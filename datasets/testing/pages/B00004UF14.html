The portrayals are humorous, the action, and even the plot as it begins to focus on an alien plot to destroy the earth. But it is all in a day's work for "The Men in Black".</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>Luckily, Earth is far from the interspace wars that rage throughout the universe; that is what makes it such an attractive place for alien refugees seeking asylum on some unnoticed planet inhabited by a simple, somewhat-intelligent, and technologically-backward species that is willing to make room for them; of course, we jumped at the chance to establish a safe haven in exchange for a few trinkets. . . .<br /><br />An enclave was established in New York City.  By treaty, the aliens had to blend in and not reveal their unearthly origin.  While a few lucky alien species could pass themselves off as human; most had to rely on organic-mechanical contrivances.<br /><br />Keeping the aliens in line was a tough policing job and keeping their presence on Earth a secret required constant vigilance, and in general, it worked, but unfortunately not all species are covered; one such, is a particularly obnoxious species: the Bugs. . . .<br /><br />One night, not long ago, an unlicensed, immature Bug crashed his flying saucer into Edgar's pickup truck.  Luckily for the Bug, Edgar stormed out of his house to see what had happened.  Unfortunately for Edgar, Bugs are indiscriminate eaters and Edgar's skin would suit it well until it could find and snatch the Arquillian's prize possession; foolishly, an Arquillian had brought it to this defenseless planet. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 4.5 to 5.  Languages and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Thai.  Additional Subtitles: Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Dutch, Indonesian, and Alien.  The "Alien" option is underwhelming.<br /><br />Special Features: possible additions, beyond those listed in older DVD reviews: a MIB trivia game and "Ask Frank the Pug" ( he is an alien, in a dog suit, who has the inside scoop).  He will answer your questions about love, money, and etc.  Be sure to talk loud; Frank is a little hard of hearing. . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>i got this one bad thing is only a 1 disk set.  where it all started.  the movie is great.  some special features cast and crew commentary are some of the features.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>There is so much positive to say about Men In Black. First of all, I haven't read much of the comic, but I'm inclined to believe that it's perfectly transferred from the pages of the 1990-97 series, to the big screen. This is what comic book movies are supposed to be. They are supposed to have great scripts, with a nice balance of tongue in cheek humor and riveting drama. I mean, they are based on publications of literature. And they wouldn't become movies, unless they were well written. How can screen writers mess up something that was already written out for them? I don't know, but they do it. Another thing that comic book movies should always have is top notch acting. I understand that all movies should have this, but comic book movies need it even more, because they are not taken seriously to start with. Obviously comic book adaptations should have well done action set pieces. Most comics are full of action, so that's a no-brainer. And finally, I think they should have great music. That's just me being me. I love film scores, so that's something I pay attention to. Too much pop music, and not enough orchestra can really turn the audience off. It can be very distracting. Men In Black has all of the above. It's very stylish, and cool.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are a match made in heaven. They are both hilarious when they want to be, but also have the range to be excellent dramatic actors. Also, they both know their way around an action set. An experienced cast makes for a great start. Plus it's a lot of fun. What good is a film of this nature if the fun is sucked out of it? The humor is very good, in my opinion. One scene in particular was so racist and stereotypical, that I couldn't stop laughing. The scene I'm referring to involves a cab driver's religious practices. I'll let those of you who haven't seen this in a while reflect on that. Anyway, MIB is actually hilarious at times. I don't think they ever missed the mark with a joke. Some weren't as laugh-out-loud hysterical as others, but they all worked nonetheless. As for performances, I mentioned Smith and Jones, but the stand out was Vincent D'Onofrio as Edgar/The Bug, or roach, or whatever he was. He was great. It takes a lot of skill to walk and talk like he did, for god knows how many hours. His hard work paid off, and he delivered to us a perfect villain. I cannot say that Director Barry Sonnenfeld has done a lot of work that I really enjoyed. This would have to be his crowning achievement, if you asked me.<br /><br />I sort of enjoyed Wild Wild West, was bitterly disappointed in Men In Black II, haven't seen Get Shorty, don't remember The Adams Family, and don't care to check out any of the television work he's done. So, I cannot give much credit to a less than credible Director. I give all of the credit to the writers, and the cast. Also, the music by Composer Danny Elfman (just about every Tim Burton and Sam Raimi film, The Simpsons, and many more brilliant scores) really accentuates the creepiness of the film, and the fun simultaneously. I loved his score. It was everything I said comic book movie scores should be, and more. In fact, that sums up how I felt about the entire project. Men In Black is everything a comic book movie should be, and more. Save for your extremely required suspension of disbelief, and the occasional cheese, this is an amazing way to spend an hour and a half.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Men In Black" is one of those very fun movies that can be watched over and over, and we just re-watched this before heading out to see the new "Men In Black 3" movie.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; The story is centers on "J" (Will Smith), NYPD detective and a newly recruited Agent to a top secret organization responsible for monitoring Aliens (as in from outer space) living on Earth. As might be expected, "J" brings a fresh attitude to the relatively stodgy establishment, including Agent "K" (Tommy Lee Jones) and the leader, Agent "Z" (Rip Torn). I liked that the pace of the movie was not overly rushed and they gave time for the characters to develop an on screen chemistry. The special effects were also quite good, considering when this movie was made.<br /><br />My whole family really enjoys this one!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>This is one of the best sci-fi movies, one of the best comedies and all round one of the most enjoyable films as far as I am concerned. The idea behind the film is clever, the dialog is crisp and witty, there is great use of film techniques, the acting is first-class and the movie doesn't waste a second. It's got more action packed into 98 minutes than you'll find in most 2 1/2 hour movies AND their sequels combined.<br /><br />Worth watching over and over again to see all the throw-away pieces of business, funny asides and topical references layered into the main body of the film. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are wonderfully well cast and Linda Fiorentino delivers her lines with such great timing and conviction that it takes a couple of viewings to realise how good at comedy she is.<br /><br />Not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>"Men in Black", featuring Will Smith both as lead actor and end credit singer, is a classic comedy. When I first watched it years ago, I laughed at almost every situation. My favourite? Smith and the other guy are going to meet an expert on intergalactic diplomacy. Everyone assumes it's the weirdo with the dog. Actually, it's...the dog! Had me fooled, too. Another old favourite is the claim that Sylvester Stallone is an alien. The tall guy from Twin Peaks makes a guest appearence (he's been on Star Trek as well).<br /><br />Since I was versed in the UFO subculture, "Men in Black" struck me as extra funny, since the secret agents don't exactly behave as MIBs are supposed to. Usually, they behave in the exact opposite way... And yes, they are more cool!<br /><br />When I watched the movie last night, I was stuck by two things. One, I wasn't laughing so much anymore. Why? No idea. Maybe I'm older, maybe I'm through with the "funny Black sidekick" angle, maybe I remember the only twist element in the plot ("The Galaxy is in Orion's belt"). Instead, I found myself analyzing the meaning of the scene where Will tries to fill in a form at MIB headquarters, together with a bunch of marines. Is there some deeper meaning hidden away in that scene? Or is just me getting Freudian?<br /><br />Two, despite this, the movie isn't bad, although I might yet draw that conclusion when I'm Tommy Lee Jones' age, waking up from a coma after 35 years. Or perhaps I'm just tired of the UFO subculture?<br /><br />Although I no longer get laughing tics out of Will's character in sunglasses, I nevertheless give "Men in Black" four stars. If you are 20+, don't miss this classic sci fi comic flic. And remember: the Galaxy is in Orion's belt!</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>Mixing smarts with hip and cultural "cool", this sci-fi action-comedy reached immediate cult status and is regarded by many as the main catalyst in Will Smith's acting career. Based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham, Barry Sonnenfeld's fun spectacle is the epitome of a "blockbuster", casting big names, using big sets, incorporating first-rate special effects, and grossing nearly $600 million in worldwide box office sales (it earned over $250M domestically).</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>Just over ten years ago I discovered what was to become one of my top ten favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time; Men In Black. Linda Florentino was hot in this, and I was amazed at how tough as nails Tommy Lee Jones could work so easily beside comedian Will Smith and both of them show how to get the job done when you're dealing with aliens from other planets. Tony Shalhoub (MONK) as Jack Jeebs is freeking hilarious and extremely well acted, Rip Torn is convincing as the agency top boss, and this may be the one and only time I will say David Cross did a great job in his role in this movie along with all of such a stellar cast throughout Men In Black. Frank the pug's, "If you don't like it you can kiss my hairy butt," is one of the most quoted lines from any movie for the last twenty-five years, and while I'm busy here telling you how much I like this movie, the sequel 'MIB II' is just as great. Get them both. If you like Sci-Fi at all, you'll love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this has to be one of will smith's and Tommy lee Jones's best movie. mib is awesome i recomend this movie for everyone</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After gaining box office and critical praise for his work in the smash hit "Independence Day", actor Will Smith was riding high as one of Hollywood's newest box office sensations. So, what does someone in that position do for a follow-up performance, perhaps something small, maybe an independent feature or something of the sort...on second thought, that wouldn't be Will Smith's style, so what did he do to follow-up his big screen success? Well, he went on to co-star alongside Tommy Lee Jones ("The Fugitive") in director Barry Sonenfeld's surprising sci-fi comedy hit "Men in Black".<br /><br />"Men in Black" is the story of a secret government organization whose job is to monitor and police extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Their agents are chosen from the best that government training has to offer, they work in secret, and most likely you'll never even know they existed. But when an NYPD detective (Will Smith) encounters an alien, he finds himself cast into the middle of an alien war that the 'MIB' are trying to prevent from spilling over onto Earth. With the help and training of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), this former cop is about to get a crash course in what it means to be the last line of defense against the worst scum of the universe.<br /><br />Now, here is a case where a movie gets released and catches everyone off guard. Upon its release there were not too many people that knew much about "Men in Black", there were some that were aware of the little-known comic book, but most just thought it looked like a funny movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith against a bunch of aliens. More than likely the film would prove to be entertaining and possibly worthy of owning later on, but nothing all that original. Boy, were we wrong or what? "Men in Black" was incredibly entertaining, from the action to the sci-fi to the hilarious comedy spread throughout, there was never a dull moment in this movie, and the box office returns and praise from both audiences and critics were proof of just how good this movie truly was.<br /><br />The performances by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were enjoyable, their banter/bickering was always fun to listen to, and still is even after multiple viewings. Linda Fiorentino ("The Last Seduction") and Vincent D'Onofrio ("Law and Order: Criminal Intent") were excellent in their supporting roles, especially Vincent who was spectacular, and even creepy as an alien hiding out in a decaying human body. A few brief appearances by Rip Torn as the head of 'MIB', Zed, provided some humorous moments, especially in the scenes with the aliens known as the 'worm guys'.<br /><br />The story for "Men in Black" was probably the most surprising aspect of the movie, it was a rather basic plot wrapped in a very original package of a government organization tracking aliens hiding among us here on Earth. It's refreshing to see a movie where the writers were able to take a plotline that has been used many times over, the aging veteran must train a new partner who in turn becomes his replacement, and place it into a story that is full of energy, action, humor, and originality making for an incredibly enjoyable movie experience that audiences will want to go through again and again.<br /><br />If you enjoy action comedies or science fiction films then here is a movie that should entertain you from start to finish. Aside from a little bit of language and a few gross scenes that may scare younger viewers, this is a movie that for the most part the entire family can sit down and enjoy, if nothing else it seems to be aired regularly on TV so you can always see the slightly edited version without the grossness and language.<br /><br />"Men in Black" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A very good comedy, Men in Black sheds light on a secret government agency that monitors alien activity.<br />Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino (who is HOT!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br />The setting, the plot, the music, the humor, and the dialogues are all wonderful!<br />Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Ten years later, and this movie is still as funny as the first day it premiered in theaters.

Tommy Lee Jones is suave as Agent "K" and, while amusing, Will Smith seems to be riffing off his Fresh Prince persona here as Agent "J".  It's obvious from subsequent solid work he's done that he learned something from the tutelage of a seasoned pro like Jones.  Vincent D'Onofrio does an amusing turn as a malevolent alien who inhabits the body of a rustic type.  My only complaint is the film does not properly utilize the extremely talented Linda Fiorentino who plays the coroner and had done some solid work in independent film.  If this is how she is underused by the mainstream film community she's better off in the independents.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>This movie is like Ghostbusters with aliens.

Coming from a comic without an iconic hero like Superman or Batman, instead it had two men in suits.  When I saw the movie I was amazed at the funny chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee.  It was almost like Alien Exterminator Odd Couple.  The Alien effects were very real but very cartoon-cool at the same time (come on Rick Baker worked on this film what do you expect.)  The movie was very funny, very thrilling, and very good.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves action and sci fi.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Loosely based from a 1990 comic book series, this 1997 blockbuster combined eye popping special effects, classic sci-fi fare, and off the wall comedy and featured Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent's J and K respectively.  Both of whom are members of the MIB: a government organized secret group who keep the knowledge of extra terrestrial life under wraps while keeping the planet at peace.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld handles the film very well and keeps it at a crowd pleasing speedy pace throughout most of it's running time.  While it does start to lose steam towards it's climax, where Men in Black shines is with the casting: featuring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub, and Vincent D'Onofrio in lively roles, with D'Onofrio being his usual scene stealing self.  This Deluxe Edition of the film seems like the umpteenth time MIB has been released on DVD; but out of all the previous editions this seems to offer the most bang for your buck.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>AFTER AN NYC COP [WILL SMITH] DISCOVERS AN ALIEN, HE JOINS A SECRET ORGANIZATION THAT MONITORS AND POLICES ALL ALIEN ACTIVITY ON EARTH.

This limited edition package is really quite nice. When you take  the wrapping off you will notice the case isn't like anything else. If  anything, its originality is similar to the Fight Club's packaging. It  opens up much like a book, which I think is really cool. As for the  contents on the DVD's themselves, Disc One contains both a fullscreen and  widescreen version of the movie, and Disc Two holds all the goodies. There  is a feature where you get to watch two scenes being broken down from the  first storyboards to the final cut. That is interesting to watch. Another  original feature is a scene editing workshop, that lets you &quot;try&quot;  and be and editor. This feature took a little while to figure out how to  use, but once I tried it out, I realized how bad I would be at editing a  movie :) Overall, this is a nice dvd to have, although it is anywhere from  $5-10 more than the regular version, so it is a bit pricey.

Most films don't, I know, but the impact is severely lessened in my opinion. The film is still great, and Will Smith does look loads better in the last suit he'll ever wear than Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />One of my favourite scenes in the whole movie is where Jay gets left in charge of delivering what can only be described as a baby squid. It's an absolutely hilarious scene, even though you're supposed to be concentrating on Kay in the foreground of the scene, you can't help but watch Jay get thrown about!<br /><br />One of the other brilliant scenes is the scene where Kay shows Jay some of the aliens on earth at the moment being watched, and Jay points out his old school teacher. Some of the more known celebrities on screen are: Danny DeVito, director Barry Sonnenfeld, Chloe Sonnenfeld (Barry's daughter), Sylvester Stallone (he's the one everyone spots), Dionne Warwick, George Lucas, and executive producer Steven Spielberg. I love all the jokes regarding the aliens on the planet, saying they're all cab drivers, and the very last scene is absolutely fantastic, and really effective.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is also funny, particularly when the car is driving upside down, and he's singing along to Elvis (Jay: "You do know Elvis is dead, right?" Kay: "No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.") The other shots you have to look for, but it's when Will Smith says something funny, and Tommy is trying to cover the fact he's trying desperately not to laugh.<br /><br />There's plenty extras on the 2-disc special edition (which means I'm probably not reviewing the correct one, as there's so many 'editions' of this movie out there), but my favourite is the "Men In Black" music video. I love the way Mickey dances. There's your usual, bog standard commentaries by Barry Sonnenfeld & Tommy Lee Jones; character animation studies; tunnel scene deconstruction; extended & alternate scenes; storyboard comparisons (I HATE these!); metamorphis of Men In Black documentary; theatrical trailers; art gallery; scene editing workshops; Edgar bug fight sceen deconstruction and creatures: concept to completion. So basically, you're getting more than your money's worth if you're interested in this sorta thing.<br /><br />This is a terrific movie, and well worth getting. I probably shouldn't say you should get the sequel as well!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I had the opportunity to watch the new collector's edition of "MIB' the other night. What a great DVD with a lot of neat extras.<br /><br />Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner Dee (Richard Hamilton) are two of the Men In Black, an elite force of men in a secret institution that are charged with "Protecting the Earth From The Scum of The Universe". Dee is unable to stop an alien from attacking, requiring Kay to blow it to bits. Dee wants out of the business. Kay needs to find a new partner. James Darrel Edwards III (Will Smith), a NYPD detective, is the best candidate. Kay sees something in him. Zed (Rip Torn), the director of the division, agrees to let Kay recruit Jay (Smith), despite his misgivings. Almost immediately, the Earth is threatened by an alien force that wants to prevent another galaxy from falling into the hands of Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), a hick farmer that has been killed by an alien. The alien, a roach like creature is using Edgar's skin as a disguise. Edgar is searching for the galaxy. The Men In Black must stop him, or the other alien race will destroy the Earth.<br /><br />"Men In Black" is a quintessential summer film, a film that works in so many ways. Released in July, 1997, the film cemented Will Smith's stardom. Smith is very good. He plays Jay in a somewhat somber way, cracking jokes, but in a more refined manner than we had seen him do to this point. He is actually trying for a character here and he succeeds. Tommy Lee Jones is just perfect as his partner, the aging, wiser mentor of the couple. Jones has many funny moments, allowing his dead pan persona to help define his character.<br /><br />The film is also aided immeasurably by it's brevity. So many films like this run in excess of two hours because they spend so much time establishing the characters and then telling a story. "MIB" does all of this in 98 minutes, moving along at a brisk pace, keeping us occupied and interested.<br /><br />Two of my favorite scenes both showcase Tommy Lee Jones. The first is the tunnel sequence. The Ford LTD that Jones drives zooms through the Holland tunnel aws Jones sings along to Elvis Presley. The catch? The car is riding on the roof, Jones is singing along merrily as Smith is frantically trying to get seated. The second is a scene in which Jones interrogates an alien that has disguised himself as a little dog. Jones is shaking the dog, trying to get information out of the alien. Very funny. Smith is also very good, perhaps best in the audition sequence. His character is participating reluctantly in the audition, trying to fill out a test with a pencil that breaks, no where to write. Very funny.<br /><br />The DVD presents a great print of the film, very clear and crisp, available in widescreen (yeah!) and pan and scan (boo!). It was a joy to watch the film again, so quickly transported into the world that director Barry Sonnenfeld creates along with the writer, Ed Solomon.<br /><br />The 2 DVD set has a second DVD with a lot of extras, perhaps the most interesting of which is a 'scene editing workshop'. I only had time to try one of the three options. This option presented three different takes of three different parts of the scene. You can preview each take, select one and then move on to the next segment. After you have selected one scene for each bit, you can play them back as you have edited them. Then you can compare them to the film.<br /><br />The second neatest feature is the 'special effects deconstruction'. Two segments are presented and you are allowed to view five different aspects of it, switching back and forth as you watch it. The first aspect is the original storyboards, then a blue screen strip, followed by a composite and so on. This allows the viewer to watch, in an abbreviated fashion, the process of creating these sequences. A lot of fun and a lot of information.<br /><br />There are also a lot of production photos, including a large segment of photos taken at ILM as some sequences were created.<br /><br />There are also the requisite trailers, talent files and commentaries.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is a teaser trailer for "MIBII", which doesn't reveal anything at all for the simple fact that they can't. The film has been delayed due to budget constraints and other problems.<br /><br />A great DVD. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Barry Sonnenfeld's Sci Fi comedy blockbuster starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the most purely entertaining films of the 90s. The premise, taken from the DC comics is simple, yet an excellent choice considering the talent behind the project and the possibility (now reality) of a new and exciting franchise.<br />With the superb comic duo of Smith and Jones (As agents K and J respectively) and an inventive take on Sci Fi cliches, added with well-played wit and charm, it's effortless coolness is just right. Jones' dry persona in the film, combined with Smith's jibes, is one of the best buddy parings since Newman and Redford. The supporting cast including Rip Torn as head honcho "Z" and Linda Florentino are great, and extra kudos for Vincet D'Onfrio as the bug in the "edgar suit".<br />Danny Elfman's Batman-esche score adds a nice layer of comic adventure. And extra kudos for FX maestro Rick Baker's award-winning alien creations. All of the seamless combinations of ILM and practical effects are literally out-of-this-world. The audacious concept that aliens are living among us (disguised as humans) provides for some humerous moments, including an alien observer screen that shows that MIB-producer Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone (among others) are extra-terrestrials. Ok, so it's somewhat of a re-tread of GHOSTBUSTERS in some caveats, and it dosn't even pretend to have depth. But hey, the universal question pervades: Who cares? With comedy this good, it's minor flaws can be ignored. Building on it's endless comic potential to a satisfying showdown, MIB will no doubt linger long in anyone's memory, regardless of if you've been nuetralised.<p>But for cryin' out loud! Yet another re-re-release of the MEN IN BLACK DVD. However for all the jaded people who, knowledged by the usual re-release pattern so common in many DVDs (MATRIX, LORD OF THE RINGS et all) decided to wait for a better edition of MIB, then here's the best one to get. With enough extras to satisfy fans, this "Deluxe Edition" has it all. A 2 Disc set, the extras include a Commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld, Rick Baker and the team at ILM, a featurette and trailer from Men In Black 2 a scene editing workshop, Creatures: Concept to Creation, Music video, Storyboard comparisons, Conceptual art gallery, Multi-angle scene deconstructions, Original featurette, Character animation studies, Extended and alternate scenes and trailers (Phew!). The picture and sound quality are top-notch too. Very impressive stuff, and one of the many reasons you junked your VHS collection yonks ago. And altogether, a 5-star DVD. But then, in a couple of months, a DVD 2 Pack of MIB and MIB 2 might pop up...</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. There had to of been a couple of raised eyebrows when people first heard of this big screen pairing. What will these two be like together?. Some might've thought it was a recipe for disaster. On the contrary. Jones and Smith clicked. They just melted together like butter. Sure the effects and make-up and all that was fun and well done, but it's the on screen chemistry of this new duo that makes this film the fun it is. Director Barry Sonnenfeld(The Addams Family movies, Get Shorty, Big Trouble)directs this highly entertaining summer movie that is one heck of a pleasing journey. Will Smith plays a rookie cop who is recruited by the MIB to work opposite Agent K(Jones)to keep track of aliens on earth. Their main adversary here is an alien who has inhabited the body of a farmer, played hysterically by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio is quite incredible as the human taken over by the alien. The skin doesn't fit right and he is rapidly decaying. Gross and funny. Rip Torn is on hand as the leader of the MIB group. Linda Fiorentino shows up as well as Dr. Laurel Weaver. Another familiar face here is Tony Shalhoub("Wings", "Thirteen Ghosts", "Big Night")as an alien passing as a human. Smith and Jones know better. The make-up is very good. The effects are satisfying. The movie moves along at a nice rate where there isn't much time for the film to slag, or the audience to wander off. It's brisk and enjoyable. This is a film that could almost of been directed by Tim Burton. Burton's longtime composer, and musical genius, Danny Elfman, composed the movie with the great kind of score we come to expect from him. Again, this movie really lies in the hands of Jones and Smith. They deliver some great comic moments. It just comes across as very natural. It's nice to see the notoriously serious Tommy Lee do something funny. "Men In Black II" looks like it will uphold the tradition of this first film too. I hope it can keep the same kind of fun/cool of this one. That's what this movie and others like it are for. They are not here to be overly analyzed and taken seriously. Look at some of the more harsher reviews and you'll know what I mean. You have to go to a summery like popcorn movie and know that you are seeing a summery popcorn movie. It can be a good, intelligent, well done movie without having some Oscar-worthy plot. You gotta know that going in. Anyways, this is a fun treat for anyone who likes fun entertainment. Who doesn't?.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>actually somewhat thinkers twice buy blu-ray edition of the MIB is considering the release of version 2 does not exist bluraynya.

"Men in Black" is about as realistic as winning the lottery every day for a week.  On the good side, its violence is not to be taken seriously, and it probably is a great family show for those with 6-10 year-old children.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Just as much fun today as it was the very first time, if not more so. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliantly cast as the stern, no nonsense G-Man straight out of the 1950s, a role he was seemingly born to play, and while new recruit Will Smith was badly typecast at the time, there's a very real, palpable chemistry between the two that transcends what roles they may have played before or after. Further complimenting the scene is a dynamite supporting cast, with Rip Torn amplifying all things stoic and ancient about the government, Vincent D'Onofrio stealing every scene as a not-so-subtle wolf in sheep's clothing and a typically dry, sarcastic performance from Linda Fiorentino. The jokes are still funny, even though I remembered most of the punchlines, the adventure is a perfect blend of introduction and elaboration, and the pop culture asides still work fifteen years later. Even the special effects aren't aging badly, which is a rare blessing considering the rapid advances in CGI since it was in theaters. Enthusiastically funny, rambunctiously fast-paced and occasionally genuine, I was surprised to see it's still firing on all cylinders.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>"Men In Black" (MIB) is now available in the superior Blu-Ray format,and it looks and sounds awesome!!!Also includes lots of great extras that are out of this world!!! An awesome Blu-Ray title,hands down!!! A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>So much has been written about the brilliance of this gooey sci/fi comedy, that it would be redundant for me to tell you how great it is. But what I enjoyed most about &quot;Men In Black&quot; is that it is such a New York film. <p>When Will Smith is being oriented to his new job by Tommy Lee Jones, he's informed that many New Yorkers are disguised space aliens. &quot;Like cab drivers?&quot; Smith asks. &quot;Not as many as you think,&quot; Jones responds.<p>The fact that the MIB have a car that can defy gravity is funny enough, but the fact that it needs such a vehicle to fight the perpetual traffic in the Midtown Tunnel is even funnier.<p>An alien disguised as a dog in an I LOVE NEW YORK tee-shirt is fairly funny. But when it speaks with a New Yawk accent as thick as Bugs Bunny's it makes it funnier.<p>When the edgar bug alien hauls a mideastern cab driver out of his cab, not funny. When he tosses his wooden-bead back massager at him, funny. But on top of that, when he throws the ubiquitous air freshner out, then its hysterical (without being racist).<p>The whole concept that the World's Fairgrounds in Queens is a hangar for spaceships is just brilliant. And I've always wondered what that structure at the head of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was!<p>Glimpses of the World Trade Center are a little bitter to take, even now. And there is that sense that this film is from an innocent pre 9/11 time but, really, the rest of the movie still rings true of the New York of today.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>&quot;Men In Black&quot; proceeds from the familiar premise that humans are one of many intelligent species in the universe, but adds a coy corollary: we ain't that bright a species.<p>Nevertheless, in the universe of &quot;Men In Black&quot;, Earth is a kind of DMZ for aliens looking for a trouble free existence, and the job of the Men In Black is to keep it trouble free. Tommy Lee Jones's character, Agent K, likens it to the exile world of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it's a apt comparison. But the worst problem facing the poor exiles of &quot;Casablanca&quot; was Louis Renault's arbitrary gendarme; certainly, giant intergalactic bugs that suck the guts out of humans and wear their skins as a disguise never made an appearance at Rick's Cafe Americain.<p>And where is this sci-fi &quot;Casablanca&quot;? New York, of course.<p>&quot;Men In Black&quot; veers wildly from sly comedy to slapstick and fairly standard sci-fi action. There are the requisite sci-fi trappings, like ray guns, flying saucers, a fancy high-tech headquarters, and cool gadgets. But &quot;Men In Black&quot; takes these kinds of sci-fi conventions and turns them on their ear; Agent J (Will Smith) is issued his ray gun sidearm, it's a tiny affair called the &quot;Noisy Cricket&quot;. But as it turns out, the Noisy Cricket is roughly as powerful as a rocket launcher. The Men In Black's requisite high tech headquarters doubles as a kind of intergalactic customs office where aliens man the communications console AND the coffee maker, and like to smoke Marlboros. <p>This sort of &quot;anything goes&quot; tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, at least for its first half. Agent K even instructs J in the fine art of finding aliens. Does he use some kind of super-advanced technology to do it? Nope. He reads the National Enquirer.<p>Jones is all seriousness as Agent K, a man who's literally been there and done that, and listened to Elvis while it was happening; Smith is at his streetwise best as K's partner J, who has an affinity for chasing down aliens and smack talking 50-foot-high giant bugs that have 70 million children (as the bug stares J down, he crushes a cockroach and asks 'Was that your auntie?').<p>I won't even begin to describe the over-the-top plot, but suffice it to say that the film's villain (Vincent D'Onofrio) is an intergalactic bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and isn't real fond of humans, especially ones that hurt bugs. <p>That kind of irreverent, 'anything goes' tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, but unfortunately, the movie bogs down when it goes for standard summer action fare about halfway through. It's also a shame that director Barry Sonnenfeld couldn't find more for the excellent Linda Fiorentino to do in this film.<p>Still, even when &quot;Men In Black&quot; resorts to standard action-flick conventions (the street chase, for example), the tongue-in-cheek attitude remains, and that's the film's biggest strength.<p>It bears noting that the DVD has any number of excellent features that make it a nice buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>A hilarous and campy film that hits the spot on orginality.  Will Smith continues his comedic acting as the young hotshot rookie. And Tommy Lee Jones does a great job as the overbearing yet lovable experience "MIB" character.  Both actors bring life and vitality to the movie and characters they play.  A film that brings a great sense of comedic punch lines and humorous slapstick.  A great for the whole family to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is another one I don't know why I avoided it for so long. I think I may have mixed it up with the Blues Brothers, if that was the name: the one done by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Anyway, this is a very good movie. Just a little too silly on the science fiction part to qualify for five stars, but great fun.<br /><br />K (Tommy Lee Jones) works for "Division 6," he tells some border guards as he manages to select out one of a load of illegal aliens that really is an illegal alien. As in from outer space. But he tells different things to different people, and one of the border guards is certain that there is no Division 6.<br /><br />Due to his amazing performance, K recruits James Edwards of the NYPD (Will Smith), who then becomes J. The only other name you might recognize is Zed, played by Rip Torn. He was quite the heart throb when he was young, but that was a long, long time ago.<br /><br />Since their job is to keep track of all the aliens on the planet, most of whom are refugees and live peacefully disguised, there are lots of opportunities for great sight gags, like when J helps in the birth of a baby alien who really is cute. It's a pretty harrowing experience, but mother, baby and J all come through it OK.<br /><br />Central to the function of the MiB unit is a device like a penlight flashlight that wipes the memories of those involved in encounters. Keep your eye on that "light thingie," as it turns out to be pretty important all around.<br /><br />It's a very, very funny movie, but also real adventure.<br /><br />Also keep your eye on the cat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I remember I must've watched Men in Black at least 4 times during its theatrical run. I just really really liked it, then of course there's the VHS release now the DVD release. I don't know what it was that drew me in so quickly. I think it's a rare movie that manages to be on both spectrums, that of being silly and outrageous while being serious and straight-faced. And unlike Independence Day, this one's actually funny, better paced and just all around better.<br /><br />Aliens exist in the world with most of them looking very much like regular people. However, like people, some of them stray and try to stir some stuff up so in come the Men in Black, a secret organization that keeps aliens secret from everyone else. When one alien decides to cause some stuff that could spell doom for everyone on Earth(of course), it's up to Kay and new partner Jay to save the world.<br /><br />When the disappointing sequel came out a couple of years ago, Sony decided to re-release the film in a "Deluxe Edition". The extras are pretty much the same except for some previews for MiB II. So it's pretty much just buy this if you haven't got the old one but if you haven't, might as well get this one. The featurettes are ok but the commentary was slightly annoying. Presented in a quasi-MST3000/football match style, on occasion the director and Tommy Lee Jones almost act like guys who haven't seen movies ever with stuff like "and there's you saying that line" and whatnot.<br /><br />What ultimately makes the film succeed is a couple character moments throughout. Kay's backstory is explained involving a woman that helps the film become more than just a simple flashy blockbuster. Not to mention the film can still entertain with funny lines or just physical comedy. There's no weak link in the cast and the effects still hold up after all these years.<br /><br />Should you buy it? Definately. It's funny, exciting and it's perfectly paced. Just don't watch the sequel...eek.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>If there was ever a movie to blow the doors off of alien conspiracies in a hilarious way this is it. For no other reason than that, Men in Black is a well-deserved hit. Combine that classic sci-fi charm with a smart combination of different special effects techniques and the chemistry of actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith and you have a recipe for fun.<br /><br />Probably the most intriguing element of Men in Black for me is its classic sci-fi charm. The urban legends of the men in black surfaced around the 50's and this movie seems to tip its hat at that prospect. The aliens and gadgets all have that classic 50's sci-fi B-movie aspect in regards to their looks and names. The B-movie aspect is all the funnier when Tommy Lee and the gang interact with this strangeness as if it were an everyday thing. In addition to the classic sci-fi fun you also see some fun with the whole government conspiracy to hide the truth. I'm telling you it's great fun seeing MIB agents with their deadpan looks handle completely outrageous situations.<br /><br />This movie oozes style. Not only with the sci-fi space guns and tech but also the look of the MIB headquarters. It's another throwback to the 50's with some major art deco designs and black and white color schemes. It's like looking into one of those freaky classic movies. Special effects can be a mixed bag, but still fun to watch. You get some really good animatronic effects with a few aliens as well as computer animation, but I tend to give more kudos to the animatronic side of things here. While the CG stuff looks good at a distance it starts to lack on closer shots with that very noticeable shine you get from making a too glossy surface.<br /><br />Another plus on style is the Jones/Smith interaction. It's a lot like a buddy cop film where the two partners are very different from each other. Tommy Lee's straight and serious Agent Friday style of professionalism is perfectly juxtaposed by Will's irreverent wisecracking style. My favorite performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio, who made an enormously entertaining performance as the bug in an Edgar suit. I don't think you could have gotten a better cast.<br /><br />While Men in Black is a definite plus it does have a few limitations. For one the pacing of the movie feels rushed in a certain way, although it's hard to put my finger on. I suppose Will's indoctrination into MIB worked well, but after he became an agent, things moved more mechanically than dynamically. Might be more of a time constraint issue than anything else. Also this movie is slimy. You will find lots of gooey and icky stuff splattering all over the place. Some of you might get into it. I just feel like I need a shower.<br /><br />Men in Black is ultimately light entertainment that pokes fun at the genre while at the same time being true to it. The only people I can't recommend this movie to are the ones who are looking for a whole lot of depth in the story, or can't get around the slimy stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Aww Will Smith at his best. That's what he is in Men in Black with his character J. This movie was a huge bright spot in the summer of 97 and is one of the best sci fi comedies ever made.<br /><br />James Edwards(Smith) works for the NYPD. He's a good cop despite what his peers say. After a chase with a criminal he meets a stranger Kay(Jones) who tells him to meet him. Edwards goes to the meeting at the strange building to find that it is a recruitment meeting.<br /><br />Kay gives James a proposition. Join the Men in Black and help them control the aliens on earth. James is skeptical about it, but in the end he joins. In the meantime an illegal alien has come to America. It's an oversized coachroach who is killing some princes looking for the galaxy. Now it's up to the Men in Black to kill the roach before the Princes family destroys planet earth.<br /><br />You have to love the two stars in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. The two are a great duo on screen. Their timing with each other is awesome and you can tell the two enjoyed working with each other. Smith plays the normal character we've come to see him play, but he plays that role so well and we love it. Jones is great as well and he plays Kay like only he could.<br /><br />The special effects are great in this movie. The team at ILM did a great job with all the space and bug stuff. Lots of credit has to go to Barry Sonnefeld for doing a great job.<br /><br />There isn't anything to not like about this movie. It's funny and the action is good. If you like Will Smith then you have to see this. If you want a good sci-fi comedy then strap in. Here come the Men in Black.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Campy yet clever, Men in Black is just a whale of an entertaining movie, sporting all kinds of great action, some surprisingly good dialogue, fine acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and a small galaxy full of laughs.  It is actually a little surprising to me that it took so long for Hollywood to make a movie spoofing the infamous Men in Black, mysterious entities who reportedly intervene on occasion in the lives of those having just made significant UFO or alien sightings.  The only thing that should stop anyone from enjoying this movie is a chronic inability to suspend one's disbelief and just sit back and enjoy something meant as pure entertainment and nothing else.<p>The plot isn't that complicated.  Aliens of all sorts have been around for ages on earth, and the public is kept ignorant of their existence because, as Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) says, a person may be smart but people are dumb and would panic if their self-absorbed fantasy reality were to be pulled out from under their feet.  One organization, the Men in Black, makes sure that earthlings are kept in the dark and that visiting aliens are kept in check.  Will Smith plays a New York City cop who unknowingly impresses a top MIB agent by chasing down a disguised cephalopod on foot.  The future Agent J (Smith) is not your typical MIB recruit, espousing some disregard for authority, making light of all kinds of situations, and generally just making everything he says and does hilarious.  He shows up for an "entrance test" even after having his memory of a most mind-expanding night's events "flashing-thingied" out of his head, but he doesn't really buy the whole concept of aliens until he sees some little extraterrestrial Cheech and Chong-type fellows inside MIB headquarters.  His first two days on the job are, to say the least, eventful.  A big bad alien bug has landed illegally in upstate New York with designs on stealing a galaxy belonging to a visiting royal family member from another planet, and the fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the offended alien race demands their galaxy be returned to them.  <p>One thing I really like about Men in Black is the fact that some of the funniest bits happen outside the main focus of the shot - nothing tops the scene in which, in the background, we watch Agent J attempt to help deliver a non-human baby.  I also got a kick out of seeing executive producer Steven Spielberg subtly identified as an alien.  A number of easy-to-miss references of this type are imbedded in the film, making multiple viewings interesting as well as entertaining. <p>There are plenty of special effects throughout the movie.  The aliens are all done quite nicely (and there is enough exploding bug goo to satisfy just about anyone), while a few of the Batman-type effects have a campy look and feel to them; I actually think campy was the way to go because this movie was not made to be taken too seriously.  The dialogue is actually quite good, I think, including some witty pop culture references, and Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan delivery is the perfect counterpoint to the infectious humor of Will Smith.  Smith has played this type of character before, and no one does it better.  The man is just funny, and it is his performance that made this summertime release such a successful, quintessential summer blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/A34XPZS5DXA6HA.html">A34XPZS5DXA6HA</a><br/><p>This was a great movie.  The pairing of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith showed unbelievable ability on the part of the casting directors as the two work very well together.  This movie also shows that a great effort was made in the costume department.<p>There is comedy around every turn that L (Jones) and K (Smith) make as they chase aliens and earase memories.  Be prepared for a laugh as you will not be dissapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The classic government conspiracy surrounding the UFO and alien phenomenon comes out at last with explosive and literally gooey force.  It's a film that takes almost every aspect of the government conspiracy theory (the black-suited men, the aliens, the spaceships, and power-freak teachers) and puts it in a funny and exciting reference.<p>The film's story line is relatively simple and small-scale, but still leaves much room for thrills, suspense, humor, and imagination.  At the same time, it allows characters sufficient room to develop.  The actors of the film did a swell job in this film, and are topped only by the film's special effects.<p>Combined with a great theme song and musical score, this film is most enjoyable.  The special features in this disc set makes the movie even more worth it.  It's a deluxe deal!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Excellent story, casting, director, and music. Quite honestly one of the best SciFi movies in recent years. Original story adds to the fun. Most people knew that the Air Force conducted investigation Blue Book and sent around men in black suits to ask questions about UFOs. Now we see what is a movie poking fun at what that could have led to. Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Rip Torn are a great combo in this bug hunting techno comedy. Has a good deal of replayability so it is well worth having on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>One thing I hate is when studios put out multiple versions of the same movie and each package contains different features. New Line Cinema is doing this with Lord of the Rings. The same was done with Men in Black. Thankfully, with MIB most of the special features that were on the single disk version were included on the dual disk version, so I don't think I missed anything. However yet another version of this DVD is in the works. I'll be sticking with what I've already bought.<br /> The movie itself is your typical summer blockbuster. It may not set new standards in story telling, but it is certainly a lot of fun with some good looking CGI special effects, something that's becoming a rarity these days. The acting in the movie is probably the most fun, especially the villain of the movie, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great. The movie may be lacking in depth, but it is supposed to be an action comedy. So this is excusable. This film is worth the purchase, and the load of special features are more than enough to keep fans of the summer blockbuster genre busy for hours on end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>There's a hidden secret government agency known as "MIB" or "Men in Black" for short, their mission is to keep all aliens from space under wraps from the public as far as possible and to protect humanity from the scum of the universe. MIB Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has been assigned by leader Zed (Rip Torn) to find a police officer named J (Will Smith) who witnesses something unusual that could lead him to become a member of the MIB, unfornuately when a hideous bug monster disguises itself as a human farmer (Vincient D'Onofrio) who plans big plans for Earth but it's up to the MIB to solve a case and try to stop the alien menace.<br /><br />Co-starring Linda fiorentino, this is a stylish and exciting Sci-fi comedy based on a cult short-lived Malibu comic book of the same name. Barry Sonnefeld ("The Addams Family") directed this movie quite well and the acting is solid especially the smart humor that incorporated this movie, it's a satire on what if aliens were really among us yet they want to be kept under wraps among the humans. The film even offers brilliant make-up and special effects by Industrial Light and Magic and Rick Baker giving us realistic alien critters that no one has seen before on film and there's plenty of great fun in this movie that made it a pure big blockbuster among audiences and critics alike.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers nice quality pic and sound even for HD lovers with great extras like audio visual commentary, Trailer and Teaser, featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, Storyboard comparisions, Documentary, music video, galleries, interactive games, scene editing workshop, and BD-live.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>&quot;Men in Black&quot;. When you first look at the cover of it and even hear the title, you would think that it would be a very scary and very violent movie. Well, anyway, that's what I thought. Until I finally watched it. And to tell you the truth, it wasn't as bad as I thought at all! Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great as 'the men in black', agents who watch over the population of aliens on the planet earth. This is a very funny movie with lots of great action scenes, too. Language might be a bit strong for younger kids but I'm sure teenagers and adults will love this movie as much as I did!</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>A very good set of DVD's. I would have preferred a double-sided DVD instead of two. The audio commentary was okay, but I've heard better. I liked the Mystery Theater 3000 way they set up the audio commentary, where you can see an outline of the director and Jones as they point at the screen. They also have a graphic where they can write on the film much like Monday Night Football. The bonus features had some very interesting items that I never seen on any other DVD. Interactive items where you can re-edit 3 different scenes and another where you can breakdown the special effects to their various components, very unique and interesting. Another feature where the aliens morph from initial concept to final look was also very interesting. There were no deleted scenes although the director talks about some scenes that were changed to modify the plot. Some storyboards from never shot scenes are also included.

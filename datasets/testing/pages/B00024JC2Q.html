In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.<br /><br />The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.<br /><br />The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal. Those who liked the Starsky and Hutch television series or who are fans of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will probably enjoy this goofy, spoofy, sophomoric little film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>One, two, three, four, now we've got disco war!  This flick is a ton of fun.  What an ensemble.  Owen Wilson is hilarious as a corrupt but somehow decent cop.  He has some great lines like...let's float this dead body down to another precinct. Vince Vaughn has to be one of the most entertaining actors out there as it's impossible to take your eyes of him.  Snoop is perfect for his role as he knows some people who know some people who steal. Will Ferrell plays a pervert extremely well, which isn't a big shock, and the whole thing has a real upbeat vibe.  It's happy entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>I was too young to see "Starsky & Hutch" when it was originally on TV, and I have never seen in syndication on network or cable TV.  Prior to the full feature motion picture coming out, I had come across only two passing references to this show (other than having the knowledge that it had existed at one time).  The first was when the main character in the 80's kids film "Flight of Navigator" asked if this show was still on TV because it was his favorite.  The other reference came while watching British comedian, Benny Hill's "One Night Video Stand" when he did a hilarious send-up of "Starsky & Hutch" and the spate of atrocious 70's television production values.  So, what is there to entice someone like me to see this film?  The answers are obvious:  The opportunity to see the modern-day odd couple of Ben Stiller (Starsky) and Owen Wilson (Hutch) expertly ply their comedic trade as the title characters and to see Snoop Dogg in his first feature length mainstream role as ubiquitous Huggy Bear.<br /><br />There are few actors more laid back than Owen Wilson, and there are few actors more neurotic and `tick-ish' than Ben Stiller, which makes their castings a stroke of inspiration.  Stiller's Starsky is an anal, by the books martinet, while Wilson's Hutch is a laid back `dude' with more than a few shady shenanigans going on behind the scenes.  So, naturally, events will conspire to force Starsky & Hutch to partner up to fight Bay City's latest bad guy, sleazy drug dealer Reese Feldman (played with the sleaziness expert, Vince Vaughn).  It seems Feldman likes to deal in cocaine and now seems to have come up with a variety that is undetectable to police dogs, making it truly a hot commodity.  Acting on a tip for `information broker' (don't dare call him a snitch) Huggy Bear, the boys begin an investigation to stop Feldman in his tracks.  Of course, this being a comedy, instead of serious remake of the original show, all hell breaks loose and Starsky & Hutch more than have their hands full trying to stop Feldman.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is, "Starsky & Hutch" should be funnier than it actually is.  It is full of hilarious moments, but those moments never seem to create moment that make the film an overall laugh riot.  It's possible that the ease at which Wilson and Stiller fit into their roles is more of a detriment because it seems like they aren't trying very hard (when the likely just make it look that way).  The plot, when stripped down, reveals itself to be paper-thin, as well.  On the other hand, it's those numerous hilarious moments that do rescue this film.  Will Ferrell makes an amusing cameo and a prisoner who will offer key information for a few `special favors' from the guys.  Snoop's brief scenes are eminently watchable (such as the golf course scene) and show that this guy has a future in film other than directing "Girls Gone Wild" videos.  Then there is always the manic Ben Stiller who has far too many scenes to count where he simply flips and leaves the audience in stitches.<br /><br />On the whole, "Starsky & Hutch" is not likely to occupy your thoughts beyond five minutes past the closing credits.  Yet, it makes for a fun 100 minutes and is a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  After all, that's what this type of movie is meant for.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I just saw this hilarious movie. I knew it was going to be good when i heard the song can't smile without you playing during the opening credits. I was taken by the way this film had enjoyable comedy.

Probably not, but the result is a really funny movie.  Taking the "Brady Bunch" approach, and placing their tongues firmly in cheek, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson assume the roles made popular on the small screen so many years ago.  Ben Stiller is the somewhat anal Starsky and Owen Wilson is the laid back Hutch.  And while there is a plot somewhere in there, the movie's focus is the relationship between the two.  After being teamed together, they are out to bust a drug dealer, played by Vince Vaughn, who has developed cocain that cannot be detected by narcotics dogs.  The plot allows them to go undercover, get some girls, and have some action scenes.  I firmly believe that there will be a sequel to this, especially if the film does well (which I think it will).  Stiller and Wilson have a comroderie that has worked well in previous movies, and is even more evident here.

Ben Stiller is Starsky and Owen Wilson is Hutch, our main characters, who are forced to partner up with each other by their captain. Their first case is going after a drug dealer, Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn. Snoop Dogg is Huggy Bear, their street informant, helps them on the case. The performances by the cast, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Snoop Dogg, are extremely funny and well acted. The story is brilliant and is as funny as Stiller, Wilson, Dogg are. The directing by Todd Phillips is brilliant. The story by Stevie Long and John O' Brien, as is the screenplay by John O' Brien, Todd Phillips, and Scot Armstrong. The music by Theodore Shapiro is excellent. The cinematography by Barry Peterson is excellent. The film editing by Leslie Jones is excellent. The casting by Juel Bestrop and Jeanne McCarthy is excellent. The production design by Ed Verreaux and costume design by Louise Mingenbach is brilliant. This movie is without a doubt, funny.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>For those of you who had a love affair with the original Starsky & Hutch detective series from the 70's you will find this movie quite entertaining.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is nearly perfect as the serious Starsky, he even takes on many of the mannerisms and scowls that the original character embodied. Stiller makes this film with his dry humor. Playing opposite Stiller is Owen Wilson who creates a new Hutch. Wilson is quirky and somehow sexy in a very funny way. These two actors make a brand new comedy team and you won't be disappointed in this film if you enjoy the way they tag team off one another for a laugh. Of course Snoop Dog does a great job as Huggy Bear too and the red and white Grand Terino takes on the original car with a few new tricks!<br /><br />This movie is a great laugh and an evening of nostalgia for people who grew up watching the original series. Many scenes are re-created almost to a perfect tee! The 70's clothing deserves a shout out as well! The only negative aspect I found was in the dimwitted women, like Carmen Electra, who dance across the screen every now and then without much meaning. Otherwise this movie is a comedy gem and worth watching more than once. Look for the cameos of the original Starsky and Hutch and try not to feel too old!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I can't believe anyone liked this movie.  It was boring.  It wasn't funny at all.  It was everything bad that I don't feel like typing.<br /><br />The only good part was a scene near the end where the car... I won't spoil it.  It's not like I have a problem with the actors.  I just had a problem with the lack of an interesting plot and the absense of humor.  What was passed off as humor did nothing for me.  Hey, maybe it's me.  I have the problem, I guess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Having never seen the original Starsky and Hutch shows I was absolutely clueless on how these two men worked in their relationship. Starsky played by Owen Wilson is definatly in a turnaround in this role, as he usually plays the rather clueless and brainless man of the hour. Point in case I Spy and the shangia noon/knight series.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is as always Ben Stiller, no more, no less. The movie is a crackup, there is just no two ways about it. Snoop Dogg is an interesting character, although I was a bit on the clueless side about his role. It think they needed to explain what he was just a little bit better. fashion statement or detective. Or both. I'm not sure.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the film is where Starsky and Hutch break into the enemy's territory by playing Mime's. Wherewith the mimeless Starsky tells the crowd that he'll do the climbing wall motion one more time. Watch it, you'll see what I mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IKOYZVFHO1XP.html">A1IKOYZVFHO1XP</a><br/><p>Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson delighted audiences in early 2004 with a theatrical version of the television classic that starred Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Great supporting performance by Snoop Dogg. These guys are going after the bad boys and scoring with the hot girls. Awesome film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I wasn't a huge fan of this movie when I saw it at the movie theater, but I did like it enough (or so I thought) to buy it.  Yet, now that I own it and I watched it again I just didn't find it as funny.  I love Ben Stiller he is one of my favorite actors (Zoolander, Doodgeball, Duplex, etc.)  And even though everyone in the movie gives a great performance it is just not up to par with other movies each one of them have done in the past.  I get in the mood every so often to watch this movie...luckily I didn't spend too much money on this movie...so I feel I am okay if I watch it a few times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>This irreverent homage the second rate 70's television show of the same name can't decide whether it wants to be a screw ball, tasteless comedy, or just a trip down memory lane. There are three good laughs in this movie - the rest of it is just terrible. Ben Stiller is a terrifically talented comedic actor, but he must indeed be desperate if this is all he's being offered. The lackluster story involving cocaine dealers merely serves as an excuse to team Starsky (Stiller), the neurotic, by-the-book cop, with Hutch (Owen Wilson), the laid-back, somewhat bent, cool dude.<br /><br />The story revolves around a drug dealer (Vince Vaughn), who has remarkably come up with a new type of cocaine that tastes like artificial sweetener, and that is immune from sniffer dogs.  Juliette Lewis plays his ditzy, junky girlfriend who is helping him sell the drugs to a local crime syndicate.  However, Starsky and Hutch, with the help of a local black gangster, Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg), are hot on the trail of the syndicate. As the film progresses, both cops are shot at, and ridiculed by their fellow officers for being prissy and not being up to the task of hunting down the criminals.<br /><br />The story is really a vehicle for presenting a number of site gags (some of which work and some don't), and for highlighting the dreadful hairstyles, clothes, and disco dancing of the period. One of the funniest scenes is when Starsky - thinking that the cocaine is actually sweetener - accidentally consumes it in his coffee, and goes out on a mad, competitive disco dancing spree. Although, amusing, the scene may as well be from another movie, as it bares no relevance to the actual story. There's a fun scene featuring Will Ferrell as a perverted convict with a thing for belly buttons - he makes the uncomfortable Hutch bare his, and then makes both Starsky and Hutch act out some bizarre dragon scene while shirtless. Carmen Electra also provides some laughs and does a good job of playing a cheerleader who gets off on undressing in front of the cops. Most of the humour, however, falls pretty flat and eventually becomes overly self-conscious. The whole film runs out of steam towards then end and fast becomes sour and quite stupid.

Stiller, one of the most talented comic actors of his age, here goes for shallow caricature rather than developing a true shallow character.  Where it worked for him in Zoolander it fails here.  In fact it's as though Stiller decided to ape Zoolander playing Starsky.  An interesting premise perhaps, but its execution falls fairly flat.<br /><br />Owen Wilson doesn't give much more, and doesn't fare much better.<br /><br />The duo are not without some funny moments, but overall there were long stretches of nothing padding out the comic bits.<br /><br />The film is worth watching primarily for the performances of Vince Vaughan and Snoop Dog's Huggy Bear - both breathing life into an otherwise fairly stagnant vehicle.<br /><br />Also worthwhile is Juliette Lewis in an inflated cameo is wonderful, and more than any other cast member, embodies the sexual innocence gone haywire that seemed to fuel the 70's.<br /><br />Hard to believe Chris Penn in the role he has here.  Completely unrecognizable.<br /><br />Even harder to believe is that this was directed by Todd Phillips, the director who gave us the unflinching, hard hitting documentary "Hated" about the twisted, revolting life of punk anti-hero G.G. Allin. Phillips would go on to impress in the comedies Old School and Road Trip.  Faced here with a period piece he relies too heavily on site gags (oversized portable phones, radios, etc.) which cannot alone carry a film.<br /><br />These types of films fail because they are all surface and too little substance.  The original Starsky & Hutch seems funny to us now because there was a sincerity in respecting the material.  The material may not have been great, but the premise was and the execution by David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser nearly perfect.<br /><br />Phillips has been announced as the director for The Six Million Dollar Man with Jim Carrey.  Smells all wrong to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>More of a costume party than a real film, with more 70s references than plot points, Starky & Hutch is mostly about Stiller and Wilson playing dress-up, jiving with each other and making countless 'insider' jokes about the mod/pop culture of 30 years ago.<br /><br />And when they run out of ways to make fun of afros and other sundry items of retro fashion, they resort to leering at bimbos (enter Carmen Electra and Amy Dumb), making what starts out as just harmless junk into callow, obvious junk.<br /><br />Most of the 'jokes' seem targeted at the 13-18 year-old male demographic. On a humorous scale of 1 to 10, it scores a magnanimous 0.5 -- idiotic and disturbingly reliant on a conversance and affection for a television show that most of us remember as being about a red Grand Torino if we remember it at all.<br /><br />Two stars for the occasional funny moment that sneaked in.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Not sharp enough to be satire and not bold enough to re-imagine its source, Stiller and Wilson's take on the '70s TV show never gets out of second gear.  The plot's thin and the jokes are thinner.  Sure, there are some good moments - the quid-pro-quo interrogation of Will Ferrell, and an acrobatic knife-wielding Korean kid - but nothing is really laugh-out-loud funny.  With moments like the "dance off" echoing the "walk off" from "Zoolander", you get the feeling these guys are already repeating themselves.  Still, you just want to like them anyway.  Despite a bad script, the duo have enough onscreen presence to have you giggling: Stiller's frustrated-little-guy shtick gets another incarnation in Starsky, the by-the-book cop trying to live up to the reputation of his policewoman mother, and Wilson's laid back, laconic, almost Zen-like 'non-acting' continues to pay off for him.  They're almost enough to carry the film, but not quite.  Watching Stiller and Wilson is like watching your two kid brothers on screen: you want to like what they do, you want to see the best in it, but sometimes it just isn't there.  When it works for them, as it so often does - in marvellous movies like "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents" - the results are hilarious.  But when they fail, it breaks your heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great in this hilarious comedy. If you don't like it, you just don't like comedies! Based on the classic television show, this is an absolutely hilarious movie! Snoop Dogg and vince Vaughn costar in which Starsky and Hutch try to stop a drug dealer. Will Ferell is in the funniest scene with "two dragons". After that scene, you'll be on the floor laughing. The accent that Starsky adopts at the end is funny (just do it), and the horse scene along with the chinese kid that throws knives are also funny. There are so many more funny scenes, like when Starksy takes drugs by accident.

Then I looked at who was directing this movie and who was staring in it and my hopes became higher.  This movie actually worked.<p>Ben Stiller plays Starsky, the by the rules cop, and Owen Wilson play "Hutch", the surfer dude type cop whom always tries to benefit from his busts.  The two actors have great chemistry together on screen.  Vince Vaughn plays the cocaine dealer, I forgot his name, and does what he normally does in his movies.  This movie had many funny parts and for some reason, I can't help laughing everytime that I see Stiller on the screen.

They've worked every angle of the pairing that pits the neurotic, six-cups-of-coffee Stiller persona (Starsky) against the "What, me think?" Wilson persona (Mike "Hutch" Hutchinson). By the close of director Todd Phillips' third consecutive financially-successful-yet-uneven comedy - think Ivan Reitman meets P.T. Anderson - even Stiller and Wilson seem sick of each other; the movie is stolen with or without their permission by Snoop Dogg (as Huggy Bear) and Will Ferrell (as an imprisoned gay biker with a dragon fetish.)<p>The script, co-penned by Phillips and writing partner Scot Armstrong ("Road Trip" and "Old School") installs a mustached Jewish businessman, Reese Feldman, as the drug villain, played by Vince Vaughn straightaway, without humor. He shoots a guy in the movie's opening scene, blows up Hutch's shack in another. Feldman's discovery: a hybrid cocaine undetectable by German Shepherds and crime labs - watch for an inside joke about "new" and "old" coke - which plays a role in an extended sequence where Starsky mistakes it for sugar.  <p>Phillips and Armstrong poke a bit of fun at the 70s - the original TV show emerges mostly unscathed - by parodying disco, cheerleaders in the Farrah Fawcett hair, the pimp culture, punctuated by Snoop Dogg - but they generally rely on Stiller and Wilson to goof off one another. It's debatable whether their chemistry has ever been that good - "The Royal Tanenbaums" wisely kept them apart - but here they struggle in dead air. For Stiller it could be fatigue - seven films in calendar year plus a regular spot on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" - and for Wilson, it could be the epiphany that there are more roles out there than the shaggy, shambling fool.<p>"Starsky & Hutch" seems strangely lobotomized. A scene, for example, that features Starsky and Hutch interrogating a topless cheerleader (Molly Sims) might have earned an R rating shot from the front, but at least we would have been spared a viewing of the skeletal Sims' alien spine. Robbed of their ability to rip off "Porky's" by Hollywood bean counters looking for a franchise, Phillips and Armstrong fall back on the PG-13 comedy standbys - casual drug use, slightly loose women, homophobia, and two household names and a handful of cameos ( Snoop Dogg, Jason Bateman, Chris Penn). It's not unlike one of those failed Saturday Night Live comedies: too tame in one scene, too lame in another, stale most of the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>why is it that every time a movie is put out, a rapper or a pop trash star has to be in it? rap is not my favorite kind of music, and I almost fell asleep watching this. besides Snoop Dogg, Ben Stiller was acting. Ben Stiller can't act to save his life. Ben Affleck should have played the part of Starsky. I commend Owen Wilson for his acting ability though. Owen was in the movie "Armageddon",so the part of Starsky should have been played by Affleck, or even Adam Sandler, or even Jim Carrey.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>I remember having a discussion with a friend, once, about people in high school and how there are three groups of them - (1) the ones you hate, (2) your friends, and then the third group: the people that you could live without, but you simply don't have the energy to actively dislike them...so you're nice to 'em. Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself. <p>  The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.<p>  Then again, S&H can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).<p>  When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither. It tows the line and makes it a worthwhile experience in the end, and an albeit hilarious one, at times. It's occasionally dumb, it has an interminably slow first act, and I can't say I'd watch it again. I can't say I didn't have fun the first time, either. GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>The march of the Seventies continues with this latest attempt to update an otherwise dramatic period show as an outright comedy. Stiller plays Starsky, the man with the natural perm, while Owen Wilson is the sensitive Hutch.  And the car is back (though it seems like they crunched about a dozen or so Gran Torino's in making this movie).  Set in the fictional "Bay City" (though it still looks as much LA as any of those cop shows supposedly set in NYC), "Starsky & Hutch" has our heroes working together for the first time to take down a crime lord (Vince Vaughn) set to flood the city with a new form of cocaine utterly undetectable by police dogs.  Will they be forced to rely on a local "businessman" named "Huggy Bear" (Snoop Dogg)?  You bet!  Will they earn the wrath of their Captain (Fred Williamson)?  You got it!  Will they be torn apart, yet rise above it and learn to work as a team?  No problem.  S&H is good clean fun - aside from a knife-throwing kid, a three-way kissing match between Hutch & 2 cheerleaders, a near case of "Russian Roulette" and a disco-dance challenge that goes bad.  The jokes are fun, but it's a thin movie - sort of like a stretched version of the "Sabotage" video done nearly a decade ago, in which all the hazards and professional hurdles of being an LAPD detective were compressed into a few minutes.  None of the jokes are that new - and most of them are sight gags (the ridiculous size of electronics, old cars and hair-dos, and how the cool people of the time look incredibly stupid and unattractive).  Though it hails from the same TV era as "Charlie's Angels" it's not quite as energized as either of the two "Angels" movies, could have used some more car-chases, but it's still a load of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>It ranks a little under Zoolander in terms of my favorite Ben Stiller movies, but it's really pretty funny.<br /><br />However, I couldn't help but get the feeling that about 20% of the jokes were lost on me though since it's been so long since I'd seen the series.  I got the impression that I would have enjoyed it more had my memory been better.<br /><br />If you're a 'Starsky & Hutch' fan, I'd actually go back and re-watch some of the episodes of the TV series (which is also out on DVD), and THEN watch the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Then this is a must see!

Stiller and Wilson effectively master their characters quirks (Where in the WORLD did the costumer's ever find that hideous Starsky cardigan!?!?), and the story, while not the stuff of brain surgery, is light and entertaining.  It's a well done 70's TV to screen in much the same way Charlies Angles 1 was:  It manages to stay true to the show, while still satirizing it's material.<br /><br />Most brilliant spot is Starsky and Hutch bring home their dates, and Hutch does his 'thang.'  For those who remember the 70's and lived it...please don't drink during this segment, becaue you 1.) will choke on your soda or 2.) lose your soda as you do the classic spit-take before rolling in laughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Let's be honest, most cinematic remakes of classic TV shows are awful. They either barely resemble the original (like the Claire Danes version of The Mod Squad) or turn it into kitsch parody (like The Flintstones). More often than not the contemporary update pales in comparison. As a result, there was a healthy dose of skepticism when a remake of Starsky and Hutch was announced. Would Hollywood ruin yet another vintage TV show?<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie is not an out-and-out parody but plays things fairly straight. It is set in the 1970s and actually has a story that one can follow instead of the typical M.O. of these kinds of films that simply string together a bunch of loosely connected comedic set pieces.<br /><br />Starsky and Hutch is a vehicle tailor-made for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's comedic talents. Stiller plays Starsky as an intense, by-the-book cop, while Wilson's Hutch is the laid-back, loose cannon. You would think that after all of the films they've done together their schtick would have gotten old by now. However, they play so well off each other. Their comic timing is dead-on. The give and take of the dialogue between them is effortless and enjoyable to watch as the mellow Hutch constantly baits the easily flustered Starsky.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Todd Phillips. He dishes a lot of trivial factoids on this rather bland track.<br /><br />"Fashion Fa Shizzle Wit Huggy Bizzle" is a brief tour of Huggy Bear's funky retro outfits and stylin' pimp wear with Snoop Dog. Not surprisingly, ol' Snoop displays a real knowledge of `70s fashion.<br /><br />"Last Look Special" gently makes fun of these kinds of puff promo pieces as Stiller, Wilson, et al "talk trash" about director Phillips. This is a fun, little extra.<br /><br />There are several deleted scenes that run six minutes in total, including one that has Starsky lecturing Hutch about peeing in public. There are some funny bits here and it's a shame that many of them were cut out.<br /><br />There is also a five minute "Gag Reel" that is a slightly amusing collection of blown lines as the cast try hard to keep a straight face during certain scenes.<br /><br />Finally, there is the obligatory theatrical trailer.<br /><br />This is a movie that could have been so easy to screw up. It's amazing that all involved did such a good job. They've created an entertaining and funny movie that pays homage to the classic TV series and yet also stands on its own. This is an excellent example of how to remake a TV show the right way.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: After seing the dissapointments that were Dodgeball and Anchorman I decided to give Ben Stiller and the gang one more chance. Boy am I glad I did. This movie was a truly funny movie that did not force the audience to laugh by doing crazy things. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson really clicked in this movie and that really helped the experience. The movie is not a parody, it's not making fun of the 70's like Anchorman is. This is just a funny spin on a classic tv show, and sure you'll find a little spoof on things here and there.. It's not as over the top as Zoolander, which was a very vivid parody on the modeling world. This was a good comedy that I really enjoyed. I really hate comparing it to Dodgeball and Anchorman but I have to because all the cast members are in each of these movies except for Owen Wilson. I actually found Will Ferrel funnier in here than I did in Anchorman. Never will this movie force you to laugh nor will it have crazy things that have no reference whatsoever. So, if you need to wash that bad taste of Dodgeball and Anchorman out of your mouth then this is the movie to do it with. Great to own, a must to rent.<br /><br />  VIDEO: The video turned out great for this kind of movie. There are a lot of bright colors in this movie and every thing was sharp and crisp. Ususally red is a nightmare for movies because it blurs very easily, but Starsky's car was so very shiny on my HDTV.<br /><br />  AUDIO: The standard 5.1 mix does the job, and actually will surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine.<br /><br />  PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Oh my! Another single disc release from Warner in an Armary case. Maybe they got rid of those cheap snapper cases for good, but there is no insert. The extras are a bit wimpy as well. You have a commentary by the director, a funny take on making of documentaries, a look at Snoop Dog's character, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a trailer. You will breeze through these in one day. Thankfully the movie was enjoyable.<br /><br />  MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *)<br />  DVD SCORE: (7 / 10)</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.<br /><br />The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy with a dragon fetish who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.<br /><br />The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal. Those who liked the Starsky and Hutch television series or who are fans of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will probably enjoy this goofy, spoofy, sophomoric little film.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Detective David Starsky is the most dedicated undercover cop working the mean streets of Bay City, California. Maniacally devoted to his job, when he's on duty no crime goes unpunished, and he's always on duty. And that's a good thing, because he has some metaphorically big shoes to fill: his mother was a legend on the force, one of the best cops in the history of Bay City. But while his mom stuck with the same partner throughout her entire career, due to his extremely zealous brand of police work, Starsky burns through partners faster than his beloved Gran Torino goes through spark plugs. Detective Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson is having career issues of his own, he's a good cop, but his hazardously laidback personality and desire for a quick buck don't always get the job done. He has excellent instincts, he just needs a little bit of focus to keep him on the admittedly less profitable side of the law. "Starsky and Hutch" is well-made and funny, a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. I recommend you see this movie if your looking for a good comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Starsky and Hutch is more fun than it has any right to be, even if it does depart from the series in many ways. Stiller has Paul Michael Glaser's mannerisms down to a tee (he even has Glaser's bizarre run, like a hyperactive duck doing a windmill impersonation, down to perfection) but otherwise is another of his trademark anal neurotics while Owen Wilson takes Hutch even further away as a laid back dude not above a spot of robbery to supplement his salary. But it is funny, good natured and doesn't outstay its welcome too much. The only real bum note is giving the final glory to Snoop's terrible Huggy Bear, a charmless, boring and lazy performance constantly outshone by his own bodyguards.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I can't really say how this movie compares to the popular T.V. show from the 1970s.  I was only 6 years old in 1975, and STARSKY & HUTCH came on after my bedtime.  I may have seen a couple of episodes, but all I remember vividly is the trademark red Grand Torino with the white stripe.<br /><br />Insofar as the car is concerned, it has been resurrected for the current movie.  I am inclined to believe that the humor of the movie is much more of the slapstick variety than any humor displayed in the T.V. series.  There is one curious aspect about this remake, however:  unlike most remakes, this one takes place in its original epoch of the 1970s as opposed to being an "updated" rendition that takes place in the present day.<br /><br />By far & away the weakest part of the movie is the inclusion of Snoop Dog.  He is absolutely the worst actor that ever lived;  every scene he is in, is like taking the air out of a balloon.  Trying to teach him to act is like trying to teach an alligator to be a vegetarian.  He is probably the most talentless self-made millionaire the world has ever seen - bar none.  I would beg Snoop Dog to kindly disappear from the public eye - the world would be a better place for it.<br /><br />I am puzzled as to why it went the route of being rated PG-13.  After all, nobody under 35 would even be aware that there WAS an old T.V. show called STARSKY & HUTCH.  It had some opportunities for gratiutous nudity that would have made it a good old-fashioned "R" Rated slapstick comedy.  For some unknown reason, it shied away from this and ended up being a teaser flick.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, it is OK.  Nothing great, nothing terrible.  For some, it might be nostalgic as it goes back to the 1970s.  Other people, including me, will have nightmares about DISCO making a comeback (yikes!).  If you pick up this DVD w/out expecting a whole lot, you should be fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>The makers of this film recreate the funky 70's, from the polyester suits to the background music.  The best part of the movie is the interplay between the uptight Starsky and his laid-back, fun-loving partner, Hutch.  Some of the scenes are funny and some of them are tasteless, but it all averages out to a pretty average movie.  It's fun for nostalgia buffs, but nothing to write home about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Starsky and Hutch' is a remake of a 70's TV show of the same name. Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson, a.k.a. &quot;Hutch.&quot; Both characters are police officers in Bay City. Starsky is a &quot;by the book&quot; officer, while Hutch is laid back officer willing to bend the rules.<br /><br /> Joining Wilson and Stiller are Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear and Vince Vaughn as Reese Feldman, the movie's villain. Huggy Bear is a pimp character of sorts, and a friend of Hutch. Feldman is a cocaine dealer plotting to distribute millions of dollars of cocaine that has been engineered to be undetectable.<br /><br /> The characters and actors are what make this movie watchable. Wilson and Stiller have teamed up on other projects, and they always play well together. Stiller's performance can be somewhat forced, but his best scenes come when his character is undercover. Wilson plays a character that is similar to most of the characters he plays in other movies: a laid back, 90's type of guy. Snoop was perfect as Huggy Bear, right down to the 70's style fur coats, cane, and pimp attitude. Vaughn was remarkable as well.<br /><br /> Will Ferrell has a small role in the movie. It was a shame he wasn't used more. His casting was dead on for the role he played. His delivery and interation with Wilson and Stiller lead to one of the funnier scenes with a few funny follow up references later in the movie. There is also a cameo at the end of the movie by a couple of other actors. I won't name them so as to not spoil the surprise. The cameo seemed a bit forced and a bit long. If it had been a bit shorter and tighter, it could have been funnier.<br /><br /> Where the movie loses points is in the delivery of the jokes. At times, the movie plodded along, and some of the jokes were either forced, or took to long to set up and didn't deliver enough of a laugh as a payoff. There is a great scene at the beginning of the movie where one of Huggy's henchmen recites facts about everything in the middle of stand off with Starsky like he is World Book Encyclopedia. This scene worked, but unfortunately, it wasn't followed up on well.<br /><br /> There are several DVD extras, but none of them are extraordinary. The gag reel largely features scenes that got flubbed because the actors couldn't stop giggling through their lines. The deleted scenes only would have helped the story minimally, and it was easy to see why they were deleted. There is a featurette, in which the actors pretend to have hated working with each other and the director. It is funny because it is obvious they don't mean what they say, but after a few minutes, the joke just seems cruel, especially while the director says such admirable things about the cast.<br /><br /> This movie is fun, and definitely worth a rental. I haven't seen much of the 70's TV show to make a decent comparison. This is a movie that you can watch while you do something else, and you won't miss a whole lot. I wanted to give it four stars, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it enough to give that rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I think the best word for "Starsky and Hutch" is 'serviceable'. It's reasonably funny, decently acted and directed, and, all and all, an entertaining way to spend an evening. It's neither the best nor the worst work the team of Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have done. [This is their sixth movie together.] One doesn't have to have any knowledge of the ancient TV series it is based on to enjoy it.<br /><br />Starsky [Stiller] and Hutch [Wilson] are two renegade cops who belong together. When first made partners, they don't much like each other, but, after awhile, they begin to care for each other in a classic 'male bonding' way. Their first big case involves a drug dealer [Vince Vaughn], who has figured out a novel way to smuggle and transport cocaine. As is always true in movies like this, they are stymied by the 'system' in pursuing their man, but they figure out 'novel' ways to overcome this problem. [Their 'novel' ways would land them in jail in real life!]<br /><br />The moviemakers wisely chose to make "Starsky and Hutch" a satire of the 70s rather than a replication of the TV show - a show most people only vaguely remember anyway.<br /><br />Some of the gags work, while others fall flat. Stiller and Wilson are always a pleasure to watch working together. Sometimes it's funny just to see them TRY so hard when a sketch is weak.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Starsky is a pretty funny film. Is it rolling on the floor laughter? No, but it's still good.

There were some references to technology (I'm a computer geek) that I thought was pretty funny, especially when it comes to the size of the gadgets used by Starsky and Hutch.<p>This movie does follow the regular buddy-cop recipe where two cops, who can't stand each other and are complete opposites of each other, end up as partners rushing out to fight crime.  While trying to work with each other they find a common bond that allows them to work together as a team.  There is more to the recipe and it makes this film rather predictable at most parts... but there were some parts that surprised me and that also caused me to laugh out loud.<p>Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do a great job and are a great team.  I believe this will have to be their fifth or sixth movie together.  They are very funny... but the show was stolen by Snoop Dogg who does a fantastic job as Huggy Bear.  He really brought this movie up a notch in its hilarity.<p>If you want a good comedy, especially the kinds of Ben Stiller's calliber, then I would highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>STARSKY & HUTCH is not a great film.  It is not even a good film.  I went through a series of stages while watching it.  At first, I did not think I was going to like it at all.  I do not really care for Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson all that much and I found their other collaboration, ZOOLANDER, a complete travesty.  But in the first five minutes, I felt the film had some promise.  However, as in some of their other films, I feel that you either love watching these guys play themselves or you do not.  Neither of them is able to create dynamic characters.  Instead, they just simply play themselves in every movie and let the cards fall where they will.  Of course, I realize that there are some pretty serious fan clubs out there for both of these guys.  Thus, if you are someone who loves watching either of these guys, then you will probably get a kick out of STARSKY & HUTCH.  But if you are not a fan of these actors, then there really is not a lot here to justify the expense of purchasing the DVD.<br /><br />Of course, there are some winning moments.  The trumped up "partnership" of these two guys gets to be quite funny at certain points and Will Ferrell's brief performance is a scream, as always.  I never saw the original TV show, so I cannot comment on the film's "accuracy."  However, given the standard performances of these two guys, I wouldn't be surprised if the film fails to resemble the original at all.  I would describe it as a mediocre comedy at best.  The only reason to watch it is if you like Stiller and Wilson.  STARSKY & HUTCH has them both in spades.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Starsky & Hutch&quot; exceeds expectations, which you have to admit have been lowered considerably when it comes to all of the movies that have been made recycling old television shows. This is perhaps to be expected when you understand that the target audience for these films consists of people who have probably never seen an episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; or &quot;The Mod Squad,&quot; and who are would be more familiar with the famous poster of Farrah Fawcett than any single episode of &quot;Charlie's Angels.&quot; But this 2004 comedy has two advantages.<br /><br /> First, there is a rich tradition of buddy films where a &quot;good&quot; person and a &quot;bad&quot; person team up and overcome their differences to work together, extending back from Riggs & Murtaugh to Butch & Sundance, all the way back to Katie Scarlet & Miss Melly. &quot;Starsky&quot; and &quot;Hutch&quot; plays with this tried and true formula, mainly by tweaking it, but the key thing is that the film embraces the idea at the same time it is lampooning it. This is, all things considered, a gentle comedy telling the story of how Starksy and Hutch came to meet, even with Snoop Dogg bringing something of an edge to Huggy Bear.<br /><br /> Second, there is pretty good chemistry between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as Starsky and Hutch; they should since this is their sixth film together. In fact, this is the most chemistry Stiller has shown with anybody in one of his films since he worked with DeNiro. Stiller is helped by the fact that his Starsky tends to go over the top but still manages to get the job done. You keep thinking he is about to make a fool of himself, and he certainly moves in that direction, but things never get so far out of hand that he becomes just a big joke.<br /><br /> The big joke in the film would be the plan of bad guy Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn) who has invented a former of cocaine that has even German shepherds cannot detect. In other words, Feldman has invented (wait for it) &quot;new Coke.&quot; But the plot is merely an excuse for Stiller and Wilson to do scenes together and it the spirit of true partnership each gets humiliated in turn, such as when a jailhouse snitch (Will Ferrell) makes Hutch show his belly button (then things get really weird), and then they get humiliated together. It is not like we do not know that in the end Feldman is going down, because he is going down hard, man, so the plot is not the point. Furthermore, the supporting case of Juliette Lewis, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra, and Fred Williamson as Captain Dobey is pretty good for this sort of film.<br /><br /> Plus, you have Starsky's beloved bright-red supercharged Ford Gran Torino, which he drives like a crazy person and then becomes incensed by the thought it might get scratched or dented. The homage to the original consists of the requisite appearance by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, as well as Wilson warbling Soul's one hit, &quot;Don't Give Up on Us Baby,&quot; a joke that is going to be lost on most of the viewers. Actually, throughout the film director Todd Phillips makes great use of the music of that period, such as &quot;We've Only Just Begun&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Delight,&quot; to add a ironic counterpoint to the proceedings.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be funny as I never took the TV Series too serious, and the cameo at the end was a nice touch...<br /><br />Fun entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Remember David Soul and Paul Michael- Glaser in the old Starksy and Hutch action series from the 1970's? If you're trying to put it behind you, then you may not want to see this movie. But for those who loved the show and who like cheesy comedies, this 2004 big screen rendition might be for you.<br /><br />The stars this time around are Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in the roles as David Starsky and Ken Hutchinson respectively. Stiller is a more serious character and Wilson is more laid back and funny, even bordering on stupid at times. The two don't seem to get along that well, but they end up as partners regardless as they try to complete a drug sting. Along they way, they get some help from a character named Huggy Bear, played by Snoop Dogg- one of the best parts of the film. Huggy Bear seems like a cool, slick helpful type of guy, but you don't really know whose side he is on. Snoop Dogg is, basically, playing himself in this role. He always has that cool, calm, confident demeanor no matter when I see him on the small or large screen.<br /><br />The music in this film comes from the 1970's, and much of it is forgettable, just like the 1970's were forgettable. One particularly nauseating scene (or funny, depending on how you look at it) has Owen Wilson taking a guitar from his partner and proceeding to play the song "Don't Give up on Us". Most viewers won't recognize this song at all, but it is, in fact, an old hit single from the 1970's by the original Hutch, David Soul.<br /><br />Some of the comedy here is funny, but other parts of the movie don't quite seem to hit the mark. However, the action scenes and the nostalgic value are enough to recommend watching this movie. It isn't the greatest, but it has enough entertainment value to make it worth paying a few dollars to see on video.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Oh, boy.  If anybody needed another example that Owen Wilson cannot act and is not funny other than the very lame "Shanghai Knights" then look no further than this film.  He reminds me of a less intelligent Dennis Miller, always trying to come across as cute but without the wit.  Blah!  Then there is the flimsy and altogether predictable and flat script.  It made me wonder how on Earth the producers managed to get so many "name" actors for bit roles.  When the drug-deal story goes stale(as it frequently does) Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are called upon to improvise by wearing ridiculous costumes and managing to sneak their way into various locations.  The script even calls for the obligatory passing of the torch from the original actors who starred in the television show by having them hand over the keys to that very cool car.  The best thing about the show was the car, not the acting or the predictable tough-guy dialogue.  "Let's come up with a new movie idea based on an antiquated television show!"  Sound familiar.  Here it is again.  The only redeeming factor in the entire film(other than Carmen Electra in a cameo as a cheerleader, ouch!) is Ben Stiller.  He seems to be the only person concerned with making this once popular iconic television show into a parody, which is the only sensible thing to do.  He has a few outright hilarious scenes and plays a few other characters that are crazy and quotable.  It's just too bad no one else shared his energy or his vision while making this otherwise dumb film.  As far as Snoop Dogg playing the character Huggy Bear...hoodlums waxing intellectual has been done before.  His presence is wasted in every other scene with stilted dialogue and unbelievable situations.  This film is a waste of time for anyone who isn't a Ben Stiller fan.  As for his fans I recommend renting this film and not buying it, then picking up his other recent film "Duplex" which is funnier by leaps and bounds.  Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This movie is so funny. I've never seen Starsky and Hutch the show before, but I think the movie is so funny to watch.

Scooby-Doo did it, and- sorry if you were in the process of wiping this one out of your memory- The Avengers did too. But somehow Starsky And Hutch avoids remake clich&eacute;s by revelling in the irony goldmine left vacant by the TV show.<br /><br />Top marks go to the casters for revolving the film around trusted comedy performers rather than straight-faced, perfectly groomed Hollywood big-shots. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson- who tickled the world together in Zoolander and The Royal Tenembaums- have now perfected the geeky, uptight but loveable goon and laid-back chick magnet. Snoop Dogg has a go at stealing the show in his 15 minutes of screen time as Huggy Bear- a role he seems to have spent his whole life emulating.<br /><br />Despite the absence of a Wilson writing credit, the script strikes a balance of comedy and wisely simple plot. It's never laugh-out-loud funny but then, with heavy dollops of nostalgia, irony and references to navigate through, it's no problem.

Snoop Dogg also has a scene stealing turn as informant Huggy Bear, as the rapper turned actor finds himself perfectly cast here.  Starsky & Hutch is lighthearted fun for the most part, and Phillips' energetic direction makes this spoof/homage worth seeing.  Also featuring Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Fred Williamson, and an uncredited (and memorable) Will Ferrel.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Good film. Good acting. Limited story especially since I have no clue what Starsky & Hutch was all about. In any case, watch this film if they're showing it on television or rent it. Do not buy because it's not really one of those films you buy. Some scenes were funny and it is just the perfect movie for the "three star" grade. Cheers.<br /><br />Want a 5 star comedy film?

Snoop does a great job playing Huggy Bear.  If you want to laugh and be entertained then you should get this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>"Starsky & Hutch" is not the worst movie made from a TV show...that list is way long...but it's not that good of a movie either.<br /><br />Other reviewers have outlined the plot, such that it is.<br /><br />It's clearly made with a lot of care. The soundtrack, the sets, the dialogue, the hairstyles...it's "fun."<br /><br />The screenplay is lazy, but it's sort of like lazy in a "70's TV show" kinda way, so this might be intentional. Owen Wilson's wisecracks are occasionally funny, but are also anachronistic. Ben Stiller adds another ballistically whacked-out character to his resume...he's fearless in his goofiness, surpassed only by Will Ferrell (who has a small, extraordinarily weird part in this film) among our current actors.<br /><br />Much has been said about Snoop Dogg, and his casting is fine. He's not an actor, but he's funny enough being Snoop-as-Huggy Bear.<br /><br />Many other actors, like Fred Williamson, overact to the point of absurdity, while somebody like Jason Bateman barely registers as Vince Vaughn's compadre. Vaughn is solid, as always, with the lines he's given.<br /><br />While watching the film, we sometimes became impatient. Lines fell flat. Scenes just didn't work. But as the movie progressed, it did gain some sort of momentum where we did want to know how it ended.<br /><br />That may be faint praise, but I know all of you have seen movies where you couldn't care less how it ended because they were that bad ot that boring.<br /><br />This isn't in that category. It's funny in spots, but not uproariously so.<br /><br />I will say this: the ending was worth waiting around for.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Owen Wilson (The Big Bounce, The Minus Man) and Ben Stiller (Along Came Polly, Zoolander) star as the main characters in this hilarious comedy about the two detectives, Starsky (Stiller) and Hutch (Owen) who team up to take on the evil drug lord, Vince Vaughn (The Locusts, Swingers). Along the way they encounter strange things and get into stranger situations, example a chinese kid wielding weapons. This is a movie where you expect the two stars to play the same roles they did in teh rest of their movies and they do that. This is the best of the Stiller movies that came out this year. Also starring Jason Bateman (Dodgeball, Arrested Development), Juliette Lewis (Old School, Natural Born Killers), Amy Smart (Campfire Tales, Road Trip), Carmen Electra, Brande Roderick (Dracula II: The Ascension) and a amusing camero by none other then Will Farrell (Elf, Old School). Paul Michael Glazer and David Soul appear at the end of the movie and if you dont know who they are then your stoopid. Directed by Road Trip and Old School director Todd Phillips. to quote Stiller and Owen in the movie..." I like your moves"..."I like your style"</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Stiller and Wilson upheld their parts as did Vince Vaughn - Bateman and Snoop Dogg - the story had some comidic parts but it was just slightly above average.<br /><br />Still not bad for entertainment - the gals were beautiful - the guys were into their parts - the car was great despite its dents - loved the end where the two originals showed up.<br /><br />Huggy Bear had quite a range of wild duds.<br /><br />Not a classic but it will do.

The convention in these tales is to take two cops with diametrically opposed personalities and team them up as fearless crime fighters.  Thus, we have Starsky, the stuffy, by-the-book, idealistic cop who takes his job seriously and actually believes he is making the streets safe for law-abiding, paired up with Hutch, a laid-back, cynical pragmatist who has no illusions about the nobility of his profession and no qualms about bending the rules when he sees the chance of getting a little personal gain out of it.<br /><br />"Starsky and Hutch" has a great time poking fun at the cliches of its genre, never taking itself or the era in which it is set too seriously.  In fact, the movie does a fine job satirizing the fashions, trends and music of the 1970's in all their kitschy, tacky glory.  In a clever in-joke, the movie has Hutch singing an acoustic version of "Don't Give Up On Us," the sappy number one hit recorded by the original Hutch, David Soul, in 1977.<br /><br />Of the actors, Ben Stiller steals the show as Starsky, bringing to the character a quality of deadpan seriousness that makes him a sympathetic figure even as he becomes more and more the butt of the movie's jokes.  The screenplay spins many a convention of the cop buddy movie on its head.  For instance, invariably in these films, one of the cops has a father who distinguished himself years earlier as a model officer on the force, and now his rookie son has to live up to the family reputation.  In this case, however, it is Starsky's MOTHER who set the standard for bravery and courage in the precinct and Starksy knows he cannot let her memory down.<br /><br />Owen Wilson is somewhat less effective as Hutch, mainly because the character has been conceived as essentially the same wisecracking slacker Wilson plays in virtually all his movies.  Still, the two actors generate an effective rapport on the screen, one that helps us over some of the rough spots that set in from time to time.  For indeed, the movie, like most big screen comedies, can't sustain the hilarity through the entirety of its running time.  Nevertheless, "Starsky and Hutch" does a better job than most at making us laugh and does so without ever insulting our intelligence.  That's quite an accomplishment, actually, in this day and age.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I bought this movie today. I've never seen the TV show before I don't think. The movie is very funny, I love Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. There are other great actors who are in the movie as well. Last but not least the band that was featured in the movie Old School &quot;The Dan Band&quot; play in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The only thing I liked about this film was the cameo appearances of the real actors from the "Starsky & Hutch" tv series (ABC, 1975-79), Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018D3RI">Starsky & Hutch - The Complete First Season</a>.<br /> Looks more like a Zoolander 2.<br /> "Easter Egg" in Special Features: When the yellow star is on Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel or theatrical trailer, press the right button. When the big star is yellow, "click". You will see a Brady Bunch trivia bit with Vince Vaughn and a cop.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Starsky and Hutch is based on the 70's tv series. It stars Ben Stiller as Starsky who takes his job as a cop way too seriously. While Owen Wilson plays Hutch who doesn't take his job seriously as well. Stiller and Wilson are perfect for the parts. Stiller trys harder to be in character with his curly black wig. While Wilson just shows up for every movie he does just as....Owen Wilson. He doesn't need to change his look or attitude, he's just funny as himself.<br /><br />  The supporting cast is great too. You have Vince Vaughn who's making a name for himself in comedies. He plays the coke dealing villain who made an untraceable coke. All he did pretty much is mix coke with sweet and low lol. Juliet Lewis (Natural Born Killers), plays his g/f and Jason Bateman (Teen Wolf Too) plays his main henchman. Will Farrell is funny as always in a small role as a prison inmate that Starsky and Hutch go to for info on the coke dealers. He has an obsession of dragons and has Starsky and Hutch do all these weird poses before he'll tell them what they want to know. Last but not least Snoop Dogg plays the role he's meant to play, a pimp like character who knows his grass lol. With a cast this funny it's hard not to like Starsky and Hutch.</p></br></body></html>

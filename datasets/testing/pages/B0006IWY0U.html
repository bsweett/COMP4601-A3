The brilliant plot is adapted from Patrick O'Brian's two novels written in the 1800's about war hero Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Crowe.  No other actor could have played him better.  He proves that he continually evolves as an actor through every film.  His tremendous talents are rare in modern-day entertainment.  Director Peter Weir leads the cast and crew to creating this masterpiece.  All of the realisms and hardtimes are greatly expressed in this film.  Such tremendous film quality offers audiences a great, unforgettable experience.  The action scenes are intense, keeping the battles raging and the ocean storms like a roller coaster.  Yet, the emotional aspect never dies.  During moments of peace and rest, the expressed struggles keep the emotional tides to the fullest, namely depression and fear. <p>The elaborate background settings add the entertainment pleasure.  The Oscar winning sound editing and cinematography wonderfully add intensity to the action scenes and desplict the characters' surroundings fuller.  The costume design are accurate to the actual styles of 1805.  The visual effects greatly desplict the realities of the times.  They make audiences feel like they're living that year.<p>"Master And Commander" is a great film that will keep audiences watching closely to every scene.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>I've never read a book by Patrick O'Brien featuring captain Lucky Jack Aubrey, so everything on "Master and Commander" was new to me. First of all, Peter Weir proved to be a very intelligent director, making the viewers totally at ease and making me feel I was part of Aubrey's crew. Sometimes it seemed I was on the deck of HMS Surprise. <p>Second, though the story is not original and really showed no surprises (no pun intended), the screenplay is very good. At first sight, a 130-minute movie that goes on pratically only aboard a ship seems dull and boring. But the scenes are always significant to the context of the film, and the screenplay provides interesting insights on the characters' personalities, not only the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and the Doctor Maturin) but minor ones as well. I think the children's and teenagers' acting was great. The battle scenes are impressive, and the quiet and sometimes funny scenes on Galapagos Islands proved to be a nice interlude. <p>Surprisingly, Russel Crowe is not in his acclaimed usual macho-style as in "Gladatior" and "Proof of life". He plays Jack Aubrey as a commanding but sensitive man (his musical scenes with the doctor are great - in fact the music in the movie is very good and appropriate). But the one who steals every scene he's in is the real-life Lucky (his wife is Jennifer Connelly) Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen Maturin. <p>"Master and commander" is not only a nicely-executed film, but also great entertainment as well.<p>Grade 9.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>This is an excellent movie in the tradition of Stewart Granger, Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn and Robert Taylor. What with all of the extraordinary technology director Peter Weir hurls at us, it would be difficult to subscribe a 50's feel to it. Nevertheless it has that larger than life feel to it not uncommon in some of those earlier "epic" works.<p>Crowe is a larger than life actor, and fits well into the garb of Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, Captain of HMS Surprise. His orders - to shadow and destroy the enormous French warship, the Acheron. Captain Aubrey's friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, equally well played by Paul Bettany, is a formidable advocate for compassion as Crowe is for leadership.<p>The Surprise steals the show, and 10 minutes after the movie begins we forget we are on the pitching deck of a 200 foot frigate in the South Atlantic.<p>Jolly good show. Makes movie goers want to see more period pieces and book readers read more of Patrick O'Brian.

You see plenty of lovely sights, and get a few snatches of swashbuckling and derring-do, but you get all that without benefit of plot or character development. This is a film that is literally all about the journey, not the destination. It is, though, a rather entertaining journey at times, and never a dull one. YES you read right, despite the length, this film is good. Not as good as Lord of the Rings mind you, but better than The Last Samaria. Plot is following Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Russell Crowe, who must be a great actor because he's so likable in his movies even though he's a jerk in real life. The year is 1805, and Aubrey is piloting the HMS Surprise, out chasing down one of Napoleon's boats, which is said to be intent on spreading the Napoleonic Wars to South America. The Surprise is damaged in an early skirmish with the French vessel, but Aubrey does not turn back. He insists on repairing the ship at sea even as it continues its pursuit. This is folly, says the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin ), who is also Aubrey's best friend. Stephen suggests it's Aubrey's personal pride that's getting in the way of making a more rational decision, and that his crew's lives are at stake. Aubrey says no, that's not it, and the matter is dropped. Did you blink? Because if you did, you missed all you're going to get in the way of character arcs or personal struggles. Unlike most protagonists, Aubrey does not learn, grow or change over the course of the film. He's presented as a larger-than-life leader who doesn't make mistakes, and even his apparent mistakes turn out for the best. Sad thing is, I know people like that! The direction by Peter Weir ("The Truman Show," "Dead Poets Society") is praiseworthy indeed, as nearly the entire film takes place on the open sea, and the guy actually had a real ship built for that reason. It is far more exhilarating to see actual people on an actual boat on the actual ocean than it is to see them computer-generated, or to have scenes shot in water tanks on studio lots. Where trickery has been used, it's been integrated seamlessly with the real thing. As a viewer, it's a little thrilling to be part of a seafaring adventure, even if we're not really going anywhere. All in all I say that this is time at the cinema well spent and you should definately go and see it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Peter Weir, a director whose work I have often admired, has done a wonderful job with this material, delivering the best evocation of life aboard a 19th century war ship ever put on film.  The quality of the production and the seemless blending of real sailing vessels, models and CGI work cannot be over-praised.  It is marvelous work in set, cinematography and sound.<p>Couple all that with a fine cast, led with the conviction and commanding (pun intended) screen presence of Russell Crowe,and tell the crackling good tale of a deadly game of cat-and-mouse played on the high seas, and you have a wonderful adventure filled with humor, action and suspense.  They got it right in all departments.<p>A straight-ahead action/adventure drama, Weir and company have produced a first rate film that stays within its period and material, lightly touching on the themes of honor and duty, without the heavy-handed, oblique references to our own times found in The Last Sumarai.  Makes us believe we are witnessing life in another time, with very different living conditions, and different notions of purpose and duty.  No extraneous material was tossed in (a romance for instance) and they play it straight.  Well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Do you feel you are missing films thanks to your local Cineplex, which only features the most high-profile projects, and therefore excludes independent features? Or do you ever feel that by taking a weekend or so off from the movies that you missing some great films? And then you hear you friends chatting about them, it makes the already bad situation even worse? Many can lay claim to being in that very situation, missing out on noting-worthy independent and less commercial films that eventually found their way to be acknowledged by the Motion Picture Academy at the 76th Annual Academy Awards in February 2004, while others weren't quite so lucky. Such note-worthy features that failed to receive recognition include Bad Santa, Phone Booth and The Singing Detective. This isn't to say that nominated projects such as Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and Lost in Translation aren't worthy of acknowledgment, far from it. It is to say this one thing in Hollywood has yet to change: The bigger the studio, the bigger the trophy case will be.<p>The story is based on the tenth novel, "The Far Side of the World" in the "Master and Commander" series by Patrick O'Brian, who wrote twenty installments of the high-seas adventure series until his death in January 2000. The feature starts off in 1806 - Napoleon has proclaimed himself emperor of France after a failed attempt on his life and from there wages a military campaign which conquers Italy, Genoa, Vienna, and most of Austria and Germany. The Third Coalition, which consisted of Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Sweden, has all but been decimated by severe defeats on land, thus leaving Britain and its advanced naval sea power as the only thing standing in the way of Napoleon and total victory over Europe. One of Britain's most impressive ships is the HMS Surprise, captained by the ambitious and commanding Jack Aubrey, who travels the world with his friend Stephen Maturin, who is also the ship's doctor. Along the Eastern coast of South America, Aubrey and his crew are ambushed by the French frigate, the Acheron. Though they escape in relatively one piece, the ship is deeply weakened and there is talk of turning back home to England. Faced with the fate of his crew and his country in his hand, Jack Aubrey must show true leadership by putting everything on the line and making quick decisions, no matter the cost. The story for Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the few films out there that embroils itself deeply in a certain time period of history but doesn't require its audience to have such extensive knowledge of events that it alienates certain demographics. Though the film doesn't demand background knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you go in with at least some idea of the events that the story surrounds itself with.<p>Though Master & Commander contains a rather large cast, few have actually made a name for themselves that they are easily recognizable by a majority of the movie-going audience but that doesn't matter so much in that only one person requires the audience's full attention, that being Russell Crowe. Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his performance in Gladiator and was nominated for A Beautiful Mind, was certainly worthy of at least a nomination with his commanding performance as Captain Jack Aubrey, in which he combines slight humor, enduring emotions, and dignified atmosphere that envelops the audience and keeps them focused with the actions on screen. Unfortunately, despite the film itself receiving ten nominations, the academy failed to recognize Crowe's amazing performance but that is easily forgettable as long as the audiences that watch this film get their money's worth of the film, thanks mostly to Crowe's engaging Jack Aubrey. And it's not just Crowe but the character's actions within the film itself ... the fact that he darts across the deck of the ship in an attempt to be almost everywhere at once, his ability to be charming and eloquent while playing his violin while being forceful and compelling in battle, and sticking to his guns despite certain opposition and small consequences that occur because of that decision.<p>Overall, Leadership, patriotism, and a true sense of responsibility and duty, all of which are desperately needed amongst a certain portion of the American people today, take center stage even away from Crowe's most commanding role to date. The most astonishing thing Peter Weir and his follow filmmakers have been able to do, besides elegantly and tastefully poking fun at the French, is to create a story that is slow and lumbering at times but not so much so that it results in a boring and lusterless feature, in fact Master & Commander is quite the opposite. It successfully keeps the audience members at the edge of their seats not only for the action occurring on screen but by keeping them in utter anticipation of events yet to unfold in the film as well. A beautifully mastered musical score, created by Christopher Gordon, Iva Davies and Richard Tognetti, keeps the historical time period in the context of the occurring actions in slower portions of the film while still engaging the audience with a rousing complement to the battle sequences. But the film's most powerful quality is its message of enduring leadership and dedication to one's country despite nearly impossible odds and the cost of friendship and life appearing to be worth more then the end result. The United States faces that exact challenge today but as the Jack Aubrey discovers, there is no more important value in life then a devotion to one's country and the commanding leadership that drives not only the crew but the heart and soul of one's country as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>Master and Commander is a film based on the naval book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393325172">Master and Commander (Movie Tie-In Edition)</a> by Patrick O'Brian, featuring Commander Jack Aubrey during the Napoleonic Wars, as her pursues the French ship - Acheron.  Although it is based on the book, fans of the series should not expect a close film adaptation, as the movie is very different from the plot of the book (although it does retain some of its themes). Not only is this a great movie, but it is a fantastic DVD.  One thing you really notice is the outstanding picture and audio transfer that made it to this disc.  Even on my small 30" TV it felt like I was watching this in the theater again.  If you have a DTS capable DVD player, you'll really appreciate the Bruckheimer soundtrack.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are where it really stands out.  This thing is packed to the brim with extras.  And I'm talking about quality extras, not a bunch of "music video" or "upcoming trailers" fluff to fill up the disc.  The extras are all entertaining, and fairly lengthy.  The shortest one on here is the HBO First Look, which is still 25 minutes long.  I almost enjoyed watching the extras as much as the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This isn't quite an updating of MOBY DICK.  It lacks the metaphysical and religious elements, but just as Ahab is pursing his white whale, so does Capt. &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey pursue the French fighting ship Acheron, which is larger, better gunned, and faster than his own H.M.S. Surprise.  This is not a deep movie.  It is not, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, a morality tale.  It is simply an adventure yarn, but as such, it is one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long while.  The movie stars Russell Crowe as Aubrey, and while this isn't one of the more challenging roles he has played, he did his usual stellar job.  Paul Bettany has the second lead as Aubrey's close friend, classical music partner, and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The rest of the cast (including Billy Boyd who I saw earlier today as Pippin in RETURN OF THE KING) is uniformly excellent and makes a fine ensemble cast.  There is one other costar, and that is the ship used to portray the H.M.S. Surprise.  They really went all out in making a perfect recreation of a late 18th century frigate.  I kept thinking about the gigantic number of ropes that seemed to be required to make the ship functional.  <p>This is a chase movie.  There is little or no preface and build up to the action.  We are immediately told that the assignment for the Surprise is to find and capture or sink the French ship the Acheron.  The rest of the film consists either the two ships engaging one another, or the Surprise chasing the Acheron.  The substance of the film beyond that consists entirely of the relations between the various members of the crew, with the exception of a trip to the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin, as a naturalist, gets to glimpse the animals that Charles Darwin would make so much of only a couple of decades later on the Beagle.  Apart from some TV documentaries, this is the only movie I can ever remember having seen that was actually shot on location in the Galapagos Islands, and it was, moreover, the only parts of the film shot on dry land.<p>Some serious film buffs might turn their noses up at this film, because it doesn't try to do anything but entertain, but it does that so well, that I would suggest that they think about nose jobs.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>In ".L.A. Confidential", Russell Crowe was the cop with  the dark and tragic past who found love in an unlikely place. In his Oscar-winning turn in "Gladiator" he showed us that man cannot live by bread and circuses alone. In "A Beautiful Mind", he takes the audience on a bizarre journey between genius and madness, and now, in this seafaring epic to which Peter Weir gives a surprisingly lighthanded direction, based on the novels<br />by Patrick O'Brian, Crowe lends his formidable stance to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey as he leads the crew of HMS Surprise in a campaign against the French ship Acheron in 1805.<br /> As the story commences, we view the British ship on the glistening waters off the coast of Brazil. The pre-dawn calm is shattered by the sound of the Acheron's cannonfire.<br /> Soon, the audience bears witness to the poignancy of lost innocence, graphic surgeries at sea, and the general claustrophobic conditions of a battleship in the early 19th century. A viewer can almost smell the stench, taste the awful food, and feel directly in the presence of both the lesser and greater of two weevils.<br /> The monotony is broken up with singing by the crew members, upperclassmen as well as underlings, and occassionally the elegant sound of Aubrey's violin as it mingles with the cello played by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (a role in which Crowe is reunited with  his 'Beautiful Mind' co-star, Paul Bettany)on a duet or two. As Aubrey's friend, the more analytical<br />Maturin provides a stablizing influence on the Captain.<br /> The camaraderie among the men deepens during Aubrey's dinnertime anecdotes, and outrageously bad puns as he loosens up a little while slightly inebriated.<br /> But the astute captain is firm and consistant in running his ship.  The film drives home the point that the young boys who served (personified by the angelic Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney) were not coddled because of their tender ages, and were made to grow up quickly in an era that had less respect for childhood.<br /> Viewers follow the crew through tragedies caused by natural or man-made disasters, and they also receive psychological<br />profiles of men who are forced to serve in such confining conditions.<br /> Aubrey often faces some wrenching dilemmas, but after many years at sea, never wavers in his certainty of whatever course of action he chooses. He spends a good bit of onscreen time  bestriding the deck with eyes that narrow and a perfect Cupid's bow mouth twisting into a scowl of determination during battle. A lot of the drama that cannot be expressed in words is expressed in close-ups  of Crowe's gracefully oval-shaped visage. When speaking in a jesting or slightly jesting manner, his large, deep-set  eyes-- which can never decide between emerald and opalescence--widen, and grow round as if he were daft.But he is mostly staid and stoic although we do see his delight in his work as he climbs up to and down from the highest heights of his ship to be rewarded with a more panoramic view of the ocean with upperclassman James D'Arcy at his side.<br /> Occassionally the men serving under him share his delight, and are relieved from months of confinement at sea when they weigh anchor in the Galapagos Islands where Dr. Maturin does his naturalist research and the crew play cricket as a respite from their duties. There is a sense of gentleness and serenity  brought on by the  beautiful Oscar winning-cinematography of the curious seals, tortoises, and other creatures as they receive a rare visit from humans. In a few brief moments the maimed Lord Blakeley has a chance to be a child as he roams about joyously in loose clothing as an assistant to the recently injured Maturin.<br /> Soon enough the pursuit of the Acheron is resumed. But the trip to the Galapagos results in Aubrey's gaining insight on how to lure and overtake the enemy ship. Strangely, the film's battle scenes didn't strike me as too intense, and while this film has its inevitably  dark and brooding moments, the lighter moments compliment and compensate for them quite nicely. There is a very stirring moment when Aubrey finally  views the corpse of his mortal enemy. Perhaps he feels some satisfaction...But how young and handsome his rival looks even in death. One wonders what his story was and how hard Aubrey had to try to suppress any feeling of common humanity as he accepted the French Captain's sword in surrender.<br /> Suppression of any such feelings may not have been too difficult when we see the high price of victory, laid out in sewn-up hammocks on the deck of the British ship...Men and boys of all ages in whom we've invested a few hour's time...The loss of sage advice of the elderly seamen, and the permanently halted ambition of the young men are dramatically emphasized as we view them lined up, pale and still, awaiting their final journey...<br /> But soon life aboard HMS Surprise resumes its normalcy, and when a piece of misinformation is revealed to Aubrey the merry pursuit of duty continues and as the crew go to quarters, we are left with a stringed duet to remember them by.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>While most movies depicting the rigors of war and battle these days focus on either the glory of heroism or the gore of wounds inflicted, MASTER AND COMMANDER focuses instead on a more realistic aspect. That is to say it combines both of these depictions of war, never truly making one or the other seem the way it was. And I believe that that is what it would actually boil down to; a combination of the physical and emotional scars of war as well as the admiration of men of courage.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is in command of the H.M.S. Surprise with instructions to ferret out the Acheron, a French ship that has been wreaking havoc off the coast of South America. With a hardy crew and a combination of battle scarred and fresh faced officers, they set out to do the task they were assigned.<br /><br />But rather than wait till half way through the film to have these two adversaries confront one another, the film nearly opens with a full blown sea battle. But this one is unlike most offered in films from the past. The glowing heroics of jumping from ship to ship, the always missing cannonballs, the smiling faces are replaced with a more realistic atmosphere.<br /><br />The Surprise is caught off guard and pelted with cannon fire, ripping the ship apart. The battle is not so much fought using guns and swords as it is using tactics and maneuvering. A combination of these two (as well as the fog bank from which the Acheron was able to launch its attack) and the ship and crew are saved. Broken but not yet destroyed, Aubrey and his crew set out to find the Acheron while making repairs as they go.<br /><br />With this adrenaline rush completed for the viewer, we are now offered a glimpse into the real life that was found at sea. The daily routine of making sure the ship was taken care of, the talking between the ships crew that eventually leads to the death of one of the officers, the camaraderie of the crew who would follow their captain to hell and back and yet would never consider sharing more than a cursory glance at the officers. These were two separate classes brought together for a common cause, but that never made them friends.<br /><br />And yet when a kind word or situation presents itself, it is offered. The deeds and misdeeds of those on board bring about a closeness between this group and they rise to the task before them.<br /><br />Not only does this story present itself (more in visual deed than in word), the observations of the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) towards his friend and commander are seen. The pair shares an interest in classical musicianship and an interest in the crew. But while Aubrey feels the need for battle and to rid the seas of his countries enemy, Maturin takes the more intellectual approach, voicing his opinion that rest is needed, that time should be taken rather than pursue the Acheron. Some might see this as a metaphor for the recent battles in Congress over the war in Iraq. That could be said. But I saw this more as the question that all men ask before launching into war. And the answers are never simple nor easily made.<br /><br />There is an underlying complexity to the character of Aubrey that Crowe brings forth. While he longs to face his enemy and to win, he also cares deeply for his ship and for its crew. His desire to win may cause him to make a wrong decision now and then, but deep down he would never put his men in the face of danger if he were not convinced he could save them.<br /><br />A final face off is inevitable but to reveal who wins would not only be a tremendous spoiler but would take away the effect it has on the viewer. Suffice to say that the movie truly never quite has an ending. But in a good way, not a "here we go again" one.<br /><br />The movie depicts the life of a sailor in these times in more realistic fashion than any movie I've seen before. While we are usually given old sea faring gents, this one shows us a combination of men who have no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure. The range of ages was exactly that in those days.<br /><br />While a single hole in a ship meant a fast sinking vessel in most movies, this one shows that repairs could be and were made. The ships were not that easy to down. But it also allows us to see the damage caused by the cannonballs that slammed hard into the ship, inflicting more human damage than they could to the ship.<br /><br />While a sobering look at sea warfare, the movie also has its lighter moments. It also offers a testament to the human spirit as well. But most importantly it offers us something sorely lacking in today's world, something that has bothered me tremendously. It offers us a hero. A steadfast man capable of making mistakes but owning up to them and then rallying his troops to face off against a common enemy. The world lacks heroes these days. Perhaps we will only find them in film. But at least a new generation will have the chance to have that hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World" depicts the adventures of the HMS Surprise, a British frigate trolling the Atlantic during the Napoleonic Wars.  The ship's captain, "Lucky" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is ordered to track down and engage the French frigate, Acheron.  One foggy night, the Surprise happens upon the Acheron, with full out battle following.  The Surprise is forced to retreat, and a genuinely exciting game of cat and mouse between the two ships ensues for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Clunky title notwithstanding, "Master and Commander" is a truly superb action film.  I have never been a fan of movies about 19th century seafaring.  The battle scenes are too often both static and confusing.  However, Peter Weir is more than up to the task here; he's always been an outstanding director, but this film is among his best work.  The chase scenes and ensuing battles are suspenseful and fully engaging.  Weir also manages to infuse a great deal of humanity - each time a member of the Surprise is killed or even injured, it's heart-breaking.  Fortunately, he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for directing, his fourth.<br /><br />The Oscar nominated script is beautiful but never cloying, with wonderful acting contributing to its success.  Crowe and Bettany (as Dr. Stephen Maturin) brilliantly portray the complex relationship between their characters - close friends who respect but also challenge each other.  The film is, of course, based on two novels from the esteemed series by Patrick O'Brian.  I have not read any of the Aubrey-Maturin books, so I cannot attest to how accurate the film is.  However, clearly a viewer need not have read the books to enjoy the film.  Incidentally, I immediately purchased the first book in the series and hope to tackle it soon.  Finally, every technical aspect of "Master and Commander" is exceptional - the score, cinematography, costumes, and so forth.  All these elements add up to a lush modern classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander" is a film I never tire of watching; it is a grand and glorious sea epic, with examples of courage and bravado, and a tumultuous battle sequence, as well as a film with great depth and meaning. The details of "this little wooden world" that is the English ship, as it chases a French man-of-war around the coast of South America in 1805, through the stormy Cape Horn, and finally landing in the Galapagos Islands, are astounding.  One gets the feeling of what it must have been like for the seamen in such close quarters for months on end. This is one of director Peter Weir's very finest works, in a career that has been replete with great stories told brilliantly on film.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Jack Aubrey. His charismatic and virile presence fills the screen, and he is the perfect model of a heroic 19th century sea warrior. I always admire how Crowe subtly uses his voice to fit the part, a talent that is rare in actors these days. Equally excellent is Paul Bettany as the ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin (Bettany will be remembered from his part in "The Beautiful Mind," the film that garnered Crowe an Oscar), and the interaction between these 2 extraordinary actors make for some memorable scenes. Another notable performance comes from Max Pirkis (recently seen as Octavian in the HBO series "Rome"), as the young Midshipman Blakeney.<br /><br />The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a marvel, especially the scenes in the Galapagos Islands, with its unique landscapes and strange creatures, and the soundtrack is a delight, using many lovely classical pieces, among them Bach's Cello Suite # 1, and Corelli's Concerto Grosso # 6. I recently viewed the Full Screen Edition of this film, which focuses on the expressiveness of the acting with its larger close-ups, and found it gave an added dimension to the film; I would recommend buying the Widescreen Edition, and perhaps renting the Full Screen Edition for additional viewing. "Master and Commander" is one of the most mature, satisfying, and engrossing films in recent years, not to be missed by anyone who enjoys adventure, along with a well-written script, intelligent characters, and the finest acting. Total running time is 138 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>This movie does know what it's trying to do...and does it quite well. The reviewer below seems to want a simple story and complains that the movie is misguided in its purpose. I strongly disagree.

Russell Crowe's bold command is often challenged by his friend and ship's surgeon played by Paul Bettany.<br /><br /> The film is mostly accurate as to details on sailing vessels of the 19th century as well as the types of tasks sailors had to undertake. The film shows that sailors were not only hoisting sails on ships but that each ship had specialists on board to tend to various matters: carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, soldiers, etc. The film also accurately captures what tactics and battle conditions would have been like during that period of time. The only inaccuracy is where one ship is in pursuit of the other and the ship in front is blowing smoke: if one pays attention, one will see the smoke blowing back against the wind and towards the ship in pursuit. This presents a physical impossibility as the smoke would have to be blowing in the same direction as the wind and not against it.<br /><br /> Despite some technical inaccuracies, the film is exquisite in every way. The film is has good character development and the plot is well paced; I didn't feel the time pass. The film is rated PG-13 but the violence is not so light as to make it childish. I strongly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Master and Commander is an engaging and dramatic experience that shouldn't be missed. Russel Crowe (Gladiator) is wonderful as the captain of a ship that's trying to track down a dangerous French warship. The warship attacks his ship in an excellent battle in the beginning of the film. After that Crowe is determined to stop it. Pail Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, A Knights Tale) is also fantastic as the ships doctor and Crowe's bestfriend. The ship battles are excellent and entertaining but there's not really a lot of that. There's a lot more dialogue and scenes where we get to know the crew of the ship. Bettany surprisingly makes a lot of this movie his own. He has great scenes with Crowe and also touching scenes with a boy on ship who he takes under his wing and teaches about animals and nature. Some people will think there's not enough action but it's still an excellent film. When there is action it's very good, the scenery is very nice, directing great and Bettany gives what should've been an oscar nominated performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>As a former naval officer I remember sitting through a showing of the movie "Twelve O'Clock High" in our leadership classes.  The movie was used to demonstrate contrasting leadership styles. "Master and Commander," if it had been available all those decades ago, would have been an excellent movie to demonstrate the the calm, calculating thought, often accentuated with a smile, that is required in a leader when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  Russel Crowe's Jack Aubrey demonstrates that trait beautifully.<br /><br />Leadership aside though, the movie's attention to seafaring detail is phenomenal.  Although I was part of the modern Navy, the DTS soundtrack of the movie captures the constant intrusions of sounds at sea; all the squeaks, clanks, snores, footsteps, splashes, wisps and howls of the wind are an ever present character in the film.  Of particular note was the use of the "chipset," a simple device that used knotted line to accurately give the ship's speed in "knots."  Also, though easy to miss, there is a scene while the ship is attempting to "round the Horn" at the tip of South America, where it shows a sailor using the "head," the nautical term for the toilet on the ship.  If you look carefully as the camera pans from the front to the back of the ship, you'll see a sailor with his pants around his ankles sitting on a holed plank off the front or "head" of the ship.  For obvious reasons the head was placed as far as possible from the captain's quarters, the area at the far aft (back) of the ship.<br /><br />Finally, the acting in the movie is exceptional, the battle scenes chaotic, and the cannonball shots impressive. You almost want to duck as the cannonshots approach and tear through the ship.  Whether you buy the DTS encoded DVD or Blu-ray, the battle scenes will impressively exercise your home theater system.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Based on author Patrick O'Brian's series of books, set during the Napoleonic Wars. It tells of the story of the H.M.S. Surprise and it's Captain, "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. The movie is an excellent adventure on the high seas but could have been epic. The movie picks up in the middle of the ocean with a preface of the ship's orders. From there they're suddenly attacked by a superior enemy. When the ship and crew are badly injured, Aubrey is torn between duty and friendship as he pursues a dangerous chase across oceans, to capture his enemy.  The movie's acting and historical accuracy are it's strongest points. Crowe and Bettany are a joy to watch play off each other. The action and cinematography are amazing as well. It could easily get 5 stars but it just feels like there was more story to tell. This movie belongs in any collector's library.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and fantastic audio make this a blu-ray winner. The movie is shot mostly in dark and fog so it is tough to say this is a DEMO DISC, but those who know will see how beautiful it is. The special features from the collector's edition are nowhere to be found and is the only drawback. FINAL VERDICT: Keep the collector's edition you bought but DEFINITELY UPGRADE!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Imagine a movie that lasts more than two hours and during that time only shows the confrontation of two ships near the coast of South America. Sounds like a very boring premise, right? Wrong! Director Peter Weir has done an outstanding job in creating an exciting atmosphere and hooking the viewer throughout the duration of the film. <p>It is April 1805 and Napoleon has only one last barrier to cross in order to rule over Europe: the British Fleet. Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) is the captain of the Surprise, an English ship sailing in the north coast of Brazil, when the Acheron, a French ship that outclasses them in speed and weaponry, attacks them. The Surprise, which was surprised by the Acheron, was saved by miracle of the fog, were they lost themselves preventing their doom. Now Lucky Jack has to decide whether to return home for repairs and reinforcements, or go after the aggressor and try to defeat this dangerous enemy. Obviously, Jack chooses the latter path, even against the advice of some of his nearest officers in rank. <p>One of the aspects that make this movie extremely interesting is that it reveals the way of living aboard a battle ship in the beginning of the nineteenth century. For example, the audience gets to see the relationship forged between these men and the rules of honor that determine their conduct. Among these rules, we can observe that the value of friendship is paramount. <p>This production of epic magnitude delivers what it promises: action, glorious settings, impeccable performances and a nail biting chase between to ships that become archrivals. In some aspects, the relationship between Lucky Jack and the Acheron reminds me of the one between Captain Ahab and Moby Dick. Finally, if you ever watched the America's Cup and rejoiced in the strategy that it entails, you will find yourself pleased with the amount of strategy involved in this battle too.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Those who enjoyed the various Horatio Hornblower films (one of which stars Gregory Peck) will especially appreciate this adaptation of material from a series of novels written by Patrick O'Brian. Directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe as Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, Master and Commander examines life aboard a British warship during the Napoleonic Wars as it encounters and is battered by a French privateer, the Acheron, and then pursues its enemy from the coast of Brazil southward around Cape Horn to The Galapagos Island until the final, inevitable and decisive encounter. The acting is first-rate, beginning with Crowe but including Paul Bettany (who previously appeared with Crowe in A Perfect Mind) as ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin, and Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney, one of several midshipmen aboard H.M.S. Surprise. Weir brilliantly juxtaposes violent battle scenes at sea with quiet, at times tender moments aboard ship. There is also a fascinating sequence during which Dr. Maturin and two youthful companions leave the ship to gather scientific specimens until unexpectedly....<p>The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, receiving one (Russell Boyd for cinematography). Given the competition, it probably did not deserve others but suggesting that in no way damns with faint praise. (Praises with faint damnation?) This is a delightful, stirring, and on occasion moving account of a charming and resourceful captain and his loyal crew who, when necessary, summon exceptional courage with style and grace. I was surprised to learn how self-sufficient such ships must be, especially in terms of repairing damage resulting from combat. Because all of the film is set aboard the British warship, I also realized how confining, if not claustrophobic it must have seemed at times to crew members. On occasion, I did have a problem catching some of the dialogue but that may be more indicative of my hearing ability (or loss thereof) than of the quality of the soundtrack.  This was an especially entertaining film which I plan to see again soon, joined by a large bowl of hot buttered popcorn and a cold beverage or two.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>... MASTER AND COMMANDER presents a far more realistic, meaningful, and interesting portrayal of life on the high seas than PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN.  Spend your cinema time wisely, and invest a few hours with Russell Crowe and his maties in THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.<p>'Nuff said.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (Gladiator) commands the seven seas in the exceptional war drama "Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World". Set in the early 19th Century during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) and the crew of the British warship HMS Surprise embark on a mission to intercept and destroy the French privateer Acheron. After narrowly escaping their first encounter with heavy damages and casualties, Captain Aubrey continues the pursuit of his powerful adversary into the Pacific Ocean. Directed by Peter Weir (Witness & The Truman Show), "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is an outstanding well-crafted epic movie that successfully combines great storytelling and strong human drama. The visual effects are terrific. The climatic sea battle sequence is thrilling and very entertaining. Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany deliver great performances. "Master and Commander" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release of "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" misses its mark. The 2003 war drama is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the DVD but unfortunately it isn't a solid choice to show off your High-Def television. With its fine clarity and thunderous bass, the DTS-HD audio is the real winner in this release. Its only extras are six deleted scenes, a pop-up trivia track and the film's theatrical trailer. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice. Overall, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" gets a "B".</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Based on Patrick O'Brian's renowned seafaring adventure novels, Peter Weir's "Master" delivers an intimate, seemingly accurate portrayal of rugged life on the high seas, limited in creature comforts but rich in camaraderie. You can practically smell the salt air and taste the rum. Crowe makes a commanding but compassionate hero, and his friendship with ship doctor and scientist Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who'd like Aubrey to slow down so he can collect samples of unknown species, provides some interesting character by-play between the full-bore battle sequences. In all, a flavorful, bracing adventure, suitable for family viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,&quot; directed by Peter Weir, tells the rousing story of HMS Surprise, an English warship sailing around South America during the Napoleonic era.  The ship's captain (played by Russell Crowe) engages in a battle of wits, wills, and firepower with a rival captain during the perilous sea trek.<p>This is a vivid, exciting tale of naval warfare, but it's also a satisfying and moving portrayal of a unique community: the company of a warship.  The film is full of stirring action scenes, but it is equally rich in the details of the men's everyday life: their food, shipboard entertainment, naval tradition, etc.  It's a sweaty, muscular portrait that really puts you in the midst of this fascinating world.<p>Weir gets superb performances from the large ensemble cast.  Crowe won my heart as the captain: he portrays a man who is tough and witty, but also humane and reasonable.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, both a loyal friend and verbal sparring partner for the captain; it's a marvelously realized relationship.  The rest of the cast rises to the high mark set by these excellent performers; Max Pirkis in particular shines as a courageous young midshipman.<p>There are some intense scenes of violence and combat surgery.  But this material is not gratuitous, and is handled with care by Weir, who never loses sight of his characters' humanity.  And the film is also about much more than war; it's also about exploring a distant land and seeing wondrous sights.  There are nice moments of humor to balance out the film's serious themes of military discipline, ethics and tactics.  Overall, M&amp;C is a rousing adventure story, told with heart.  As a Navy veteran myself, I'd like to thank and commend all involved with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain and Franch were mortal enemies fighting for dominance of Europe by land and sea. England was threatened with invasion for the first time in three hundred years. The only thing protecting the isle was the Royal Navy. This is the backdrop of Master and Commander who fights for England with his brave crew and stout ship against France on the far side of the world.<br /><br />Russell Crowe heads a first rate cast that replays a genre that hasn't been seen since Gregory Peck played the title role of "Horatio Hornblower." From a consistent script and story, one gets the impression of what life was like on the high seas during this time and how quickly, silently, and deadly mortal danger could arise. There was no sonar or radar save those in one's sight, hearing and judgment. And the fog could be one's enemy as much as it could be a friend.<br /><br />Besides the acting, the music lent perfectly to the story, and one can recognize Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 played by Yo Yo Ma. My favorite was Boccherini's La Musica Notturna Della providing the background for captain's order to beat to "General Quarters."<br /><br />As soon as you can, steer a course and set sail to your nearest store and purchase "Master and Commander..." It's one of those stories that seems to get better with each viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>A friend of mine and I have a tradition of seeing every film that has an Oscar? nomination before the Academy Awards? are aired, so we've been blitzkrieging the cinemas in our area, trying to see them all. I am so glad that &quot;Master and Commander&quot; was nominated, because I'm not sure if I would have otherwise bothered to see it. What a fantastic film!<p>As someone who has had 3-near drowning experiences and who makes it a priority to not only avoid the water, but films involving water where people might drown, I am not much into seafaring films. Nothing about living on a stinky boat for months on end without modern medical care appeals to my interest... but this film had me on the edge of my seat. I was so quickly drawn into this film; it was more than just a story, but truly an experience. I felt as though I was a member of the crew of the HMS Surprise in 1805.<p>The HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is on a mission to intercept the French warship, the &quot;Archeron.&quot;  The resourceful crew ranges from elderly sea salts probably in their late 60s, to the youngest crewmember who looks to be all of 12 or 13 years old.<p>Their first encounter with the Archeron in heavy fog is quick and deadly. Many crewmen on the Surprise are killed or injured, and the youngest of the crew, Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), receives a broken arm in the battle, which results in amputation without the luxury of modern medicine or anesthetic. Pirkis's performance is breathtaking. Expect to see this young man many more times in the future. The ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany - Crowe's co-star from &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;), is a loyal, but opinionated friend of Captain Aubrey. He serves as Aubrey's friend, motivator and muse, but he does put their friendship to the test on more than one occasion.<p>While there is blood and violence, the most memorable feeling is one of being overwhelmed and engaged by the experience. The &quot;F-word&quot; was used once, but other than that, there is no real foul language, nudity or suggestive scenes and I believe the PG-13 rating is appropriate.<p>During their first encounter, the Surprise must limp away in dense fog to escape with their lives, and although they hit the Archeron with cannon balls and musket fire, they hardly raise a splinter on the larger, faster, thicker hulled ship. Dr. Maturin claims it is pride, but Aubrey insists that it is duty and loyalty to England that is driving him to engage the Archeron again... a ship that appears to outgun them and outclass them in every way.<p>Aubrey proves that he is a brilliant battle commander and manages to outwit the Archeron captain, who appears to be his equal in brinksmanship and cunning.<p>Their Pacific journey forces them to the coast of South America to trade tools for livestock and foodstuffs... and many of the crew pick up a parrot or a squirrel monkey along the way. The ship is driven south in heavy snow and ice, then north again to a windless, rainless, utterly hot and humid region of the see that drives the men crazy.  They turn on a less-than-capable crewmate who does not take the pressure well, as they believe he is the personification of the Biblical Jonah and must be toss overboard to save them from God's wrath. They go the Galapagos Islands to repair damage to their ship from another encounter with the Archeron. There are so many exquisite, incredible things along their journey, it is truly breath taking. Little things that would have been omitted in a lesser film, such as the attention to detail in repairing the ship, including chiseling and patching up the maiden gracing their stern, make this a film worth savoring.<p>It has been a long time since I have felt so &quot;in&quot; a film - I could almost smell the salt air and feel the sea spray on my face. The friend I saw the film with reported feeling the same about this cinematic experience. While seafaring voyages do little to evoke my interest, I was totally engaged in every aspect and moment of this film - less like a voyeur, but rather a crewmember in the shadows, observing and participating. This is how a film should be made. <p>Director Peter Weir is no stranger to filmmaking. He has directed such hits as &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; &quot;Dead Poets Society,&quot; and &quot;Witness,&quot; but this is clearly his masterpiece.  If you've been putting off this film for any reason, do not delay. Seeing it on the big screen is preferable - being surrounded by the empty calm sea, or deluged in waves, helps to enhance the experience that much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Even better than the novel on which it is based, this rousing period adventure traces the nautical adventures of Lucky Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew.  Near flawless special effects combine with a solid story, cinematography, soundtrack and performances...most efficiently led by the great Russell Crowe.  The supporting performances and production design are also beyond reproach, especially an Oscar-worthy turn by Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor.<br /><br />A wonderful movie to enjoy.  Too bad there are no special bonus features to compliment the great movie.  Available for a low price, so who's to complain!?</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World, is the story of action and adventure, tough choices to be made, and a man's quest to end the threat of the high seas by any means necessary, whatever the cost may be.<br /><br />Russel Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, known to his sailors and fellow ship officers as "Lucky" for his relative luck in the face of battle. One example would have to be a bank of fog that his ship retreats into after being ambushed by a french ship during the time of war.<br /><br />The year is 1804, and France and England are at war as Napolean is conquering Europe one country after another. Only England's fleet of warships stands in Napoleans way of ruling the seas, so the tensions and battles at sea between different ships is at an all time high. Aubrey has been given the command to sink or capture a French ship named the Acheron, before it sinks any British ships.<br /><br />The whole story isn't just about playing a cat and mouse game between Aubrey and the French captain. Aubrey's crew start to wonder if the French ship is some type of phantom ship after numerous sneak attacks lead them to question if there is a curse on one of the sailors, like the famous story of Jonah. Aubrey must keep control of the ship but at the same time he still needs time to keep the men happy at the same time.<br /><br />There are also several other small stories in this movie, from the ship reaching the Galapagos islands and all the men looking at the strange creatures they never saw in their lives, to a storm at sea and a man being washed overboard, some great action scenes with just mother nature pounding on the ship. There's even a scene where the crew builds a floating device that reseambles a ship at nighttime to lure the french phantom ship away after yet another sneak attack.<br /><br />We don't see much of the French crew during the movie, and 95% of the story takes place on the British ship. However you do see the respect Aubrey has for the French captain, and he is determined to prove he is better of the two during their chasing games back and forth as both ships manage to get behind the other during several ambush attacks.<br /><br />The acting is superb, especially by Russel Crowe and the ship's doctor. The action scenes during the cannon fights and the climactic ending battle are well worth checking out. Emotional near the ending as men die for what they fought to protect, both on the French and British side.<br /><br />The extras have:<br /><br />Some behind the scenes shots of the movie and subtitles in English and Spanish. The ending of the story itself has a twist near the end, see if you can spot it before the characters in the story unveil the truth. Highly Reccomended.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>with its beginning that pulled me in and then the end where it all blasted out. good battle sequences and great acting especially by Russell Crowe, hes a dynamite actor, an actor ahead of his game id say. beautiful and dizzingy camera shots and directed with ease by Peter Weir(Witness, The Truman Show). though there are some predictable parts like when Paul Bettany(the doctor) trys to find his bird and I knew the french ship was gonna be there. other parts like when the doctor got shot was a surprise. and what the heck is this I read about this is a sequel to Pirates Of The Carribean..its not people and its not a ripoff either.

The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Ships, Battles, and swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, it is a movie worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>In 'Master and Commander,'  Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey of the HMS Surprise.  Aubrey has received orders to take the Surprise and her crew to the South Atlantic, off the coast of South America to pursue the Acheron, a French vessel.  The Acheron's captain has been given a letter of marque to act as a privateer for the French, and is commandeering British ships as prizes.<br /><br />Aubrey's ship is not the only 'Surprise' in the movie.  Right off the bat, the French ship surprises Aubrey and his men, causing them to flee the French ship.  The attack leads the crew to dub the Acheron 'The Phantom.'  We come to discover that the Acheron is a new type of vessel, constructed in a way that it is superior in design, speed, and firepower to the Surprise.<br /><br />The biggest surprise comes in the movies climax, as Aubrey and the crew of the Surprise engage the Acheron for the final time.  This is some of the finest naval warfare captured on film.  Few movies equal the cinematography of the clash between the two crews.  The only draw back to the scene is that it is often difficult to tell the two crews apart.  In addition, many of the characters have similar hair styles and costumes, so it is often confusing as to who was just stabbed, shot, or slew an enemy.<br /><br />After Russell Crowe, the character receiving the most attention is Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  Maturin is played by Paul Bettany.  Unlike the rest of the crew, Maturin's skills do not lie in combat or sailing, but in medicine and the natural sciences.  Much is made of his being a naturalist, and the lessons he gives to a young naval officer resound throughout the movie.  His character is a great foil for Aubrey as he is more conservative and thoughtful.<br /><br />'Master and Commander' is a very enjoyable film.  It falls just short of getting five stars because it borders on being just a bit too long.  In addition, portions of the film remind the observant viewer of 'Moby Dick' (substitute the Acheron for a whale) and 'Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner' (a large gull follows the ship and leads to some key scenes).  I haven't read the books, so I cannot discuss how the movie stacks up.  One last warning, there are some medical scenes after the first battle that the squemish would be best served by getting a friend to tell them whens it over.  I give this movie a good recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I think I tried the books, but they are not my cup of tea. I agree that the movie's main plot is simplistic. However, it is the acting, the relationships, and the subplots that make this movie soar for me. I think Crowe does a great job. There is a good supporting caste. Crowe displays well the inner turmoil over the hard decisions he has to make that affect the life of his crew. The sea is itself a character in the movie. The images of daily life on the sea are compelling as well. The battle scenes are done well. The strategies and subterfuge the opposing captains play on each other are enjoyable. The strategies are simple ones like you would use in Stratego rather than chess, but still fun. The relationship between the doctor and the captain is interesting. The behind-the-scenes options on the DVD are interesting as well. In its genre, the movie holds up well to the classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This film is a wonderful story taken from the novel's by Patrick O'Brian. One can think of other well-made classic maritime films such as Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, and my other favourite, Horatio Hornblower, starring Gregory Peck. These films will always be classics, as they have withstood the test of time, as Master and Commander will most certainly do in the future.<br /><br /> This high praise comes from the obvious, as this film is almost flawless in many respects, artistically, technically and its historical realism. However this unqualified praise really comes from the fact that my expectations before finally viewing the film were actually quite low. In fact, up until a few months ago, I had totally overlooked that Peter Weir was the film's director, and this man has proven himself to be one of the current greats in Hollywood. His past triumphs, such as Witness, staring Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was one of the top ten films made in the eighties. Considering my expectations were nothing to speak of, Master and Commander turned out to be a great surprise.<br /><br /> For the most part this film is a story about leadership, courage, tenacity, friendship, honour and loyalty. And this is all done in the film without having to resort to unnecessary sentimentalism or platitudes. Captain Jack Aubrey is the manifestation or epitome of all these virtues and more. What an inspiring character. Russell Crowe delivered a believable performance as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot;. Crowe has a tremendous amount of presence in front of the camera, which is the exact skill or gift necessary to play this particular character. If anything, most if not all the performances in this film were first rate.<br /><br /> The soundtrack, too, was appropriate for the film. As a classical music admirer and listener, for once I've been prompted to purchase the recording (which doesn't happen often) as well as the DVD to add to the library. Master and Commander is an &quot;all-rounder&quot; and will be a pleasure to watch many times over. A solid five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This is truly a masterful and commanding sea adventure in the style of the great old Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone movies from the 30s and 40s such as Captain Blood, or The Sea Wolf, with E.G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart. For those who are fans of "The Mountains of the Moon" with Patrick Bergen (although a land adventure in Africa) you'll know what I mean when I say that if you've been wanting a similar historical adventure in faraway places then this movie might be just what you're looking for. I really enjoyed "The Mountains of the Moon" and have always wished for more.<br /><br />I understand that the movie takes liberties with the original timeline and combines two O'Brian books, which has offended some fans, but as an adventure movie it comes off very well. Using a combination of CGI, big and small ship's models, historical footage, and on site filming, the movie's look and feel is as authentic as you could want.<br /><br />Add to that several dramatic sea battles and hand to hand (or more like sword to sword) deck engagements, and you have a rousing maritime adventure as good as anything from the old days of action and adventure flicks. The brief sojourn to the Galapagos Islands adds another dimension to this well done film. Fine acting by the whole cast and a more than competent script round out the film's many strengths. Overall, a great adventure film from the capable hands of Peter Weir and well worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>When movie magic is at its best, the viewer is immersed in the story, and believes everything portrayed on the screen.  Case in point:  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, Peter Weir's epic depiction of life at sea in the early 19th Century.  Here we find gritty authenticity where absolutely nothing is spared, from the suffocating stench of below decks, to the mirth and mayhem of the ship's officers dining together, to the brutality of hand-to-hand combat as one ship overtakes another.  It's all as believable as it is spellbinding, as we follow HMS 'Surprise' as it plays a cat-and-mouse game across two oceans with a vastly superior French frigate.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is the headliner playing Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a most approachable commander with a winning disposition paired with astonishing resolution; Captain Aubrey is going to take the French ship, dire consequences or no.  This often puts him at odds with the ship's surgeon and Jack's personal friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany); Maturin serves as a sort of barometer for the crew, and is allowed to be upfront and frank with the captain.  These exchanges create remarkable tension, as both men have unwavering mutual respect.  Meanwhile we're privy to the ongoing adventures of the 'Surprise' as it sails the Atlantic, rounds the Cape of South America, and heads into the immense waters of the Pacific; from battle to meatball surgery to topsails to camaraderie to rigid discipline to the sailors' infatuation with superstition.  The cast playing the crew is stellar, including Billy Boyd (who will always be known to me as Pippin).  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an engrossing and enchanting tale, enthusiastically recommended for all movie buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of those films that had me hooked from beginning to end. This isn't your typical Hollywood-style action-adventure. It's a very elaborate and very realistic "historical" film with tremendous details on costumes, art direction, and cinematography. The action scenes are spectacular, no slow-motion fights or unnecessary over-the-top music whatsoever. Performances from the entire cast are superb (jobs well done for Crowe, Bettany, Woodall, Boyd, etc.). The dialogue is solid gold, while the pacing of the film is just right. The baroque music is enjoyable, and the sound effects are first-rate. This is good stuff right here. I can easily recommend it to those who love swashbuckling adventures, historical epics, and human drama.<br /><br />Grade: 9.2/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent. This is a war film which is certainly worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.<br /><br />It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual.<br /><br />However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.<br /><br />This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about. One tip for those having trouble with some of the accents or naval terminology: put on the English subtitles. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself. I was so pumped to see this on Blu-Ray, but the transfer wasn't much better than the regular DVD, so save your money on that one.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD stars Russell Crowe as Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, master and commander of the 'HMS Surprise,' on war patrol during the first worldwide war of the Napoleonic era (1805). Crowe is perfectly cast as Aubrey, an intelligent, erudite captain who can both inspire and lead his men with fairness and firmness, only occasionally resorting to the knout.<br /><br />MASTER AND COMMANDER is gorgeously done, the ships are authentically recreated, and the atmosphere of the film never thins. For anyone familiar with the history of seafaring conditions in those days, the film is somewhat sparse in showing us the true underside of life before the mast on board a late eighteenth century/early 19th century British man-o'-war: A stinking, dirty, dark, dank, impossibly cramped and crowded space most often painted red to hide the bloodstains from work wounds, war wounds, and fights. Compared to the reality, the 'Surprise' might as well be the 'Mauretania,' but beyond this lapse, the film is an honest portrayal. Sailors, be they professional, military, or recreational, will love it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have derided this film as being "boring." It is not. However, a drawback of making accurate films about the Age of Sail is that a jack tar's life in those years was defined by backbreaking, repetitive daily labor altogether adding up to long stretches of ennui, punctuated by short, incredibly violent and bloody exchanges with the enemy. To be an honest portrayal, a film cannot find its way around this central fact.<br /><br />Captain Aubrey and his crew and ship, including his friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a surgeon and naturalist, are attacked by the French battle ship 'Acheron.' After being trounced, Captain Aubrey becomes as obsessed as Melville's Ahab with hunting down the adversary, and takes his vessel around Cape Horn, into the Southern Ocean, the Pacific, and to the Galapagos Islands to meet battle.<br /><br />While at the Galapagos, Maturin discovers dozens of new species of life and formulates a theory regarding the origin of these species, but the demands of the service call the 'Surprise' away before he can collect specimens or coalesce his ideas, leaving it to Darwin to do so not many years later.<br /><br />As the film closes, the 'Surprise' continues on her war patrol, leaving the door open for a sequel.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is probably the best movie ever made about life aboard an early 19th Century naval vessel. There is an epic storytelling quality here that is reminiscent of  classics like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai". It also has a grace and elegance not often seen in movies - epic or otherwise - these days. <p>Ironically, all these fine qualities may have limited its commercial appeal. The bulk is the movie is about the two main characters - Capt. Jack Aubrey [Russell Crowe] and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin [Paul Bettany] and their relationship with each other and with the rest of the crew. There are only two major battles scenes, which, while impressive, run only a few minutes each. <p>Capt. Aubrey is commander of the Surprise, a rather small and outdated British vessel. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and England is in danger of invasion by the French. Aubrey and crew are off the coast of Brazil, where they spot a very fast and modern French ship. Aubrey decides to pursue it, and the chase takes him all the way around the tip of South America to the Galapolos Islands off the coast of Chile. There, the final confrontation between the two vessels takes place.<p>Crowe and Bettany are superb as two friends whose differences make them perfect counterpoints. To those who are more into narrative than action, watching these two play off each other is the highlight of the movie. <p>"Master and Commander" is marvelous entertainment and quite possibly the best big studio movie of 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>This is one of those big movies that I would've dearly loved to have made it to the theaters to see but never found the time which is a bit of a personal disappointment as this film, I'm sure, would've been even that much better on the silver screen.  While this great film has it's glorious battle scenes, it is a film based not so much in big action sequences but more in the intelligent dialogue and narrative.  Few films have so aptly displayed what a harsh life sailors of this particular era lived as well as this film does.  Youthful dreams of such a life may have been deftly squashed for many by seeing the harsh realities displayed in this film.  Simply put, this film is well paced with an apt balance between intense battle scenes and almost an almost poetic script.<p>For many years now, Russell Crowe has displayed exceptional performances in several movies, showing that he has a wide range of acting abilities and this film is no exception to that as he brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life.  Paul Bettany's performance in this film is quite exceptional as well.  I believe the only other film I've seen him in was another Russell Crowe film in "A Beautiful Mind."  Clearly his future performances are to be looked forward to.  Another notable cast member is Billy Boyd, most well known for his role in "The Lord of the Rings" as Peregrin "Pippin" Took.  Although his role in this film is minor, he does stand out.<p>Director Peter Weir has had a long and storied career directing in Hollywood with such notable films as "Dead Poet's Society" and "Witness."  This film will certainly go down in the history books as one of his best.<p>The Premise:<p>The fate of the British Empire seemingly rests on the shoulders of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he commands a British Naval warship that is suddenly attacked by a much larger French warship that he's been given the mission to capture or destroy.  After his first fateful encounter with the behemoth he must repair his ship and embarks on a trip spanning two oceans to capture or destroy the French ship or die in the trying...<p>What follows from there is, as stated above, an extremely well made film that in its dialogue rings to a subtle but poignant tune and its action carries the weight of a big hitter.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Strangely enough, the Special Features for this film seem to be somewhat of an afterthought and few at that.

(I have gleaned that the fans of O'Brian's novels probably wouldn't be satisfied with ANY film version.) I can definitely say, however, that Weir rivets our attention from the very first seconds of this movie, taking us into the far corners of the tall ship in the early morning fog, and never lets go of it until the final credits. Aided immeasurably by the magnficent camera work of Russell Boyd, Weir takes us into realms of thought, feeling and experience where the cinema seldom goes. He gives us a vivid picture of life aboard a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic wars, and draws us so deeply into the teamwork and camaraderie of the crew that we feel as if we're climbing the riggings ourselves. In a way, the actors are just as much a crew as the sailors they portray; none of them stands out, but all of them put their shoulders together and work as a perfect team, each man (there are, of course, no women on board) holding up his end to perfection. Even the starring performance of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, courageous and consummately skilled ship's captain, is a masterpiece of understated team playing; different in degree but not in kind from his mates, he commands the movie but never overwhelms or bullies it. Likewise, Paul Bettany--standing a little apart from the rest of the crew as ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin--is a marvel of quiet, unobtrusive authority. There are some great debates between Aubrey, man of action, and Maturin, man of intellect, on the conduct of war and the nature of command; yet in the end they work together as a team, their essential harmony symbolized by their duets on the violin and cello. (Of the other actors in the film, special mention must be made of 13-year-old Max Pirkis as midshipman Lord Blakeney, who--after suffering a series of extreme traumas--lives up to his promise as a budding commander of men.) "Master and Commander" is such a consistently compelling action film that it catches you by surprise with its frequent moments of tragic emotion (hint: don't get too attached to any of the characters). But at the end you will leave the theater shouting a few huzzahs for Captain Aubrey and his men.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>If ever there are prizes for the best directorial comebacks, then surely Peter Weir should have one. The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.<br />Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.<br />The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..<br />I found myself transfixed at the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.<br />And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.<br />The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end of the film, elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.<br />The scenery is quite impressive, especially the ones filmed in the Galapagos islands.<br />Now the acting,<br />I don't if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe! He simply plays the part to perfection, and you can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead role and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.<br />The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one. You have to see Master and Commander..to know what I mean and to applaud one helluva comeback!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World" brilliantly recreates life on the high seas!

Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I never read the novels this film is based on so I can't say I'm really a fan of the genre.  That said, I enjoyed "Master and Commander" immensely.  I thought that director Peter Weir captured the claustrophobia of being aboard a warship circa 1800 and the feeling of being embattled at sea.  The construction of the ships, from every creaking plank and rusting nail, is flawless.  The sound and cinematography here is superb.  As far as the story, it's slow going at first but as the film progresses and the characters become more fleshed out it picks up momentum.  As far as the performances, what can you say about Russell Crowe, probably one of the most versatile actors working today.  He can add another memorable character in Jack Aubrey, the cocksure and determined captain of the H.M.S. Surprise.  He is equalled by Paul Bettany, the ship's surgeon and naturalist, Stephen Maturon.  These two are as much confidantes as adversaries.  Whereas Aubrey obsesses over attacking a state of the art French ship, the Acheron, Maturon lobbies Aubrey about taking a more cautious approach.  One could almost draw an obvious parallel in modern pop culture(dare I say it? Kirk and McCoy).  Anybody looking for a well told story that takes it's time this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The year is 1805 and the British are in war with Napoleon, who rules over France and most of Europe.  This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).<p>Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.<p>Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.  This leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that has several lessons, which can be both interesting and educational for many generations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>&quot;Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World&quot; is one of the finest naval films ever made.

Har har. The trouble with these old sea tales is the lack of women. Its all about the men and boys for years, er and hour or so. Here's an excellent recreation of life at sea on wooden ships. Are the action scenes exciting or farfetched? As a yarn I guess its okay, but a little too Hollywood for my taste. Russel Crowe is certainly everybody's favorite captain or little league coach. His doctor pal is unreasonable and not much of a friend in his single minded Darwinian search for lizards and bugs while the British Empire is in danger.

The acting is superb, the historical details almost totally accurate, and great special effects. <p>The story revolves around Capt. Jack Aubrey and his crew aboard the British H.M.S. Surprise. It is 1805 and Napolean is conquering the world and now the seas. Aubrey's orders are to intercept the French ship Acheron and either destroy it or capture it. The Acheron surprises the Surprise twice and Jack vows it won't happen again.  Along the way we see the perils of life at sea and the comraderie (and sometimes displeasure) between the sailors.<p>Peter Weir hasn't made a film since THE TRUMAN SHOW and it is a delight to watch his latest achievement.  The movie is strongly story driven. However, unlike many films, the characters aren't underdeveloped.  We get a real sense of the lives of many of the shipman and we grow to like them.  There were two points in the movie where most of the audience sighed in shock as tragedy betook beloved characters.  Also, the musical score is beautiful and seems perfect for a sea-adventure film such as this.<p>I haven't read the books (yet) so I can't say how true to the spirit of the novels the movie is.  However, I can say MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is one good yarn worth watching on the big screen at the theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>It was wonderful watching a movie with well-drawn characters that have personalities and humanity with foibles, strengths, fears, and a sense of time and place in history.  I enjoyed the "quiet" scenes where we are able to get to know the men of the Surprise.  The friendship between Aubrey (Crowe) and Dr. Mautrin (Bettany) is a glue for the whole movie.  The state of their friendship is a barometer for the state of affairs for the mission of the ship.  Being a musician, I loved the scenes of them passing time making music (and the raucous music of the crew as well).<p>Max Pirkus plays the 13-year-old Lord Blakeney with amazing skill.  His maturity reminds us of the time when children were not condescended to as creatures of little capacity and less responsibility as they are today.  Some may find such adult expectations of such a young person abhorrent, but given the life expectancy of the times to 13 was to be about a third of your lifespan.  They had to mature early and Lord Blakeney is a wonderful character with emotional strength, courage, and intellect beyond most adults.<p>There are two major battle scenes and a storm scene off the southern tip of South America that provide the action scenes of the movie.  They are wonderfully done and are quite rousing.  The scenes of surgery on the ship are filmed in a way that is not visually grisly, but so emotionally intense that you will want to look away because of what you might see, but don't.<p>I think it is always wonderful to capture a past time and place accurately.  While I am not a historian and I am sure that those historians who pay close attention to this period will find things to complain about, I did like the details they captured about the living conditions of a crew aboard such a confined space.  I don't know if all the details are right, but it was fun to watch a movie with details that added to the understanding of the plot rather than making one roll one's eyes at the implausibility of it all.<p>A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: DELIVERED A SENSE OF SUSTAINED EXPECTATION FROM BEGINNING TO END<br /><br />It is delightful for see an action adventure feature film that so precisely brings us to a world far away from our times and places.

Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.<br /><br />From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy.

The idiosyncratic world of life aboard a ship (a man-o-war) is in many ways like viewing the universe through the wrong end of a telescope: life with all the relationships, fear, lust, camaraderie, bigotry, animal drives for survival, agony of death from the eyes of the dying and the eyes of those surviving become a microcosm of life beyond the vast stretches of sea to that on the Continents of the civilized world in the year 1805. Patrick O'Brien's epics are well served down to the last detail of grit and grime and ship etiquette as captured by director Peter Weir.<br />The claustrophobia of confinement aboard a ship at sea is staggeringly well depicted. The lighting, the inevitable fog, the allegiance of a crew to its Captain, the British use of young midshipmen, the close relationship between the Captain and his ship's physician (they rise above the rawness of ship life by playing duets on the violin and cello at night in the Captain's quarters), the gore of naval battles both across ships and after boarding an enemy ship - all are extraordinary. The actors are excellent - especially Paul Bethany as the physician and Russell Crowe as the Captain. The music score is utterly breathtaking as it uses Ralph Vaughn-Williams "Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis", Bocherini, Bach and some wonderful sea shanties to realize a very British atmosphere. The music is there when it is necessary, not merely to bolster the magnitude of the sound of noisy battle.<br />So why is the sum of the parts greater than the whole? For this viewer all the splendor and production values somehow bury the importance of who these men truly are. Perhaps that is Weir's (and O'Brian's) choice - that the thrust of the story should be about one ship and its crew and destiny. I wonder. This is a splendid movie and I recommend it highly.

Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey, a British soldier in command of the HMS Surprise. They are sailing past Brazil looking for a French ship of privateers. The French ship is larger, faster, and has more guns. Her captain manages to sneak up on the British ship twice and Crowe and his crew are lucky to survive to get a third chance at them.<br /><br />The movie is a little too long and there are a couple of times when it gets off track onto things that don't really advance the story. But it does a great job of showing what is was like to serve in the navy in the early nineteenth century. The battle scenes are amazing. I'd love to know how they filmed them because they are so realistic you would swear the actors were having a real sea battle. This was a well written, acted and directed film.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Nice to see such a well crafted tale of the high seas come back to the screen - it has been too long since this type of story has been told.

The story is about friendship, honor, and duty.  There is alot of dramatic things such as when the man gets knocked overboard during the well done storm sequence, the man drowning himself with a cannonball as a weight, and the 2 main characters playin music together and fighting over right and wrong.  Overall its a good war drama, with good action, performances, drama, cinematography, and visuals.  I give it a 8 out of a 10 because it needs a battle in the middle to help quicken the pace a little to make it more watchable but everything else is good entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I finally saw this film, and am awe-struck! The attention to detail is quite exceptional, thanks to the brilliant vision of director Peter Weir. I was wondering if ths might be a franchise...&quot;Far Side of the World&quot; ...maybe there'll be more. The action scenes and the flawless cinematography, not to mention brilliant editing, draw the viewer in and you're taken away. Crowe is great, as is Paul Bettany, who creates a sense of purpose and legitimacy to the proceedings. And Billy Boyd is certainly a busy guy, appearing in two Oscar nominated blockbusters in one year (&quot;LOTR&quot;). This is a well-made, seriously endearing action drama with loads of heart. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Master And Commander&quot; is a masterpiece of a film.  It shows an accurate description of Napoleonic-era nautical warfare, as well as the bonds shared between a group of men on the sea.  Russell Crowe plays Captain &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, leader of the HMS Surprise.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor/Aubrey's confidant.  The entire cast does an outstanding job.<p>The story begins with an attack on the Surprise by the Acheron, a French warship that Aubrey is hunting.  The rest of the film plays out with Aubrey setting out on a quest to outwit and defeat the Acheron, a ship that is armed with more guns, more men, and a captain that even Aubrey is respectful of.  Along the way, we see Aubrey's softer side, his human side, that usually isn't portrayed in a character of his magnitude and position.  We are shown the bonds of brotherhood that keep the crew together through good times and bad.  We also see how life on a warship can swiftly change from boredom to life-and-death situations, as well as discipline carried out by ranking officials.<p>Overall, I've yet to see a film that reveals so much action, so many emotions, and so much reality into two-and-a-half hour production.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Director Peter Weir delved deeply into the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew as they embark on a cat and mouse game to capture or destroy the highly advanced French enemy frigate, Acheron. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Capt Jack Aubrey was finely tuned to create a brilliant tactician with wit, humor and intense leadership qualities with much humanity.  He was able to laugh with his men yet instill the highest standards of discipline and expected protocol to be followed to the tee.  The ship's doctor, a naturist and healer, does not understand the military mindset and understands even less the fine line between friendship and duty.  It's through their banter we come to understand the leadership-style and character of Capt Jack Aubrey.<p>The great plus of this movie resides in the extensive detail that is put into recreating a late 17th century era from both a Naval and Darwinian viewpoint.  Orders, protocol, uniforms, salutes, meals, canons and even choice language is very well depicted in this movie.  The actors make it seem as if their whole lives had been on that ship.  You really felt like you were part of that crew. Equally realistic is the doctor's fascination with the creatures of the Galapagos Islands, calling the animals by their scientific name and keeping a detailed diary of drawings.  <p>The director definitely wanted to highlight the emerging presence of modern science and how it could be challenging to centuries of tradition and values.  This is clearly paralleled in the doctor's and Capt Aubrey's distinct philosophies. But Weir is clever enough to resolve this by showing the two can co-exist and prove quite a powerful, if not necessary, combination.  <p>If you're expecting a movie with a lot of barking orders, swashbuckling and canon-fire in scene after scene, just all out action, then you could be mistaking this for Pirates of the Carribean or even Gladiator. This is very much a serious drama with engaging action sequences built into it, not the other way around. So it can be slightly off-putting, if not a bit boring.  <p>Nonetheless a worthwhile and insightful film.  I highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>Master and Commander, the latest Russell Crowe feature, is a story confined to one boat (and a couple of island shots).  You don't even see the enemy...and that's the beauty of the movie.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are such great actors and they can carry a film like this, with no sign of the enemy.  After seeing this movie, I find it amazing that sea battles actually had any survivors.  The action is intense and the sound is simply amazing.  The DVD has both a DTS and Dolby 5.1 tracks, and they are some of the best sound mixes out there.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Master and Commander', for me at least, is one of those films that surprises you by how good it turns out to be. I wasn't expecting to be gripped and captivated as much as I was. This is set during the Napoleonic wars and follows an English ship as it is chased and as it chases a French warship of superior size and strength. This basic premise may seem rather staid, but this has so much tension, as the cat and mouse game is played out, that the just over two hour duration goes by in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />This conjures up the tensions, fears and excitements of life on the high seas and offers a fascinating look at life onboard one of these ships, from the captains table to the men on deck. You will enjoy the rough camaraderie and carousing amongst the crew, as well as the superstitions and cabin fever long stretches at sea engenders.<br /><br />This film is shot very well and you are quickly pitched into the cramped and close quarters of life onboard. You see how the men live and fight and the hierarchy onboard as well. All the accents are `most frightfully British' and whilst it seemed mildly annoying at the start, it very quickly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Crow acts surprisingly well in this film and you can feel his charisma and drive as a captain throughout. This is a good old fashioned adventure film and left me on the edge of my seat and moved by the end. Well worth checking out at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie really reflects navel life at sea. The way it was filmed and acted was so real life and believable. The words that were filled with sea tanged royal marine life, felt as if you were beside the men manning the deck, paving the way for a battle upon the high waves of the ocean, near some mysterious tropical island or remote tossing about like a toy on a world of water. The movie fills the screen with two excellent actors, one is Russell Crowe and the other his name forgotten, yet his skill in the performing arts shines. The movie reflects the camaraderie of the men and their well founded esteem for the capitan and the doctor. There are men of all ages, the youngest being pre-teen. They all are excited to be serving the crown, fighting against the French fleet. The movie is about the cat and mouse pursuit between the Surprise manned by the Brits and the Avature bespoken by the French. Russells ship or Captain Jack's ship is not as well made as the stronger faster rival. The movie shows the chase and their strategies in finally meeting and fighting for the prize. The images in the film are so beautiful with color and the desire to be in that moment. A sumpetious feast of symbolic brilliance. The crashing waves filled with dark mystery. The bounty floating below the wooden rails, ships brimming with perfumed fruit and lovely native men and women selling their wares. I loved the scene where the men share their dinner, young and old with anectadotes of their travels and meetings with important others. The crystal and the silver, the meals prepared by the grouchy cook. The nautical equipment was visually attractive to look at and creating imaginings of yourself in that experience. The music and the friendship displayed by Stephen the doctor and the captain. Their respect for one another, tested by the lessons of life. I especially liked the expeditions journied by the doctor learning about faraway lands and animals that had not been logged in books. His drawings and his discoveries plus his knowledge at doctoring patients, crusty with salt and young with beads of sweat. The sweltering heat when the sails sat still as did the ship upon the smoothed over wrinkles of the deep blue. The grand adventures that came from their voyages, like the Gallpagos Islands fed my yearnings for faraway places.

Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.<br /><br />From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.<br /><br />--* THE MAJOR PLAYERS *--<br /><br />Russell Crowe - Captain Jack Aubrey<br />Paul Bettany - Dr. Stephen Maturin<br />Billy Boyd - Barrett Bonden<br />James D'Arcy - 1st Lt.

The movie looked cool, and with the ever-admirable Russell Crowe at the helm, seemingly a sure winner. But what if it was terrible?<br /><br />I finally faced my fear and found to my delight that "Master and Commander" is a wonderfully rich and varied experience that was well worth the wait. The film's action is fairly straightforward. An English man-o-war, the "Surprise," must intercept the much swifter and stronger French "Acheron" before it reaches the Pacific and spreads Napoleon's empire into that hemisphere. But to this basic period chase story is added a fast-paced plot, a wonderful cast, superb effects, excellent performances and more twists than a cat-o-nine. Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, a brave and audacious pilot who has spent much of his life aboard the Surprise. The boat is well past its prime, but Audrey knows how to squeeze every ounce of speed out of her. Paul Bettany shines, or rather glowers as Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is a cynic, an old friend of Aubrey's and the ship's talented surgeon, whose land-bound habits and moral code make him a perfect foil for Crowe. When the two aren't fighting each other, they are playing classical strings pieces in the Captain's cabin.<br /><br />"Master and Commander" masterfully mixes disparate are elements - the sailors' superstitions and their Christian piety when burying at sea; their fighting prowess alongside their tenderness toward their sick comrades; their love of grog along their dogged will to work. The film includes a number of scenes and characters that could easily have descended into clich&eacute;: the amputation; the noble-yet-caring captain; the encounter with native women. But smart writing and a focus on the mission keep both the Surprise's crew and the film's plot focused. Special applause goes to Max Pirkis as a doughty young midshipman. Sharp-eyed viewers will also note Billy Boyd (filmed in the midst of his role as Pippin in "The Lord of the Rings") as a rambunctious coxswain.<br /><br />M&C is quick-footed and thrilling, with battle scenes that are breathtakingly brutal. The effects of cannon shot on a ship's hull have never been so convincingly rendered. The camaraderie among the crew is heartwarming and sincere. The plot line is far from predictable. And finally, a movie that does not insult a viewer's intelligence! The film's final shot tells us, without needing to show us, what happens as the credits are rolling. Terrific, terrific, terrific!<br /><br />(There are no DVD extras to speak of apart from a few previews. Alas! But so much the more to preserve the story's magic!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe (Capt. Jack Aubrey) stars in this classic sea epic about naval warfare during the Napoleonic wars.  The year is 1805 and Napoleon's armies are set to invade England.  The world's oceans have now become battlefields as well.  The French frigate Acheron has been sent to the South Atlantic Ocean to journey around South America and into the Pacific Ocean to raid English whaling vessels.<br /><br />Capt. Aubrey's vessel, the HMS Surprise, stands in the Acheron's way.  After a battle off of the Brazillian coast in which the Surprise suffered considerable damage, the French ship made good its escape.  Faster than its English counterpart, it is able to increase the distance between itself and the slower British ship.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, the viewer gets to experience sailing, sea tactics, and life in general aboard a sailing ship.  Young officers who were in fact pre-teenage children were routinely placed aboard these vessels to learn the art of seamanship from the more experienced crewmembers.  Capt. Aubrey lends in his navigational talents to the training.  Battles are ferocious and often deadly, and young and old alike are the unfortunate casualties.  The overcrowding, poor food, and mental stress of being cramped on a ship for months on end is accurately portrayed, as well.  However, the men are sustained by the thrill of the chase and moments of courage, especially by Capt. Aubrey.<br /><br />Tough choices are made as well, such as when one of the crewmembers is swept overboard, but Capt. Aubrey is forced to make the agonizing decision to leave him behind rather than risk his ship and crew.<br /><br />Starring along with Crowe is Paul Bettany, who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  He provides a kind of antithesis to Capt. Aubrey's sense of duty.  The pair play music together, eat together, and get drunk together, and there is a true sense of trust and friendship among them.  While chasing the Acheron, the Surprise stops in the Galapagos islands, where Dr. Maturin discovers many different species of animals, but Capt. Aubrey informs the doctor that the Surprise must resume the pursuit of the Acheron.  This decision drives a wedge between the Captain and the doctor.<br /><br />Upon sighting the Acheron, Capt. Aubrey comes up with a plan to disguise his ship as a whaling vessel in the hopes of drawing the bigger and heavier-armed Acheron closer.  The plan works, and a teriffic sea battle ensues.  Will the Acheron win, or will Aubrey's Surprise pull of a "surprise" of its own?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  The action is non-stop, and Russell Crowe does a magnificent job as the charismatic Capt. Aubrey.  Life aboard a sailing ship in the early 1800s is accurately shown, and the sea battles are truly exhilarating.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of great sea action and adventure will surely enjoy this great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Given the number of excellent movies that have been made about sailing ships and the breadth of coverage of those movies, at first you might wonder how yet another movie is going to add anything to the genre. If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question. This story is as compelling as "Moby Dick," and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.<br /><br />The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains. However, it cannot be, for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents. In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy. Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.<br /><br />Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.<br /><br />First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good. The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous. Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book "Two Years Before the Mast." While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.<br /><br />Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed. We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own. We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as "The Enemy Below" and "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different.<br /><br />Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery. In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool. In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in "Jurassic Park," you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics. While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast. "Master and Commander" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but "The Return of the King" overshadowed this superb historical fiction. It is gratifying to see such quality in film making. This movie is well worth five stars and then some.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>A wonderful tale of life aboard an 1800's ship during war time.

There is simply no doubt about that.  The viewer is literally transported and immersed into the brutal and harsh service of the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe perfectly portrays Captain Jack Aubrey ("lucky Jack") of the Patrick O'Brian novels.  The acting, sets, everything, simply crackle with authenticity.  The attention to detail in this film is astounding.<p>The storyline is not bad either, although in my opinion it moves a bit slowly.  But the relatively slow pace of the storyline is for a purpose, to draw the viewer into the subtle nuances that the film is trying to convey--that this was a hard age, the Royal Navy of the times was a brutal and merciless service which brooked no disobedience and yet was not lacking in humanity.  Russell Crowe portrays a Captain Aubrey who is both harsh and humane in an age of hardship and adventure.<p>I deprived this film of the fifth star because I did feel that the storyline could have been made to move at a brisker pace without sacrificing the nuances that the film accomplishes so well.  Others may disagree, and I can understand that.  It may be that with repeated viewings I too will decide that this is a five-star film.  In any case, it is an excellent film, featuring excellent performances, authenticity, and an interesting storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe is perfectly cast for this role. I can really believe in him as a commander who is one part fighter, one part man of learning. In one of my favorite recurring sequences in this movie, he and Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's doctor/naturalist/philosopher, perform classical duets on violin and cello, just for fun. (How they keep moisture and salt out of those instruments, which always seem to be sitting in the open, I cannot imagine.) Not only do these scenes set them both up as cultured men, but they dramatize that this relationship has been going on long before we join up with them. It's a brilliant way of getting a chunk of back-story out of the way in seconds.<br /><br />The protagonists' strong friendship, however, gets put to the test early on. There's no doubt Russell's character, like Russell himself, is a fair man with his fists, and when push comes to shove, like Russell himself, he prefers duels to duets. That's why he's put in charge of the HMS Surprise, a British warship sailing the seas during the Napoleonic Wars. (That's the early 1800s, for all you who have History For Dummies on your Amazon wish list.)  When the ship encounters a bigger, faster, meaner French vessel that wants to blow them out of the water, Russell goes on the offensive and chases the Frenchies around Cape Horn, through some of the nastiest storms this side of FEMA.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I rented this movie the same day as Steven Spielberg's Munich, and both films vaguely share a theme: fists or brains? Reason or violence? Neither film finds an answer (as if one could) but in both case characters take each side of the debate and argue passionately their beliefs, thoughts which are as old as the ancient Greeks at least. Yet despite some excellent moments in each film, and the high-minded intentions of each, somehow both come out feeling a little hollow somehow.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the attempt to rationalize what are, at bottom, irrational acts--terrorism in Munich and a style of warfare that was very much like terrorism, or at least guerilla warfare, in the early 19th century. It's gratifying to hear Crowe and Bettany debating fists vs. books downstairs in the captain's quarters. At the same time, I feel we've all been here before, and neither one has anything new to add.<br /><br />To be sure, all the prep work has been done. Early on we meet a young lad of about 12 who has been pressed into service. He loses an arm, yet he still wants to fight and is inspired by Crowe's meeting, when he was also about 12, with Lord Nelson, who also lacked one limb. There's something fascinating here about such a young man being forced to serve, losing an arm, and wanting to continue on, in the way this parallels Crowe's own early years in the service.  Yet as with the fight vs. think duality between Crowe and Bettany, the film never quite makes enough out of it. We are just presented these spectacles to observe, but they don't develop, or at least not much.<br /><br />Some parts of Master and Commander, however, are masterful. The storm sequences are stunning, the scenes where we watch the crew handle the ship make us feel like we are with them. The tricks and double-tricks of early naval warfare are fascinating to watch. Australian director Peter Weir is masterfully understated at times--there's a scene where an officer does a Dick Cheney on the ship's doctor, and the doctor has to operate on himself while someone else holds up a mirror so he can peer into his own wound. This could have been done with much gratuitous gore. Instead Weir gives us what we need to know and no more. And the Galapagos Island scenes are like a breath of fresh air: we feel as relieved as they to get off that cramped, damp ship. (Again, *how* did they keep the moisture out of those instruments?)<br /><br />While on the Galapagos Islands, making proto-Darwinian observations about creatures great and small, they stumble again upon the French warship, which sends Crowe in a tizzy because of his desire to get the better of a faster, bigger enemy. Somehow this had the feeling of inevitability to it, to the point that my wife, watching it with me, said as soon as they disembarked "They're going to find that ship again." It had a slightly mechanical quality to it. And although Kirk and Spock--I mean Crowe and Bettany--kick around the philosophical bean bag, neither really has a revelation or learns from the other. They end where they began. Quite literally.<br /><br />Compare this with another film with some similar themes which I think is one of the all-time neglected masterpieces, Never Cry Wolf (1983). The central character here is living at peace with nature--and two Inuits whom he thinks are the antithesis of modern civilized man with all his problems. Then one of those men shakes him up. While sitting on a rock cleaning his rifle, he tells our hero that he would have no qualms hunting and killing the wolves our hero adores because he has to buy rifle bullets and he needs a new snowmobile and wolf pelts go for several hundred dollars and he has to feed his family and...And we realize then and there that the whole set-up of the "Noble Savage" has been shattered by this one quiet scene. (For those of you not familiar with the concept, look it up in Wikipedia.) After that scene our hero--and we--are changed--in ways he only comes to grips with in the film's deeply moving, almost haiku-like coda.  In the present movie, there *is* a bit of a twist at the very end, and no, I couldn't foresee it, and neither will you.  But it didn't feel like enough. (It does leave the film open for a nice sequel, though. There are something like 20 novels in this series, so there are lots to choose from. It could become like Harry Potter.)<br /><br />To me the film could never convincingly settle on being either a cerebral drama about the dawning of the age of science or a tense cat-and-mouse thriller. (Parts of it reminded me of a cross between Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot and Steven Spielberg's Duel, believe it or not.) I'm aware that Weir likes to combine and blur American genres--his Witness (1985) is a great and effective example of this. But I don't feel this film was as seamlessly joined.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, however, and all the technicals are first-rate. Indeed very quickly we forget all about the Hollywood trickery and believe we are really at sea, traveling through storms and battles. Like a lot of films, this could have been a bit shorter, but the first half in particular has many edge-of-the-seat moments. In fact, we get so wrapped up in the events on board the Surprise that when the French ship finally appears up close, it almost feels strange to realize here is another craft with its own crew, its own captain--until now they've been abstractions. It's at this point I felt the film turned into another, different movie--a rather straightforward action film, with Russell Crowe slashing the enemy to bits with a feral quality reminiscent of...Russell Crowe. As I said, there's a twist at the end, but it wasn't enough and it left me feeling oddly unsettled, as if I'd just given the filmmakers two and a half hours of my time and got neither a resolution nor an open-ended question, just another chase.<br /><br />Still, for the spectacle alone this is worth a rental. I just don't agree with some people, such as my erstwhile colleague James Liu ("Dr. Jimbob" in these pages) that this is a modern Kurosawa-esque film. Kurosawa would have left us more of a moral dilemma to chew on. He would have expressed it more fully, gone deeper. He wouldn't have raised interesting issues, only to step away from them to go fight another battle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an all-male, testosterone-fueled, seafaring adventure about a British naval captain who plays a cat-and-mouse game with a faster, more advanced French warship.  The time of the film is 1805, when Napoleon was seeking to conquer Europe, and England had declared war.  The film is based on the historical fiction novels of the same title by Patrick O'Brian.<br /><br />Russel Crowe heads an excellent cast as Captain "Lucky Jack" Jack Aubrey, a hard-headed, disciplined military man bent on capturing the Archeron at all costs.  Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's opposite, a gentle, intellectual doctor who is ship surgeon and naturalist.  Maturin and Aubrey are constantly butting heads, making M & C kind of a high-seas buddy pic.<br /><br />The story is tightly paced and the music score is low-key.  It is music you might expect to hear watching a chess match, rather than swelling orchestral strains one expects during these types of historical pictures.  But indeed, the deadly stalking of the two ships is very much like a chess game.<br /><br />I loved this exciting, old-fashioned movie.<br /><br />The film is available to watch in Spanish and French dubs and subs.<br /><br />Unless you have a remote on whatever machine you are watching this DVD on, you cannot access special features.  I watch mine on a laptop, so I was out of luck.  Shame on the DVD designers for this poor menu design.  The only thing I could access was something called an "Inside Look" that I thought was an inside look at the film.  Instead, it was just previews!  Boo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Peter Weir directs this high seas adventure with skill and a great eye; the film received an Academy Award for cinematography, and the action and effects are terrific.  Russell Crowe stars as Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is his friend and ship's surgeon as the ship battles a French phantom ship in this adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's series of books.  Some liberties are taken with the books, probably wisely; for instance, the protagonists battle the French during the Napoleonic wars rather than fighting the Americans in 1812.  Max Pirkis is excellent as a young seaman, and Billy Boyd does well in a small part as the crew fights for, and admires, their inspirational captain.  Sometimes the language is difficult to understand, so it helps to watch with the subtitles on.  There is some gore in the battle scenes and aftermath, but there is humor as well.  The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, with optional English or Spanish subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>This is an amazing action movie set on the high seas, and I especially mean high when they are rounding cape horn.  I had watched the movie through once and felt I had missed a lot because much of the dialog seemed gibberish.  I immediately watched it a second time with closed captioning on and it helped a lot.<p>This movie has humor action and a certain reality of sea warfare.  Imagine a 12 year old officer, son of a lord commanding a group of low born navel sailor.  If you had a hard time imagining Luke Skywalker leading Rogue Squadron at age 16 and Princess Leia leading the rebels at age 19, how about age 12.  This was the royal navy in 1805.  A 16 year old was a third Lt. ranking high enough to join the officers mess and lead men into a battle.  And the navy men followed.<p>The movie is PG13 but the violence was not gory.  There is no nudity or cursing that we recall so we judge this movie to be family friendly.  More evidence that a director can make a great movie with a superior script, great acting and outstanding cinematography and special effects.  The opening battle with the sound of projectiles flying by makes you feel you are right there.. Makes you want to duck down.<p>Russell Crowe is incredible as the extremely bright, creative naval tactician and captian of the HMS Surprise who leads his men with a positive, confident swagger.  The men have nicknamed him Lucky Jack Aubrey.<p>So many things make this an outstanding movie that I must give it a, rare for me, 5 star rating.  The one annoyance of the unclear dialog, actually helps the viewer feel like they are in 1805 British times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" gives its audience insight into the mysterious world of sailing.  We all know about pirates, sea battles, and swash-buckling, but do we really know about the men behind it all?  No.  Never before have we been given such a privileged look into the lives and hearts of those brave men at sea.  Peter Weir's film follows the British naval ship HMS Surprise and her crew during the Napoleonic Wars as they are relentlessly pursued by the far superior French ship, the Acheron.<p>Russell Crowe, one of the finest actors to come along in the past decade, plays Captain Jack Aubrey.  Aubrey is a man who demands perfection and respect from his crew, yet is enormously loved and respected by all of them.  It is here that "Master and Commander" finds its strength, in the comradery of men.  The naval battle sequences are grand and epic, the dialogue witty, the cast pitch-perfect, the sets and costumes flawless, and the score heart-pounding.  Yet it all boils down to the friendships and bonds between the men.  That is the true heart of "Master and Commander".  This is a fascinating and informative film as well as a supremely moving one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Peter Weir<p>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is based on two of the novels of Patrick O'Brien (both Master and Commander, and The Far Side of the World, the first and tenth books of the series).  I haven't read any of the books, but any movie starring Russell Crowe and directed by Peter Weir is worth seeing.  Weir is a very talented director (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) and Crowe is such a good actor that when he is in a role you don't see the man, you see the character.  That is rare in a leading man.  This movie (as well as the books) is historical fiction.  <p>The captain of the H.M.S. Surprise is Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe).  Aubrey is given his orders: to pursue and capture the French ship the Acheron.  The Acheron has been harrying and sinking English whaling vessels and it is up to the Surprise to stop this.  It's a simple story and this point is where much of the plot lies: in the chase.  The rest of the movie is the development of the friendship between Aubrey, and this ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  Over the course of the film (and the long chase of the Acheron) we get to see what sailing would have been like in the 19th Century, and we see how Aubrey interacts with his crew.  He is a compassionate Captain, a moral man who leads without being a tyrant.  We see Aubrey's strong leadership with the crew and his humanity both in his leadership as well as in his friendship with Maturin.  <p>This was an impressive movie.  Unlike The Perfect Storm, Master and Commander captures the feel of being on the ship and really working.  The use of nautical and military terms without stopping to explain each term adds to the realism of the movie.  Peter Weir has the details down and he crafts quite an experience that does not go for the cheap payoff in the chase of the Acheron.  The acting was top notch, and while the supporting cast was not very well developed (I never saw them as individuals, only as Crew) they blend seamlessly into the movie, and into the ship.  I was very impressed with this movie.  It had more of a classic film feel in the pacing and the acting, but Weir's vision was strong and I loved the movie.  Highly recommended for anyone.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>I don't know Russell Crowe personally, but I know his work, and I'm not sure the man would appear in a bad movie.  This one is a good one.<p>Peter Weir has collected all his available resources - a good story, CGI, other special effects, skilled cinematographers and set designers and a great cast and crew to put us to sea with a mighty hearty seagoin' adventure.<p>Crowe's "Lucky" Jack Aubrey is intelligent and seasoned, and clearly cares about his men individually as well as the ship and crew as a whole.  In his character we get to see the weight of momentous decisions he must make - sacrificing the life of an overboard sailor to save the entire ship, as well as bringing his overgunned and outmanned HMS Surprise right up to the speedy French Acheron and letting his crew have at it, knowing that many lives on both sides will be lost.<p>We get to see that the Captain is not always right, and he occasionally has to accept the consequences of his wrong actions or decisions.  But we also get to see that often effective leadership means taking decisive action and implementing an imperfect plan because a team that is committed to a wrong plan will accomplish more than a crew paralyzed because leadership has come up with no plan at all.<p>There is no love story artificially superimposed upon this rousing good tale, and the performances are fine and memorable.<p>I recommend this one highly for anyone looking for an intelligent action adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe does a superb job of portraying British naval hero "Lucky" Jack Aubrey as he pursues a bigger and better-prepared French ship off the coast of Brazil in the early 1800's.  He is an inspiring leader, who keeps his eye on his objective while encouraging and mentoring his crew.  Paul Bettony gives a very good performance as the ship's doctor who gives his friend Aubrey his honest opinion about his decisions as the ship's commander.  The Dr. is fascinated by the unknown creatures he sees on the Galapagos Islands and is very disappointed when his specimen-collecting expedition is interrupted by the reappearance of the French ship.  This is a beautifully filmed movie with lots of action and good performances by the actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Fans of Russell Crowe will love his newest film, MASTER AND COMMANDER.  Crowe continues his tradition of playing strong-minded characters in his role of Captain Jack Aubrey, the commander of Her Majesty's Ship, The Surprise, during the English-French war of 1805.  What director Peter Weir brings to the screen is an exciting and as astonishing a sea adventure saga that combines the best of the Horation Hornblower series with Captain Kirk from STAR TREK.  Weir captures the essence of what it must have been like to be a sailor of that time.  Part of the believability lies in Weir's portrayal of the natural elements of shipboard life: the cold, the hunger, the salt spray, the lack of women.  But what makes this film click is a series of subtexts that explores the infinitely illogical relationship between duty and frienship.  Serving as ship's doctor is Lieutenant Stephen Maturin (Peter Bettany, who played Crowe's non-existent roommate from A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  Maturin is more than just the rather youngish ship's surgeon.  He is a naturalist one generation before Darwin.  He longs to explore the unknown flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands.  Several times, Captain Aubrey promises him the opportunity to do so but each time the exigencies of war force him to do otherwise.  This clashing of wills is only but the most obvious of themes that elevate MASTER AND COMMANDER to a superior sea war film.  Director Weir further examines the delicate balancing act that any commanding officer faces when deciding just how close that officer can allow himself to be towards his crew.<p>The plot is straightforward and uncomplicated.  Aubrey is ordered to seek out and destroy the Acheron, a vessel that is much faster and more heavily armed than Aubrey's.  During this chase, each ship takes turns chasing the other, with the ultimate confrontation resulting in a roaringly load sea battle that seems as exciting as it was undoubtedly authentic.  There is more than a few passing references to Star Trek, especially the episode where Kirk disguises himself as a Romulan to defeat a vessel of superior technology.  MASTER AND COMMANDER seems sure to garner a few Oscars, probably for Best Picture and Best Actor.  It was truly a pleasure to see such a politically incorrect film wow the audience in a way that would have made Errol Flynn proud.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Seat Sail for an action packed ocean battle thrill rid in Master and Commander. this movie is really good. it's kinda slow but still a good movie to watch. i recommend this movie for everyone of the age 15 and up</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Sailing movies of the war genre don't appeal to all people usually. No doubt fans of the "Hornblower" DVD sets will like this movie. Any fans of classics like "Damn the Defiant" with Alec Guinness should find it entertaining.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does a fine job of portraying the captain of a British ship in search of the French enemy. His enemy is a worthy quarry and must be tracked to the ends of the Earth. Even when you think the movie is concluded you find it is not. The acting is excellent and they did a fine job of casting.<br /><br />The real treat is the photography and sets. The level of detail is phenomenal. Rarely have I seen such attention to what helps to make a great seafaring movie, a great ship set. The ambiance of sea life is so well preserved you will think you are smelling the sea breeze and feel the salty spray across your face. That or you will feel cramped and smell the sweat and powder below decks as they engage the enemy.<br /><br />The DVDs included in this are first quality and the picture and sound is excellent. It includes numerous extras you can find listed under the details above. All in all this movie was masterfully done.<br /><br />I initially rated this four stars. I would change that to three if I could now. The reason is the more I reflected on this movie I realized I wouldn't be likely to watch it again for some time. What I mean is it does not have a great deal of replayability. The reason is that I wasn't happy with the constant chasing of only one quarry and then even at the end the chase starts all over again. You feel you have been cheated out of a victory and that leaves a hole in the story. At least with the other sea movies I mentioned there is a conclusion, good or bad, it ends and you feel good about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>There is an oft-quoted line from the movie: "This ship be home... this ship is England."  The Royal Navy had such a tradition by 1805 (the year of this film) that its ships really were little floating islands of England.  This is both good and bad - it made them formidible opponents, was morale-boosting for the crew, etc.  Of course, it also embodied the imperialistic chauvenism of the English, as well as their stratified society.  These thoughts went through my head after watching "Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World" because the film so convincingly models the attitudes and feel of a 19th-century man-of-war.<br /><br />I have not read the source material - the Maturin-Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brien - so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film to the books.  However, as director Peter Weir points out, the plots aren't nearly so important as the relationships between the boat and its crew, between the crew-members themselves, and the books' historical authority on the Age of Sail.  Thus, this doubly-named film ("Master and Commander" and "The Far Side of the World" are, in fact, two different stories) concentrates on the accuracy of costumes, rigging, and speech.  This accuracy is essential, as immerses the viewer into the film, so when the action does take place, it is all the more poignant.  The basic plot - Capt. Aubrey hunting a larger and better armed French ship around the Cape - allows for some spectacular footage.  There are the obligatory sea battles and a visit to the Gallopagoes (filmed on location in the very islands), but the best part of the film is probably the storm as the ship rounds the Cape of Good Hope.  Combining location footage, computer animation, and model work (both full and 1/6 scale), the storm is hang-on-to-your armrests convincing.  This brings up the point of the effects; they are so seamless that they are unnoticeable, and this is possibly the film with the best-ever visual effects.<br /><br />So why only 4/5 stars?  Viewing this film on my system, it does move a little slow.  It works better in a movie theatre, I think, but since this is a review of the DVD, I have to deduct a star for the DVD-watching experience.  The extras on this two-disc set are interesting, but not complete.  There is ample footage of the film being made - including a 20-minute feature on the fantastic score and some deleted scenes - but there are no background featurettes on historical context, little on the anatomy/vocabulary of a square-rigged frigate, etc.  I think most people who would buy this DVD set would also be interested in this information, and not so much in information that is so similar to the extras on the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings special-edition DVD's.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I'm a long running fan of Russell Crowe so needless to say I had to see this movie as soon as it was released.  I was expecting something much different...the previews made it appear to be not stop battles and what not, so after the first viewing I was a bit dissapointed.  Yes, Crowe is astonishing as usual and he has every bit of what it takes to COMMAND a role, and that he does here.  It wasn't until seeing it for the second time that I started to appreciate it more, you know, for what it was.  What it is is a great naval movie, not more or less about the battles and the death but about the life people led living on the ships, never seeing home.  The small sub plots which at first I felt took away from what I was waiting for actually served their purpose after watching it again.  The film is beautifully shot, and the authenticity of the set and sounds make you feel as though you are bellow deck with the crew.  In closing I feel that this is a great addition to any DVD collection, and although it may not be what you wanted, if you look at it for what it is you will be not only impressed but quite satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: This film is about the story of Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew on the HMS Surprise. The film takes place during the times of the Napoleonic Wars at sea. What makes this film a winner is the fact that it was able to stay incredibly historically accurate and still maintain is entertaining value. Most movies that try to be historically accurate tend to fail miserable due to them being . . . well . . . boring! Take Gods and Generals for example. Anyway, the film documents the adventures and journeys of this ship as it fights for their country and themselves. I guess what made this movie so exciting was the incredible sound and visuals. At $150 million, the movie was no cheap fare to make. Unfortunately it did horribly at the box office and was the reason that the movie was split between three different distributors (20th Century Fox, Universal, and Miramax). What really makes this film so enjoyable is the fact that it has such a fantastic ensemble cast. As you've expected, Russell Crowe is the star of the show, but without the supporting cast his performance would have gone to waste. A terrific film, one of the best of its kind, and something that you can take with you to history class and to your home theater.<p>VIDEO: The video of this DVD is incredible. Your HDTV will certainly get its run for the money, mine sure did. This two disc set comes in anamorphic widescreen in a 2.40:1 ratio.<p>AUDIO: Here you get an amazing DTS and Dolby 5.1 mix that will knock your socks off. The sound of this movie is incredible and needs mixes like these.<p>PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I have the two disc edition. I personally feel that the only reason why we have the choice of one disc and two disc editions is because of the poor performance at the box office. So in order to get as much money as they could, they put two discs in a fancy shmancy box and charge a lot for it. Then they give the option of a disc with absolutely nothing on it so buyers of the two disc set feel special. Honestly the extras are nothing to bananas over. It's not a great amount and they are not all that special. In this set you get trailers and tv spots, 70 minute behind the scenes documentary, how they adapted the movie from the books, moviemaking secrets, sound design featurette, cannon demonstration, 6 deleted scenes, multi angle scenes, and a split scene vignette. When someone buys something they always want it to be the better of its kind. So knowing how the human mind works, Fox released a bare bones release and a normal two disc set wrapped all pretty and slapped a big price tag for that. Naturally the consumer will buy the better set. I don't see why the consumer has to suffer just because their marketing failed during the theatrical release. The set is good though, I'm just complaining about how they released it and priced it, that's all.<p>Movie Score: (4 Stars / 5 Stars)<br />DVD Score: (8 / 10)</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.<br /><br />I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.<br /><br />Back to the film.<br /><br />I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.<br /><br />So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.<br /><br />Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected ("Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate.")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.<br /><br />The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.<br /><br />Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.<br /><br />So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>This film reminds me an era when Director's and Producers wanted to make an epic, didn't matter what the cost was, they just wanted to make a good film that both excites you and makes you think. Russell Crowe gives his most daring performance in years, fans of the O'Brien books thought he couldn't do a real man's performance, he was known as dreamy Russell before now. Crowe is not only being compared to Tom Hanks , but compared to the greatest actors of our time, like Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, and now he's being placed in the category of Marlon Brando and Peter O' Toole. He not only brought back the sandle movies, but now he's bringing back the swash bucklers, wow.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />The film is about CPT. Jack Aubrey(known as lucky jack), and his sidekick the doctor(Paul Bettany). They embark on a journey to hunt down an enemy ship, but this isn't the test, this is a journey of finding one's self and coming together to conquer their fears.<br /><br />"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is an incredible film that will entrance you into the ocean and put you into the minds of the men and CPT. Jack Aubrey. But something is missing, Paul Bettany, he's great in this film but he doesn't have the same intensity that he had in "A Beautiful Mind", or maybe he's not sopose to. Even with that flaw, this is still an acheivement, and nothing can stand in the way of the new rein of actors, and I hope to see more of this cast including Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is one of this year's best, it is brilliant. Russell Crowe plays Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, in one of his best performances of his career, Captain of HMS Surprise. Paul Bettany plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, Surgeon on the HMS Surprise, in the best performance of his career, so far. HMS Surprise is attacked in the beginning of the movie by the Acheron, a much stronger and faster battleship. Some of Aubrey's men were wounded and some of them died. As the movie progresses, we get to learn how the characters are feel and we feel the same exact thing that the characters because of the fact is that we know and get how they feel. Aubrey gets surprised twice by the captain of the Acheron and vows there will not be a third time. Men are lost in the balance of the attack and chase to find the Acheron. Men that were good people and fought for their country very well. At the end of this movie, they set a trap on the Acheron so they won't be the ones that are surprised and this trap does work brilliantly to Aubrey's advantage. This movie is set during the era of the French Revolution, and it is quite brilliant how Peter Weir and his crew made "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" come to life so brilliantly. The acting is superb as the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany's were. The directing by Peter Weir is brilliant and superb at its finest hour. The screenplay by Weir and John Conlee is excellent without compromise. The visual effects by INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC & ASYLUM is brilliant without compromise. The costume design is dynamic and brilliant. The production design is wonderful and brilliant. The film editing is great. The cinematography (Oscar Winner) is superb and dynamic without compromise. The music is brilliant and excellent. I like this movie very much, because it was brilliantly different from the movies we have seen this year, because it doesn't go for swashbuckling at all. The Acheron is the shark from "Jaws". It hides and it waits for its attack to happened. This movie should get brilliant Oscar and Golden Globe coverage when the Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe Nominations are announced in the next two months or so. See this movie now or any time you can see it. You will enjoy it very much. Also won for Best Sound Editing.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2 The odd thing about "Master and Commander" is that its strengths and its weaknesses both seem to derive from one and the same source: its subtlety.  <p>Based on the novels by Patrick O'Brian, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is a seafaring adventure tale more notable, perhaps, for its straight-ahead action sequences than for its finer elements of characterization and conflict.  O'Brian has certainly given writer John Collee and writer/director Peter Weir plenty to work with here, starting with an Ahab-type main character named Jack Aubrey, a British sea captain in 1805 who becomes obsessed with overtaking and attacking a much larger French man-of-war ship that defeated his vessel in battle off the coast of South America.  Aubrey, albeit a man of sensibility and compassion, often endangers the lives of his men in an effort to complete his "mission," even though he is routinely challenged by cooler heads on the ship to acknowledge the fruitlessness of the endeavor and to set sail for home an honorably defeated man.<p>Aubrey is nowhere near as neurotic and delusional as Ahab, and that perhaps is the biggest problem with the film.  Aubrey, for all his bluster, is really not all that interesting a character.  Although we can see where the filmmakers are trying to take us, they never seem able to crack open Aubrey's mind to help us get inside and learn what really makes him tick.  One thing about Ahab is that we always knew why the stakes were so personal for him.  With Aubrey we don't really understand why he is so single-mindedly set on getting his target.  Perhaps the confrontations he has with his crewmen are just a trifle too low-keyed and underplayed to reveal very much about his character.  "Master and Commander" may be a more realistic yarn than "Moby Dick" but, in this case at least, subtlety comes with a hefty price.  An adventure film set on the high seas needs to hit more dramatic high points than "Master and Commander" is eventually able to muster. <p>Having said all that, it seems a bit perverse and paradoxical to now point out that "Master and Commander" also draws its greatest strength from the fact that it doesn't rely on cheap melodramatics to achieve its power.  Thanks to outstanding direction, set design and special effects, we really feel as if we are on one of those early 19th Century sailing vessels, a feeling that is enhanced even more in the battle scenes which are executed with a stunning eye for believability and detail.  And there are many moments of silent intensity particularly between Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident naturalist, obviously modeled on Charles Darwin (though 30 years earlier than Darwin), who can't understand why Aubrey has to go off fighting Bonaparte's forces when all Maturin wants is to be able to go traipsing all over the Galapagos Islands in search of new and fascinating faunal specimens (at least Darwin didn't have to contend with some pesky war when he was off developing his Theory of Evolution).  The subtle interplay between these two characters provides for some of the most gripping moments in the film.  Russell Crowe manages to convey both authority and compassion in his role of Aubrey, and Paul Bettany creates a compelling foil for him in Maturnin.  Aubrey is also up against the superstitious nature of his disgruntled crew who attribute much of their troubled journey to the curse laid upon them by a vindictive god (vide "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner").  The filmmakers also do an effective job exploring the internal decision-making process a person in authority often has to go through in weighing the good of the group against the good of the individual.  The fact that Aubrey isn't a raving lunatic (like Ahab) lessens the drama but heightens the verisimilitude of the piece.<p>"Master and Commander" is a bit of a close call for me, but taken as a whole, its virtues ultimately outweigh its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>I liked this movie alot, and would have given it five stars, but for the inacurate portrayal of Marine Iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.  Read the other reviews for information on the acting and action, I am writing to stand up for the lowly Iguana.<p>Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana, the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal which lives on land but grazes on a variety of seaweed, either on exposed rocks or by diving into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas, provides them with an abundant food source but can make them vulnerable to predation by sharks and other large fish. <p>In the movie, there are scenes reminiscent of Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle", many of the characters are seen collecting what are supposed to be marine iguanas.  However, are these actual Galapagos marine iguanas?  No.  These are actually the common Green Iguanas of South America.  They are not even using costumes or makeup, just their natural green skin.  It is like they are acting on the stage.  Do these iguanas get credit at the end of the movie?  No!  Like Kermit the frog said, Its not easy being green.  Real marine iguanas are ugly dark colored brutes you would never want to meet in a dark alley, but common green iguanas are our friends.  <p>This was a great movie, it just doesn't give proper credit to the iguanas.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've never watched Master And Commander before, there's always been something in the way. The length, it wasn't "appropriate" to watch it at that particular moment in time, and the fact that I couldn't (notice the past tense) stand Russell Crowe. But when you're thinking that you'll never agree on a movie to watch, out comes the one that you've never had a chance to watch yet.<br /><br />The thing about M&C is that it's very much a movie aimed at men. There is only one scene which features women, and it's very brief. The rest of the movie features men - manly men, wimpy men, rugged men, MEN. Now, while us ladies like our men, it can be a little bit overpowering especially in a 138 minute long movie. And when some of the cast look like they should be appearing in Oliver. But when you consider that the rumoured love interest for Russell's character was supposed to be Keira Knightley - I'll stick with all the men thanks.<br /><br />But back to the movie. For a 138 minute long movie, I'm surprised that it actually went by so fast. Even the setting didn't get boring - 90% of it is set on a ship after all. And the other setting was Galapagos Islands (I still don't know how to pronouce it).<br /><br />There's a pretty basic plot, but at the same time it's pretty involving, and at one point I was clenching my fists, desperate for the right ship to win. My only quibble was the cast - there was so many of them, I eventually lost track of who was who, and didn't even recognise Paul Bettany, despite having just watched him in Wimbledon. (I thought it was Jason Isaacs - duh.) The cast was very impressive, and all of them played their roles very well - even though I still have no idea who was who. A few of the cast could have easily walked off the ship and straight into a production of Oliver, which made me smile quite a lot.<br /><br />Russell was surprisingly good as well. I tend to stay away from his movies, as I just don't see the appeal. But he's not a terrible actor, and his portrayal of Capt. Jack Aubrey was excellent.<br /><br />There are a few sad moments in the movie, and I started second guessing the ending - but thankfully I was wrong. In my opinion, the ending did fall a bit flat, and it wasn't what I expected, but it was better than what I was expecting. If that makes any sense what so ever.<br /><br />Overall, M&C was an excellent afternoon movie, although I did fall asleep straight afterwards - but fortunately not during! - but just make sure you set aside plenty of time for it, and possibly don't watch when you're in a man-hating mood.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>There's no doubting Peter Weir's skill as a director, nor the indomitable screen presence of &quot;our Russ&quot; when he arcs up, and &quot;Master and Commander, etc.&quot; offers plenty of opportunities for both of them. What it doesn't offer is a particularly compelling story. The rather thin plot blends two novels by Patrick O'Brian, and most of both of them seems to be missing. This film, I guess, isn't about telling a story - it's about recreating life aboard an English naval vessel in 1805, and on that count it succeeds brilliantly, not only in the vividly realised physical details and extraordinary battles, but in the group psychology of men. Still, the central relationship between Captain Aubrey (Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin (Bettany) doesn't go much beyond the &quot;morality vs. duty&quot; cliche - the story doesn't give it a chance to. Overall, this isn't a five-star affair. For all its big-budget realization, it offers little more than a good episode of LWT's &quot;Hornblower&quot;. Actually, I think it offers a bit less. Crowe's swashbuckling bravado isn't a patch Ioan Gruffud's vulnerability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>I found it amusing that Amazon paired this with the Tom Hanks flick Cast Away for the "Best Value" - these movies are very similar in speed and action.  Way too much getting from point "A" to point "B", with little occurring once we arrive at point "B."  This is definitely a film about the journey, not the destination, ie, the fast frightening French Frigate (say that five times!)<p>Our intrepid Captain Crowe seems to be a bit behind the times in naval warfare and very slow on the uptake.  One gets the impression that he blunders his way through challenges. I was grateful for the 8x fast forward speed on my DVD player, as I was thankfully able to skip over a lot of the fluff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>Russell was cheated by not even receiving a nomination for this film.

Unnecessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>It should come as no surprise that Peter Weir's 2003 film "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" would come away from the Academy Awards with two Oscars after receiving ten Oscar nominations.  Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films "The Truman Show" (1998), "Dead Poet's Society" (1989) and "Witness" (1986). He also directed the films "The Year of Living Dangerously" (1982) and "Gallipoli" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director.<br /><br />"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" was based upon the 1970 novel "Master and Commander", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, "The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of "Master and Commander" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby.<br /><br />With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three "Lord of the Rings" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2003 "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.<br /><br />The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.<br /><br />The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.<br /><br />Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship "Acheron", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.<br /><br />The captain of the "Acheron" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.<br /><br />A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I thought the movie was beautifuly filmed- amazingly detailed,but I think needed something more. I found the pacing to be very draggy at times, some segments could've been trimmed to speed it up a bit (the 20 min. of deleted footage on the extras might have helped the movie out by adding more interest?)<br />It might not sound like it but I do like Master And Commander and I'm thinking about buying my own copy.I'll be getting the 2 disc widescreen special edition for all of the extra's it contains because they sound really good, and will make it even more worth owning for not a lot more money.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>About as much fun as playing with your toy boats in the bathtub. These 19th Century British military seamen seem better suited for Never-Never Land and a bottle of rum, given their ridiculous offensive war strategies of disguising the ship and building dummy ships to fool the enemy. I've had better ideas in 'Stratego'. There's a flogging, a tormented officer, an amputation, sentimental characters getting killed, and a good-hearted commander who will stop at nothing to destroy his Napoleonic archenemy. The only thing missing is a great white whale to smash the whole thing to smithereens. Given the current state of seafaring movies, if this were a ride at Disneyland, it would be the safe, innocuous Dumbo elephant ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Okay, okay I know there are fans of this movie that will want to make me walk the plank for this review...BUT......

Captain "Jack" Aubrey (Russell Crowe in a marvelous performance) and the crew of the Surprise pursue a French warship in Atlantic waters. Out gunned and out classed by a heavier, faster ship, Aubrey is determined to take down the French raider before it takes down another of Her Majesty's Ships. This pursuit will cost his crew, his ship but must be done to keep the waters safe for other vessels.<br /><br />The most important question is whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray because of improved picture quality. While "Master and Commander" does look better than the standard DVD and many scenes look truly exceptional, the film looks a bit uneven overall. Could the transfer have been better? Absolutely but owning this on Blu-ray comes down to how much you love/like this film. I suspect that the same original HD master was used for this a couple of years back. It looks extremely good but not as brilliant as I had hoped.<br /><br />Sharp direction by Weir, a masterfully adapted script by Weir and John Colee makes this harrowing sea adventure a worthwhile trip. Weir adds a powerful cinematic flair with the sharp camera work of Russell Boyd. Unlike a lot of previous adventures at sea, the fluid camera work adds to the sense of menace and danger that Aubry and his crew feel.<br /><br />The extras are similar to the original single disc DVD which is a bit disappointing especially considering how much Fox is charging for their Blu Ray discs (particularly compared to Warner). All the extras are in high definition which is good news. We get deleted scenes, a historical and geographical trivia track, a pop up map showing you where the H.M.S. Surprise is at any given moment, the theatrical trailer and the ability to search and save your favorite scenes.<br /><br />There's no commentary track nor are there any featurettes on the making of the film. Considering this IS a Blu-Ray disc, I'd expect the featurettes from the deluxe DVD edition of the film if nothing else but, sadly, we don't get it. I suspect we'll see a Blu-Ray double dip shortly.<br /><br />I can recommend the movie on Blu-ray simply because it has a superb looking transfer with nice detail and without the over use of digital clean up (a problem for "Patton" which is one of the worst looking Blu-Ray's I've seen--not because of the image itself but because of the overuse of digital tools to clean up the film creating waxy looking skin textures, loss of general detail and adding an unnecessary digital "look" to the film to eliminate film grain).</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Over the years, there have been many films set on board sailing vessels.  None, however, catch the mood of ship board life as well as "Master and Commander".<p>I would expect this film to rate well in the forthcoming Oscars.  Crowe's role is absolutely dominant. He is truly the master and commander in this seafaring epic.<p>I have been told that the original book involved an American ship as the "baddies" but, to sell the story to the US market, a French ship was put in its place.  This has no impact on the overall film which is quite awe inspiring.<p>Peter Weir's direction of the film is magnificent.  The on board scenes with the rigging creaking and the ship rolling are totally believable.  There is also a "cameo role" for the Galapagos Islands where the ship's doctor moves to within a whisker of scooping Darwin.  <p>I recommend this film to all ages and sexes.  It is seemingly an all boys story that manages to appeal to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>See this opening credit.  Three big powers of Hollywood --  Miramax, Universal, and 20th Century Fox -- joined forces to produce "Master and Commander," a thrilling adventure tale of HMS Surprise, led by Captain Jack Aubrey, set in 1805.  He is ordered to capture (or sink) the formidable emeny ship the Acheron, without any support from other ships.<p>The story, based on Patric O'Brien books, is simple.  Russell Crowe's Captain is determined to chase the Acheron, whatever it takes, and in the following two hours you see the fierce battles, and very brief, quiet time of peace.  Paul Bettany is doctor of the ship, and Captain's most trusted friend, and their friendship also plays the major part of the film.<p>But you want to know whether the battle scenes of the film deserve your time and money.  They do.  The authentic descriptions of the fighting on the sea in the 19th century, when good use of the wind and the cannonballs decided the winner, are presented with confidence and tact.  They are not bloody as the real ones perhaps, but the danger of being there is easily felt.<p>My complaint is the film's occasional lull (including the literal one), in which the onward action so far, suddenly without warning, changes to a different theme.  When you think a chase between the two ships is about to start, the scene switches to a big storm.  When you think the ship is heading south, nearing the icy continent, you find the ship had already changed its course, going north.  This quick change, with episodic mode, comes probably from the way of adaptation of the original books, which are too long to be put into film.<p>Russell Crowe (who put on weight for the role) is always good at playing this kind of character with machismo, and that's no surprise when he is so perfect, but more astonishing is Paul Bettany, who underwent the complete transformation from his past gangster No. 1 images to a thoroughly intelligent Dr. Maturin.  You recongnize in him no "MC Chaucer" he did "Knight's Tale," and that is amazing.  <p>Peter Weir's direction is assured and well-paced, but to some the film's pace looks too slow at first.  He does not hurry to show the excitement of the battles or storm, and that shows his unshaken confidence in the material.  In fact, "Master and Commander" is a good case of "the images tell everything," and to watch it is like seeing a majectic battleship gliding gracefully on the ocean.  And it's so beautiful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.<br /><br />Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship "Acheron".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.<br /><br />The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a thrilling drama and as a glimpse into the British Royal Navy at what was arguably its peak as the best navy in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>This was a very clear movie. A lot of information was gained from the communication between the characters, and it was easy to understand that they were chasing that ship because of the captain's sense of purpose and duty. It was full of incident, and every scene added to the movie's depth. It was interesting all the way, and there was plenty of excitement. In the end the captain was fooled by the enemy captain faking his identity, so it was decided to escort the French prize back to Valparaiso. There weren't any useless scenes to delete, and the ending was good. A very entertaining and instructive movie, and definitely worth watching, even if you're not a Russell Crowe fan.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Master and Commander is the stunning epic tale of the British ship Surprise and its mission to find and defeat an enemy French vessel during the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series of books. And when I heard the film was out upon DVD, I had to watch it.  Visually- I thought Master and Commander was stunning. In particular Russell Crowe as "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. The crew were well portrayed, and the ships and cinematography quite simply gorgeous. My one and only disappointment was the character of Doctor Maturin (Paul Bettany). For one thing. Where's his wig? Maturin always wore a wig. Second, the character was supposed to be Irish, and quite a bit more eccentric than he is portrayed in the film. This Maturin was quite normal, and even rather dull. Hmmm... Not how I envisioned this character. The actor couldn't even muster an accent!<br /><br />At any rate, the film was an excellent but shallow taste of the Aubrey/Maturin saga. If you like what you see here. Read the books. They explore the characters of Aubrey and Maturin in detail, and contain much more than just battles... But an excellent glimpse of what it was like to sail the seas in the 1800's.</p></br></body></html>

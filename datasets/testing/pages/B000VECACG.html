I was not living in North America at the time and saw it while on vacation from Britain. I'd seen no trailers or other publicity, so I came to it with no preconceptions whatever. I found the sense of wonder in the movie and the gradual drawing together of the threads to the climax to be fascinating; and the climax itself, on a giant screen, was awe-inspiring. I've never got quite the same feeling of magic from any other movie. It's 35 years since the movie burst upon the scene and evidence of its influence is still seen in numerous movies (most recently 'Super 8'), but nothing has quite matched the original. It is truly a seminal movie of the genre.<br /><br />The drawback about seeing it on DVD is that, even with today's large-screen TVs, the movie needs a bigger stage to deliver maximum impact. It's still a wonderful film, one which I continue to enjoy after many, many viewings, but I'm so glad my first experience of it was in the theater, totally unprepared for what I was about to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>Loved this film.  I have the Collectors Edition and know nothing about Bluray, though it seems there are many reviews that talk more about Bluray and techy stuff than about the story. I don't have bluray, and my DVD is just fine!  I very much enjoyed the 2nd disc Collectors Edition, and the discussions with Spielberg, the editors, artists, musicians, actors and others who made this such an enjoyable film.  Mainly because it was just so much FUN to watch!<br /><br />I give it more than 5 stars, as all the fantasy (fantastic) scenes were made without today's help from computers.  Everything they did was done without computers and it still looked real.  As much as I love Harry Potter, and I do,  I doubt it could have been made or even attempted without computers.<br /><br />I"m glad I bought the 2 disk version because the 2nd disk explained so much about the making of the film and the selection of the characters.  The little boy in the film, now all grown up explains how such a little child was able to attain the expressions, the wide eyed looks and his adorable smile that a kitchen gone crazy might have frightened a child of his age (I think he was about 4).  (He was my favorite character.)<br /><br />Terry Garr was perfect in her role as the bewildered wife and Richard Dreyfus, perfect as the man whose mind had gone far off kilter so that he could follow a strange obsession placed there by the UFO, uh, characters.  Great music by John Williams (per usual) and Francois Truffaut, an excellent French actor and director brought a kind of scientific reality to the whole fantasy. Can there be UFOS? I doubt it, but who knows?</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>The sign of a classic movie is how well it ages and "Close Encounters ..." seems to get better over the years and the more times you watch it.  This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey" from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it.  Franchises like The "X-Files" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.<br /><br />This one-disc Collector's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very, very well for an excellent picture and sound quality.  I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous!  I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout.  I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you'll need to get the 2-Disc version.  For those who just want a great Director's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself, this is a very good dvd version to get.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In a town in Indiana, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) while investigating a strange power outage in the town he witnesses a UFO that flies above him and gives him a special sunburn as proof.

That is the way Close Encounters makes me feel; when I was 8, 18 and 28. Spielberg has created such masterpieces that have shaped our lives. I thank him. I thank him.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Even though Spielberg "trimmed" the film a few years after its initial release, there still remain some really slow scenes, especially at the home of stars Dreyfuss and Garr.  The actors do there best to work the "family thing" but the scenes are prolonged and drag the story line.  More effective are the ones with Melinda Dillon and the precocious Cary Guffey as a mother and son, respectively, terrorized by nocturnal and unseen visitors.<br /><br />That said, the end when the Earthmen and aliens finally make contact is breathtaking.  Coupled with the special effects and John Williams's magnificent score, CETK is a science fiction classic that still manages to captivate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>This film is a true science fiction classic.  When it was first released in 1977, it competed with Star Wars as one of the top films of the year.  Richard Dreyfus stars as Ray Neary, a man who  suddeenly begins to have visions and hear voices.  Terri Garr stars as Dreyfus' wife.  Finally, Ray's visions begin to take strange turns, and he ends up constructing a model of Devil's Tower in his living room.  By this time, his wife and children have left him.  Meanwhile, odd occurances are happening all over the world.  A flight of Navy torpedo bombers missing since 1945 suddenly shows up in Mexico in almost brand new condition, and a ship is found in the middle of the Gobi Desert.  The voices finally lead Ray and others to Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  There, a large spaceship lands with people that have been missing for years, including the pilots of the torpedo bombers.<p>This movie is loaded with special effects which were excellent for their time, and it still remains one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  All sci-fi fans should watch this excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>I remember watching this movie in great amazement when I was a child.  It is such a great movie.  When I'd heard that it would be on DVD I had to rush out and get it.  I watched it with my ten year old stepson and he watched it with the same enthusiasm that I remember in myself.  Close Encounter's is truly one on the classics.  A wonderful movie to watch with your family.  If you've not seen it, you need to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>For anyone who loves X-files or anything dealing with the arrival of aliens on this planet, this is the film for you! The special effects are awesome and the story is brilliantly written and acted. and while there are government conspiracies, they are not as evil as in X-files. Close Encounters is a beautiful film that asks us to think about many questions dealing with life beyond earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>Director Steven Spielberg's classic 1977 follow-up to &quot;Jaws,&quot; &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; stars Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary.  Neary's just an ordinary blue collar guy, a bit of a dreamer with a taste for Disney films and miniature railroads... until he witnesses a spectacular UFO appearance.  Haunted by mental images of a mountain he's never seen before, Neary risks his job, his marriage, his sanity and, eventually, his life to uncover what it all means.<br /><p>&quot;Close Encounters&quot; also marks the first appearance of the Spielberg formula.  You know, the messy suburban house, the mouthy kids, the whole &quot;just plain folks involved with something magical&quot; storyline.  And while he gets a lot of knocks, both justified and unjustified, for inflicting this on American movies in the 80s, Spielberg's use of documentary-like elements throughout (as the space people play some Burmuda Triangle-related tricks on what's apparently an international investigation team) and some funky casting (Teri Garr, French director Francois Truffaut, Bob Balaban and others) combine to lend this one a veracity some of his later films- and those of his imitators- sometimes lack.  This is a very fresh and original take on sci-fi subject matter, completely without physical violence (although there is some of the emotional kind).  Seeing decades later after so many heartless, bombastic, noise and light CGI fests, one can't help but admire Spielberg's ability to get to the emotional core of this material.<br /><p>Plus, it helps that the cutesy elements are kept to a minimum.  There's Melinda Dillon as a single mom whose oh-so-adorable-with-his-big-eyes kid gets kidnapped by the UFOs; the scene is played for scares, rather than laughs and it is genuinely terrifying.  Neary's kids are mostly unpleasant, and gone after the halfway point.  Dreyfuss downplays Neary's potential drippyness and plays up his frustration and rage as circumstances overwhelm him.  And Garr is very believable as Neary's doubtful wife; she keeps the character from becoming a one-note shrew.  You actually sympathize with her as she deals with what she thinks is her husband's selfish midlife crisis.<br /><p>The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent &quot;Jaws&quot; disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.  A handsome release.<br /><p>Look for Lance Henrickson in a small role.  He'd later appear as one of the Mercury 7 in &quot;The Right Stuff,&quot; and investigate the unknown on &quot;Millenium.&quot;  And Carl &quot;Apollo Creed&quot; Weathers as a National Guardsman!</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>There's been a raging argument since this film's release back in the late 70's: which is the better science fiction film, STAR WARS or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND?<p>I think those who've engaged that argument have been going about debate much the wrong way, for there are really no similarities in these two pictures except for the fact that both includes aliens and otherworldly craft ... but the comparison really stops there.<p>After its initial release, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS enjoyed a second release not much later with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: THE SPECIAL EDITION, which added footage cut and/or reshot to make the film a bit closer to visionary Steven Spielberg's dream picture.  The added footage, however, really was tacked onto the end of the film, giving viewers a glance inside the Mothership of the UFOs that have been haunting Earth.<p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND: THE SPECIAL EDITION is an amalgam of the two films, preserving the best essence of the two pictures by creating one complete whole.<p>Perhaps the greatest nod to this film is that there would be no THE X FILES without this film having been made.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS paved the way found countless variations on the theme of extraterrestrial contact.  In fact, Spielberg himself had initially dubbed E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL as the unofficial sequel to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but he changed his mind last minute as the two films really have very little linkage.<p>This two-disc compilation boasts an excellent digitally mastered (audio and visual) product along with Dolby DTS and Dolby 5.1.  The second disc includes a Making of Documentary that gives some valuable history to the picture as well as commenting seriously on the films of Spielberg as a whole.  The deleted scenes add little to a film that already holds a complete rung on the ladder of the film industry.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Finally it's back: the 1977 version of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, never released on VHS or DVD before. (It had a brief life on laser disc. However, since the LD format never became truly mass market, it's fairly safe to say this is the first time most people will be seeing this version since it was in theaters.) Despite all its warts--and they are considerable--this is the best version by far in my opinion. It's also an illustration of the changes that have come over Steven Spielberg in his career, in my opinion.<br /><br />Throughout filming, Spielberg supposedly said he wanted the movie to feel like an embrace. It was take its time unfolding. The 1977 version comes closest to that. The story unfolds gradually and has more mystery, more contrasting moments of silence and noise, of darkness and light, and, in the music, of dissonance and consonance. More time is spent with the Neary family, observing how they live (uber-typical 70s middle-class suburban family). This makes the journey Roy Neary takes more pronounced--I don't mean just the physical journey from the midwest to Wyoming, but the emotional journey, the change in his lifestyle, etc. Some wonderful moments, like the frayed family evident at the beginning of the mashed potato scene where he walks in bleary-eyed and confronts a tense family, define his and their characters and were trimmed down in the 1980 re-edit, to make room for a horribly-miscalculated inside-the-mothership scene that even Spiels now admits was wrong. And all versions after 1977 also omit the "pillow coda" at the end of the scene where Neary is fired from his job--why I can't imagine. I always thought it was Spielberg at his most clever and inventive, and it fits right in with the suburbanish tone the film's been cultivating till then.<br /><br />Also in the '77 edition is Neary's encounter with an army MP when he goes to the Wyoming evacuation station (a very young Carl Weathers).  Again, why SS cut this in every subsequent print I'll never understand. As the scene plays in '80 and thereafter, it seems as though Neary strolls through ten thousand evacuees and finds Jillian in two minutes.<br /><br />Perhaps even more interesting--and revealing--is now Spielberg changed the order of the scenes after 1977. Surely he likes the second version, since he kept it for the DVD redo in 1997, but I think I may just prefer the first way overall. Originally Spielberg did far less cross-cutting (or checkerboarding, as another Amazon reviewer describes it) between the two narratives, giving us lots of Neary and his home life in the first third, then spending a lot of time with Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his team of scientists in India, at an auditorium, and at a radio telescope in the desert. In the later editions we get alternating scenes of Neary and Lacombe, an extra unnecessary scene of the scientific team (sans Truffaut, who was probably not available in 1980) in the Gobi desert, with sort of parallel stories. The cross-cutting, and the fact that many of the "heads and tails," or the beginnings and endings of scenes, were cut shorter, presumably to quicken the pace, gives the movie a terser, more "action-oriented" feel. And that's where I think you learn a lot about Spielberg and his career.<br /><br />This is just speculation, but I feel that in the 1970s, Spiels was interested in making a more personal, more sprawling and slow-moving film (the "embrace" feeling). According to producer Julia Phillips, who can't always be trusted but here is probably credible, after George Lucas' Star Wars, released a few months before, started smashing box office records, Spielberg gutted family scenes and added more special effects. In the 1980 rerelease even more family time is subtracted and there are more special effects and action. There are more harsh cuts. This is more in the style of the 80s school of popular filmmaking vs. the "New Hollywood" style of the 70s. (If you don't know what the New Hollywood movement is, consult Wikipedia.) I have to wonder if by then Spielberg, pushing himself to have one mega-success after another, was embracing the likes of Robert Zemeckis, James Cameron, latter-day George Lucas and others--or, if not them, for they were still in their infancy, at least the more rapid-action qualities of 80s films. As reviewer James Plath of one website, DVDtown.com, puts it: "Young viewers might find it slower going, though, because Spielberg develops characters and relationships as much as he explores the kind of strange phenomena that leads human believers to a point in Wyoming that the U.S. government has been trying to keep top-secret."<br /><br />The 1997 edition is closer to 1980, but thank heavens the horrible trip inside the mothership was excised--and burned, let's hope. Overall, though, the balance of the '97 cut takes its cues from the 1980 and not the 1977 film. I have to respectfully disagree. Though flawed and a bit awkward, the '77 version feels more personal, more about the Neary *family,* than the later versions. If all this sounds confusing and you think you need a flowchart, well, guess what? One is actually provided in the DVD box, explaining all the changes and where they happen along the time-line. On the flipside of this chart is a reproduction of the original 1977 theatrical poster. It's printed on thick, heavy paper that should last, too.<br /><br />While I love the 1977 version most, here you have all three, so you can't lose. You also can't lose in the digital remastering of picture and sound, because these prints--all of them--look better than the last DVD incarnation, of the 1997 cut. Also I think, though I haven't done direct comparisons, that the sound is clearer, particularly in the simultaneous-dialogue scenes.<br /><br />Close Encounters itself is a guilty-pleasure of mine. I love the atmosphere Spielberg suffuses the film with--you can *feel* his joy, his enthusiasm. He's thought about every camera move, every framing and reframing, every costume and set detail. It's a movie for the senses. At the same time, Spielberg's weakness also shine through, and this film has flaws you can drive a truck (or fly a mothership) through. There are plot holes and irrationalities galore: why roll a giant globe off its stand and into a radio telescope room when you can more easily carry a piece of paper with the coordinates into the room with the globe? If you're scientists on a secret mission, why hide your scientific gear in food trucks? If you are stopped by some authority and you have scientific equipment inside a Baskin Robbins vehicle, that looks suspicious, while a plain unmarked truck with a fake invoice claiming a delivery to the University of Wyoming is far more credible. Also, why drive the guys in the red suits on what appears to be a rented bus? Just charter a jet, and skip the suits. (Why are they wearing their red suits before they get to Wyoming anyway? Do they sleep in them?) If you're trying to be hush-hush secret, why rent a stadium that seats 100,000 to teach *fifty* technicians the hand signals? Why *do* the hand signals in the first place? To an alien creature, they may mean, "You momma wears army boots." What's the meaning of the "jam session"? Even someone on earth from, say, in Indian or African culture would not be able to "sit in" with Western jazz musicians; the musical elements are too different. Why build a giant mountain in your living room, when the backyard would do far better? Why tell the earthlings to go to Devil's Tower two different ways, by sending coordinates to the scientists and implanting a "picture" in the minds of others?  Why not just implant the picture in everyone?  --And so on. I won't even go into dynamiting and bulldozing a huge chunk of government land protected by reams of federal legislation!  And gassing people on the side of a mountain and leaving them there to die of hypothermia or have them picked apart by wolves?  Hmmm....<br /><br />The joy of watching Close Encounters is seeing the life Spielberg can breathe into something as mundane as a farmhouse or a country road against a starry sky, or witnessing the effortless performance he coaxes out of little Barry Guiler. Don't ask questions and enjoy the spectacle. This movie literally saved a near-bankrupt Columbia studios from going under, but it's hardly a calculated corporate entertainment. Though epic and chock full of special effects, it's also oddly personal. (Spielberg at the time was a believer in UFOs, or at least sympathetic towards them.)  And the effects were groundbreaking for the time and still hold up extremely well today--notice that Spielberg didn't have to digitally re-do anything when he rereleased this film in 1997, unlike Lucas' patch-ups with Star Wars.  So this is a fun film in the spirit of the old fashioned Hollywood epics, and a reminder of just why I fell so in love with movies and the director's role in them in the first place. I feel like saying to the 1977 edition what Merrill Connally says to the returning Navy flyers: "Welcome back."<br /><br />(Bit of trivia: note the prominence of Coca Cola brand placement.  Columbia was romancing Coke to buy them while this film was being made, and in fact Coke did buy Columbia the very next year.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>It had been years since I had watched this film and i wanted to see whether it would have the same impact on me as it when i saw it almost 20 years ago.<p>  Perhaps unsurprisingly it was every bit as intimidating, eerie, and tremendously entertaining as it was back then.<p>  Ask any UFO buff and he/she'll tell you that when it comes to films about the &quot;objects in the sky&quot; there are very few, extremely few, that can demand good notes from the audiences.<br />  &quot;Close encounters&quot; is definately one of them, a film that despite a near 30 yrs after its release it still jumps at you (small screen or big) and is at the same time thought provoking.<p>  Spielberg has some tremendous (especially at the box office) hits under his belt but in the minds of many this might be one of his very best films. If not the best.<p>  As &quot;they&quot; arrive with lightning-speed craft that cruise the skies of a small american town, scanning and patroling while getting the attention of every local in sight it seems like a collective obsession takes over the residents and the viewers together.<p>  What do they want? Who are they? <p>  The questions, the fear, the immense intimidation, the complications and the implications come through in brilliant manner through all the characters that parade through this classic film.<p>  But what still impresses is that &quot;Close encounters&quot; manages to remain intelligent even if you see it today. That might sound<br />like a moot point to those that love this film but it's a legitimate point. Spielberg doesnt ridicule the issue, doesnt attempt to offer some laughable debunking, doesnt dismiss it, but instead takes it full-on with the seriousness it demands.<br />  And even when the film has its funny moments the focus isnt lost for a single second.<p>  All the more wowing is the fact that effects still look pretty damn good and i saw it in my small living room TV. Sure, it might reek of that 70s aura all along but that's inevitable and it really doeasn't come across as annoying, if anything that even adds to the charm.<p>  Funny and certinaly bizzare that I havent seen a good film with this theme in a long, long while, unless we consider braindead disasters like &quot;Independence day&quot; contenders.<br />  This is why i picked up to the DVD and the reward factor was immense.<br />  The extra features on this limited edition disc are seriously interesting as well.<br />  Way up there with the cinematic classics regardless of genre. If you havent seen this check it out.<br />  Timeless stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>I really liked the way this movie used mystery and linked it with good feelings. Spielberg and others who worked on this film, used their imaginations to create positive symbols for the unknown. Roy who was played by Richard Dreyfuss, was child like in his excitement and drive to discover and learn more about his encounter. His child like desire seems to touch the viewer and get them caught up in the movie, feeling his fascination. He kept saying, &quot;I know this is important&quot;! The film has awesome special effects and for that time period was really spectacular. It is definately a classic, at least for me. The only sad part was that Roy's family left him. They seemed like a happy, busy, bustling family before Roy's encounter. Instead of supporting him, they turned away with fear and distance. I felt that was dissappointing. Although, I liked watching him build the mud mountain in his living room, if I was his wife, I may have drawn the line of support there. I also liked Teri Garr's performance. I think she is a good and funny actor. Wouldn't it be eerie to experience an encounter? It kinda makes you wonder if anything is being covered up out there, stuff they don't want you to know about???<br />Lisa Nary</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>Are we alone? Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a classic American film. It was directed by Stephan Spielberg and stars Richard Dreyfus.  This film set the tone for much of what happened at the movies for roughly the next 15-20 years following its 1977 theatrical release. Close Encounters is essentially a near perfect product defining the time it came out.  The film explores alien visitors, government conspiracies, general paranoia, sensationalism. family issues, and ultimately madness.  The depth these issues are explored make this film a hallmark of American cinema. It is the movie version of imagination and wonder. This is a philosophy and vision regarding what an alien visit to the planet would look like.  There is no war and nothing is getting blown up. The main thing happening is communication. It is amazing. It is done in a such a thoughtful way that it stands effectively as an excellent contribution to the collective consciousness imagination about such matters as alien visits. After repeat viewings the most important question is: What do you believe? This is a human film that defines the medium of movie making.<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Cableman Roy Neary is one of several people who experience a close encounter of the first kind, witnessing UFOs flying through the night sky. He is subsequently haunted by a mountainlike image in his head and becomes obsessed with discovering what it represents, putting severe strain on his marriage. Meanwhile, government agents around the world have a close encounter of the second kind, discovering physical evidence of otherworldly visitors in the form of military vehicles that went missing decades ago suddenly appearing in the middle of nowhere. Roy and the agents both follow the clues they have been given to reach a site where they will have a close encounter of the third kind. Powerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Strange events around the world foreshadow the first contact between mankind and aliens.  Several people who encounter UFOs are psychically imprinted with an impulse to converge on the meeting area, including a worker for the phone company (Richard Dreyfuss) and a mother (Melinda Dillon) searching for her abducted son (Cary Guffey).<br /><br />I'm not sure which of the three (at least) versions of this film I saw.  I didn't get to see the interior of the ship at the end, but I did see the scene in which Dreyfuss tears up his yard to construct a replica of the mountain in his visions; that may provide a clue to those who are more knowledge about this movie than I.  There may be a superior version of this film out there, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  No one can convey that sense of wonder better than Stephen Spielberg at his best.  The story structure is very effective, alternating between the intellectually stimulating narrative of two scientists (Francois Truffaut and Bob Balaban) who are investigating the unusual phenomena and the intense, personal stories of two people who don't understand what is happening to them.

My friends and I were watching for UFOs in 1966. Somehow, Dreyfuss got into the three biggest movies of the 1970s. In Close Encounters, he is obsessed with an image in his mind. It turns out to be Devil's Tower in Wyoming, a vertical monolith created by erosion and the nation's first National Monument. Dreyfuss is drawn to an alien landing. "The Third Kind" indicates actual contact with UFOs. The film tries to create a sense of realism. So far, UFO stories have been hoaxes and science fiction. Where does Dreyfuss go with his aliens?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's 1977 UFO classic, is the thematic antitheses to 1996's Independence Day.  While Roland Emmerich's ID4 is a throwback to 1950s "invaders from space" flicks, Spielberg's vision of a "close encounter" between humanity and extraterrestrials is more mysterious and, in the end, more hopeful and awe-inspiring.  Instead of exchanging bullets and "heat rays," humans and aliens communicate by using musical notes.<p>Spielberg's screenplay divides Close Encounters roughly into three acts, basically corresponding to each of the three kinds of  "encounters."<p>In the first category, sightings of a UFO, we first see a very strange sight in the Mexican desert: an international team of researchers led by French UFO expert Lacombe (the late Francois Truffaut) and guided by several Mexican Federales finds five World War II vintage Grumman TBM Avengers.  The planes are abandoned but strangely intact, as though they were brand new.  "Who flies this kind of plane?" asks a bewildered cartographer/interpreter named Laughlin (Bob Balaban). <p>"No one," replies another astonished researcher. "This is Flight 19."<p>(Flight 19, of course, is a reference to a Navy training flight which took off from Ft. Lauderdale one morning in December 1945 and vanished, along with a Martin Mariner search plane sent up to look for the missing planes and crews.  Flight 19 is now famous in the lore of unsolved mysteries related to the Bermuda triangle.)<p> Laughlin is baffled by something else, as well.  A Mexican villager, old, sunburned, and seemingly delirious, keeps repeating, "El sol salio anoche y me canto. El sol salio anoche y me canto."  When Laughlin asks what the phrase mean, a researcher who is fluent in Spanish says, in an awed tone, "He says the sun came out last night.  He says it sang to him."<p>Later, in the Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, a more dramatic close encounter of the first kind plays out on the radar scopes as airliner pilots call in reports of bright lights in the sky and unknown contacts make their presence known.  For a few tense minutes it look as though tragedy is imminent, but within moments the contacts vanish into the night sky.  Torn between reporting a UFO sighting or just letting the incident slide by, pilots and air traffic controllers alike opt to keep quiet, mainly to avoid having to fill out tons of bureaucratic paperwork.<p>As important as these sequences are, the focus of Spielberg's story is on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an employee of a Midwestern power company whose life on Earth is ordinary, hectic, and somewhat unfulfilling.  Sent out to investigate a section of power lines in rural Indiana (caused, of course, by the UFOs' passage), Neary has a close encounter of the first kind and impulsively goes on a truck-borne pursuit of two small "flying saucers."  This sequence, which ends with a Keystone Kops-like police chase of the same UFOs, triggers an obsession within Neary that neither his wife Ronnie (Teri Garr) nor his children will understand, much less accept.  Neary, along with several hundred other people from different towns and states, will soon be haunted by both a visual image and a simple five-note musical phrase.  The traces of the UFO flights that leave traces behind (sunburn on people who, like Neary, were exposed to bright light at night) are known as close encounters of the second kind.<p>Spielberg weaves Neary's everyman-faces-an-extraordinary- situation plot with the official investigations being carried out by the UN-sponsored Lacombe team and a more secretive U.S. government First Contact program.  These plot threads will all lead to a climactic and awe-inspiring close encounter of the third kind: actual (and documented) contact between humanity and another space-faring civilization.<p>The Columbia/Tri-Star Collector's Edition brings not only a newly re-edited version (trimming some excess material from the 1980 Special Edition) of the 1977 film, but also comes with a second disc loaded with extras such as a Laurent Bouzereau documentary on the making of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a 1977 promotional featurette, and the theatrical trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>This is a movie that truly proves "We are not alone"! Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors in cinema today. This 1977 classic features a superb cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr and Francois Truffaut. The visual effects are spellbinding.

Don't miss this classic Spielberg spellbinder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great example of a film doing away with conventions and making a compelling and even magical film that you can't imagine being made today. When it comes down to my top 5 favorite films ever, this tends to interchange with E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Whereas that film is still touching and more emotional, Close Encounters is filled with a visual splendor where the images are made to show us the wonder of things that can happen. Despite Spielberg's claim that it's the one film that "dates" him, it's still arguably one of his best, even in light of Schindler's List or Jaws.<br /><br />Roy Neery is a blue-collar family man who, while on the job, has a strange encounter with a craft with bright lights in the sky. The experience ends up changing him and pretty soon he becomes obsessed with it and one particular image which causes much trouble with his wife and kids. Elsewhere, a frenchman named Mr. Lacombe and his interpreter Laughlin are finding strange things around the world such as planes and ships in the desert and a curious 5 note melody. All of this ends up tying together in the end as everyone discovers something life changing.<br /><br />In the days of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, one thing that was never lost on Spielberg was making even mundane scenes interesting. From radio traffic controllers encountering something strange to Lacombe showing the famous hand signals matching the musical notes, nothing in this film seems wasted. Which of course makes the completely memorable images all the more striking such as Roy's truck going haywire, mother Jillian getting unwelcome visitors in her house to seeing just how massive the final ship is compared to the mountain, this film never feels like it just lags.<br /><br />One of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go "well...thought it would be cool" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.<br /><br />Is it as exciting and popcorn fun as Jaws? Or as serious and character driven as Schindler's List? Well no but that's beside the point since this is a film where you're almost glad something that feels this against the grain exists.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>Spielberg's vision of the outerworld is brilliant and captavating. The film is long, but it demands attention. Stephen wrote this and directed it. Dreyfuss is good, but a little to strong in his character. Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant, so is Teri Garr. This film makes you think, can the government actually pull this off?...After seeing this, I believe it. The DTS version is incredible, the scene where Barry,(little boy), is abducted, is just out right crazy and loud.<br />  Dreyfuss,(a man on a mission), has had a close encounter, is out to find out where and why. Believe me, if this was you, you would have sleepless nights. Dialogue is good, FX, is incredible for 1977, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC. Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough, and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams. Spielberg is the man, and he was only 28 then, War of the Worlds basically relies on CGI effects, still fun, but this is the best(friendly) alien encounter film ever. Hope that didn't spoil anything. Entertaining, hands down, or up, if your reaching for the dark skys.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and I have no idea how many times I've watched the awesome and stunning masterpiece "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind" indeed is. The effects (still today, and not just for its' time) somehow work to make the movie timeless, and the same with the story. How many people doesn't still look to the sky for answers of the great unknown that's above us for sure, the universe is there serving us with its' giantness and all that yet undiscovered out there making our imagination go wild -and that's what makes this movie as facinating as it still is today!<br /><br />The wondeful Richard Dreyfuss in the lead, of course it is well acted -from most of the actors at least. The locations, somewhere in Montana (?) -perfect. Beautiful pictures of the nightsky, fantastic spaceship(s), the movie is sometimes witty, sometimes sad and gripping -the story being as complex yet as simple as it is. It's the story of a family falling apart, and a story of serial of un-explainable events witnessed by a father (Dreyfuss) that drives him to do things that makes it look as if he is going insane, he becomes obsessed. And much more to that of course.<br /><br />I have no idea which version I have seen, could they not just release the extended version once and for all? That is the only stupid thing about this movie, or perhaps its' makers that is.<br /><br />Great picture, great sound (dts), legendary movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>It's a pity that Close Encounters was so badly overshadowed by "Star Wars" when it was released, because it IS an intriguing movie. Although a bit slow, the ending is exciting and the realism makes it worth watching. Just how WOULD aliens contact earthlings (and would anybody believe them?), how would the government handle it, and what would happen..... Spielberg gives us a definite hint of his greatness to come with this 70s classic. Worth adding to your collection. John William's score alone is worth buying</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Lost in the hype around Star Wars, this gem of a movie is the smart man's "sci-fi" film.

This is the movie that makes you think: ARE WE ALONE?</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Strange things are happening around the world; things that challenge the imagination and open the mind to possibilities almost beyond imagining.  Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain, which he does in his monumental epic of man's encounter with alien life, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."  Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert; a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert; and in Dharmsala, Northern India, hundreds of people are gathered together, singing--a short "tune" that consists of a mere five notes, over and over, repeatedly.  When they are asked where they heard this tune, the throng, as one, dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky.  And, indeed, in the skies all around the world, strange things are happening. <p>And even as these events are transpiring, one evening in Muncie, Indiana, the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is at home when it hits, and he is called in by the power company for which he works, then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location.  Lost, he sits in his pick-up truck at a railroad crossing, studying a map, when all at once he notices a "disturbance" around him.  Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves; then things inside his truck begin to move, subtly at first, then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornado--and then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light.  He leans out the window for a look, but it's too bright and he has to pull back.  Then just as abruptly, it all stops-- the disturbance, the light-- everything.  And he looks out the window again; but this time he sees something.  And though he doesn't realize it at the time, at that moment, his life changed forever.<p>In this wonderfully realized, highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg, he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie.  Roy becomes lost in thought, drifting, unable to focus on anything, much to the consternation of his wife, Ronnie (Teri Garr).  But he can't help himself; something-- an image-- has begun to form in his mind.  He has no idea what it is or what it means, but it becomes an obsession, and slowly it begins to take shape:  First in a handful of shaving cream, then in a plate of mashed potatoes, which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork, while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment.  But he can see it in his mind, and it's like a mountain-- a mountain shaped like a "tower."  And Roy isn't the only one.  Around the world, others are being drawn to the same image in their minds, and it's a force that compels them, pushing them on to find whatever it is, a power so strong in cannot be denied or refused.  They know only one thing:  Whatever it is, it's important, and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead.  And it becomes a great adventure, one in which they discover what Man has long suspected:  We are not alone.<p>Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary, a regular guy-- he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone-- and gives a thoroughly convincing, introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure.  Garr does a good job, as well, as Ronnie, the wife concerned with her husband's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior, someone with whom you can certainly sympathize.  Dillon delivers, too, as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events, and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey, as Barry, Jillian's son, who makes his own connection with the other-worldly visitors. <p>The supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut (Lacombe), Bob Balaban (Laughlin) and Lance Henriksen (Robert).  An uplifting, positive motion picture, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is thoroughly entertaining, as well as thought provoking.  Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can, with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify-- all of which adds up to an absorbing, memorable and enjoyable experience, and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Admittedly, an engaging, enchanting film.  25 years later the performance of French film director Francois Truffaut as a foreign scientist, Richard Dreyfuss's obsession with mashed potatoes, and the sonic exploration of the octave and its overtones remain nestled in the viewer's subconscious, if not conscious, memory.  But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation, once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture, had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities.  The &quot;story&quot; represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities, conflicts, risky human relationships, and life itself.  Another capitalistic commodity pretending to renounce a way of life it in fact promotes and is inextricably bound to, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is the first of many blockbuster &quot;Third Kind&quot; epics to achieve success on the big screen.  Play it with a good sound system.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>This is a great 2-disk set of one of my favorite Spielberg films.

There is an excellent scene at the Neary's neighborhood barbeque where Roy (Richard Dreyfuss) must explain his half-suntanned face.  Teri Garr does a wonderful job.<p>Also, the documentary on this disk is incredible.  It is much more thorough (and seems to be a longer version) than the one that was included on the recent VHS release.<p>The film remains a classic.  Some of the night scenes (especially on the country road set) look like they didn't transfer well (i.e. grainy and faded blacks).

I'm glad it is gone on this version.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>I was really surprised how well this film held up.  A marvelous movie with marvelous DVD extras.  Don't be surprised if the ending is different than you remember.  This is actually the ORIGINAL ending to the film, not the ending that Spielberg was persuaded to put on the &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-release of the movie.  The other ending is contained in the special features, if you miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>I am glad Spielberg re-edited the film and included the scene where the ocean liner is found in the Gobi desert(this scene was originally dropped in the initial 1977 release). There are also scenes that were dropped for the 1981 Special Edition release that are included here such as the Air Force press conference, and the footage of Dreyfuss tearing up his neighbors duck pond and yard to create his Devil's tower.  One thing is missing however, and I think Speilberg made a mistake not to include the footage of Dreyfuss going inside the mothership on this version. Sound is incredible on DVD version. Special features include trailers, teasers, outtakes, and a cool documentary with interviews by cast and crew.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Laserdisc collectors already have the definitive version of this movie courtesy of the Criterion Disc.

I still have the Criterion Laserdisc version, and that will be the one I go to when the time rolls around to watch this movie again.  Spielberg did the same thing when he released &quot;Jaws&quot; on DVD in July of 2000.  What should have been a definitive release was instead an abbreviated version (I'm referring to bonus stuff, here) of the edition released as a Collector's set on Laserdisc years before.  What gives, Steve?</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>Don't get confused with what seems to be a small amount of extras on this two disc DVD set.  The visual and audio for the film were pretty good (especially considering how many different times this movie's been re-edited, re-shot, etc.).  The documentary (over an hour and a half long) seems to squash any necessity for an audio commentary.  Seeing how a lot of these physical effects were done reminded me how far film effects have gone over the years and shows how the little experiments can pay off big.  Included are some deleted scenes (almost all I believe come from the previous versions of the film) and some trailers.  However, the main reason for this purchase for me is the film itself.  Though Steven Spielberg admits that out of all his films that &quot;it's the one that dates him as a person now&quot;, it's one of those films that still has resonance with the little kid in me.  It's a truly great film, and one of my personal favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Spielberg's alien masterpiece about aliens invading Earth was an instant classic in the seventies, and is still a great film, better than Star Wars. Why? Because we can identify more with a middle-aged electrician than we can with a moisture farmer on a desert planet. Richard Dreyfuss is the aforementioned electrician, who has an extraterrestrial experience and suddenly is obsessed with these aliens. This epic is an excellent early work of Stephen and truly delights the senses as well as the mind, and is still extremely watchable today. Now, for the faults. It starts slow and never really builds to a frantic pace, but it only increases the suspense. Although the aliens are a little disappointing (just the basic pointy-eyed, almond faced stereotypes), these faults are easily compensated in this amazing experience. One of the best sci-fi movies of all time.<br />-m-</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Wow! This Close Encounters of the Third Kind DVD set is affordable and it spoils you rotten! It has the 1977 theatrical version, the 1980 special edition, and the 1998 director's cut! Also, there's some extra features. I first saw Close Encounters when I rented a VHS tape from the video store in 1998. Roy(Richard Dreyfuss) encounters a UFO while stuck at a railroad crossing. He has a vision of a tower in his mind. Director Steven Spielberg succeeded in casting French film director Francois Truffaut as a French scientist. Melinda Dillon plays a single mother and lovely Terri Garr plays Roy's wife. The special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Greg Jein, Ralph McQuarrie, and Dennis Muren are superb. The animatronic extraterrestrials built by Carlo Rambaldi are first rate. John Williams' music score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind is flawless. The five note motif was spoofed by a school band on a TV show and in the 007 film Moonraker(1979). This film has the iconic scene with Roy making a tower with mashed potatoes. This scene was spoofed in UHF(1989) and The Simpsons.<br /> The 1977 version of Close Encounters shows Terri Garr listening to an officer talking about UFO's. The 1980 version of the film shows the bright, colorful inside of the mothership. Cary Guffey is quite good as a three year old who is kidnapped by aliens. Close Encounters came out in 1977; it had to compete with Star Wars. Both films were referenced in Independence Day(1996). Times have changed. Steven Spielberg directed War of the Worlds(2005) and that film showed us some nasty, malevolent aliens from Mars. In the 1970's and the 1980's, Spielberg was willing to show us optimistic tales of encounters with space aliens. Close Encounters is a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>This is another one of Spielberg's gems.See who actually made the contact,those shy aliens.Situations like this keep you guessing.But Spielberg was no fraud when it came to science fiction classic's.Would you have the guts to actually contact the alien,or perhaps get someone to do it for you.We would see then wouldn't we.Who has the answers huh,with all those advances those aliens had,they have nothing to fear.I dont think i would walk onto a spaceship with one,would you?<br />You should look into this,it's actually a great package.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>The basic story is of a telephone line repairman (Richard Dreyfuss) who encounters a UFO and has trouble relating this to his wife (Teri Garr); she is in denial and refuses to entertain the thought that there may be UFOs. There are parallel stories of other people encountering UFO's. Eventually the government is also contacted by the UFOs and sets up a meeting with them had a unique location. The individuals encountered have also been compelled to attend; this to the government's consternation. Will the other invitees make it to the rendezvous point? What trials and tribulations must they endure on the way?<br /><br /> The lighter version, "The Collector's Edition" (ASIN: 0767827031) of the film. This is closer to the original cut but still not the one shown on TV.  I bought this version after I realized I had the darker version. Amazon.com did the research for me<br /><br />The dark version, also called "The Collector's Edition" However I think it was supposed to be a director's cut (ASIN: 0800198395) cut out all the comic scenes like the throwing all the dirt in the window prior to building the replica of Devils Mountain. And added some "Mother gets disturbed scenes." I bought the dark version first because I thought it had the special ending where the inside of the ship is shown. But I did not know that it was completely remade. Some of the Gas mask scenes are missing also.<br /><br />If this review ends up on another version you will have to check for your self how complete it really is and what has been cut out.<br /><br />Other than that if you did not see the original or the third version that is shown periodically on TV you would like this movie and it is worth the purchase price.<br />-----------------------------------------------<br />Well now I do not want to mix media with a review that is for the movie however a later contribution with the advent of Blu-ray is the two DVD "30th Anniversary Ultimate" editions which seems to have picked up some original material missing from all the tapes. Again I am not trying to distract from the movie content but this edition show that (probably due to this being a movie from the pre-blu-ray era) some scenes are clear and almost three dimensional while others are very grainy and of poor focus. Once you get into the story this distraction will go away.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827031">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECACG">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UFZK">Poltergeist (25th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is another one of Steven Spielberg's innocent looks at children and aliens, as in ET.  This classic is a superior example of good filmmaking, with its rather thin plot overshadowed by its wonderful direction and Richard Dreyfuss' marvelous performance.  Also note the fine support from Teri Garr and Melinda Dillon; their presence gives the movie a foundation of family ideals.  The scene where Dreyfuss makes his mashed potatoes into a replica of Devil's Peak is still one of the most memorable in science fiction films.  John Williams' score is as always impeccable and the effects state of the art.  A lot doesn't really "happen" in the movie, but its view of friendly aliens and contact with we earthlings still gives it classic status.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I hadn't watched this movie in years, but I rewatched it recently and was pleased with how well it's aged. The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It's a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you've gone on an emotional journey as well.<br /><br /> The movie's slow pace and subtle cinematography are a nice change from most movies released nowadays. At over 2 hours, the movie crawls for most of the time presenting dialogue and images. Initially, that sounds like a recipe for disaster (or 2001 Space Odyssey) but it works really well in this context. Slowing the pace down allows viewers to feel like you're traveling with the characters and for the tension to build. It also makes the climax all the more rewarding.<br /><br />The special effects still hold up pretty well and have been improved for this 30th anniversary edition. I haven't watched this on blu-ray so I don't know how the quality holds up there. I did think some of the blacks could have been cleaned up to remove some of the "static," but I have to say it also gives the movie a nice "older" feel.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sci-fi classic and still probably the most realistic depiction of contact with aliens ever to come out of Hollywood. Too bad Hollywood just doesn't make movies like this anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is Steven Spielberg's 1977 blockbuster that examines how a man's life is changed forever when he realizes through a series of unexplained events that other beings exist in the universe. Roy Neary, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a happy family man when, one night, a spaceship flys over him in his truck. This leads him to investigate the incident, with him ultimately losing everything he has, including his family; his investigation becomes a compulsion that even he can't control. The movie was one of the biggest blockbusters of the 1970's and is the best film that explores aliens and the unknown. This beautiful 2 disc DVD set is loaded with extras including interviews with Dreyfuss and Spielberg, 11 deleted scenes, a making-of documentary, a 1977 featurette called "Watching The Skies", plus much more. Rona Barrett from ABC said the film is "brilliant and nothing short of a masterpiece".</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>Very good transfer to BD, although I think a little more attention to cleaning up the film a bit more would've made it even better.  Great movie, sound is good, and really fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>An interesting film from the canon of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career.  You can say that this film is an "E.T" for adults.  It is not clear from the start whether to view the visitors as a malevolent or friendly force.  The film introduces us to Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfus) who encounters an alien craft while repairing some downed power lines.  From that moment on he is obsessed with this encounter despite the toll it is taking on his family and his marriage.  We also meet Gillian (Melinda Dillon), a young divorcee whose toddler son has been abducted by the aliens.  The two join forces in attempting to locate these beings despite interference by a seemingly hearltless government beauracracy("E.T." again).  They eventually locate the mothership in Wyoming where there is a major multi-national effort to communicate with the mothership.  The scene in which the technicians use musical notes to communicate with the alien craft is classic.  Not to give anything away, when we do finally see the aliens and the inside of the mothership it is something of a letdown.  I like this film immensely, though I wouldn't exactly call it a great film in the legacy of Spielberg.  It's a nice thrill-ride of a movie and you have to put in perspective that this film came at the beginning of Spielberg's career before he evolved into possibly our greatest director.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's second smash hit, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an effective, optimistic, and visually appealing film.  In the light of current special effects, it's showing its age, but the story still retains wonder and interest.  Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O.'s and then becomes obsessed with them.  Others that have made sightings share the obsession, including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens.  A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming.  Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists (played by Truffault and Baliban) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years, and which turn up in strange locales.  They, too, receive a message (along the more conventional method of radio contact) to head to Wyoming.<p>Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.<p>Unfortunately, the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film.  It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob (of scientists) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear.  Yes, the effects are good, even by today's standards, but it is boring!  Similarly, Teri Garr as the protagonist's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy, and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature (at the time) director.  All in all, though, the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.<p>This DVD edition is quite nice, with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars (except Truffault, who had passed away).  Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films, but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs.  There are also some deleted scenes, including the &quot;new&quot; ending Columbia demanded for the &quot;Special Edition&quot; release in 1980.  The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD (and rightfully so!).</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>It's easy to take this movie for granted, now that so much of it is embedded in the public consciousness. But maybe that's why Close Encounters of the Third Kind earned its #64 spot on the AFI top 100 ranking. It's a mystery story infused with real life with shades of quite plausible science fiction. And, that all being said, human relationships are the focus here.<br /><br />Dreyfuss is a normal man living a normal life. Alien spaceships, visually beautiful, begin visiting far-flung locations on Earth. They are revered by some, while others are threatened, and yet others refuse to accept it's happening. It's not that there are Good Guys or Bad Guys. It is more how all of us react to a knowledge which is new and strange. Do we hide from it? Embrace it? If you're a mother, do you let your child get drawn off by these unknown creatures? The movie does a great job of showing all sides, how the aliens *might* be friendly - or they *might* be a threat. How can one know? The government is trying to get a handle on things without causing a panic. Is that a proper response? Anyone who's seen the TV series 24 knows how tricky that type of decision can be.<br /><br />Garr plays Dreyfuss's wife, who while skeptical, does also try her best to understand him. She goes with him to the press conference. But to her it's as if he claims to have seen the loch ness monster. He's already lost his job over this. How about her kids? How much can she let her husband's "bizarre behavior" affect them? When he flings a heavy plant through a window and at her head, and starts ranting while stealing fencing from his neighbors, many would say she's quite right in taking her kids to safety.<br /><br />Then there's Dillon, who plays the mom of a young boy who is taken away. She is determined to get her child back. So while Garr runs away with her kids to protect them, Dillon teams up with Dreyfuss to get hers back. When Dreyfuss is falling back on the mountain, it's Dillon who kicks him into gear. I did find it a bit iffy that a short while later Dreyfuss gives her a fairly warm kiss on the mouth. How quickly he forgets his wife. And kids. And it's also a bit strange that Dillon, knowing her son is probably with the aliens, doesn't want to go too. If I was a mom and my kid was in there, I'd be heading down to get on board right alongside Dreyfuss.<br /><br />It's amusing that some of the alien music ends up sounding Jaws-y.<br /><br />The government does send two females in their nearly all-white-male submission to the aliens. And the movie features the two women in the cast showing two different points of view - the one who shies away from the aliens for her kids and the one who goes towards the aliens for her kid. But really, 99% of the movie is about men. The two women never talk to each other and barely see each other as they pass in one scene. Dreyfuss has one woman to take care of his kids, another woman to empathize with his dreams, and it doesn't seem like he gives his family even a passing glance before he hops the next spaceship out of there. He created those three kids - but he was apparently "meant for so much more". They annoy him with their talk of fractions and mini-golf.<br /><br />And one has to say, if the aliens can figure out our long/lat system and have advanced physics, surely they could learn English in a week or two of monitoring our TV signals and simply talk with us. Not nearly as much fun as teaching us slowpokes an entirely new musical language.<br /><br />So yes, as much as this positions itself as the intellectual counterpart to Star Wars, it's still not as tightly written as many other movies out there. That's all right. It's more an artistic romantic vision than an intellectual examination. This is a man's fantasy about escape. He has women to care for the various aspects of his life, he has the freedom to escape, and he goes. He throws caution to the wind and hops on that space-schooner into the unknown. It gets kudos for its portrayal of that simple desire to head off towards the horizon, and its presentation of aliens as a pleasant rather than dangerous force.<br /><br />Well recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>I love the little comment a previous reviewer said about "Closet Cases of the Nerd Kind." I remember seeing that parody on HBO years ago and it was before seeing the "actual" film. The scene where Richard Dreyfuss looks at the shaving cream and says "This means something," I still haven't recovered myself from restraining the laugh-fest. Maybe someday that parody and "Hardware Wars," can make an appearance on DVD! <p>It wasn't until the Special Edition came out in theatres where I finally got to see it with all the added scenes. Yet, after watching this DVD version I love it! The movie most definitely does better without all the added stuff. The sound and picture are better than it ever was in theatres but that's also a testament to explain how far the technology of sound has come from. Let's face it, I saw the Special Edition in theatres in 82! Sound has most definitely improved since then, thank God! The picture quality is unbelievable and after watching "Superman The Movie" it's great to see our classic films get the facelift they deserve, even though most of these actors need facelifts of their own:) Just kidding!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was a movie I fondly remember from my youth as kindling that spark of cinema magic that seems to be in short supply these days.  For its day the visual effects were mesmorizing and the prospect that we are not alone in this universe became very real for me after viewing this movie.  Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth.<br />Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I LOVE Spielberg, please don't get me wrong. I even kinda liked this movie when I first saw it all those many years ago. But we watched it with our kids (13 & 8) in the year 2000 and they hated it, and frankly, I dozed off myself. Science fiction is the hardest genre to keep fresh for generations, for obvious reasons, but some core elements of film-making never go out of style.<p>It feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?<p>It's fun to hear the "alien theme" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?  He's so often gone with unknowns or unusual choices and we've usually been SO pleasantly surprised).<p>I don't want to dwell on this too much, but CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a piece of movie history, but sadly, not a living, breathing one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br />Cast:  Richard Dreyfuss, Francois Truffaut, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon.<br />Running Time: 137 minutes.<br />Rated PG for mild language and some intense situations.<p>Fresh off the outrageous success of his first hit &quot;Jaws&quot;, Steven Spielberg creates the extra-terrestrial epic &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.  While obviously a film about aliens, Spielberg uses star Richard Dreyfuss as a chess piece to how the mystique and mystery of a foreign being can not only cause a man to go crazy, but can ultimately influence mankind as a whole.<p>Dreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle.  Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life, he returns home as if nothing happened.  Dreyfuss's behavior grows stranger and stranger (he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table, then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house), he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers.  What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.<p>Spielberg's direction is top-notch and sincere, proving that his previous sucess was not a fluke.  Much like his other alien film, &quot;E.T&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters...&quot; provides  a symbolic theme that is far more significant than what the aliens look like or what planet they came from.  With the peformance of Dreyfuss, Spielberg is able to to show that it is okay for all of us to return to the kid we once were, and to explore all of the questions that we all want answers for.  A true spectacle of a film with superb special effects, a wonderful musical score by John Williams, and a child-like charm that is for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>This is the clearest, sharpest and most colorful transfer to Blu-Ray DVD I have ever watched! This film was made in 1977, prior to the well explored theme of government conspiracies with evil aliens intent on colonizing Earth. Earlier and later sci-fi films (with the exception of E.T.) have generally attributed much less benign motives to space aliens.<br /><br />Spielberg was able to get his audience to believe in well intentioned aliens interested in making first contact with authorities on Earth. A more difficult film to make interesting to audiences brought up on evil space critters, the film still works and many folks appear to enjoy it. While not one of my favorite films I do enjoy watching the very colorful visual effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.<br /><br />The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.<br /><br />The climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.  Anyone else can safely skip it since there are far more entertaining films for you to choose from.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's epic film that brainwashed the world into accepting alien invaders with open arms and a five-note melody arrives in a great looking two disc set that includes a fascinating new 102 minute "making-of" documentary and 10 deleted scenes.  The lush 137 minute widescreen transfer is apparently the third version of the film and is Spielberg's definitive version.  For now.  Rated PG.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>The film  &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.<br />This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal.Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.<br />However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise.His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer.It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr.Spielberg?<br />Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire.Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future.What a pity.I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original.<br />Be patient and stay tuned...but dont buy yet!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Can you believe, I have never seen CEO3K until the other week.  I looked forward to seeing it, but unfortunately it did not measure up. After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.<br /><br />Close Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking "is that it, after all that slow build-up?".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.<br /><br />I have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.<br /><br />The second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.  I wish someone could enlighten me on why this film is considered a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg topped himself with this movie, which arrived two years after JAWS, the movie that blew the movie industry -- and the rest of us -- away.  The first movie to explore aliens from the vantage point of someone  who could be your neighbor, or YOU, is fascinating and utlimately  surprisingly moving.  The visual wonder of this movie is so palpable you  can almost touch it with your hand, and the performances are so in synch  that you become friends with these people by the time the Mother Ship  arrives -- especially Melinda Dillon and Richard Dreyfuss; Teri Garr is as  usual excellent, and Francois Truffaut is the perfect man to embody a  sympathetic scientist, filled with wonder.  When communication between  humans and aliens begins to explode, I found tears welling up in my eyes,  so complete was Spielberg's magic spell.  The fact that this movie  essentially features no real villian is remarkable; it manages to be  profoundly funny, sentimental, interesting and magical without any real  violence and no real character conflict/battle.  John Williams once again  provides a score of majesty and power; the creative collective genius who  concocted an alien encounter entirely through music, whether it was  Williams, Spielberg, the writers, or a combo, deserve(s) special mention,  and Williams' theme evokes precisely the right emotional chords to  transport you to the galaxies above, or at least to heaven.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>Close Encounters is thirty years old and can be considered a classic among cinema fanatics.  The movie was released when special effects were in their infancy.  Movies like Star Wars had just come out and the idea of bringing UFO's to life was becoming possible.  Now thirty years later movies like this seem very simple.  Although the story never grows old and now in hi-def it is well worth another look.<br /><br />From the minute I got my hands on this set I realized how nice it actually is.  Containing just two discs but hours worth of features.  The first disc contains the movies in three different editions.  The Original Theatrical Version contains the movie how it was originally seen on the big screen.  Special Edition is the same version that was released several years ago with a few additional features that was added to the Theatrical Version.  The Director's Cut contains additional parts of the movie that were Steven Spielberg intended to be in his movie.  For all of you confused don't worry the set comes with a high quality glossy timeline sheet with the extra parts that were added to each edition.  On this disc you are also given an option to run the movie with all the extras.  So essentially you have four versions of this film.<br /><br />When I started watching this movie I was in awe.  This was one of the best hd transfers of a movie I have ever seen.  I have watched numerous movies over ten years old and this one looked best.  The color and visuals looked superb.  The sound is superb and the way it was intended to sound.<br /><br />For those of you who have never seen the movie it involves several characters.  A group of scientists are researching strange discoveries that are taking place like a fleet of WWII planes that went missing thirty years prior.  The discoveries are just the beginning as UFO's begin to make appearances all over the world.  Richard Dreyfuss is one of the people who witnesses the UFO activity and from that point his life is changed.  Trying to discover what the meaning of this is.  Of course in the meantime his family and work life are completely disrupted.  Although this is just the beginning of this mysterious journey.<br /><br />Close Encounters is a magical movie to say the least.  The story is timeless and has been copied for many years without the same success.  The special effects have improved greatly over the years but movie still remains a classic.  Now on Blu-ray this movie gives people a whole new reason to own it.  The extras make it well worth it.  This is a beautiful collection that should be added to any movie fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This Review refers to the newly released (Aug 2002) Single Disc Collectors Edition of this film (columbia)......<br /> So you have either seen this film and you love it, or by some chance have never seen it and want to see what all the fuss was about.In either case you are trying to decide which edition to buy. I'm not here to make up your mind for you (it was a tough enough decision for me) just to let you know that this DVD was one of the most enjoyable I've watched lately...First a little about the story though.<br />  This Sci-Fi tale of UFO's is more like a fairy tale.Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfuss) is a regular guy, living an ordinary maybe not so happy life with his wife(Teri Garr)and kids. On a routine run in his Utility truck one night, something extrordinary happens to him. He is witness to bright lights which turn out to be UFO's. He becomes obsessed with the visitors,as do others who have witnessed the same. He befreinds Jillian(Melinda Dillon), who's little boy was abducted by the ship. They are drawn to the site that the Ufo's have communicated to scientists, through musical tones,where they will meet. There is a hugh gathering of all these men of science,as they wait for something, anything to happen. Roy looks on, just thrilled to be a part of it all.. Without giving away too much (for those who have not seen it), I will tell you that we are treated to the most wonderful and touching scenes of the "encounter".John Williams score, and  "When you wish upon a star" being played throughout really adds to the viewing and listening pleasure.<br />  Steven Spielberg has presented us with a gift of a tale that can be enjoyed by families for many years to come. You will never tire of this story.<br />  Okay Okay! so the DVD.....As I said before it was one of the most enjoyable DVD's I've watched. It's Digitally mastered. As far as audio there is set ups for dolby digital 5.1 as well as 5.1 DTS, also one for 2 channel surround, so whatever system you have you should be real happy with the sound. I felt like I was in the theatre. The picture is the sharpest I've ever seen it. It's in widescreen (anamorphic) and remastered in high defination. There are several languages for subtitles if needed.<br />There are no other extra features(Behind the scenes, or interviews), Just a Class-A treatment for a Class-A movie.<br />"We are not alone".................Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br />for Spielberg fans:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZ3I5">Saving Private Ryan/Amistad</a><br />for sci-fi/horror fans:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157297110X">Sci-Fi Channel Trivia Book</a></p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Home video is quite a temptation for directors. It allows them to go back play with, alter, tamper and second guess themselves. We get three versions via seamless branching on Blu-ray on one disc with a disc of extras and the films presented with extras over three discs on DVD allowing us to see Spielberg's thoughts on "CE3K" over three different decades. The latest 30th Anniversary edition allows writer/director Steven Spielberg to fix flaws in "CE3K" that have bothered him for years about the film. The original theatrical version editing he felt was rushed and unfinished while the "Special Edition" deleted some key scenes and added a completely unnecessary trip inside the Mothership (something he later regretted). --he's edited it again (it's 2 minutes longer with some scenes lengthened and others shortened plus the trip inside the Mothership has been left to the audience's imagination). The "Director's Cut" works better than both versions; Spielberg has licked some of the pacing issues that dogged the original film and he has eliminated the gaudy trip inside the ship. For those fans who HAD to see the inside of the ship we still get that edition of the film which is a good thing--this is the most comprehensive version of "CE3K" released. This is the definitive version(s)of the film.<br /><br />Interestingly, Spielberg added the last section inside the ship so he could get the financing to re-edit the film for the 1980 re-release. It was a compromise he could live with at the time but he has since reversed that opinion wisely realizing that focus groups (Columbia's marketing department got focus group feedback asking to see the inside of the ship and that's where the decision to show the inside came from)can be idiots and cause damage to a film (see "Blade Runner" for an example of how it can compromise a film).<br /><br />The image quality is spectacular on Blu-ray and looks terrific on DVD as well. I have to give Spielberg credit; unlike, say, George Lucas, Spielberg presents his original vision with as much respect and care as he does his later revisions. You can pick and choose which version appeals to you--I liked the original version a lot in 1977, disliked the 1980 "Special Edition" and loved the "Director's Cut" of the film. What was subtle in the first version was blunt in the second and has been returned to subtle in the third version with better pacing and cuts that work better with the flow of the film. Fans of the film will love having all 3 versions so they can pick and choose which version they like.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific as well with an active 5.1 mix presented in DTS and Dolby Digital Surround. The Blu-ray also features the sound presented in lossless uncompressed TrueHD Dolby. John Williams' soaring and uplifting score is beautifully rendered.<br /><br />The Blu-ray uses an interactive comparison feature "A View from Above" that has a pop up color/shape to tell you when there is a difference in a scene. It is color co-ordinated to which version has a difference and also to which version you are watching. It shows an image from the scene and explains what was altered. We also geta hard copy of that as well for both the Blu-ray and DVD with a "map" explaining the differences between the three versions and, on the other side, a reproduction of the original, effective poster (which also was used as a teaser trailer and is on the cover of the box)from 1977.<br /><br />There is also a storyboard to scene comparison section as well as conceptual art done by Ralph McQuarie (who also worked on "Star Wars" and "Alien" coming up with designs for various aliens and spaceships). Complimenting these sections on storyboards and artwork is a companion 30th anniversary scrapbook. We get brief biographies and backgrounds for the key players in the film and behind-the-scenes as well as comments from Spielberg about the project and behind-the-scenes photos.<br /><br />Ported over we get the extensive 1997 documentary on the making of the film as well as an interview with Spielberg from 2007 discussing his thoughts on the film, the changes he made and where the film fits for him now 30 years later as a film director. The original 1977 "Watch the Skies" featurette that played on TV as a promotional tie-in is included as well. A number of deleted scenes are also included. Finally we get the various theatrical trailers with the original teaser (that didn't show any scenes from the film but was compelling and artistic by itself) included as well.<br /><br />All of this is housed in a sturdy cardboard case for both the Blu-ray and DVD. This set is highly recommended on both DVD and Blu-ray since it houses the ultimate edition and allows viewers to pick the version of the film they enjoyed the most. It's also a way for Spielberg to have his cake and eat it, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>This movie is a bit overhyped, I am not going to argue the movie has good acting and special effects,and that perhaps we may not be alone. I really like the scene on the highway near the train tracks and The chase,*SPOILER*but really "Roy" is such a jerk and leaves to join the mothership? I would hope they torture him up there for being such a bad father and husband. probe him good. I also dislike spielberg for commenting "If we can communicate with beings from another planet peacefully then why not The Reds during the Cold War?" something to that effect. Spielberg must be one helluva naive person to state something like that and believe it. I also believe that Aliens wouldn't come here, Humans are too dumb,why bother. And if they did come they would probably destroy us.<br />I would never want to have an encounter, The movie itself is not bad,but you go back to one place(India) then another (Muncie,Indiana) why not focus on One place and one plot? I prefer Signs to this. And the end of this movie totally killed it for me.See for yourself whether you agree or disagree with my review.it's not a bad movie  but certainly could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>No doubt, legendary director Steven Spielberg will best be remembered for E.T. and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  This UFO classic will always remain my favorite.  The director's edition restores some scenes that were omitted when the special edition was released in 1980, and deletes the "inside the mother ship" scene, which I always felt was overkill.<br /><br />On a more personal note...in the days following September 11, 2001, this was the film I finally came upon on TV after all those horrifying hours of 9-11 images.  As I watched, I was suddenly 10 years-old again, seeing the movie for the first time at the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC.  It didn't seem to matter that I had the uncut, unedited VHS tape on the shelf in front of me, I just kept watching it to the end.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for being the only evidence of any real magic in this world.</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This by far is the most visually perfect movie ever made!  A definite feast for your eyes!  It is truly amazing how perfect the special effects are to this day.  The magic in this Steven Spielberg movie will never be outdated.  I saw this in the theater in 1977 and it impressed me then, and still to this day keeps me in awe.  This tale of a UFO encounter takes the audience on a trip to discover that we are not alone.  This movie is a must for everyone to see!  It is my ultimate favorite film.  I do believe we are not alone...</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>On its thirtieth anniversary, Steven Spielberg's UFO masterpiece, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), seems as fresh and wondrous as a child's birthday present.  UFO's appear in the night skies over Indiana and kidnap little Cary Guffey.  His poor mom, Melinda Dillon, has no idea that the aliens are friendly.  Richard Dreyfuss sees the sightings also and all but ignores wife Teri Garr to follow them all over Indiana in a truck.  After Dreyfuss makes a giant mountain of earth in his living room without knowing why, Garr takes their son and leaves him.  But he's too busy trying to figure out what obsesses him about the mountain.<br /><br />Then Dreyfuss and Dillon realize at the same time what the mountain means--Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  But what is the mystery of Devil's Tower?  Pretty soon they are joining forces by truck to head for Wyoming.  What compels their journey?  I'm not even sure Spielberg, as writer and director, knows.  Over thirty years, he has re-edited his movie at least three times--from 135 minutes, to 132 minutes, to a Director's Cut of 137 minutes that leaves out several scenes I remember, including the inside of the space ship at the film's finale.  Anyway, our intrepid duo reach Devil's Tower.  Ironically, the Army arrest them as aliens!<br /><br />The last third of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, secretly filmed in an Alabama warehouse, has some of the most spectacular visual effects in movie history and won Vilmos Zsigmond a Cinematography Oscar for his brilliant work, in tandem with at least five other cinematographers all over the world, including Douglas Slocombe in northern India.  (The great Douglas Trumbull gets Visual Effects credit, along with Spielberg.)  Legendary French filmmaker Francois Truffaut has a nice supporting role as a French scientist who initially wants to know what Dreyfuss knows.  But he turns out benign.  This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood movies to treat extra-terrestrials sympathetically.  (Spielberg's E.T. was still five years in the future.)  And it is still one of the best ever, helped immeasurably by John Williams' ethereal score and an innate intelligence toward UFOs.  Young Guffey's final scene is particularly lovely as he waves goodbye to the departing spaceship.<br /><br />I still wish Spielberg had kept in the scene he replaced in the 1980's for TV where we go inside the spaceship at the end.  But my Mom thinks it is more satisfying to let us wonder what the interior is like and who is inside.  Judge Crater?  Lee Harvey Oswald?  Marilyn Monroe?  I still fondly remember "When You Wish Upon a Star" from PINOCCHIO playing inside, but maybe my Mom is right on Spielberg's decision.  He and longtime editor Michael Kahn (still his editor of choice) seem to have imperceptibly improved the middle of a long 137 minute movie.<br /><br />CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is magnificent filmmaking that holds up beautifully after thirty years.  Though his SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) are mature adult works of art, Spielberg still has no equals for creating great popular movie entertainment for kids of all ages--like the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is worth another look if you have not seen it in a while.<br /><br />I am reviewing a $10 drugstore DVD with no bonuses, but restored color, THX sound, and letterboxing for Panavision.  You might want to spend more and get the two disk set with bonuses on how the astonishing UFO's were created.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg uses the concept of urban paranoia to dismantle it, to expose it and to denounce it. The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them. <p>The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman. <p>What is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.<p>This film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King's Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>This is a real "guilty pleasure" with me, a fun film to watch that, at the same time, is silly to the point of almost nonsense in many ways. While it was a high water mark in Spielberg's career, it also marked the beginning of some of the indulgences that make him a second-rate filmmaker today. (Save me your flame mail, I won't retract that.)<br /><br />There are some moments in Close Encounters that look good on film, but are seriously illogical or just plain silly: building a giant Devil's Tower in your living room when it'd be much more convenient to do it in your backyard; implanting a mountain image in the brains of casual UFO witnesses while sending longitudes and latitudes to the scientists; hauling a giant globe into a cramped radio telescope booth when it could be dealt with more easily where it was already standing; going all the way to India and asking *one* question, and a pretty stupid one at that; organizing a "top secret" operation by meeting in an ENORMOUS hall when there are all of about 50 people involved; allowing a woman to leave the state and otherwise go about her life without police surveillance when she claims her son has disappeared because aliens "stole" him; camouflaging trucks full of scientific gear with mock food signs, when they would be perfectly unobtrusive as simply unmarked trucks carrying perfectly legitimate research gear; chartering a bus (!!!) to take the red-suited astronauts to Wyoming when an unmarked military transport helicopter would have been a far better way to keep the mission secret; teaching a group of men and women hand-signals that aliens may not understand, or, worse, may misconstrue. Not to mention the silliest scene I've ever seen in a movie that is not a comedy: in the Gobi desert, jeeps are *followed* by *low-flying helicopters.* These helicopters should be scouting ahead, but they just fly near the ground and kick up sand. And someone has to tell Spielberg the locals there use horses for transportation, not camels.<br /><br />But there are many grand scenes too--one just wishes Spielberg could put a brake on the sillier parts of his imagination: the magnificent moment where Roy and Jillian first see, and rush up to, the mountain. The genuine awe and sweetness of the ending, totally devoid of any cynicism or negativity, yet not sappy either. The soulful, understated performance by Melinda Dillon. The incredible, spontaneous scenes with the little boy. (My favorite moment in this whole film is when she is on the rock madly snapping pictures of the Mothership and he is next to her, just silently staring at the amazing ship from which he had just come.) The way the aliens are more hinted at than shown. (There's one wonderful longshot of them just standing there looking at us, and then we look back at them. What more is there to say?) The effects were visionary in their time and have held up extremely well since 1977. Were it not for the cars and the haircuts and the suburban furnishings, you'd think this movie were made today. And Spielberg does such a good job of taking two worlds--two movies, really--and crashing them together head-on and making it work. You have the middle-class ordinary family existence, told conventionally, even blandly, and you have the grand, supernatural world of the UFOs. Spielberg joins them seamlessly, makes one believable in the realm of the other. Not many sci-fi movies have attempted this; they generally are very "futuristic" and "spacy" to begin with. Spielberg's triumph is that he melded his aliens into routine Indiana suburbia, brought them down to the Dairy Queen, and we don't laugh at the incongruity. It's credible. It's more of a directing job than Spielberg is often given credit for.<br /><br />Fortunately, most of the scenes cut from the 1980 reissue are restored here. While often underwrittten (the whole film is underwritten), they give the film the weight in the real world it needs to be truly credible. Spielberg was unwise to scissor them at all.<br /><br />The DVD picture is quite good overall.  The sound is very fine and a lot of additional surround material has been added (more bass, more stereophonic wind effects and chatter in the air traffic control scene) that is not overdone and gives the film more presence without being obtrusive. The second disc of the documentary, deleted scenes and other goodies is fascinating. You'll learn everything you ever wanted to know about the making of CE3K in the 100+ minute supplement, and you can see a lot of early expositional material that was eventually cut from the movie (most of it wisely so, though there's a great scene with a young Carl Weathers that I wish they'd have kept).  The only thing that mars the documentary is Spielberg's silly PC comment that he created three different types of aliens because he wanted to show cosmic diversity and multiculturalism.  If you read Bob Balaban's book about the making of the film, written before there was such a thing as PC, you'd know the aliens aren't consistent-looking (neither are some of the saucer shots) because he was trying different techniques as he went along, hoping something would work.  Or, if he's so concerned with diversity, why are almost all the scientist-earthlings white males?<br /><br />The trailers are interesting primarily for illustrating how poorly trailers were made back then.<br /><br />Overall a great release of a young, fearless Spielberg, only about 30 when he made this ambitious film.  Too bad he never (at least in my opinion) fulfilled his promise to become the wunderkind director everyone was already calling him. After his disastrous next film, 1941, he started playing it safe, and never again attempted something like CE3K. For the next 20 years he was content to make formulaic flicks notable mostly for their special effects--and yes, I'm including ET on that list.  Sure he's tackled some serious subjects, but even then his approach is generally simplistic, as though he's giving us a Dumbed Down Everyman's Guide to our recent past history.  Steven Spielberg (and George Lucas) very likely started the present trend of filmmakers not trusting their audience's intelligence very much.  Pity.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of Spielberg's most personal films, and one of his best DVDs. Originally released in 1977, Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980, then altered it again for the film's 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in. This DVD is the definitive version of Spielberg's classic, with the extra sections making the film's progress more involving than when it was first released.<br />Extra stuff aside, does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction? The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Different from other nihlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion.<br />Dreyfuss, who also starred in Spielberg's own Jaws (1975), is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic. While perhaps not as essential as the 2 Disc version with lots of extras, CE3K is an impressive film in any format.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>Marketing experts, pay attention: this is how you should package all classic films. All three versions of the film, a retrospective look at the making of the films (note the plural), story boards, deleted scenes, the 'Watch the Skies' featurette, several audio and video options (standard def v. high def, DTS 5.1 in three languages, etc) and wide accessibility through about a dozen languages worth of subtitles. There is enclosed a nice 30th anniversary booklet with a lot of pics, trivia and retrospective. We don't get commentary, but we do get a Editor's Fast Track that pretty much does the same trick.<br /><br />If you like science fiction, chances are you've already seen this. If you are a fence sitter, wondering if the BD is worth it, the special features alone scream 'yes!' For once, you can't complain about sound or video thanks to all the alternate settings. So you don't have to suffer a bad transfer. Instead you are left following the wonder of normal folk who experience first contact. Watch them question their lives and become infected with the promise of something more than their banal lives. This is a much more cerebral film than most other 'first contacts'. Here, we are promised something different, a learning experience, a chance of friendship.<br /><br />It's all too rare to find movies with a positive resolution instead of cheering on a heroic character that might or might not deserve said cheer. We're left with a hopeful wondering of our future, and that has so much more of a payoff than anything that has come since.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>This is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.  Steven Spielberg has given us many Sci-Fi movies and his first is still arguably his best.  The "Collector Edition" of Close Encouters of the Third Kind presents us with the third version of the 1977 hit.<br /><br />This is an absolutely wonderful movie and DVD.  It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio, although this edition was not the one originally in theatres.  On top of that, it is a wonderful Two Disc Edition, with features that everyone could love.<br /><br />It includes a feauturette, clocking in at 102 minutes, is a movie itself.  It is entitled "Watch the Skies".  It also includes a second feauturette and a beavy of deleted scenes, 11 in total.  I suggest you pick this up.  You could always wait for the Definitive Three Disc Edition, but if you're hard up on cash, I suggest this one.  You will not be disappointed.  It's an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Nearly a quarter century since it was unleashed, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND ranks as one of the supreme cinematic achievements of the modern era.  Steven Spielberg wrote and directed this tremendous science fiction film with his own distinctive middle-class view on things.<p>Richard Dreyfuss is at his usual terrific best in the role of Ron Neary, another of Spielberg's &quot;Everyman&quot; characters.  He is an Indiana power lineman who is called out on a night where the entire city of Muncie goes dark.  Then, at a railroad crossing, he is suddenly shocked by the appearance of a UFO, flooding him with brilliant white light.  This encounter soon turns both him and his life upside down; his wife (Teri Garr) and kids can't understand his obsession with turning the shape of mashed potatoes or mounds of dirt from his backyard into a mysterious mountain he's been seeing in his mind.  Meanwhile, a lonely mother (Melinda Dillon) has her own close encounters with the UFOs, resulting in the still-unseen aliens abducting her son (Cary Guffey).  She too has visions of a mysterious mountain, visions which find their way into paintings and colorings.<p>When the news comes on TV with word that a train supposedly loaded with deadly nerve gases has overturned in northeastern Wyoming, however, both Dreyfuss and Dillon know the locale--Devils Tower.  In spite of government officials closing the park off to outsiders (the nerve gas leak is an elaborate cover story), Dreyfuss and Dillon witness, along with a noted UFO expert (Francois Truffaut, director of the 1969 classic THE WILD CHILD) and hundreds of others, the first actual close encounter of the third kind--direct physical contact between Earthlings and extra-terrestrials.<p>Spielberg's film was obviously a radical shift from most previous Hollywood depictions about outer space visitations to Earth.  He evokes the famous line &quot;Watch The Skies&quot; from Howard Hawks' 1951 classic THE THING, but does so without the paranoia and hysteria of the space invasion films of the 1950s.  There are no lasers or bug-eyed monsters.<p>Because CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America's twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, a &quot;don't-let-the-military handle this&quot; approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams' score...what more needs to be said; it's brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.<p>Well conceived, suspenseful, occasionally terrifying, and finally uplifting, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is yet one more staggering masterpiece for a director with a whole lot of masterpieces still to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)<br />Science Fiction, Drama, 137 minutes<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg<br />Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon and Teri Garr<br /><br />Close Encounters works so well because of the way Spielberg slowly increases the suspense. This is not a movie that relies on special effects; it succeeds because of a strong script and good acting. Although we learn of the alien presence at the start of the movie, most of the story consists of people's reactions to those early events.<br /><br />Why is Roy (Dreyfuss) behaving oddly and causing his wife and children to freak out? Chicken wire and mud in the living room is not normally a recipe for a good marriage, but it soon becomes clear why Roy thinks it's necessary. The idea is pretty simple, with an image being placed in the minds of selected people. Jillian (Dillon) has reasons of her own to pursue something and teams up quite believably with Roy. I like that there's no forced romance between the two and that they are merely acting on instinct.<br /><br />One refreshing thing about the movie is that the aliens aren't portrayed as invaders. There's no hostility in their actions, they just want to know and understand us. What a contrast to most science fiction movies up until that point.<br /><br />Spielberg keeps you interested for over two hours as two people journey across the country. That's quite an achievement. Notice too that the conclusion resists the temptation to show us too much about the aliens. Close Encounters is great cinema and has wide appeal to audiences of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I am a huge Spielberg fan, but this films has always been one I was the least familiar with, for some reason. I have rediscovered it now, thanks to DVD, and am kicking myself for not getting better acquainted with it after all these years. It isn't a stretch to say that Close Encounters may be the best Alien movie. Spielberg also wrote the film(and why hasn't he written a truckload more?), and it's a wonderful accomplishment still after 30 years. The great Richard Dreyfuss stars as Roy Neery, a middle class, suburban husband and father who has a 'close encounter' when UFO's begin to come into his town of Muncie, Indiana. And what a great scene that is!. Roy and a few others, including single mom Melinda Dillon(A Christmas Story), end up with a connection to the UFO's as the aliens inside try to make contact with earthlings. Spielberg has a great sense of feeling and wonder thru the entire film. He shows us how this could be taken in two ways. One, he gives us the whimsical, fantastical, awe-inspiring side, and with a fantastic sequence in Dillon's house with her son, also gives us how this can be frightening and scary. One look at that scene and you can see how this movie heavily influenced Shyamalan's "Signs". The movie was made 30 years ago, but it holds up strongly. It's 30 year old story and effects are more affective than a lot of the films today with millions of dollars and fancy new technology. Dreyfuss is always good, and he's great here as Neery. Teri Garr plays his wife. The home life aspect of the fillm doesn't work for some, but it's part of what made the movie to me. Seeing how this normal, average joe gets sucked up in this obsession and how it starts to affect the family life. Garr doesn't get a whole lot here, but she seems to get across that she is a woman who doesn't know what to do. The late director Francois Truffaut plays a scientist, along with Bob Balaban, tracking the UFO's and the strange occurences that have happened around the world. The score by Spielberg mainstay, John Williams, is another success in his long cannon of work. Beautiful and haunting, and who will forget those few chords?. The end is still remarkably fresh and amazing, and the mother ship itself is more cool and impressive than a lot of what we can see nowadays in movies. It's grand entrance is still amazing and a great accomplishment in filmmaking. The smaller ships that come and go are equally fun and well done. Close Encounters has a lot of great things going for it. There are a number of great/classic scenes, a wonderful score, good acting, and a sense of awe and wonder that Spielberg is so brilliant at capturing. You gotta love early, 1975-82, Spielberg. The fact that this movie remains to be so good and touching and amazing 30 years on and before all the studio money that goes out nowadays is a testament to the film and Spielberg's talents. A true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>Though, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was made thirty years ago, it has a wonderful, fresh, timeless quality that keeps you intrigued and entertained.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town.  Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening.  His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses.  Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter.  They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival.<br /><br />CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.<br /><br />What's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen.  This is great for true film buffs and anyone for whom CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was a religious experience.  The anecdotes are entertaining and insightful.  This is truly a great introduction to the films of Steven Spielberg.

Unlike the sci-fi films of the 1950's that revolve around UFO's and alien contact on Earth that usually had the aliens being evil and coming to dominate and destroy the Earth,  Mr. Spielberg depicts them as benign and friendly.

The acting is good.  I don't know what it is, but this is a film that I am rarely tempted to watch.  For me, this is a &quot;pull it out once every five years&quot; film.  I find the development of the plot lines to be interesting and one that raises numerous questions.  I just am not terribly interested in the way the director chose to answer those questions.

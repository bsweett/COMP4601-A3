Tomas Alfredson, in Swedish, subtitled, 2008, 116 minutes. Based on the novel by  John Ajvide Lindqvist) This is a film I was dying to see. Knowing the artful beauty and natural giftedness of Swedish filmmakers/actors, and being a vampire 'buff', I couldn't have lived with myself if I had missed this film. I enjoyed and reviewed the American remake. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BLJQOK">Let Me In</a>, it's good but WHY do we keep messing with Swedish greats?) Let me address one thing in order to avoid confusion: this is a 100% Swedish film - but is often cited as a Norwegian film since it premiered in Norway.<br /><br />With KOMMA, it is plain, especially to those like me who saw the American remake first, that it is a nearly scene-by-scene, line-by-line remake. However, there are major departures, and KOMMA is the more artful, frightening and old-school of the two films. I guess since the Swedes are not known for their vampire films, and in America there are far too many each year, well ....<br /><br />This may be the classic horror film, but it is genius and I wish America made them this great. Here young Oskar (K?re Hedebrant), a tormented boy who looks like an ethereal ghost due to his beautiful paleness, meets Eli (pronounced "Ellie" and played by Lina Leandersson) the stunning creature who looks a bit like an angry Italian fishwife. I noted that she resembles the traditional American idea of the vampire: attractive, very pale, very dark hair and creepy silver eyes.<br /><br />Because he is small and gentle, Oskar is bullied to the extent that he begins a transformation into a psychopath. This is perhaps the most frightening thing about this film - we are watching a sweet little boy being turned into a future serial killer, without a doubt. He fantasizes about violence, follows murders and violent crimes in the tabloids and scrapbooks like Martha Stewart - but only the most violent crimes.<br /><br />He befriends Eli and they fall in love. The scenes of Eli's vampirism are much more eerie, more impactful, than I ever expected. Excellent. In this film, you will see a unique transformation that truly shows what the poor girl is suffering. I will not spoil it, it is simply too good. It far outstrips the silly "Exorcist" job they did in the American remake. Why oh why do we unnecessarily remake these classics??<br /><br />Another point I love about Eli is we discover she can fly. This was completely unclear from the remake, and I can't help the constant comparisons because there is no comparison. KOMMA is 100% better than the remake, in spite of the remake virtually copying KOMMA. The colors blend with the action and have meaning; the soundtrack, while more traditional, is more powerful; the approach is so logical there were moments when I felt this was a VULCAN vampire film.<br /><br />The children here do not seem to shoulder the acting burden placed on the American kids in the remake. That is vital, because the director accomplished so much by doing what looks like so little. The kids approached their roles with a minimalism that adds to the horror, and adds to this film's genius. When Eli, who deeply regrets what she is, chides Oskar for being a psychopath because he chooses to be, I dare you not to shudder.<br /><br />It's filmmaking at genius-level, no question. Though I saw tremendous errors, goofs, not really bloopers, I ask you: doesn't it seem at some point that the director is paying homage? Otherwise it's tough to justify all those errors. In one scene I thought I saw Eli wearing clothing that she won't get until much later in the film!<br /><br />This is a film you cannot afford to ignore, and should own. I suppose the remake is enjoyable in its own way, but I cannot emphasize enough how irritating it is to see a remake so soon and so inferior.<br /><br />Get KOMMA and remember how to be warm again - warm with the glow that only excellent horror film can kindle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>'Let the Right One In' is more a young romantic drama than a vampire movie. It deals with scary elements of real life, rather than blood dripping scares one would expect from a so-called-vampire-movie. The acting is phenomenal when Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant are together. They convincingly share a bond that makes the ending powerful, and all the more accepting.<br /><br />'Let the Right One In' invites you into a scene with small details. You listen to small sounds that draw you into the movie, like the breathing, or the clicking of a rubics cube. There isn't a plethora of dialogue, because this movie is more about visuals that create a shadowy, but familiar world.<br /><br />The movie also has some strange elements that are only muted moments from the much darker and disturbing book by John Ajvide Lindqvist. But these very strange elements are what really made me interested in this magnificient movie. Every strange event did not seem like some cheap attempt at shock value, but rather artistic and passionate. The novel presents very different routes that the movie does not recreate, but the movie stands strong by itself.<br /><br />It is a different version of the masterpiece novel that is acceptable and adds something wonderful in its own. For instance, I could never see Eli as anyone else but Lina Leandersson. The book is much more vague (purposely), while in the movie Eli is a more concrete character. I cannot go into any more detail without giving away a fascinating plot of the book, I implore you to read the book and do not search for spoilers.<br /><br />The director Tomas Alfredson is a new director to me. He seems to have a good eye for scenery and for inhibiting himself from interferring with the story. I say this because I believe he had a good chance to show more of Sweden at the risk of muddling with the pace of this movie, but he restrained himself to a few locations and kept true to a more lonely landscape. I felt that he included many scenes that would have been dropped, and looked at as mistakes in North America, but turned out to be hidden gems that made the film feel alive, with a beating heart. There are times when the children make mistakes, and in the beginning there is such a genuine flavor of nervousness under their cool exteriors that I think that the director must have set it up purposely. Taking the first few takes perhaps. I do not mean to say that there are ameteurish mistakes, far from it, it is more diliberate in my opinion.<br /><br />It is not difficult for me to say that 'Let the Right One In' is a modern masterpiece that is one of the best movies of the decade. It is a different version of the novel that adds a new layer of artistry and ideas to the vampire genre. It is a patient movie, but that swims through time. You will have watched it, restarted it and by the time you know it, have spent ten hours rewatching this film, and it would seem like you spent very little time. It is a movie that is like a romance, where you never want to spend time away. It occupies your mind for a time, and it grinds down your mind. Forget what any critics have to say, and spend little time reading about the movie, and just go see it. If you love movies, this is why. Movies like this aren't made very often.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] is an odd, friendless boy who dreams of killing the bullies at school and keeps a scrapbook of murder and carnage. One dark night he meets a girl, Eli [Lina Leandersson], in the playground. Eli says she can't be his friend, but is lonely, too. Night after night they meet in the playground, and their friendship grows. They gain each other's trust and tell one another their secrets. Oskar, that he's bullied at school, Eli, that she's a vampire.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is perfect balance of a vampire movie and a coming of age film. Intelligent and complex, it explores the challenges of growing up as well as the struggles of the lonely vampire. Excellent performances all around, but Kare Hedebrandt is particularly good as Oskar, giving a nuanced performance as he is, by turns, drawn to his new-found friend and frightened away by her true nature.<br /><br />Let the Right One in will appear to those inside the horror community and beyond.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.<br /><br />An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't<br />seem to feel the Swedish cold.<br /><br />It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.<br /><br />One note re the subtitle controversy - the UK blu-ray has the correct subtitles, and plays just fine on US machines.  At least it did on mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Is this worth paying the inflated prices quoted by third party sellers? No - but, this can be purchased for much less on amazon.co.uk. This is the UK version of the movie and fans of Let The Right One In will appreciate the commentary from the director, Tomas Alfredson (this movie actually marks his directorial debut in the horror genre) and also the author John Ajvide Lindqvist.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.<br /><br />I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was "hypnotic" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself in the role of Eli's protector.<br />The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire - "I must be gone and live, or stay and die" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I really shouldn't have admitted that but some movies just don't sink in the first go around with me.<br />"Let The Right On In" was one of those movies.<br />I've been a huge fan of "Interview With The Vampire" for many years and in my mind, that really is THE definitive vampire movie.<br />So, my first impressions of "LTROI" weren't spectacular.<br />I thought it was boring, drab and pardon the pun...lifeless.<br />So, after debating this movie with a friend a while ago. I decided to watch it again.<br />And.....<br /><br />I think I missed a lot of the subtle things that the movie offers.<br />You know, I went from writing sentence long reviews to writing reviews that bordered on "phone book" size.<br />I'm trying to get to somewhere in between the two.<br /><br />What did I like?<br />Beautiful direction.<br />Colorless and drab environments that really are a reflection of the vampire herself.<br />The acting itself was top notch.<br />My favorite scene is near the end, the hospital scene.<br />I won't spoil it but it was the coolest scene in the movie.<br /><br />What didn't I like upon the second viewing?<br />Not much.<br />Like I said, sometimes a movie just doesn't click with me the first time around.<br />The second time was a charm.<br />I don't know if the subtitles on my version were screwed up or not, I never saw the theater version.<br />All in all, it's a great movie and one of the few vampire movies that is a genuinely great addition to vampire lore.<br />"Let The Right On In" comes......<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Obviously, there's a huge uproar over the terrible injustice Magnolia did to this film.  Instead of keeping the much superior translation used in the theatre version, they redid it with one that is nowhere near as good.  It's unfortunate.  If that's something you're interested in, then maybe you should skip this film for the time being.  The following review is of the film, leaving the controversy to the side since that's being expertly covered already here at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Let the Right One in...what a fantastic film.  After watching the film, I didn't quite know what to say.  I think Roger Ebert said it best:<br /><br />"Remove the vampire elements, and this is the story of two lonely and desperate kids capable of performing dark deeds without apparent emotion. Kids washed up on the shores of despair. The young actors are powerful in draining roles. We care for them more than they care for themselves. Alfredson's palette is so drained of warm colors that even fresh blood is black."<br /><br />So, yes.  It's about a vampire.  But it's not really.  On one hand, it's a harsh coming of age story for Oskar, a young boy caught between two separated parents who don't really seem to care for him, a school that seems to ignore him, bullies that want to do not nice things to him and a vampire that wants...well, what does she/it want?  Eli, that would be the vampire, meets Oskar one night after she moved in next door to him.  She appears to be about his age, but there's something decidedly off about her.  She lives with a vaguely creepy older man, who goes out and does unspeakable things at night to feed her.  She, like Oskar, exists in a world that ignores her---unless of course they discover what she is, and then I'm sure the world would be filled with more than just bullies.<br /><br />She tells Oskar he needs to stand up for himself and he does, which leads him along a messed up journey of self-discovery and growing up.  This isn't a heart-warming story (or is it?).  Its vampires don't sparkle.  Of course, with the washed out, cold colors Alfredson paints the story with, nothing does.  This is further exemplified with this excellent Blu Ray transfer.  The film looks so cold, I expected frost on my TV.  The brilliant color scheme is used very effectively and is only heightened with the pitch perfect transfer.  Definitely recommend this version.<br /><br />At the center of this movie is, I think, a question.  Does Eli, the girl vampire who says she isn't a girl, really love Oskar?  Or is she manipulating him to be her next caretaker?  Can she even love?  I don't know.  And I'm still uncertain by the movie's end, though I have a good feeling I know.  Regardless, it's a terrific film acted by surprisingly excellent child actors.  And I'd recommend watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Finally coming to the little "art house" movie theatre in our city (Albuquerque) was a little Swedish film I had assumed I would have to see on DVD someday:  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  Thank goodness I was able to get in during its five-day run...it's a real treat.<br /><br />This is a horror movie that is also simply a romantic drama and sometimes a very dark comedy.  It hews closely to "vampire conventions" yet turns them pretty neatly on their heads at the same time.<br /><br />12 year old Oskar is a shy, weak awkward little boy.  Not surprisingly, he is prime target for school bullies and also nurses some pretty deep fantasies about exacting bloody revenge on his tormentors.  He drags through his colorless days (the film is set mostly in and around an apartment complex in a rundown suburb of Stockholm during the early `80s...and it's snowing ALL THE TIME) with little to interest him.  He lives with his mother, who doesn't seem to be home much, and only seems to enjoy occasional visits to his father out in the country.<br /><br />One day, some new neighbors move in next door.  A middle aged (closing in on old) man and a 12 year old girl, Eli.  I don't think I'm spoiling much if I let you know now that Eli is actually a vampire, and the old man is her Renfield, the human who takes care of her during the day and helps acquire blood.  While Oskar doesn't figure this out for a while, the viewer picks up on it pretty quickly.<br /><br />Here's what great:  the vampire in the film is stealthy, thirsty for blood and very strong (just like in all the "old school" vampire films).  She is also vulnerable to daylight, and her bite, if you aren't killed by being completely drained and having your neck broken, will turn you into a vampire.  There's none of the toying around with what defines a vampire as we've seen in the last couple of decades worth of vampire films.  Yet the movie shows us Eli as a person who is capable of human vulnerabilities and most importantly, human caring, loyalty and affection.<br /><br />The film shows us the slowly developing friendship between Oskar and Eli.  These scenes are handled with great delicacy and if you took out all the vampiric elements, you'd still have a nice story about the blossoming friendship / love between two lost 12 year olds.<br /><br />The film also shows us just how mundane the details of being a modern vampire are.  The acquiring of blood, the darkening of windows in a modern apartment, etc.<br /><br />And when there are bursts of violence, they are thrilling in their abruptness and ferocity.  The sound editing is great, and while the movie shows you very little of what is happening, you don't feel like it is skimping either.  You are able to conjure up all you need to give yourself a decent case of the willies.<br /><br />The two young actors in the lead (Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli) are terrific.  They are very natural and unforced...they feel NOTHING like Hollywood child actors.  They are not perfect physical specimens...but the both exude a particular brand of innocence that can only come from a child just barely, but not quite, pushed over into adolescence.  Even the bullies in the film, while certainly not carefully fleshed out, are not cardboard characters.  They are all the more menacing because they seem completely possible.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh as you shudder.  It will make you feel warm and sentimental, even when something brutally violent is happening.  There is nothing simple about this seemingly simple story.<br /><br />It is VERY slowly paced.  While it held my interest throughout and certainly captured me emotionally, I must also admit to a little squirming in my seat from time to time.  Part of it stems from the fact that the movie is set in such a bleak time and location.  Snow falling on gray, industrial looking dwellings and schools.  A washed out palette was used overall, and this made the film seem oppressive.  While very effective and highly believable, that isn't necessarily the stuff that ENJOYMENT is made of.  But these feelings were fleeting and only sporadic.<br /><br />This is a somewhat challenging film, not just because you have to read subtitles (which frankly shouldn't be considered a challenge at all), but because it demands that you see the world from a slightly different point-of-view and to show sympathy for a vampire and a 12 year old boy with murder in his heart.  But if you remember that this is, after all, fiction...I don't think you'll have any moral qualms.  I didn't!<br /><br />There are many more elements that come up later in this film, but I don't want to hint at them for fear of spoiling its many pleasures for you.  Just suffice it to say that if what you've read above intrigues you about the film...you won't regret seeing it.  For me, one test of the worth of a film is if I find myself thinking about it days later.  It's been awhile since I saw LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, and I can still feel many of its moods and picture many of its scenes as though I had just walked out of the theatre.  By that measure, and many others, this film is a great success and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Tomas Alfredson's adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel is another example of the current trend for vampires in cinema. While the Twilight series still divides critics, Let The Right One In was critically acclaimed on its release with the likes of Empire Magazine hailing it as their film of the year.<br /><br />Set in Stockholm in 1982, the film focuses on 12 year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) who has fallen foul of a trio of bullies at school but hasn't the courage to stand up to them. Oskar finds hope in Eli (Lina Leandersson) who lives next door but only meets with Oskar at night. It is through Eli that Oskar finds the strength to stand up to the school bullies but his greatest challenge is facing his growing love for Eli and the dark secret that she is a vampire.<br /><br />Let The Right One In is a great testament to Swedish filmmaking. It boasts none of the jaw-dropping effects you would expect from Hollywood but what it lacks in visual treats it more than makes up for with the atmospheric settings of snow-covered streets, deciduous woodland and plain, unspectacular houses. This is a dark and brooding town with little colour, providing the perfect backdrop to the tender romance that develops between two lost souls.<br /><br />Though both young, the two leads are excellent. Troubled Oskar is quiet and sensitive, the perfect target for the ruthless trio of bullies who sadly do not stop at name calling but resort to physical harm as well. Eli is a tortured vampire, her blood thirst portrayed more as a sickness with no pleasure taken in the killing she has to do. Amidst the snowfall on a town outraged by gruesome murders, both children find strength and love in each other. First Oskar in facing his tormentors, Eli daring to enter Oskar's room uninvited and, finally, Oskar having to choose whether to help Eli or let her go.<br /><br />There is little to fault with Let The Right One In. I felt there could have been more detail about Eli's past but this could easily have taken too much of the focus away from Oskar. Despite some areas of obscurity the film works well in swaying from love to violence, though any bloodshed is tastefully done here.<br /><br />Let The Right One In is an excellent but different horror film conveying a romance unhindered by seemingly unassailable boundaries. The brutal bullying inflicted on Oskar hits hard but the equally brutal revenge against the bullies raised a smile for me. Sadly some film fans won't touch anything that isn't British or American but Let The Right One In is one of many examples that world cinema is alive and well. Long may it continue.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>This movie is truly a gem that demands multiple viewings. The director did a magnificent job as did the personnel involved in casting. Kudo's all around for everyone involved in the making of this film.<br />Please don't simply take the movie as popcorn fodder. Ask yourself some questions about the true nature of the relationship between Eli and Oskar. Is it an intimate (as possible), friendship or is it a cold and calculated servile relationship in development? My take leans heavily toward the latter.<br />The English language remake, "Let Me In", is incredibly inferior in every respect and only barely worth viewing. The dubbed version of this film is inferior to the sub-titled version and that opinion is from someone who usually finds subtitles annoying at best.<br />Just a great movie that is hard to review without ruining the film for first time viewers. The movie is truly a "must see".</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>A very neat, decent film-making here. 'Let the right one in' is a vampire film that stays ahead of most vampire films, often witnessed by people. After witnessing brilliant performances from tho two main leads : Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson, all you can say is 'wow' and simply stare at these two children on the tv screen, specially Leandersson, who gives her almost every bit in her role, her facial expressions alone, easily make you read her mind, a similarly brilliant performance by Kare Hedebrant, who gives a genuine performance and you simply give out your heart to him. The feelings of friendship, love and sexual innocence portrayed by these two twelve year old children is something simply remarkable. The film, though slow paced sometimes, never looses its grip and maintains a horrifying atmosphere throughout. Worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>"Let the Right One In" is a terrific little movie. It is hard to pigeonhole this as a horror movie since the "horror" aspect is secondary to it's main premise which is isolation and loneliness. The "horror" aspect is all together more startling since this is an  unconventional and unpredictable film.<br /><br />The movie is about a lonely, [practically] abandoned and physically immature kid. He's weird and get bullied a lot. Because his parents are divorced and the mother does not give him that much attention, his abuse and loneliness are all the more excasperated.<br /><br />As he hangs out at his apartment complex, which is all that he has to do, he befriends another lonely child...who just happens to be a vampire. They both are lonely yet for very different reasons. She's lonely because she is a monster. However, their mutual companionship develops a bond where each charactor sets aside or accepts any flaws of the other.<br /><br />As their relationship blossoms, so does the deadly vampirical activites of the little girl. Eventually the boy finds out about it and the vampire candidly discloses her tendencies. It does not matter to the boy since he is so hungry for companionship and acceptance. Of course as the movie proceeds so does the vampire's increasing hunger for blood. Eventually, the beast in the vampire inevitably must conflict with the innocense of the relationship.<br /><br />Once again, this is a small and subtle movie. It is hardly a big scale production. The plot relies on charactor development and emotion as opposed to action and excessive violence. Some viewers discuss the climax as though it's some, phenomenal piece of terrifying action. In reality, the ending is merely symbolic and consistent with the relationship that was created throughout the story.<br /><br />Not only is this a unique way to tell a vampire story but, also, the setting, in a nordic, snow-covered, urban landscape is quite different from the usual vampire fare.<br /><br />What makes this movie special is not the scares or gore (which there are) but rather  the very proven success in telling a very adult tale through child's eyes...a la "To Kill a Mockingbird". Vampire films are a dime a dozen but when it is told through a child's perspective it can be very creepy.<br /><br />This is a very good movie done in a unique way. On it's own, it is certainly quality film making. As compared to the "horror" genre, it's heads and tails above the ususal making this among the best vampire movies.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The tagline of the chilling Swedish thriller "L?t den r&auml;tte komma in" ("Let the Right One in") goes like this: "Eli is 12 years old. She's been 12 for over 200 years and, she just moved in next door." And Eli has a secret to hide, a big, dark secret that a 12-year-old boy Oskar, who befriends Eli, is to know very soon<br /><br />Perhaps you already know the secret of Eli, an enigmatic girl with a pale face. Yes, she is a vampire. Not much is known about her past. Set in the early 80s, the film follows the story of a bullied boy Oskar and Eli, a girl who lives with a tired, middle-aged man H?kan. His past is shrouded in nearly as much mystery as Eli herself. All we know is H?kan, always faithful to Eli, is ready to do anything for her - even if it may violate laws.<br /><br />"Let the Right One in," based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (which I haven't read), is not just a vampire horror. It works as a horror, and it scares us in a most unexpected way (like a stylish swimming pool sequence which is unforgettable), but the film is also a very dark version of a "boy-meets-girl" story. The difference is, their romance is not always sweet, and the couple's "happiness" does not necessarily mean that of the others around them.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson gives a unique twist to the now familiar conventions of vampire tales: gender-reversed roles of main characters, for instance (compare this one with the "Twilight" saga). To some viewers the most intriguing part of the film would be the untold story of Eli the vampire. Where did she come? Is she alone? The film is set in the 1980s - but why is that? Possibilities are suggested and they are open to our imagination. And what makes the film special is the cold atmosphere and the chemistry between the leads.<br /><br />"Let the Right One in" is a smart vampire movie with a few things to add to the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>A film about sacrifices. While everyone who has seen the trailer will know that this is the story of a small snow-bound Swedish town haunted by a vampire, what is truly awesome about it is the fragility of each character, and how they all crumble in one way or another. Eli's sacrifices, Oskar's sacrificies, Virginia's sacrifice, H?kan's sacrifice...  The film is beautiful and minimal, and we care about all of the characters. The love story between two 12-year-olds is somehow quite believable. The theme of bullyism is a bit clumsy, and provides a bit of non-vampire action. The book, apparently, also deals with alcoholism, drug use, and pedophilia - wow, pack it all in between the vampirism and murder.<br /><br />This film is very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In is poignant, sad, weird, different, elusive, as well as being a fine movie. Oskar is a blond 12-year-old who lives with his divorced mother in an apartment complex in Stockholm. He's bullied incessantly at school. Neither his mother nor his father seems to have much time for him. He's a quiet kid who dreams of getting back at his tormentors. He doesn't seem to have any friends. Then an older man and a child move into the apartment building. Her name, we learn, is Eli. She's 12 years old, too, pale, and at times looks haggard. Oskar meets her one evening in the playground in front of the apartment complex. Snow is deep on the ground. The weather is freezing. The cold doesn't bother Eli. By now we know Eli is a vampire. Oskar realizes this later.<br /><br />Let The Right One In is a strange fusion of coming-of-age and horror, but the result is something else. Don't ask me what. It doesn't fit in any film genre I'm familiar with. Calling it `horror" is too facile. Calling it "coming of age" is too shallow. In the course of the movie people will die, drained of their blood. Eli's...what?...protector?...partner?...the older man named Hakan she lives with...will kill for the blood he and Eli must have to survive. He'll die a terrible death himself. Eli will tell Oskar that they can't be friends, yet Oskar yearns for friendship. He asks Eli to be his girl friend before he knows she is a vampire and she asks him if he would like her if she weren't a girl. When he asks her age, she tells him she is 12 and has been for a long time. Oskar's innocence may be part of his protection. Eli is not innocent, but at times she seems as fragile as Oskar. Like the man she lives with, Eli will kill for blood. She must.<br /><br />Kare Hedebrant plays Oskar and Lina Leandersson plays Eli. I understand that at the time of filming Hedebrant was 12 and Leandersson was 11. Both were nonprofessionals. They are unnervingly natural. Neither makes a single false step. Hedebrant is exactly what a lonely, bullied 12-year-old could be. Leandersson is able to imply things we may not want to know just be being still. I wound up hoping for the best for both Oskar and Eli...but what the best might be could go in a number of directions.<br /><br />This is a film, adapted from his novel by John Ajvide Linqvist, which invites discussion and interpretation. Not everything is kept clear, and, for me, that increases the sense of elusiveness. Lat Den Ratte Komma is a wonderful film.<br /><br />Excuse me, however, if I reach for a barf bag. The director of Cloverfield, Mat Reeves, has evidently signed to make an English language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films. The chance that something unusual, unsettling and restrained will be turned into butcher shop leftovers is just about, I'd guess, one hundred per cent. See this movie while you can. Since it probably will be shown in only a handful of American theaters, I recommend you buy it sight unseen when it comes out on DVD. It's that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>"Let The Right One In" is a thoughtful, introspective movie about an unusual friendship, peppered with some effective and striking horror imagery.  While not overly ambiguous, the film definitely leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the young boy's friendship with the undead girl is ultimately a good or bad thing.  A brief subplot involving a middle-aged woman who survives an attack by the girl and starts transforming into a vampire herself is a memorable addition to the film.  Especially recommended for those who like their horror set against a backdrop of mundane, realistically presented daily life.  The standard DVD looks and sounds fine, and gives the viewer the option of seeing the film in the original Swedish with English subtitles, or dubbed in English.  There is also a handful of interesting special features about the making of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Let the Right One In" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.<br /><br />I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was "hypnotic" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow abounding all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself as Eli's protector.<br /><br />The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire "I must be gone and live, or stay and die" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>"Let the Right one in" is a vampire movie that takes the idea of vampires seriously. Oskar is a 12-year old lonely boy; he is bullied in school, his parents are broken up and seems to have no friends. Oskar carries around a knife and he fantasizes of using it and taking revenge on his bullies. Then, he meets Eli, a girl that just moved to his apartment complex. Eli is special: she walks barefoot in the snow, doesn't wear a jacket and smells funny. She also has been 12 for a long time and only comes out at night. She is also capable of great violence to satisfy her hunger. Despite these things, Oskar moves past her strange qualities and they become friends. They become each other's life lines and feed the hungry loneliness that surrounds them.<br /><br />Eli is protective of Oskar and although at one point Oskar is upset about her nature, their friendship is strengthened by each passing moment. The movie is really good. It is dark, gothic, raw and at times disturbing but, it also has humor and tender moments. The nature of Eli's vampirism is somewhat explored but the main theme is that of loneliness and how Oskar and Eli complement each other. The film is beautifully shot and the end result is a great, poetic and amazing scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>**The following review pertains to a DVD release of the film featuring the original "theatrical subtitles". I can't pass comment on the 'hacked about' subtitles that appeared on the original US domestic release DVD of the film as I haven't seen it; but I am led to believe that it vastly changes the timbre and tone of the film as much of the more nuanced dialogue is sacrificed. Seek out the original "theatrically subtitled" version where you can.**<br /><br />Oskar is a bullied twelve year old who lives with his mother in a council estate in the Blackeberg suburb of Stockholm. His life is a painful litany of physical abuse at the hands of his peers, over-mothering, and impotent rage expressed through the collection of articles about serial killers from newspapers and magazines.<br /><br />However Oskar's life is to be forever changed by the arrival of the new girl next door, Eli - who is something far more and also far less than she appears...<br /><br />Tomas Alfredson's film of "Let The Right One In" is a lyrical, poetic, deliberately ambiguous adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel. Adapted for the screen by Lindqvist himself, the film is far more focussed on experience of childhood (through the travails of Oskar and Eli) and decidedly less focussed on the lives of tertiary adult characters such as the 'Sun Palace' regulars (Jocke, Lacke, Virginia, Morgan and Larry).<br /><br />That is not to say that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the novel - it is. It's just that Alfredson and Lindqvist have quite wisely realised that film is a very different medium to literature and in paring down the sub-plots, and characters at work within them, they throw the themes and concerns of the novel into sharp relief in a way that would probably only have been possible to achieve through the medium of a television mini-series had they retained the depth and multitude of sub-plots and characters from the original book. Purists may bemoan the absence of a number of characters (Oskar's wayward adolescent neighbour and his rigid policeman stepfather are nowhere to be seen, and Hakan's obscene sexual predilections have been excised and his character subtly reinterpreted in a way that may suggest that he and Oskar may have a lot more in common than is at first apparent) and sub-plots (the zombie-style rampage of a character who has received Eli's sanguine attentions has been removed; and what has been perceived by many to be the novel's most controversial twist is vaguely alluded too rather than explicitly stated), but to my mind, this only strengthens the film as one focuses directly on the uniquely un-sugared vision of a world seen though a child's eyes. The only other film that I can think of that has so perfectly provided a window into the experience of childhood is Terry Gilliam's stunning, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898">Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br />Performances are extraordinary. Lina Leandersson is perfectly cast as Eli and she uses her strange, otherworldly - but rather pretty - young face to dynamic effect. At no point did I relate to her as a child actress; she really 'is' Eli.  Similarly, Kare Hedebrandt perfectly captures all the naivety, rage and introspective joy of Oskar's lonely young soul.<br /><br />The period setting of Stockholm in 1981 is perfectly captured. I grew up on a council estate in the UK in the early 1980's and was stunned by how the Swedish council estate in th film evoked the look and feel of my own experience growing up 'on the block'. Similarly, the fashions of the clothes and d&eacute;cor of the time are perfectly evoked to the point that I forgot that I was watching a film made in 2008 rather than a period piece.<br /><br />In terms of set-pieces, I was expecting a lot from this film, in particular from the swimming pool sequence towards it's end - and it delivered. Boy, did it deliver. That one sequence alone was worth purchasing the film in my opinion. It really did feel like I was watching exactly what I had envisioned when I read the book.<br /><br />Although not to everyone's taste, if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed, languidly paced examination of young love and the loneliness of childhood (or is it a chilling portrait of the emotional manipulation of an isolated, vulnerable young boy by a ruthless predator that just appears to be a twelve year old girl? or even an allegorical tale of the primoridal manifestation of a wounded anima?) with some oblique horrific overtones, then you could do a lot worse than to pick this film up.<br /><br />A word of warning for more impressionable viewers though. This film has haunted my waking hours in the week or so since I've watched it and has effected me in a way that no film - not even Darren Aronofsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4CS">Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)</a> or Gaspar Noe's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0U4">Irreversible</a> - ever has before. It may be the air of nostalgic melancholia, the pervasive sense of loneliness that haunts every frame, or it may just be due to some unresolved issues from my own childhood, but be careful of this one - it gets into your head. That said, it may well now be my favourite film of all time.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the novel - consider it a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>This is miles ahead of the lame, saccharine, Mormonish, sexless, sanitized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>. This is the REAL thing. This is a little Swedish film that is years ahead anything made in Hollywood these days within the Vampire genre.<br /><br />Little Oskar lives in a small Swedish town. It's Winter and he is bullied at school. Until he meets Eli, a girl who befriends him and teaches him to make a stand against his enemies. In the meanwhile, they both experiment with love. Oh, and by the way, she is a vampire.<br /><br />This little film captures childhood or pre-puberty as few others do. And on top of that, the horror is so tasteful and well introduced that the viewer is constantly on the edge of his seat without the need for the cheap scares we see in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />It is amazing how this film captures a kind of Winter mood, as everything seems to stop and be confined to the indoors (while Oskar constantly keeps going to the playground in order to meet Eli). I also loved the cinematography.<br /><br />But it is the directing, the screenplay and the actors who shine in this film. I did not need the subtitles and it a shame if they do not translate the dialogs accurately, because everything here is beautifully written.<br /><br />Truly amazing! The Europeans have done it again! Hall? Sverige!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Vampire movies tend to come in two flavours -- either they're gory bloodsucker actionfests, or celebrations of goth hotties tortured by their immortality.<br /><br />But "Let The Right One In" is neither kind or story. Instead this haunting, atmospheric Swedish movie is a poignant look at a very unique friendship between a young boy and a vampire child. Brilliant acting and a sort of pale, ghostly directorial style make this a vivid experience, but the brilliance is in the story itself.<br /><br />One winter night, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) sees a car drop off his two new neighbors. He doesn't pay much attention at first, since he's always either ignored or bullied.<br /><br />But as he vents his frustrations by stabbing a tree, he sees the ghostly, rumpled Eli (Lina Leandersson), who informs him, "Just so you know, I can't be your friend." She turns out to be as much of an oddball as Oskar -- especially since she only ventures out at night, smells a bit funny, and is unaffected by the winter cold. But despite her odd greeting, the two strike up a friendship.<br /><br />At the same time, a series of brutal murders are taking place all around town -- and  it's no great shock that Eli's companion Hakan (Per Ragnar) is harvesting blood for Eli. Being no idiot, Oskar realizes that Eli is a bona fide vampire, and doesn't intend to let that get in the way of their puppy love. Yet when Hakan's errands go horribly awry, Oskar finds himself to be the only person Eli can rely on.<br /><br />It's no great exaggeration to say that "Let the Right One In" is undoubtedly the best vampire movie made in many years. While the movie has plenty of more violent moments and a snowy backdrop, director Tomas Alfredson is far more focused on the sweet, eerie relationship between two lonely, otherworldly young children. And actually, one of them is young in appearance only.<br /><br />Alfredson paints the movie in white, scarlet and black -- pale, wintry light and snow that covers the world, occasional splatters of blood and deep shadows that seem to swallow everything up. And he handles the entire storyline gracefully. Every part of the movie has the same matter-of-fact, unflinching treatment, including the nastier parts -- such as a gruesome blood-harvesting murder by Hakan, or when Eli attempts to enter a house without being invited. Trust me, it's bad.<br /><br />The most loving attention is devoted to the children's friendship, which manages to be as strange and beautiful as a rare dragonfly. Their nighttime meetings almost have the quality of a dream ("I might not be here tomorrow") and Alfredson keeps their blossoming relationship from ever seeming cutesy or contrived. And it has an innocent quality that transcends the sometimes bloody, disturbing storyline.<br /><br />And trust me, "Let the Right One In" has no sentimental ideas about children (even vampiric ones). They can be more violent than anyone, because they are more vulnerable than anyone.<br /><br />The stars of this movie are undeniably Hedebrant and Leandersson, and it's nothing short of amazing that they have never once acted before this movie. Both have the ice-pale faces and deep eyes of otherworldly creatures, making their friendship seem almost inevitable. Leandersson in particular is brilliant at showing the different sides of Eli -- one minute she's shyly asking about a Rubik's cube, the next she's bellowing at her creepy familiar.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is a hauntingly beautiful story of children's friendship and love, wrapped in the most unique vampire stories in many years. A must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>There are several sequences in Let the Right One In that would have been better left on the editing room floor. You'll know them when you see them. They did little more than take the audience out of the moment and distract from the real brilliance of the film. Had they been left out, I would have easily given the film five stars. I wanted to explain that up front, because, apart from this quibble, Let the Right One In is a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />The film is a touching portrayal of love -- it's ability to overcome, to embrace privately what makes us original, freakish, terrible, and wonderful, and the lengths to which we will go in its name.  With a slow, steady hand, and with a wonderful gift for flashing glimpses and suggestions, the director, Tomas Alfredson, convinces us that this weird, otherworldly, and bloodthirsty place is simply another facet of the human experience.<br /><br />Some moments stand out -- when the "father," having returned home unsuccessful, asks for forgiveness, and his "child" lashes out in this ancient voice; when Eli, the forever-twelve-year-old vampire, gently caresses Oskar after she reveals, and he accepts, that she is "not a girl"; and when Oskar leaves this father's house after the arrival of a "friend," with intimations about why his mother and father are no longer together. This is truly subtle and intelligent filmmaking. It also speaks to the loneliness of modern youth. For vastly different reasons, Oskar and Eli have no meaningful relationships with adults. In their loneliness, they find each other.<br /><br />In thinking about this movie, one theme that seems especially provocative is the idea of this ancient, yet physically undeveloped vampire being drawn to the young, innocent Oskar. Like the rare young woman who is wise and world-weary beyond her years, Eli gravitates to the youthful innocence of Oskar. It perhaps fills this long forgotten need to be a child -- something that may be inherent in her stunted physical development. But, at the same time, she becomes a mother to him, a guide, and, some might say, a corrupting influence. For Eli, Oskar represents, perhaps, a last, tenuous hold on her own humanity. Throughout the film, she battles the need to draw him in with the fear that, in doing so, she will destroy the very innocence that drew her to him.<br /><br />Be patient with Let the Right One In if you think it begins too slowly. The pace is essential to its ultimate effect. This is one of the best films of the year, and one truly to savor in its graceful unfolding.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.<br /><br />An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't<br />seem to feel the Swedish cold.<br /><br />It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>A sweet story of a first love the under-thirteen-y.o. bullied boy felt in with a vampire appearing as a girl of the same age, their mutual support and things mortally-dangerous occurring in Sweden of the late seventies.<br /><br />I don't like this sort of human-dead corps relations as my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T5D6LK">Twilight</a> review had testified, but it's a really romantic work touching a range of things existing convincingly, a really talented movie with a great potential for extension, by the same writer saga of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y5H5HY">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>doesn't fill in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Let The Right One In is one of the best horror films to come out in the past few years.

The main question in the movie, what makes it really interesting, is the girl vampire actually friends with the boy or is a means to an end? This question gets bounced around throughout the film but is never completely answered. The child actors in this movie are very good which is partly the reason for my 4-star rating. Well worth your time and $$.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I will not join the subtitle controversy, so I am not reviewing the DVD here, but rather the film, and as a film it is superb.  The words that come to mind are: evocative, stark, meditative, intelligent, deliberate, chill and haunting.<br /><br />It is the heart of Swedish winter, those days of long nights, spare sunlight, a stark and barren landscape of winter sky and drifted snow, deep black and white, and a slim and delicate 12 year old boy living with his divorced mother, bullied at school, isolated and lonely meets a new neighbor, a strange girl near his age and in turn equally isolated and alienated from her surroundings.  A timid contact is made and a growing connection is made between the two kindred spirits, while eerie and bloody mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Yes, it's a vampire film, but what is again demonstrated here is that when intelligence is brought to any genre you have something else quite unexpected and special.  The themes of loneliness, isolation and the heart and meaning of "strangeness" and the understanding of the "other" are subtext to a thriller that has some graphic and disturbing violence and gore, but done by film-makers with the sense to know that what you don't show can be just as effective or even more so than what you do show.<br /><br />There has been good reason for the buzz around this film, coming out around the same time as bigger budgeted and hyped film and TV shows in the same genre.  This film demonstrates how atmosphere can be made by the accumulation of detail, carefully unfolding.  They don't play with the audience in that they get to the bloody business early on, but it is revealed with deliberate care.  It may sound incongruous to say, but the graphic gore is handled with tact.  It is the glimpsed horror you see and the further horror imagined.  It is the artful use of camera angle, and consideration of a building of tension and violence.  It isn't all about special effects, it is about using them to the greatest effect by not shoving them in the audience face all the time.<br /><br />That and a mood of overall stillness.  There is something truly eerie about a brutal killing in the quiet of blanketed snow or in the middle of a sleek & blandly modern town square in dead winter night.  They captured it here and it is memorable.<br /><br />The two young leads are well cast, the girl especially has a wonderful look that is both normal and otherworldly, especially here large, hypnotic eyes.  The rest is a marvelous evocation from an intelligent script and first rate production and direction.  Well done all around, nearly classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is not the best vampire movie ever made. The cover box claims this and that is certainly not the case.  However this is a excellent vampire horror movie that has a long pedigree in film.  This isn't a horror movie pedigree but instead the idea of a friendless outcast boy finding a friend or champion in a stronger person or in this case a vampire girl.  The story is well acted and I didn't mind  the english dubbing at all. They should have offered a subtitled version but that is not a real problem in enjoying this movie. And it is enjoyable with richly defined lead characters and good special effects.  Fans of fun and fast moving gross out movies who don't want a drama context and a solid story might not like this one. However  Those fans need to branch out though into this type of story driven horror flick too ,as they are excellent too.  This is a story that is like a fairy tale story of old in some ways. And those were bloody tales when they were first told too.  This movie focuses on the relationship between the two lead characters as much as the violence and horror.  This movie reminded me of the classic horror flick Beauty and the beast (the 1946 version) in it's careful attention to detail in characterization and that's a great horror movie from that period.  On blu ray this movie looks great which really brings out the excellent photography of the frozen swedish landscape of the story.  This is just a well done movie that even people who aren't horror fans can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Let the Right One In" is among the most striking vampire films I've seen. It is less a horror film than a drama with a horrific premise that jumps out at the audience every once in while. The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a screenplay written by John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of the novel on which it is based. In a working class suburb of Stockholm in the early 1980s, a frail, bookish 12-year-old named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is terrorized by bullies at his school, while a murderer who drains his victims' blood stalks the community. Oskar is miserable, without friends or any obvious self-esteem. One evening, he is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl who recently moved into his building. Eli is as socially isolated as Oskar is, but she could be a dangerous friend to have.<br /><br />The violence that lies beneath the nearly silent, snow-covered exterior is the scary part. It's cold. The population seems affable but disaffected. The efforts of Eli's keeper (Per Ragnar) to procure blood for her are so mundane and matter-of-fact that their violence is all the more startling. Yet I almost pitied him his difficulties. Oskar's mounting anger threatens to explode. Eli is a haunting girl with dark hair and big, blue eyes, possessed of a calm resignation and no aversion to killing. The film achieves its creepiness through a measured pace, quiet setting, and a refusal to spell anything out for us. We're never certain what's going to happen or even what we want to happen. We come to understand Eli's predicament slowly. In the end, I wasn't sure what I thought of her, but Eli made a strong impression. In Swedish with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, a Photo Gallery of 20 production stills, a Theatrical Poster Gallery of 5 posters, and a "Behind the Scenes" (7 1/2 min) featurette in which director Tomas Alfredson talks about the movie, casting, and characters. Subtitles are available in English, English narrative, and Spanish. Dubbing available in English.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In is what happens when you mix vampires with Swedes.  The movie is a plodding meditation on coming-of-age for a boy in Sweden and the Swedish vibe soaks the entire film, right down to its color palate. This film is as much about Sweden as it is about vampires.<br /><br />Claudia in Interview with the Vampire brought about some uncomfortable questions about what happens when a child is turned into a bloodsucking beast. Let the Right One In answered that question: you get a 400-year-old bloodsucking child.<br /><br />Eli has her own ghoul, a scarred, plodding man who is not very good at bloodletting. His inept attempts force Eli to take increasingly drastic measures, until the whole town is on to her. But not before she befriends the little blonde moppet named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant).<br />Thing is, Oskar's kind of a freak.  Obsessed with stabbing the bullies who harass him, mouth breathing when he swims (seriously, he seems like he will nearly drown every time he gets in the water), and torn between his attractive but busy mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) and his fun but alcoholic father Erik (Henrik Dahl), Oskar doesn't really fit in anywhere.  Until he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), and suddenly it's clear that they were meant for each other.<br /><br />Let the Right One In makes a point of keeping their relationship asexual. Eli's appearance varies from sickly to vibrant, depending on how much blood she can drink, which isn't very much. She resorts to ambushing the drunken, sad sack residents of the town, who take quite a long time to rally a defense.<br /><br />Let the Right On In uses special effects in surprisingly effective ways, with one exception: when cats, who can sense vampires, go on the offensive, they look like bad CGI. But there are other scenes that are pitch perfect and perfectly convey a vampire child in a stark white world.<br /><br />There's a distinct lack of police presence in this movie. The police are only heard as sirens, never in person. There's no sheriff to speak of. Part of why Eli gets away with as many murders as she does is because there's a plot-induced blindness by law enforcement and medical services.<br /><br />And yet Let the Right One In is an undeniably creepy vampire movie. It's in part related to the no holds barred conflict between bully and bullied, who increasingly up the stakes until...well, until a vampire has to get involved.  And that never ends well.<br /><br />American audiences are likely to find Let the Right One In dull and plodding, with occasional moments of brilliance.  I prefer to see it as a distinctly Swedish take on the bloody business of puberty.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I just finished John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel yesterday and was interested to see how the story was captured on film so I watched the DVD last night. I have to say this is one of the rare cases where I actually liked the film better than novel, but I have to qualify that by saying that if I hadn't read the novel, I wouldn't have enjoyed the film as much as I did. Does that make sense?<br /><br />The basic storyline is that 12 year old Oskar is an outsider, bullied at school, living with an overbearing mother and he fantasizes about killing his classmates. Eli is a young girl who moves in next door to Oskar and the two strike up a friendship. But Eli is an outsider as well...for much darker reasons.<br /><br />Because I'm not into spoilers I won't say any more. I do recommend you read the novel before viewing, you will get much more from the film that way. Also, if you are hoping this is another "Twilight" keep looking. "Let the Right One In" is actually more of a drama than a horror film.<br /><br />I think the movie clicks for so many reasons, Lindqvist adapted the novel himself and wrote the screenplay. The novel is so melancholy, and Lindqvist adds a few touches to the story that help lighten it up a bit. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be "the-feel-good-movie-of-the-year" no matter how you cut it, but it's not steeped in the morose tone that the novel is. Simply becuase of the 2 hour running time, quite a few aspects of the original story are altered, glossed over, or left out altogether. I have to say I was disappointed Hakan's story was cut short and altered and I would have liked to see Eli's back-story included. But I understand the reason for their removal.<br /><br />I think the reason the film worked so well, and why I enjoyed it so much was simply the acting performances turned in by the two young stars. Kare Hedebrant as Oskar does a great job! The young actor's expressions, the emotions he conveys with simply looks were amazing, you really felt for Oskar. And to top it off, Lina Leandersson as Eli is equally as good. I was very interested to see who the cast as Eli. She had to be sympathetic, but also have that edge of danger and mystery that make the character so enjoyable. Lina captures Eli perfectly, at times seeming much older than 12, yet still maintaining a child-like quality. The two young stars do such a great job, I can't picture anyone else attempting these roles.<br /><br />Which leads me to this, watch this version of the film. From what I understand, Hollywood has gotten their hands on this thing and you just know it's going to be watered down pap. The title is even being changed to "Let Me In"...is this the Big Bad Wolf story??? Knowing how Hollywood works, they will probably cast a couple kids from the Disney Channel, pack the soundtrack with crap by American Idol contestants, and have the kids wearing all black to show how "deep" they are.<br /><br />Pick this up, make sure you get the corrected subtitles, and simply enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Hollywood has always thought of itself as the be all to end all. But the elite have always held fast that foreign films were the way to go. So Hollywood has chosen to remake a number of foreign films with highs and lows in success. A new film is already set for remake but this week finds the original released on DVD.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a hybrid film. By hybrid think of combining films. The western and sci fi flicks were married in STAR WARS. Musicals and romance films in STEP UP. This film is an even stranger mix combining coming of age, romance and horror. But then vampires and romance seem to have gone hand in hand forever, just not quite this young.<br /><br />Oskar is a 12 year old growing up in a city in Sweden. His life is fairly boring with the exception of the school bully picking on him most of the time and Oskar doing nothing in retaliation.<br /><br />A new neighbor moves into the apartment next to Oskar and his mother, a late middle aged man and a young girl. Oskar notices the covered windows but doesn't realize why until much later.<br /><br />Sitting in the courtyard on the jungle gym, Oskar first meets Eli. Clad in thing clothes and barefoot, he asks if she isn't cold. Her reply is that she isn't that she doesn't remember how to be cold. And so begins an unusual friendship.<br /><br />The man living with Eli is her benefactor. His job is to provide her a place to stay and fresh blood so that she doesn't have to go out and hunt, thus placing herself in jeopardy. But he's beginning to slow down, failing to complete the tasks. While one victim does die, his blood isn't captured and brought home requiring Eli to go out on her own. The attack is simple but seen and when people begin to talk about a child killing a full grown man, few believe the tale.<br /><br />Oskar and Eli begin to spend time together while Oskar's mother is at work. The required invitation to a vampire for entry is offered and Eli enters the apartment. But Oskar still doesn't realize exactly what Eli is.<br /><br />When an encounter with the school bully and his pals results in Oskar having a slice on his cheek he lies to Eli (and his mother) about how he got the injury. But Eli sees the truth. And her advice to Oskar is that the next time it happens, to make sure and hit the bully...hard.<br /><br />The film moves slowly, taking it's time with the timid pacing to set the stage. We begin to see Oskar starting to have a bit more confidence in himself. And when he finally does take on the bully, we cheer for him and at the same time worry that he will be changed to a more horrendous figure.<br /><br />As for Eli, her need to attack comes out after her benefactor fails his own plot for murder, leaving her with no one to fetch nourishment for her. The attacks she makes are the most disturbing images seen in this film. Thoughts of a child doing such horrible deeds are the things of nightmares.<br /><br />Eli reveals herself to Oskar but not before he puts her to a test: entering his apartment without the required invitation. The results are disturbing but soon forgotten. The strangest part is that Oskar has moved from his timid victim to a defensive individual able to stand up for himself, even to Eli.<br /><br />When the murders begin to set the stage for Eli being caught its time to move on. But not before one final moment when Oskar is beset not by just the bully but by his older brother, a budding psychopath if there ever was one.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has been hailed as a terrifying film for fans of the genre. But as I watched I never found myself frightened. I did find the film fascinating in its depiction of a world I've never seen, Sweden. And the characters were enough to hold my interest, especially the interaction between the pair as they discovered one another.<br /><br />If your cup of tea is the rapid paced films seen more often than not then this movie isn't for you. If you like something with a bit more substance that takes it's time to tell you the story then you might want to give it a try. The effects are not gore filled, the feeling is eerie and the tale is original. And once the story finishes, you might think twice before opening the door to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>It's taken me a long time to write a review of this film after seeing it. The delay came not from the daunting praise that's been heaped upon it (well over 60 international award nominations/wins), but by the film itself. It also has ...something ...about it that lingers in the mind; something that I'll try to hit upon while writing this review.<br /><br />First let's talk about the movie's genre. It has often been mislabeled as horror. It isn't. It has very few horror elements and should never be cast into that bloody pool (those who've seen the film will get my pun ...I hope). Yes, there's the vampire construct from the beginning, but this vampire film is far different than those that've come before. It is touching in the adolescent sense and numbing in the way the story unfolds and is filmed.<br /><br />So let's talk a moment about the filming. Shot on-location in Sweden during the winter months, the color film is often muted by the black and white of snow and buildings. This gives the film a unique feel and a connection to the main characters (as they live in a black-and-white world full of knowns ...for a while), but it also makes the eyes of the viewer tired of seeing the same drabness. This is why I gave the film a bit lower rating than most. Although I know where and why writer/director Alfredson did what he did -- for the sake of his art --  I don't think it translated completely to the big screen.<br /><br />The story, however, is pretty magical in that it takes an old genre (vampire films) and puts a new spin on it. The main characters aren't just young, they're REALLY young. Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is just 12 years old. Battling toward adolescence, he is small for his age and is ridiculed and tortured by fellow classmates. One can only imagine the amount of anger bottled up inside him. But we don't have to imagine it ...because it shows up in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), an aged vampire forever locked in a young body. The two form a friendship based on puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and their need to connect with someone their own age. For Eli, the connection is a much greater need (as we see by the end of the film). But for Oskar, it must feel just as great.<br /><br />And speaking of the end, there's a surprise waiting for those who make it through the film. A big one. The ending, when spoken about in movie circles, is often said to present more questions than answers. Was Oskar just a pawn for Eli? Something she needed to survive? Was Eli even real? Or was she a dark figment of Oskar's personality that manifested itself via murder? It is a dichotomy that will not be easily un-puzzled.<br /><br />And herein lay the reason it took me so long to review LET THE RIGHT ONE IN after seeing it: I didn't know how to respond (myself) to that ending. But one things for sure, it stuck with me. I remember every word the two main characters spoke and recall all of the mixed angst and beauty they represented. It definitely sank a fang into me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Thomas Alfredson's "Let The Right One In" is a sparse, poetic, slim masterpiece of a film which is part Guillermo Del Toro and part Bruno Schulz.  For any fan of horror, the supernatural or experimental film this will be like a juicy orange with a little blood flowing out of the center.<br /><br />Based on John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BPIWIO">Let me In [Let the Right One In] [Hardcover</a>] about a 12 year old boy named Oskar (played with an understated melancholy by K?re Hedebrant) and his newfound "girlfriend" Eli (in a brilliant performance which makes you wonder how old the actress (Lina Leandersson) herself really is.  The opening shot of the film is a tide of glistening snow, pulsating in a black canopy night, setting the mood of the dark tale which paints a bleak portrait of human nature and the Darwinian world of pre-teen/early teen relations. (Another thing I admired about the movie is how honest it is about this stage of our lives.  People often portray relations between kids as being idyllic.  I don't remember it that way at all. While I don't remember anyone trying to drown me, it's not too far.)<br /><br />Oskar is constantly set upon by bullies and there are shots when the abuse he endures is viewed as Christlike.  The cinematography here is perfect.  His mother (Karin Bergquist) is of no help to the kid and his father is practically absent.<br />He is alone most of the time and his recreational activities consist of sticking knives into trees while pretending he is killing his enemies.<br /><br />Eli appears on the scene in a shot worthy of Bunuel.  Alone in the abandoned courtyard of Oskar's apartment courtyard she is fresh from another kill and looms over the child as either a potential predator or a friend.  Fortunately for the viewer, she chooses the latter.<br /><br />The bond that develops between the two is at first informal, cold, but slowly develops.  There is a child killer loose where Oskar lives and Eli's dubious relationship with him is never discovered by Eli.  After being captured it becomes apparent that the murderer is serving Eli.  The question the film leaves one with is thus: is it Eli's intent that Oskar fill this role?  Is his destiny going to be as ill fated as the killer?  Does she swoop down and save him from a near fatal incident of bullying because they are truly bound or because she needs another servant?<br /><br />Like anyone else I thought it was a bit much using 12 year olds for this kind of role. However, there is nothing here that is all that perverse, except for one single shot which I found absolutely unnecessary and gross.  The reason Alfredson uses kids for the role is not for any nasty reason (if you want an example of that check out some of Larry Clark's movies) but to allow the film a child's imagination.  Reminiscent of George Romero's film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33E6">Martin</a> this is one of the genius takes on the concept of the vampire.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a beautifully filmed and hypnotic horror tale.

The story is gripping and at times shocking.<br /><br />All I can say is, watch it - truly outstanding.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Vampire movies tend to come in two flavours -- either they're gory bloodsucker actionfests, or celebrations of goth hotties tortured by their immortality.<br /><br />But "Let The Right One In" is neither kind or story. Instead this haunting, atmospheric Swedish movie is a poignant look at a very unique friendship between a young boy and a vampire child. Brilliant acting and a sort of pale, ghostly directorial style make this a vivid experience, but the brilliance is in the story itself.<br /><br />One winter night, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) sees a car drop off his two new neighbors. He doesn't pay much attention at first, since he's always either ignored or bullied.<br /><br />But as he vents his frustrations by stabbing a tree, he sees the ghostly, rumpled Eli (Lina Leandersson), who informs him, "Just so you know, I can't be your friend." She turns out to be as much of an oddball as Oskar -- especially since she only ventures out at night, smells a bit funny, and is unaffected by the winter cold. But despite her odd greeting, the two strike up a friendship.<br /><br />At the same time, a series of brutal murders are taking place all around town -- and it's no great shock that Eli's companion Hakan (Per Ragnar) is harvesting blood for Eli. Being no idiot, Oskar realizes that Eli is a bona fide vampire, and doesn't intend to let that get in the way of their puppy love. Yet when Hakan's errands go horribly awry, Oskar finds himself to be the only person Eli can rely on.<br /><br />It's no great exaggeration to say that "Let the Right One In" is undoubtedly the best vampire movie made in many years. While the movie has plenty of more violent moments and a snowy backdrop, director Tomas Alfredson is far more focused on the sweet, eerie relationship between two lonely, otherworldly young children. And actually, one of them is young in appearance only.<br /><br />Alfredson paints the movie in white, scarlet and black -- pale, wintry light and snow that covers the world, occasional splatters of blood and deep shadows that seem to swallow everything up. And he handles the entire storyline gracefully. Every part of the movie has the same matter-of-fact, unflinching treatment, including the nastier parts -- such as a gruesome blood-harvesting murder by Hakan, or when Eli attempts to enter a house without being invited. Trust me, it's bad.<br /><br />The most loving attention is devoted to the children's friendship, which manages to be as strange and beautiful as a rare dragonfly. Their nighttime meetings almost have the quality of a dream ("I might not be here tomorrow") and Alfredson keeps their blossoming relationship from ever seeming cutesy or contrived. And it has an innocent quality that transcends the sometimes bloody, disturbing storyline.<br /><br />And trust me, "Let the Right One In" has no sentimental ideas about children (even vampiric ones). They can be more violent than anyone, because they are more vulnerable than anyone.<br /><br />The stars of this movie are undeniably Hedebrant and Leandersson, and it's nothing short of amazing that they have never once acted before this movie. Both have the ice-pale faces and deep eyes of otherworldly creatures, making their friendship seem almost inevitable. Leandersson in particular is brilliant at showing the different sides of Eli -- one minute she's shyly asking about a Rubik's cube, the next she's bellowing at her creepy familiar.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is a hauntingly beautiful story of children's friendship and love, wrapped in the most unique vampire stories in many years. A must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008)<br /><br />When trying to convince my sister-in-law and daughter, both thirteen, to watch this fantastic film, at one point I got tired of trying to do so with my usual critical terms and just said, "it's Twilight, but good." Which, of course, scandalized them both, but when it comes right down to it, there are a great number of similarities between the two films' themes, but the execution is almost polar opposite. Film buffs will detect, for example, hints of Kieslowski in Tomas Alfredson's location choices. I defy anyone to say that about Twilight (and be able to back it up).<br /><br />The plot should sound familiar, if you're in America (since it seems everyone in the country has either seen Twilight, read the book, or both): a young human falls in love with a young vampire, who returns that love, but realizes that a true match between them is impossible. Where Stephenie Meyer's sparkly vampires, on the one hand, want to be RomEmo and Juliet, it seems as if John Ajvide Lindqvist (adapting his own novel) simply said "hey, how about we write your basic love story, but give it an undead twist?" Ironically, the one that doesn't try so hard is the one, if either of them does, that will end up the classic. Oh, yeah, and Eli (Lina Leandersson in her first film role)? She don't sparkle. However, similar to Twilight, there's a scene where the human finds out what happens to the vampire during one of those times that are traditionally supposed to be bad for vampires. And, like Twilight, that scene is one of the movie's most memorable. But trust me, there ain't no sparkling.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin saying great things about this movie, so I'll start with the obvious: the two young actors playing Eli, the vampire, and Oskar (K?re Hedebrant), her human friend. I absolutely, positively cannot believe neither of these two has acted in professional movies before this. They are absolutely perfect in every way. Oddly, they remind me of Jude Law and Elina Lowensohn in The Wisdom of Crocodiles, though the roles are reversed (and yes, I do mean to imply there's tension of a romantic nature between them), and despite my love of The Wisdom of Crocodiles, Leandersson and Hedebrant are simply flat-out better in this film.<br /><br />Then there is Tomas Alfredson. Unlike his stars, this is not, by any means, Alfredson's first movie. Before getting showered with awards from around the world for this flick, Alfredson had already won both TV and movie awards, most notably for his 2004 film Four Shades of Brown. This is the kind of guy who would likely, were he in the American system, never even consider making a horror movie. But then, I'm not sure there's anyone like Alfredson in the American system. Who's the last director you can think of in Hollywood who made a TV comedy series, a movie spinoff, gritty dramas, and a horror film staring a couple of preteens? That sort of thing doesn't happen in America. And we are the worse for it. (And when was the last time you saw Kieslowski echoed in a horror film? Look at the building in which they live--if the two movies had been made in the same country, I'd swear it's the exact same apartment block that sits off to the side of the block where all the main characters live in Dekalog. And it's not just the building--it's the lighting as well.)<br /><br />I've already mentioned John Ajvide Lindqvist's script, but I should do so again, because it doesn't matter how good your actors are, you have to give them something to work from. And this script? Genius. It's everything that, I think, Twilight wanted to be and failed, both book and movie, so miserably to be. Everywhere that Twilight is ham-fisted, Let the Right One In is understated. As a result, the relationship between these two characters feels far more real than that between Bella and Edward, for whom the world essentially stops in order for the two of them to emote. The big difference, naturally, is that Twilight is essentially a romance, and is written in the way Americans expect a romance to be written. Let the Right One In, on the other hand, is a drama that contains romantic elements. The love story is less important than the characters who are involved in that love story; Lindqvist's characters are gloriously three-dimensional. Lindqvist took a lot of care to bring his characters to life, and it paid off in spades. Eli and Oskar are two of the most endearing characters in modern film, to the point that when we see Eli doing the things she needs to do to survive, there's no real horror involved; we can sympathize with the vampire during the vampire's least human moments. (There's one scene in particular towards the end of the film where this is particularly powerful, but it would be the mother of all spoilers to tell you what it is. You'll know it when you see it, and like the scene I mentioned before, it's one of the film's best. The sympathy that Lindqvist has taken the time to build is, one hundred percent, the reason this scene works as well as it does.)<br /><br />I could keep going. Once I'd made the Kieslowski connection in my head, I almost dug out my Dekalog review as used it as a template for this one. (This was the result of frustration; I've been trying to write this review for two months, and every time I've tried, it kept turning to mush. What finally made it gel was the other connection, to The Wisdom of Crocodiles. I can't believe it took me two months to see that.) It's one of the handful--at best--of movies I've seen since Dekalog that has had an effect anywhere near as profound. And the list of movies that would qualify contains a number of immortals (most notably Satantango). It's obviously far too early to consider calling Let the Right One In one of the best movies ever made. That hasn't stopped the machine that ranks the IMDB Top 250, where this movie sits at #190 as I write this. Time will tell if it becomes the classic it currently promises to be, but on a more local scale, I can remember few ten-best-of-2008 lists where Let the Right One In did not appear. The reason for this is evident; it is, in every way, a superlative achievement. In the time I've been reviewing movies, which now stretches over two decades, I have given a five-star rating to less than thirty films. This one joins the pack. *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Let the Right One In" is another film I missed during its theatrical run. The Swedish horror film was released in the frenzy around "Twilight", trying to capitalize on the similar themes, but I suspect it got lost. That's a shame because "Right One" is a better film than "Twilight" and one of the better horror films I have seen in many years.<br /><br />I don't go to a lot of 'horror' films anymore because too many (most) are simply excuses to try and gross the audience out. Very few try to create any real horror, any real suspense. The days of "Psycho", "The Haunting" and "Halloween" (the original directed by John Carpenter) are long gone. The best horror films create a mood and place and leave a lot of the horror to your imagination, letting us fill in the gory details. This is much better because our minds know what makes us shiver better than watching images trying to frighten us with blood and guts. Grossed out is not the same as scared.<br /><br />"Let The Right One In" tells the story of a 12-year-old girl, Eli (Lina Leandersonn) and her grandfather who move into a new apartment in a bleak complex in the dead of winter. They don't come out often and the gossips start to cackle. Oskar (Karl Hederbrandt), a little boy with few friends who has to deal with constant bullying at school, lives in the next building over. One night, he sits in the middle of their snow-covered courtyard and they meet. Oskar and Eli, both outcasts, become friends. As their friendship grows, Oskar begins to suspect his new friend may be a vampire, but seems to be more intrigued by that, rather than frightened. Eli's guardian, caretaker, lover? goes out and tries to find fresh blood for her. But he is getting older and starts to make mistakes. After he is no longer able to supply for her, she ventures out on her own, afraid of what she has to do, out of practice. But Oskar has problems of his own and seems to become more and more empowered by his friendship with the strange girl.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" has moments of blood, moments of violence, but these seem designed to punctuate the story, focus our attention, to remind us of the gravity of the situation. A lot of the more horrific moments in the story are hinted at, or occur off-screen, allowing our imagination to fill in the blanks. This is exactly how a horror film should be and what made this little film so memorable.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson weaves the story back and forth between the two children, showing us how their lives are different and, in many ways, similar. Then, when they meet, he adds a third element and gives us moments of their lives together, showing us how each is changing the other. It is a very nice portrait of these two very different kids and how they cope with their individual problems.<br /><br />Apparently, others feel the same way, Hollywood has already purchased the rights to make an American version. I hope they won't, but know they will, make this new version as gory and bloody as most other Hollywood offerings.<br /><br />Catch "Let The Right One In". It is surprisingly good, surprisingly subtle and surprisingly wonderful.<br /><br />It also has one of the most memorable climaxes I have seen in a film in some time. It made me think of what Hitchcock might have done if he were directing the same film.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>What an absolutely beautiful coming of age tale.<br /><br />Let the Right One In offers a splendid contrast of tender emotion and eye-popping violence to the vampire genre.  Fearlessly it tiptoes a provocative line of adolescence and terror while channeling heavy doses of emerging sexuality.  Powerful stuff, this creepy story is bound to suck the marrow from your bones and leave you floating helplessly toward your most devilish nightmare.<br /><br />It's the story of boy meets girl, a girl who harnesses a deep dark secret.  They form a unique bond as they walk a tumultuous journey of acceptance and self-discovery.<br /><br />This movie features an excellent build-up of controlled suspense and visceral fear.  The acting by the young stars is phenomenal, plus the music and special effects are top notch.  I think the most impressive part is the camera work, the visual style is just perfect with the off-center closeups, interesting angles, and some unique shots filmed from a distance.  It really gives a feeling of helplessness at crucial times.<br /><br />There is one particular scene I really hated though.  There's a vicious attack by a group of crazy kitties?!?  These wild furballs start chomping down on a woman who had just recently been bitten by the vampire.  Huh?!?  To me, this incident seemed misplaced, silly, and downright comical.<br /><br />That's the only real misstep in this otherwise immaculate Swedish horror film.  It has plenty of dynamic moments that will leave quite an impression.  Very artistic and unsettling, 4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The vampire genre has been done to death so many times that finding something new and exciting about it often feels like fighting a losing battle.  That's why we should be thankful for Let the Right One In, a Swedish import that puts a thoughtful, haunting, and surprisingly touching stamp on vampire lore.  The film revolves around Oskar (K?re Hedebrant), a twelve year old who is constantly bullied and yearns for revenge against his tormenters.  He comes across a girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who over time he learns to be a vampire, and with whom he finds both love and a method of vengeance.  If it sounds like Twilight to you at all, just ignore that thought.  Let the Right One In can be considered what an adult take on Twilight could be, with brilliant performances, a dark and poetic tone, and an actually thought provoking screenplay.  Tomas Alfredson's direction is hypnotic as well, luring the viewer into this world that also manages to provide a good amount of shocks as well.  Rumor has it that this film is being fast-tracked to be remade for American audiences.  If that is the case (which I certainly hope it isn't) then it is also all the more reason that you should check out Let the Right One In.  It is a brilliant, thought provoking film that soars well above its genre, and it deserves your time and attention.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a modern day classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I was unsure how an unknown Swedish group could do with a BD transfer, and I will admit - I was impressed with everything (almost). From the menu sounds/pic to the amount of audio/sub selections to the DTS. Unfortunately, the extras were mediocre, but the quality of the transfer makes for the only 5-star I have given with a semi-bare BD.<br /><br />The picture was superb throughout, but only if your white balance and related settings are done correctly. The amount of snowscapes and fair skin mingled with blood and darkness makes for a competent test of the display. I had this one playing on a Panasonic 58 and there was a temperant difference in between settings (over-saturation, line blur, etc.).<br /><br />The sound was exquisite. I listened to both the English DTS and the Swedish DTS, and the difference was notable. Mistakenly I had both English subs on with the dub - that was a mess. They should try to hire the same company to do both, it seemed like two different movies so I would recommend to skip the dub version. The outer channels were used extensively, and if anything, turn up the menu (wind, snow, water) to hear some wonderfully subtle decibels. Refresh rate test: the scene where the lights get turned off in the gym.<br /><br />The extras are light, with a seven minute behind the scenes and a pic gallery of our unknown cast. Definitely an owner for the fans of this film, and even with as subtle as the majority of this film is, the channels and display get a fair workout.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>Why would I rent a vampire film?

In a sense , it's the same story as that of "The Makropoulos Affair", the dark disturbing modern opera by Leos Janacek, the tale of an immortal woman who has outlived both love and her endless succession of mortal lovers. The boy will be one, a mortally aging lover. He will become the tormented 'father' seen haplessly tapping the red sap of victims for his still twelve-year-old 'child' in some bleak snowy future. It's the vampirette Eli's tragedy that we are, I think, to feel empathy for; she knows how dire a life poor Oskar will have until she rewards him with the final sacrament of death. Hay, it's not a bed of roses, being an undying vampire ...<br /><br />But does it really "mean" anything? You tell me. If it's just 'entertainment', why all the symbols, all the aura? This is not a 'scary' movie. Not one at which your girlfriend will gasp and snuggle against your shoulder for comfort. It's actually a pretentious art film ... but not uninteresting in its genre. And now I'm tempted to 'waste' another 90 minutes watching the American remake, just for the sake of cultural comparison.<br /><br />****<br />Days later. I did it. I watched the American remake. The comparison of the two is, for me, more interesting than either film by itself. Here's my review of "Let Me IN":<br /><br />And a bloody weird one, too! And an equally weird 'purpose' in my mind in renting it. A few days ago I rented, watched, and reviewed the Swedish film  L?t den R&auml;tte Komma In (Let the Right One Come In). I gave that film a four-star rating; since it is a much better film, I've given this American 'cover' only three stars. But honestly, the ratings are irrelevant. This is not so much a review here and now, but rather a comparison -- thoughtful, I hope -- of the two versions of film-making.<br /><br />In many ways, the American film simply re-shoots the scenes and re-speaks the script of the Swedish film. But the American film is edited differently; it begins in the middle of the Swedish script and then relies on the good ol' Hollywood flashback tricks. One can't demand Originality in a re-make, logically enough, but it seems to me that the American film discarded much of the Originality of the Swedish film in favor of some Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The American film is radically gorier than the Swedish. More shocking visually, and less lyrical. It's unreservedly a "Horror" film, with lots of moments when the squeamish or overwrought viewer will instinctively look away. The American vampire exhibits more physically vampirish abilities and traits -- more explicit supernatural powers. There's a key comparison: explicit versus implicit! Or: blatant versus subtle, if you will.<br /><br />The 12-year-old boys are fundamentally different also. The Swedish boy is appealingly vulnerable and potentially "redeemable" both morally and psychologically. The American boy is a loathesome little peeping-tom degenerate from the start. The viewer will agonize at the Swedish boy's seduction into evil. The same viewer (me, that is) will expect the American boy to succumb all along.<br /><br />Perhaps the most startling difference is in the moral contextualization of the story in the two films. The American film is replete with specifically Christian religious symbols and allusions. The action is set in 1983, for the opportunity that time-frame gives of showing Ronald Reagan addressing the nation, over a TV in the background, on the essentially Christian values of America. When those Christian values are disregarded, Reagan tells us, Evil will reign. The boy's mother, in the American film, is a religious enthusiast; her evangelical 'notions' are a chief cause of her marital collapse, as hinted by the unseen father on the telephone to the boy. There's a prominent picture of Jesus Christ on the wall, in the American film, in one of the nastiest scenes. None of this overt Christian context is present in the Swedish film, where unreleased sexuality is more the catalyst than religious hysteria.<br /><br />So then, is the American film to be understood as an examination of, or assault on, religious frenzy in America? I think it could be taken that way. However, that gets murky very quickly when you remember that a belief in vampires (and other occult phenomena) is profoundly incompatible with Christian theology. A sincere Christian can't possibly accept vampires -- or the emergence of Evil independent of God's Omnipotence -- and therefore the American film explicitly derides Christian certainty as bunk. That's too metaphysically naive and murky for my taste.<br /><br />The Swedish film raises no theological/metaphysical questions. It's completely and coherently a psychological drama, closer in affect to the poetry of Baudelaire than the spooky tales of Stephen King. It's a "art" film, the Swedish one, a portrayal of psychological victimization and obsession, with a tragic ending. As the boy in the American film departs with his vampire friend, one foresees the serial wickedness the pair will accomplish. As the boy in the Swedish film departs, one sees instead the suffering he will experience as the enabler of an eternally deceptive life/blood sucker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>A very unusual vampire movie, from Sweden.  I don't like vampire movies but was told I ought to watch this one at least.  I'm not sorry.<br /><br />My big beef was that while the movie was just fine, the audio/subtitle situation is awful.  The original film is in Swedish.  The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish.  What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner.  Heck, even if you can understand Swedish, you can't get the Swedish audio, which was deleted entirely on the U.S. release.<br /><br />DVD needs to be seriously redone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the year 1982 in a Swedish town, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a lonely bullied 12 year old boy who wants anything for revenge on the local punk kids that harrass him. A young 12 year old girl named Eli (Lina Leanderson) and so called father Haken (Per Ragner) move in next door, it seems he has found an answer to his sollutions. His parents Erik and Vyonne (Henrik Dahl and Karin Bergquist) are having some problems but Oskar seems to be the one with the most problems with some other kids picking on him at school and in town, however murders have been occuring over the last days since Eli and Haken moved next year. Later Eli reveals herself to be some sort of vampire that feeds off the blood at night and has remained 12 for 200 years as Oskar doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />A brilliant work of art! this Swedish import is a gory and romantic horror drama vampire movie that is based on a popular Swedish novel. This is one of those rare vampire movies without the use of fangs or some of the Dracula mentality yet they can still be burnt by the sun and there is gore around here. The love story works here because they are 2 preteens who have little in common yet they find their love to be a little forbidden yet almost in a sexual way, there is even a hint that Eli may or may not be a girl which is subtle but this is one of the most original yet unique works of cinematic art in recent memory. Came out in the year of the vampire 2008 where stuff like Vampire Diaries, Twilight and True Blood came out, this one just picked a right time to come out and is one of the must see movies ever.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives viewers the authentic theatrical feel even with it's sweet surround sound in Swedish with english subtitles and even a very nice English dub track. The extras are few such as deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, and photo & Theatrical poster galleries. A must have for vampire and horror movie fans, but i can't believe an American made remake comes out this year but on the other hand it's produced by Hammmer, so that shouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Fright Night 1 & 2", "The Lost Boys", "Interview with the Vampire", "Vamp", "The Hunger", "Martin", "Dracula (Any version including 1931, 1979, Bram Stoker's and Hammer)", "Nosferatu (1922 and 1979 versions)", "Twilight Saga", "Lifeforce", "Def By Tempation", "Count Yorga", "Thirst (Korean 2008)", "The Vampire Lovers", "Vampire's Kiss", "Salem's Lot (1979 and 2004)", "Nosferatu (1922 and 1979)", "Habit", "Immortality (a.k.a.

I can't think of a better parallel: Each film is as graceful and authoritatively affecting; and just as Beehive faintly honors the grandeur of the story and heartbreak of Frankenstein, so does Let the Right One In tribute the entire lore of vampires and the corresponding stories of its written and spoken history through gentle underscores in the film's own narrative. As you've heard -- and as you will always hear from anyone who's seen it -- Let the Right One In is only a vampire horror picture on the outside; beneath its surface is an intricate, deeply intimate, and ironically life-avowing story of love (not only of the romantic bond between one individual and another, but of a deep passion for the nature of people and things as they relate to the development of the universe). A staggering film. Film grade: 10/10.<br /><br />DVD/Blu-ray: The first (and only, thus far) print of Let the Right One In, from distributor Magnet, is a product that should be avoided indefinitely. In their attempt to make a "more pure" translation of the film's original English subtitles, those at Magnet have doubtless loosened its tension and lessened its overall impact. Magnet has been promising a reprint of the product since April of 2009, though has not made any progress in either detailing its projected release or confirming distribution.<br /><br />Because of Let the Right One In's caliber as a motion picture -- one strong enough to survive a moderate subtitle issue, but one that will increase drastically once the issue has been resolved -- and its ghostly availability in its theatrical form, viewers too eager to see it before its indeterminate re-release won't be completely wasting their money by purchasing this product. But they will certainly need to re-purchase the corrected print if they wish to enjoy the film in its original state.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Oskar is a lonely and disturbed young man, living with an alternately distant and overprotective mother, whose loving but alcoholic father has left them.  He is bullied at school, and Oskar imagines what it would be like to frighten his torturer as he has been frightened.  Then he meets Eli, an apparently odd but pretty young woman who moves next door, who turns out to be something altogether different.  The relationship that develops is both extremely touching and utterly disturbing.  The film touches upon themes that are at the heart of the Showtime series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter</a>, but with a tenderness that reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EY5">My Life as a Dog</a>.  It is a completely unique cinematic experience (a nice alternative to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>), well worth watching, and that must be seen more than once to catch the most intriguing elements.<br /><br />This astonishing film deserves to be seen widely, far beyond the "cult film" and even "arthouse" audiences that have been wowed by it in theaters.  Here's hoping that with a newly subtitled version on dvd and Blu-ray (it is unclear whether the announced update is what you'll get when you buy it through Amazon), this film will find the mainstream audience it deserves.  It is, by far, the most moving scary movie I've ever seen - for its unique combination of innocence and dread, the only precedent I can think of might be the fascinating <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035P5R">The Night of the Hunter</a>.  The atmosphere of the film is perfect, the story is gripping, the acting is brilliant, the cinematography is powerful (capturing the point of view of children, and attending precisely to the details necessary to tell the story without superfluous imagery, lit to just the right levels to create a stark contrast between day and night).  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>This review is for the Blu-Ray watched on a 42" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35 Player. The picture and sound are adequate, with a bit of noise in some scenes, but overall, very sharp and clear. If you're a fan of the film, the purchase is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I am a fan of "different" takes on the same story,and tend to gravitate towards slower-paced,thought provoking films. However, though I thought this film was an interesting departure from the typical vampire flick, I found the film did not provide enough detail for me, and the pace was a bit too slow. The angst of the bullied Oscar, and Eli, who is obviously tortured by her "prison" of needing blood and being isolated are effective in creating a child-based vampire film, but I felt at the end, that it would have been helpful if there was a bit more background in the special features (only contains some posters, a brief commentary).<br /><br />Though I like open ended films, and don't long for a "spoon-fed" story, this one was a bit bare boned for me. The end scene, of Oscar tapping on the box was heart breaking and predicted, perhaps, a lifetime of sadness, longing and an eventual need to turn himself, as he'd become old, and lose Eli eventually. I also liked the fact that there was not a sexual component within the vampir myth, as the main characters are children. It allowed the film maker to create a violent, yet touching journey, withou the complications of sexual undertones, which often dilute the strength and need of real character development.<br /><br />I initially attempted to watch the English dubbed version (I was not sure if the film just starred Swedish actors, who spoke English, or if it was in Swedish-I didn't want to spoil my perception of the film, by reading ANY details). But I decided to watch the film in its native language,with English subs-the dubbing, as in most dubbed films, that I've watched is hideous and comical.<br /><br />I was going to give this a 3/5, as I did not enjoy the lack of detail, and had a few minor issues with the picture and sound. However, for its originality, and courage to tackle the vampire myth through a child's eyes, I decided to give it a 4/5. Definitely worth a look-this is a story of unconditional acceptance, as the sad reality of these two characters is still based on a 12-year old's innocent perception of the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>I have always had a strong fondness for vampire films. Honestly, much of the vampire films these days are full of clich&eacute; and while most of them does attempt at something original, they all have one common denominator; to induce HORROR. Well, Sweden seems to have mastered an original take on the vampire lore and yes, this film has been marked to be "Americanized" very soon. "Let the Right One In" is a film adapted from the novel and written for the screen by John Ajvide Lindqvist with very powerful direction by Thomas Alfredson. Rather than a vampire film geared to induce scares, this film is heavy on mood that will definitely terrify and touch our very hearts.<br /><br />Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a 12-year old boy whose parents are separated, he collects news clippings, and who gets bullied in school by his classmates. He usually wanders his apartment grounds at night while pining for vengeance against his tormentors. One evening, he meets Eli (superbly played by Lina Leanderson), a mysterious young girl of the same age with whom Oskar forms a provisional friendship. The two become quite close, as bizarre murders begin to run rampant in their community. Eli is a girl with powers that Oskar can barely understand, and she sees Oskar as an innocent, kindly soul worth preserving. Oskar sees Eli as his friend and confidant, as he becomes attracted to her. However, Eli has been twelve for quite a long time--she is a vampire. Their world is about to fall apart as things begin to spiral out of control.<br /><br />Ever wonder what would happen if a 12 year old girl is turned into a vampire at such an early age? Being an immortal stuck at this pre-teen age can become quite complicated. Well, this Swedish vampire tale attempts to answer that question. The film is a moody affair and is full of hauntingly effective emotions. The film's main focus is the relationship between Eli and Oskar, and Eli as an immortal with a tortured soul and a conscience. "..Right One" observes the na?ve sensuality between pre-teens and the brutality of having to kill to survive. As an immortal, Eli is longing for companionship, there is a subtle hint that the man who brought her into Oskar's apartment complex isn't exactly her father but that definition isn't really revealed which gives Eli a sense of being an enigma.<br /><br />Eli isn't a villain, but rather also a victim. It was wise for the screenplay to treat her as another casualty rather than the antagonist--her situation itself is the film's "bad guy". "..Right One" is also a thematic affair in regards to isolation, loneliness as reflected by our two leads, and an empty life to live that requires viciousness to survive. The direction has a methodical approach, as it slowly brings Eli and Oskar together, introduces the violence without any elucidation to build on the film's psychological impact. Director Alfredson cleverly plays on how each scene of violence is shown, the violence is brutal but never for a minute do we forget about feeling sympathetic to Eli's situation. He allows the sympathy to steadily build within his audience but never for a minute does he forget to hold the viewer's interest. The way the film is shot is a form of minimalism, it avoids fancy camera shots, it lingers on some scenes to convey its mood and uses a lot of perspective. The film looks gorgeous, and the atmosphere has that darkly foreboding look that exudes sympathy accentuated further by its soundtrack.<br /><br />Of course, the film does have its dose of blood and gore, but it is very calculated. Most of it occur throughout the film as it builds towards its excellent climax. "..Right One" also has the usual rules that apply to vampires; vulnerability to sunlight, dependent on blood for sustenance, the usual powers, and the need to be invited to one's home. (It was quite interesting to see what happens to a vampire when they aren't invited to come in one's home). Eli kills her prey after she gets her fill, she doesn't want to turn anyone and she only kills because she has to. The performances by Lina Leanderson and Kare Hedebrant is just brilliant with their simplicity and the two never for a moment falter in showing their age. Their awkward but endearing relationship is the film's showstopper as it endears, charms, frightens and explores the boundaries of their friendship.<br /><br />Now, don't think that Alfredson and Lindqvist does nothing else with the script. When we aren't watching Eli and Oskar, we become privy to the paranoid community as they talk and gossip about the murders. The film goes into poetic visceral overdrive as a mistake becomes the turning point for our young leads and all hell threatens everything and turns the wheels of destiny.<br /><br />I highly doubt that this film would translate well in becoming "Americanized" in its intended remake, given its very distinct European roots (as with the case with Asian Horror). "Let the Right One In" perfectly balances visceral punch with thrilling emotions that takes its brutality into sincere purity. The film takes some chances and I commend it for asking us to forgive a child and to accept her form of evil--to give her a show of compassion and sympathy. The film is grisly, grotesque, unnervingly beautiful and gentle, and is a welcome installment in vampire lore. It features the concerns of pre-teens mixing it in with waiflike atmosphere. It is one dishearteningly stupendous art house horror film!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

I liked the scene with the crane taking the body ice cube out of the frozen lake.  I liked the acid burns better.

The kids, Oskar and Eli, are perfectly cast and utterly believable. The story has a depth and charm that transcends the genre, making it one of the most emotionally-fulfilling vamp-tales ever made. Don't get me wrong, I love the blood-letting and supernatural exploits too. I simply wasn't expecting to be hit so hard on an emotional level! I actually cared about these characters, wanting for their success. I rooted for them, hoping for the destruction of their enemies. Not since HEAVENLY CREATURES has a movie left such a horribly satisfying mark! Scenes like the Rubick's Cube, the morse code, the hospital visit, and the swimming pool (to name but a few) are scratched deep into my brain, moving effortlessly between touching acts of love and incredible acts of brutality.

The story is based on a novel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312355297">the same name</a> by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also penned the screenplay.  It is about an unpleasant and tender, but relatable twelve year old boy named Oskar.  It deals with his many problems; from his careless and divorced parents who neglect him, to his classmates who mentally and physically abuse him.  Oskar has angry tendencies but you can hardly blame the poor guy.  As the film unfolds Oskar finds some light in the dark cold nights of Stockholm.  He forges a profound bond with a lonely and desheveled girl around the same age as he is.  Her name is Eli and she is a vampire.<br /><br />This is not your normal horror movie fare, nor is it in any way reminiscent of mainstream vampire fiction that I can think of.  It is afterall, first and foremost, a romance story and because of that the moments of horror were only in the back of my mind, and they work far more convincingly than I expected.  Continuity is also rare in horror films and the consistency of the characters and the performances of the actors who played them only worked to enhance the film overall.<br /><br />An aspect of Let the Right One In that seemed exceptional to me can only be explained by mentioning a scene.  As retributive as it may sound, some of Oskar's bullies get their due in brutal yet satisfying fashion.  The scene is incredibly violent and is done underwater, but within the context of Oskar and Eli as characters, and at that point in their relationship, the scene works to be equally as beautiful as it is horrifying.  In the end I pity Oskar, but at the same time I'm not sure he has known any relationship better than one with Eli, and he probably never will.  There is a bittersweet feeling throughout.  I can't think of any film that brings a sense of romance to such extreme horror but this one pulls it off quite nicely and with little direct effort.<br /><br />There has been talk about an Americanized remake of this movie but it will actually be another interpretation of the novel so I expect something dramatically different.  Either way, see this one whether in it's limited release here in the states or when it comes to DVD and Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Let the Right One In left an impression on me that no horror film has since perhaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist</a> and it is probably, along with Hertzog's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YJMX">Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht</a>, the most compelling portrayal of the vampire myth that I've ever seen in film.  This is an amazing movie and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>You can call this a vampire movie. But its not like any other one that you've ever seen. Maybe a coming-of-age story. Or even a "two lonely outsiders find each other" story. It's all of those and more, and it's gonna make my "best of" list for 2008. This is a haunting, beautiful tale of two 12-year-olds - the boy is a loner who gets beaten up regularly by the school bully. The girl is a vampire who moves in next door. The feel of the movie almost reminds me of Sophia Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides', with a beatiful melancholy to it. I don't want to hype it up too much, lest you be disappointed, but put this one at the top of your list.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>I can't stress enough how much of a foreign film this is. American films and therefore American audiences generally expect something with more bang for their buck. Bigger, flashier, faster is normally what we get. And there are films that that philosophy serve well. But films from other countries, especially countries that tend to be a little colder temperature-wise, are much more deliberately paced. The movement in a film like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a little more staccato, like someone moving through snow and ice. Some steps are very slow and methodical, and the next steps may require faster movement in order to stay upright.<br /><br />This is not to say that LET THE RIGHT ONE IN moves in an uneven rhythm; quite the opposite. It's a film that keeps its pace and its tone very consistent. To call this film a "horror" film is akin to calling WALL-E an "animated" film. It's pigeon-holing it and doing it a serious injustice. With all the hyperbole on the case for the DVD for this film, people are going to more than likely be expecting something that moves quickly and has lots of gore and sexuality, as most vampire films do. But that is just not happening in this film.<br /><br />A lot has been said about the story of this film, and I don't have anything to add to that, but as far as my thoughts about this film are concerned, with a few exceptions, I just couldn't recommend a film from 2008 as highly. The two young leads have a chemistry together that puts most adult screen couples to shame. There is never a moment that seems forced, false or out of place. The dialogue, direction, and cinematography are all some of the finest that you'll see in a film all year. It's an extrememly moody film, that has moments of raw emotional brutality and shocking violence, because when it happens, you don't expect it, and that's exactly what makes a film like this work so incredibly well. Violence never should be telegraphed with a film of this kind. It should come as a bolt out of the blue that leaves your jaw hitting the ground, and that's exactly what LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does.<br /><br />And there are moments in the film that you'll never forget.<br /><br />Many fans of the vampire horror genre have been waiting for the definitive vampire film, and this may not have the epic sweep of something like Neil Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE or the hyperkinetic bloodletting of one of the BLADE films or the nostalgia of the DRACULA films, but this is definitely the best "vampire" film that I've ever seen, and ranks amongst the best of 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This is an engrossing, eerie pas de deux between two young people who warm to each other in the silvery cold landscapes of Sweden. My DVD automatically started to roll with English dubbing and no subtitles. The dubbing seemed fairly good, so I just left the DVD at this automatic setting. However I perhaps did get a hint of how any translating subtitles might have been very inadequate, because the title itself, rendered in English as "Let the Right One In," doesn't seem quite right. It has a misleading Spike Lee declarative tone to it. Although it plays off a line ritually used by one of the character, it doesn't fit the sense or mood of the film.<br /><br />However translation failings wouldn't seem to make a lot of difference here, because so much of the film's emotion is carried in the silences between the children. These two leads in the film, supposedly both pre-teens, present an astoundingly different view of youth than the one that most current movies and sitcoms typically present. At last, we have examples of young people who are not sexually precocious, wisecracking, and preoccupied with trivial consumptions. We are presented with a more Victorian view of children - quietly observant, unobtrusively intense, capable of profound attachments.<br /><br />It's true that the capacity for such gravitas might arise from the fact that one or both of these children is perhaps actually decades, or even centuries older than appearances suggest. Through some brilliant photography and make-up work, the viewer can at certain moments peer at these children and find the ancient aspect in them. There's an exquisitely subtle shift from pre-teen to old soul that's simultaneously frightening, thrilling, and yet somehow strangely hopeful - or should I say "sanguine?"<br /><br />This film is at heart a unique love story. The children make a rare connection based on fond fascination and need. Looking down the road at what will become of them though, the viewer is left in a frisson of wonder. Which will prevail in the long run - the love - or the need?</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>From the minute we see a "12" year old girl as a vampire who connects with a 12 yr; old boy (who is starting to get those urges ) and has a kind of romance I knew I was in for something different. This film was GREAT ! I am someone who does not mind watching either the English or original language for most foreign films. I went for English language and really had no problem with it. The story itself tells more than what an actors lines are. Look at the actors faces, look at the scenery. I could watch it with no language and still enjoy it. A nice timid pace where I did not even want the movie to end. This is not your typical guy in a cape with fangs vampire film, this is something quite different. I bought this on a recommendation actually without seeing it the theaters and was supremely surprised of just how good the story and movie were.<br />Not to give too much away but there was some gore but nothing stomach churning (at least to me) and the film touches upon a loner who is being bullied by other kids in school. What this has to do with vampires is something you will have to see for yourself.<br />I did not watch the subtitles as I just went to the English language which I usually do just to see the movie. I do watch foreign films in original language as well...usually the 2nd time around just to see/hear the differences. I am not too terribly picky. Now I did read about the subs for the DVD release being sub-par because Magnolia did not buy the original subtitle translations or something like that..okay, but is that a cause for a one star * rating ? I rate movies on the movies not so much on what a DVD brings. It is good to tell readers what the DVD is but the rating comes off as don't see it and I am here to say that you should see this movie anyway you can. Watch it anyway you like, the DVD to me is worth getting because it is that good. So while there are * star releases for the movie, that is for the DVD release...Im giving this **** stars, because the movie is outstanding irregardless of what the DVD brings to the table.<br />This is a cross between a horror movie and one of those old after school specials that used to air on ABC :)<br />BLOODY GOOD MOVIE !!! :-)</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Tomas Alfredson's directs this film from the novel and screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist's.  The film is in Swedish language with English subtitles.  The leads are a pre-teen boy and girl.  The boy is not a vampire.  He is having a terrible time in school holding his own against bullies. He lives alone with his single mother and doesn't have much of a life other than attending school, which is a nightmare for him.  Suddenly though, help is at hand.  A girl his age moves into his building and he slowly becomes aware that not only is she strange but she is also probably a vampire. Things begin to turn around for him as the vampire comes to his aid with the problems in his life.<br /><br />This film is ambiguous enough that you are not sure if this is a real vampire story or an imaginary vampire story.  Perhaps she exists in his own mind.  How do we know that he is not in his bed dreaming this or that his personality has split and part of it has wandered off? There is a dream like quality to this entire film. The way it moves and looks is very like a dream. This is just a possibility and I think its even being a small possibility adds to the film rather than subtracts from it. There is also the very Jungian notion that we each have an animus and anima part of our personalities (both male and female).  (We saw this notion of animus and anima in the two titular characters of Ingmar Bergmann's FANNY & ALEXANDER.)  So that there are two preteens in a vampire dream like atmosphere may be a dream itself is interesting. Or maybe it is just a boy, whose problems are solved by a vampire coming into his life.<br /><br />It is the style though of this film that catches one's interest.  It is so European and proceeds so unlike an American vampire tale.  I found one viewing of this film engrossing and interesting.  Its visual style is what I admired the most.  The novel has been a huge success but I have not read it so cannot compare it with the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>I didn't like the casting of this film, I didn't like the amateur acting, and the script had too many holes in it.<br /><br />So why have I watched it four times?<br /><br />Yeah, it's one of those films your brain gets locked into.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Oskar is a lonely, bullied 12-year-old boy, waif-thin, who lives with his single mother in a run-down apartment in 1982 Sweden.  One night while playing out in the snow, he encounters his new neighbor, Eli, a pale young girl who lives with a mysterious old man who goes out late at night.  The two kids become fast friends, but little does Oskar know that Eli has been twelve years old for quite some time now...<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is a spectacular horror movie.  It's not your typical Hollywood fair; there's quite a bit of gore, yes, and it's definitely disgusting, but blood is never used gratuitously--it's all to enhance the atmosphere, which is what propels the film forward.  Granted, an emphasis upon atmosphere means a slower plot.  Viewers used to more standard horror movies will become bored; even hardened viewers of atmospheric films might shuffle in their seat on occasion.<br /><br />The wait is well-worth it, however.  "Let the Right One In" isn't scary so much as it is deeply disturbing; it's as much a psychological horror movie, which is usually the best kind of horror.  It seeps under your skin, letting the real horror of this budding friendship sneak up on you, until you suddenly realize: "Holy crap, he's best friends with a blood-thirsty creature!"  The center of the film is the friendship between the two children, a relationship that is as creepy as it is touching.  It won't be long until Hollywood gets its hands on this film and completely ruins it; thus, I highly recommend you see the movie as it is, and be prepared to spend a few hours afterwards wondering if you should be touched or terrified by this compelling, elegant, intelligent horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>What do you get when you cross a vampire story with a tender tale of impossible love?  If you answered "Twilight," then you haven't seen "Let the Right One In," a Swedish horror movie with an art-house sheen.<br /><br />Oskar (the excellent Kare Hedebrant) is the twelve-year-old schoolboy who's the perpetual target of a trio of bullies; Eli (the equally fine Lina Leandersson) is the fetching young vampire who moves into the apartment next door.  Together, these two social outcasts form a powerful emotional bond, with Eli hiding the truth about herself from Oskar till the point where she no longer can.<br /><br />Written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel) and directed by Tomas Alfredson, "Let the Right One In" is less concerned with the blood-and-guts aspects of the scenario than with the pain and remorse each of the main characters experiences throughout the course of the drama.  Though obviously craving a "normal" life, Eli is hopelessly trapped by her own nature, forced to endure a life of loneliness and killing simply to survive in the world.  Oskar is equally alone, though for more prosaic reasons.  In addition to the constant bullying, Oskar is a product of a broken home, and like Eli, he too may finally have to resort to violence to ensure his existence.  Then there's Eli's father who numbly and methodically performs the gruesome bloodletting rituals he knows he must if his daughter is to survive.<br /><br />There's a genuine poignancy in the fact that Eli knows that she can never give herself fully to Oskar for fear of consigning him to the same murderous fate she herself must endure.  A similar sense of twisted pathos pervades Eli's relationship with her father, who carries paternalistic duty to a whole new, genuinely disturbing level.<br /><br />All of this is played out against stark, sparsely-furnished, minimalist settings that provide an appropriately atmospheric backdrop for the story being told.<br /><br />As "art" horror films go, this one is not quite as bone-chilling or as memorable as the truly diabolical "Funny Games," but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A movie where the undead are back to their former role of ghastly bloodsucking creatures (who don't sparkle, but that's another matter), Let the Right One In is passable as a vampire film but really impresses in its nuanced depiction of a friendship between two young outcasts who find solace in each other; be warned that it's often a very graphic film, but it's also often a very good one.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Stiff acting,awful dialogue destroy this DVD.

Eli moves in next door to Oskar in a large, dull, modern apartment complex where Oskar often flees to escape the cruel attentions of several sadistic school bullies. Eli sees his dilemma, and encourages Oskar to fight back, even though he is too puny to defend himself without resorting to violent, Columbine-like tactics. As Eli's vampirism slowly becomes apparent, both to Oskar and to the angry locals, the two twelve-year-olds -- one eternal, the other mortal -- grow closer and more co-dependent. Although the film is notably low-budget (and poorly dubbed, in the American re-release) it succeeds on a deeper psychological level, as viewers are constantly made to doubt Eli's altruism towards the hapless, vulnerable Oskar. Their puppy-love relationship is complicated by the revelation that Eli (pronounced like Ellie, the girl's name) was once male, a twist that is sure to be left out of the currently-scheduled American remake... Although this film is low-rent and a bit awkward, it packs a potent psychic wallop: fans of Anne Rice's "Interview With A Vampire" (the book, not the film) will love this as well.

SPOILERS, please do not read further if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.<br /><br />This movie is HALF-RIGHT because of the reasons listed below.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />- The plot is ORIGINAL. I've never seen a movie where a girl of 12 years old was a vampire. She killed and sucked the blood out of people.<br /><br />- The movie brings up a social dilemma. That is if a child of 12 years committed a murder, should he/she be tried as an adult or a juvenile? What makes some people angry is juvenile punishment is like a slap on the wrist.<br /><br />- The acting of the actress who portrays Eli is fascinating. She makes me keep watching and watching.<br /><br />- There are some very bloody scenes that will keep gore fans happy.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />- The pace is slow compared to Hollywood movies.<br /><br />- The main actor who portrays Oskar does not show emotion on his face.<br /><br />- There's no suspense. Curiosity is what made me watching this till the end, not suspense.<br /><br />- There's one scene which is very disturbing. In my opinion, it borders child pornography. That is the scene where Eli visited Oskar in his apartment. Oskar had her changed in to one of his mother's dresses. Then he accidentally saw her private part. Why did the director have to include that scene? It does not have anything to do with the plot at all.<br /><br />Overall, it's absolutely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>That's an accurate description.

They have been suckered in by so many pretentious 'art' films these days, why can't an ordinary horror film be included in their pantheon? The critics' level of self-deception is so high on this film that there were zero negative reviews, only one mixed and 29 positive reviews on Metacritic (the mixed one was by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly; unfortunately, it's only a capsule blurb).<br /><br />For the majority of internet posters with dissenting opinions, their main objection was that the film was too slow-paced to be worthwhile. There are plenty of films that are slow-paced but they still hit the mark, so to criticize the film merely on the grounds that it's tedious, misses the point as to why 'The Right One' is so reprehensible.<br /><br />It begins in a Stockholm suburb and it looks like this is going to be another tired serial killer retread. The killer (Hakan) has slit the throat of a young man walking in a park, hangs him upside down, dangling from a tree, and then attempts to collect the blood into a gasoline can as it drips from the victim's neck. Soon, however, we learn that Hakan is actually a vampire (or rather an assistant to a vampire who appears to be 12 years old). The 12 year old 'female', named Eli, actually has been alive since the middle ages (the book that the film is based on includes more graphic details on Eli's origins--that she, rather he, was castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman).<br /><br />Some critics (such as Roger Ebert) became enamored with the relationship angle between Oskar, the lonely 12 year old protagonist, and his new found vampire friend. Oskar already has a fascination with crime to begin with, cutting out articles from the local newspapers detailing sordid murders occurring in nearby localities. While Oskar seems to have a nose for crime, the local police in 'Let the Right One In" seem to be oddly absent during the investigation into the killings initiated by Hakan and his juvenile master, Eli.<br /><br />One wonders why Eli suddenly takes a liking to little Oskar since she has no guilt feelings about draining the blood out of various other upstanding members of the community. Since those community members all seem to depicted as a bunch of louts or buffoons, I guess it's okay that Hakan and Eli can do whatever they want to them with impunity. Eli further displays her 'sensitive side' when she advises Oskar to strike back at the local bullies who have been harassing him.<br /><br />There are very few films that will feature a murderous monster who is depicted as not being so bad after all. Somehow it doesn't bother Oskar that his gal pal goes around dispatching whoever she feels like it. Not only is Oskar's acquiescence condoned, but the film's scenarists have no guilt feelings about promoting the idea that it's good for a 12 year old to take the law into his own hands. Even worse is the idea that it's okay for a boy who's been bullied, to take revenge, acting just as sadistically as his tormentors did toward him (Recall how Oskar takes delight in whipping the school bully across the face with a pole).<br /><br />I suppose the reason why Eli is supposed to get a free pass here is because somehow she can't help herself (after all, she got bitten back in the Middle Ages). The moral of the story is that you can commit all the horrific murders you want but as long as you counsel a 12 year old boy as to the proper etiquette in dealing with a group of stick figure, cardboard cut out bullies, then you can continue traipsing around Scandinavia, committing additional atrocious crimes.<br /><br />As for those of you still looking for true scenes of horror, 'The Right One' offers only slim pickings. In addition to the aforementioned opening scene where Hakan does his blood draining bit, you also get (hold on to your seats!): Eli (channeling Spiderman) scurrying up the side of a hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.<br /><br />Nothing really makes sense in 'Let the Right Thing In' including the blood sucking vampires and morally challenged 12 year olds. One can't really blame John Lindqvist, author of the book the film was based on, as well as its screenwriter, for the ultimate successful promotion of this claptrap. That honor goes to the film critics, always seeking their next great 'work of art' along with the teenage audience that went to the movie theaters in droves and (unfortunately) bought all those tickets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.<br /><br />I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.<br /><br />This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle.<br /><br />Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.<br />Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case.<br /><br />I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.<br /><br />Update: Apparently, in the US version of the dvd, the subtitles get dumbed down big time. I just read this article and while I am not buying this dvd, I think it's important to get this info out for those interested:<br /><br />http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.html</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The more I mull over this fascinating film the more I'm convinced that all the hype and praise it received (being toted as the best vampire movie ever) is accurate.  I mean, I am not a vampire aficionado by any means, but I have seen a few of the more well regarded vampire films and this one blows them all away for me.  There is just such raw and sinister relevance to this poignant story that I can't help but hold it in high esteem.<br /><br />I really, really need to read this novel!<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young boy named Oskar who meets a young vampire named Eli.  Oskar isn't aware right off that Eli is a vampire, but they bond due to a mutual feeling of exclusion.  Eli, being a vampire, is reclusive almost impulsively and has no real companions outside of a man named Hakan who takes care of her by killing men and bringing her blood.  Oskar is a small and wimpy young boy who is constantly picked on and finds himself internalizing his rage in wild fantasies of killing the boy who is harassing him.  That is how Eli and Oskar meet.  One night while acting out his frustrations on a defenseless tree, Oskar is approached by Eli and they soon strike up an unlikely friendship.  This relationship takes them through mutual hardships and helps the other to grow in areas they are struggling.<br /><br />This is very much a love story that is far less about love and more about affection.<br /><br />When one dissects the core of this film they find so much more than they bargained for, or than they initial thought they'd discover.  This is far more than just a monster movie, this is a beautiful depiction of adolescent angst and the need to find someone to share in and thus alleviate your pain.  There is also a lot here that is so subtle and merely hinted at.  I have read on some of the novel's broader scope and I love they way that this film insinuates a lot while leaving the majority of the back-story to your imagination.  Eli is a mysterious character, but there are plenty of hints to her story dropped for us to nibble on.  These tidbits add to the layers of pain in her eyes and the emotional depth we see in her undead soul.<br /><br />"If I wasn't a girl...would you like me anyway?"<br /><br />The subject of revenge and childhood alienation and subsequent domination is given proper and enlightening treatment as we consider Oskar's situation as well as the similar yet contrasted state that Eli finds herself.  Eli is very much like Oskar, yet she is a matured variation of him (beings that she is 200+ years old) and yet she maintains the same need for vengeance that he feels at his young age.  This detail tragically shows that pain etched on the skin of the young very rarely fades with time.  Oskar's undeniable desire to be older himself (he knows his age to the day, which is a tell tale sign of someone counting the days until something better) is also a tragic detail, showing the loss of youth in today's society.  With all the pain and all the heartache, our young ones are chucking away what should be crucial years of their development for adulthood.<br /><br />The title of the film alone (English translation being `Let the Right One In') is a testament to the level of emotional relevance this film carries.  The title refers to the emotional bond between Eli and Oskar, a statement referring to letting one in emotionally.  Throughout the film Eli makes it known that she must be invited inside, and this is metaphoric for the need she has to belong and or be wanted.  The same is true for Oskar, and once Eli begins to share her truth with Oskar it becomes apparent that she has `let him in' just as he has `let her in'.<br /><br />Carrying the film's heavy themes, young Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both making acting debuts here) are astonishingly effective.  It doesn't hurt that director Tomas Alfredson baths them in a sea of rich metaphoric light.  Alfredson allows his actors to become one with the imagery, creating a beautifully complete film.  The attention to detail is simply breathtaking.  From the score to the cinematography to the script to the acting, everything is a perfect compliment of the other.<br /><br />This film is truly haunting, but not in that generic horror way.  `Lat den Ratte Komma In' is far from generic.  It is intoxicatingly real, a film that shies away from the clich&eacute;s presented in this overdone genre (the characters are real and gritty as apposed to sexed up and artificial), giving us something with a purity rarely seen in a film containing this much bloodshed.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In is a 2008 vampire movie from Sweden that received overwhelming acclaim from those who saw it. An American-ized remake is due out in 2010, probably due to the vampire-frenzy created by the awful Twilight Saga. The movie-world has been overpopulated with vampire movies lately, but this film serves as that little glimmer at the end of the tunnel; a film that uses the vampire mythology to tell it's story, without ruining the mythology. It's a film that tells a story quite similar to the one told in Twilight, except it's more poignant, more violent, and much more original.<br /><br />K?re Hedebrant plays Oskar, a 12-year-old boy with no friends; he's a strange kid, seen playing with knives and acting out violent situations, probably directed at the bullies he's frequently tormented by at school. Outside of his apartment building, Oskar meets a strange, 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) who has recently moved into the building with an even stranger man (Per Ragnar). It's no spoiler to tell you that Eli is a vampire.<br /><br />This is not a "vampire" film in the traditional sense of the word, however. The film is much more interested in the relationship between Eli and Oskar, who begin to bond in a strange, initially disconnected way. It uses the idea that Eli is a vampire and Oskar is a human in the same way Twilight did, but the two characters are both 12-years-old. That's where Let the Right One In really succeeds. In this relationship, there's actually a poignant representation of a relationship between two pre-pubescent children, vampire aspects notwithstanding. Both are (technically) at an age where they haven't quite reached a level of sexual understanding, but there is a certain understanding of some sort. Their relationship is much more touching and poignant that the silly Twilight drivel.<br /><br />Both Hedebrant and Leandersson handle this material exceptionally well and, being the stars of the film, they're required to carry it...They do so quite admirably, especially when one takes into consideration that they're the same age as their characters.<br /><br />Looking beyond that, the story is just very well told if you have a little bit of patience. The story drew me in, although don't expect all your questions to be answered right away or, in some cases, at all. Despite the relationship angle, it's still very much a horror film that exercises much restraint on blood, gore, and special effects. There's a particularly chilling use of makeup in one scene, but other than a severed limb and some blood here-and-there it relies more on atmosphere (particularly it's gray, somber setting), poetic cinematography, and a haunting musical score.<br /><br />It's an eerie, effective film that is simultaneously haunting, violent, and beautiful. There are those who will find it slow and uninteresting, but it's really a quality piece of horror cinema. Anyone who has grown tired of the tired, clich&eacute;d "vampire-romance" movie will find this to be a welcoming breath of fresh air...It's an outstanding film, that truly deserves to be called "a work of art."<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>a touching, whimsical tale of love at first sight. poor isolated oscar is a well meaning good kid who just doesnt seem to have friends. he is the perfect patsy for bullies everywhere. since this isnt an american movie, the bullies are not that cruel. shoving, name calling and ear plucking is the norm. try as they may, oscars tormentors cant seem to break his good natured spirit.<br /><br />but what do you know, ocsar has a new neightbor. eli and her uncle/chaperone move into his apartment building in the ''dead'' of night. right off the bat they seem to be made for each other. shes new and hes lonely. their meeting is so sweet and innocent you almost forget people are going to die. i mean, eli IS vampire so......<br /><br />im not going to say much on the killing part except to say its done tastefully and is far from gratuitous. the gore makes sense and is done well. some may hate subtitles. they fixed that here with american voice-overs (im not a fan of that, it tends to feel artificial. ill gladly read along).<br /><br />my gripe is this is so good, hollywood will probably redo it and [...] it up. or even worse; the director wanting to cash in and do an american version ala ''funny games''. what an utterly complete waste of time that crap was. anyway, this is a fantastic little movie with no explosions, trendy soundtrack or an all star cast. for those making movies on a shoe string budget, this is an example of how its done.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In, or L?t den r&auml;tte komma in, is a film directed by Tomas Alfredson (Four Shades of Brown).  The story is based on a novel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312355297">the same name</a> by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also penned the screenplay.  It is about an unpleasant and tender, but relatable twelve year old boy named Oskar.  It deals with his many problems; from his careless and divorced parents who neglect him, to his classmates who mentally and physically abuse him.  Oskar has angry tendencies but you can hardly blame the poor guy.  As the film unfolds Oskar finds some light in the dark cold nights of Stockholm.  He forges a profound bond with a lonely and desheveled girl around the same age as he is.  Her name is Eli and she is a vampire.<br /><br />This is not your normal horror movie fare, nor is it in any way reminiscent of mainstream vampire fiction that I can think of.  It is afterall, first and foremost, a romance story and because of that the moments of horror were only in the back of my mind, and they work far more convincingly than I expected.  Continuity is also rare in horror films and the consistency of the characters and the performances of the actors who played them only worked to enhance the film overall.<br /><br />An aspect of Let the Right One In that seemed exceptional to me can only be explained by mentioning a scene.  As retributive as it may sound, some of Oskar's bullies get their due in brutal yet satisfying fashion.  The scene is incredibly violent and is done underwater, but within the context of Oskar and Eli as characters, and at that point in their relationship, the scene works to be equally as beautiful as it is horrifying.  In the end I pity Oskar, but at the same time I'm not sure he has known any relationship better than one with Eli, and he probably never will.  There is a bittersweet feeling throughout.  I can't think of any film that brings a sense of romance to such extreme horror but this one pulls it off quite nicely and with little direct effort.<br /><br />There has been talk about an Americanized remake of this movie, but it will actually be another interpretation of the novel, so I expect something dramatically different.  Either way, see this one, whether in its limited release here in the states or when it comes to DVD and Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Let the Right One In left an impression on me that no horror film has since perhaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist</a> and it is probably, along with Hertzog's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YJMX">Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht</a>, the most compelling portrayal of the vampire myth that I've ever seen in film.  This is an amazing movie and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>In support of what others have written already, "LTROI" succeeds wonderfully as a romantic horror film, but this DVD release version suffers from a sub-par subtitle track.  The English dubbed track isn't that great either, but it soars in comparison to the amateurish and overly-simplistic English subtitles.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that foreign films are best watched (and listened to) in their native languages.  Sometimes the dubbed-voice acting just doesn't measure up.  But until they re-release this DVD with a proper set of English subtitles, the dubbed audio track may be the best viewing and listening option.  Such a shame to give such horrible treatment to such a terrific movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Let the Right One In is about a 12 yr old boy named Oskar who's tormented by bullies at school. A new girl moves in to his apartment building and appears to be the same age as him. They become friends and she gives him the courage to stand up to the bullies. He starts to fall for her and wants to go steady with her but he doesn't know that she's actually a vampire.<br /><br />  The movie is dark and twisted, yet their relationship is kind of sweet. Despite the film being creepy and haunting, it also manages to be likable due to the 2 young leads. The only thing that skeeved me out though, is that they didn't have to show the girl's private area in one scene. It may have just been a glimpse but it was still wrong. You know an American film wouldn't have gotten away with that.<br /><br />  Despite that though I would still recommend it to those who wish Twilight was less romantic, mushy and whimsical. Let the Right One In is kind of romantic but unlike Twilight, you get a good dose of old fashion horror. The direction has an old school feel to it and the film even has the look of a movie from the late 70's or early 80's.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Oskar is ignored at home and bullied at school, but he soon finds a friend in his new neighbor next door. Eli is strange and distant at first, but as the two grow closer, she reveals that she is a young vampiress who must consume blood to survive. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is Tomas Alfredson's beautiful and captivating adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's best-selling novel. It incorporates the coming of age theme with a budding romance, while molding the classic vampire mythos into something wholly original. Alfredson's restrained shooting style is subtle but extremely effective. By paring down the color palette to a collection of cool blues and grays, he not only emphasized the frigid surroundings, but also Eli and Oskar's icy dispositions leading up to their friendship. He then contrasts the bleak coloring with saturated reds as a form of foreshadowing. Rather than simply relying on computerized imaging to display her powers, Eli's supernatural abilities are implied just off screen in a number of cleverly crafted shots. A review of the film would mean nothing without mentioning the moving performances by Lina Leandersson and K?re Hedebrant as the two young leads. Because the majority of the picture is spent following their growing relationship, the more horrific moments become that much more shocking and unexpected. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN defies each of the recent trends in Horror by focusing on its compelling characters and touching love story over excessive amounts of gore and violence.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Oscar is one of those kids that constantly finds himself picked on. In his freetime he dreams of serial killing, even keeping an album on the deeds of other men. He also has a knife and imagines himself killing over and over again, and this little deed attracts the attnetion of Eli. Eli first approaches Oscar on a playground outside of his apartment as he works on a Rubic Cube, and the two quickly strike up conversation. for all intents and purposes, it is an innocent affair between two 12 year olds. The only problem is that Eli has a friend she lives with and that friend hangs people from trees and drains them of blood. Worse still, Eli drinks blood to survive and has a need to feed - even if that means picking off people in the most unlikely of positions.<br /><br />Before I begin, I have to note that this is not the book Let Me In. If you watch closely you can see a lot of the pieces here, but you lose a lot as well. You lose Oscar's problems, Eli's ways, and you lose her "roommates" deal. you also lose eli's past, something that is hinted to, and a lot of other things. Still, that doesn't mean that much. Personally, i like the two of them and I keep them as different things in my mind. I do not like to mix the two, either, because the picture of eli in them movie is one I love. I like the way the two kids get along ore than anything, and I like the way things go. True, I would have liked the things that Eli can do with her hands and feet, but I am willing to give that up for the greater good of the movie. Besides, putting that stuff in would have certainly made this movie something that a lot of people would have protested.<br /><br />When you wathc this, everything from the acting to the way things go are beautiful. You have no idea how old Eli is here, but you get ideas of some things aobut here. She has a thing for puzzles, and one of the things she has is valuable enough to "buy a nuclear power plant" if sold. You also see the pain that Eli feels and the way that she seems to want to be loved. I have a thing with Oscar, not the actor but the kid in the movie, and I really am not a fan. I know hes a 12 year old, but he does things that are cruel. The thing with not inviting Eli in is hard to watch because shesimply wants someone to care, and other things hapen as well. Still, it is tender in a lot of places and, honestly, it touches me and creeps me out as well.<br /><br />This movie has some stuff in it that is kiddy. you might keep that in mind when wathcing it. You might also keep in mind that it is not the book so, for those who didn't like the reading, you have something different.As I said before, this is NOT the bok and sometimes reading it may even hurt what you have seen. You get background and some stuff you may want to know, but knowing them hurts the relationship. honestly, stick with the 5 star movie unless you simply have to have it all. this is a great feature and you can love it forever.</p></br></body></html>

But I watched it again today for the first time in ages, and it reminded me how great this is and how much of a classic it is.  You have to see this.  I can't imagine anyone that wouldn't love it.  It's a classic from a classic director.  Quentins mind is warped in a great way and only he could pull this off.  It's funny and so well written.  You have to see this.  It's one of the best movies ever made.  John Travolta et al are amazing.  They did such a good job on this.  GO AND SEE IT.  You'll love it.  It's 2 hours and 30 minutes of excellence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13.html">A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13</a><br/><p>I Can't explain how much do I love this Movie,especialy this Limited Edition Collector's Set, MR Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />is a legend :)</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino worked in a video rental shop before he started directing. Now, he makes movies that challenges the norm in Hollywood and hangs out with fellow "kick-a$$" director Robert Rodriguez. And of all his movies, I like Pulp Fiction the best. Yeah, his other work were also cool/stylistic/bad-a$$ (pick a word, they're all suitable) but this movie really blew me away with its unique storytelling, superb performances and witty dialogue.<br /><br />It's hard to explain the story, because it moves in and out of specific events, each interweaving with the next, either before or after the previous event. Confused? Watch it and you'll understand. But ultimately, it is a story about situations with various people, each interesting as hell. We have two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the mob boss, his wife, two petty robbers and let's see...yeah, a guy who smart talks his way to cleaning messes (e.g. dead bodies). It may sound unusual but it all adds up to make a surprisingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />As I said, there are many things I loved about this movie, but something that really stands out is the screenplay. At the time, it was considered to be new and refreshing, and I can see why. Watching the movie more than 10 times, I realize something...this movie is not important, it probably does not depict real life and it's even incredibly crazy at times. It is also never going to affect me in any way. Well, what makes it special? I would call this cinematic escapism at it's finest. Many times, we find that the characters talk about totally different things than what we expect. But instead of sounding lame, Tarantino has a gift of knowing how far he should take it, and it ends up sounding cool and extremely unique. Tell me, how many people can pull of talking about burgers in Amsterdam sound cool and intelligent...and as insane as that sounds, Tarantino does it. The thing you notice immediately is the passion involved in the movie. You know you're getting whatever the f*ck Tarantino wishes to put into it, without pesky studio bosses, or marketing executives telling him otherwise. It's a huge gamble, but it works.<br /><br />A good script is integral, but what really sells the movie is the actors...and the fact that Tarantino got a whole bunch of talented people to appear in Pulp Fiction, speaks for itself. John Travolta delivers one of his best performances, launching back his career to an all-time high. Samuel L. Jackson is also superb in his role. The rest of the cast; Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel...all give very convincing performances that the movie comes alive and I guess making it so much more than what it set out to be.<br /><br />Finally, if you look at Top 100 Lists anywhere, on the net, in cinema books...you are bound to find this movie somewhere there, and believe me... it very well deserves to be. Considered historic in American cinema, I for one, recommend it wholeheartedly.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>This is truly a movie I should not like. It's profane, gory and violent. So why do I watch it again and again?<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino has assembled the coolest cast (Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and more) in the weirdest and least likely comic vehicle ever produced. The film follows a cast of hoodlums, hit men and drug queens as they interact in the mean streets of Los Angeles. The film plays with time, jumbling time sequences so that "dead" characters come back to life. Hilarity ensues from the bumbling actions of Scripture-spouting hit men, heroin-addled heroines and various pimped-up freaks and tough guys. There is genuine camaraderie, honor and restraint between the most death-dealing of characters, which makes them sympathetic and gives the film its bizarre charm.<br /><br />Comedy aside, this movie is not for the faint of heart. There's plenty of gore, lots of gunplay, profanity by the bucketful and heart-stopping drug scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>"It's movies like Pulp Fiction that glorifies sensless violence and portrays it as something funny.  I'll never be part of something like that." -Natalie Portman<br /><br />The above quote is typical for people that don't like this movie.  They can never just not like it....they always have to start some crusade against it.  Oh, go away.  If you don't get it then watch something else.  If you don't like it than say so and move on.  I, personally despised the movie, Van Helsing.  I hated it with ever fiber of my being.  But I'll leave it at that.  I won't talk about how it signifies 'the downfall of moral society'.  Let's move on.<br /><br />If you've never seen this then you most likely have heard alot about it.  You know it re-launched Travolta's career.  You know it contains a mysterious suitcase.  And you might even know that the story consists of 'chapters' that jump around out of sequence.  What you might not know is that the each and every scene is a little movie in of itself.  A little masterpiece.  The car ride in the beginning, the walk to the apartment door, the conversation with Brett, any scene where there are people sitting down eating, Marcellus Wallace's talk with Butch, Christopher Walken's talk with Butch, the cab ride with Esmerelda, and so on, and so on.  The movie's full of them, and each one of these scenes is it's own little masterpiece that can exist outside the movie.  They are, in fact, their own short films inside a bigger film.  And THAT'S why this movie is so great.  That's what keeps people so entranced at the stroytelling.<br /><br />During a New York premier of Pulp Fiction, a woman went into cardiac arrest after the 'adrenaline injection' scene.  The woman recovered and was fine but in an interview when Tarentino was asked to comment on the incident....he said, "Whoa....keeping an audience interested is one thing.....but stopping someone's heart?  That's good f****ng movie-making!"</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>This film is all about dialogue, I know what your saying, Check out the big brain on Mike, I'm a smart mother father.  This movie had me wanting to walk the earth, you know, walk the earth, meet people... get into adventures. Like Caine from "Kung Fu", just so i could get into conversations and practice dialogue such as this.<br />Of course, not all conversations are gonna go smoothly like in Pulp Fiction  and there are going to be ignorant people who get angry and are ready to blow, to them i say.  "Oh! Oh! You ready to blow?"  Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherflower, motherflower! , I'm Superfly T.N.T., I'm the Guns of the Navarone!<br />You probably came into this review thinking here comes another plot synopsis, usually, most readers would be happy with some freeze-dried reviewers choice, but Mike springs this serious GOURMET shiznit on us!<br />A lot of movies try to be clever but aren't in the same ballpark as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same F'in sport.<br />So finally in closing I'd like to exuberantly add, mmmmmm this is a tasty movie, if it's ever on television check it out sometime.  Actually if you haven't seen it yet, I don't wanna hear about no mf ing ifs. All I wanna hear from your anus is, You ain't got no problems, Mike. I'm on the mother-father. Go back online, order Pulp Fiction, and wait for the dvd, which should be coming directly.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>A decade after Quentin Tarantino produced two absolute classics in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, many of us are still waiting for him to redisplay the enormous virtuosity evidence in both of these films. Although not a bad film, FOXY BROWN was a bit of a disappointment, and we will have to wait and see what happens with KILL BILL and INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, the former finished and scheduled for a fall 2003 release, the latter scheduled to begin shooting in late 2003. For me, PULP FICTION was as original and as exciting as any film I had seen in ages when it came out in 1994, and I was looking forward to a worthy successor to it. I am still looking forward to it.  (Note:  in late 1994 I was even asked by a WGN Chicago film crew--which was polling Chicagoans leaving the theater--my favorite film of the year, and I replied instantly:  PULP FICTION.)<p>This disappointment aside, PULP FICTION was one of the most incredible film experiences of my life. Retaining much of the edge and incredible dialog that was found in both RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE ROMANCE, for which Tarantino wrote the script, but injecting precisely the right blend of Americana and popular culture, the film blew me out of my seat. Immediately after seeing it, I saw it again, and then again. The film had style and swagger to burn, humor to soften the violence and give it a surreal turn, and simple the greatest talk I had ever heard in the movies. All the characters in the film love to talk, and many are brilliant at it. <p>PULP FICTION is filled with more great moments than are usually found in three or four good films added together. Many of the segments are more or less self-contained, and would be classics on their own, but added to the others produce something even greater than the sum of its parts. You get the extraordinary hit that Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make at the beginning of the film. The surreal trip to the nostalgia diner and twist contest with Travolta and Uma Thurman. The unbelievable sequence with Bruce Willis and the "Gimp." Christopher Walken's tale about the watch and its presentation to the young Bruce Willis character. And this listing doesn't come close to naming all the best moments in the film, and leaves out perhaps the best of the bunch, Samuel L. Jackson's extraordinary scene to end the film. <p>What a cast! There are a host of great performances, although I have to express some perplexity as to why Travolta received the nomination for Best Actor and not Samuel L. Jackson. While Travolta has one more scene than Jackson, in all the scenes where the two are together, Jackson absolutely and utterly dominates the action. We don't listen to Travolta; we listen to Jackson. If you removed Travolta from those scenes, nothing would be lost. Remove Jackson, and you wouldn't have anything remotely resembling the same scene. Still, Travolta is good, if not as dominating as Jackson. So many performers excel: Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, the stunning Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Christopher Walken. And to this day it remains the best thing that Bruce Willis has ever done.<p>Special mention must also be made of the superb soundtrack. I'm not sure that a soundtrack has ever been used to greater effect than in this one, from edgy rawness of Dick Dale's "Misirlou" (helping to reacquaint many with the man who truly is the King of the Surf Guitar) to Dusty Springfield's "Son of a Preacher Man" to Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" to Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" the music doesn't merely adorn the film but establishes the proper mood and carries the story forward.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino cops a little from about a million different sources, mixes in some clever (and occasionally overwritten) dialogue, about a billion ..., some standout performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (one super-bad cat!), Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, and comes up with one of the freshest, most influential films in recent years.<br /><p>Travolta and Jackson play two dangerous men in black, paid killers for local kingpin Marcellus Wallace (a glowering, muttering-in-basso Ving Rhames) and they provide the film's central narrative thread.  This bantering pair weaves its way from an early morning hit that ends with a very freakish occurence to a grisly accident to a date with Wallace's lovely wife Mia (Thurman).  Told in a non-linear fashion, the story also manages to incorporate Willis as a pug fighter Wallace has ordered to take a dive (and who has other plans), a death-obsessed cabbie, a pie-loving potbelly-desiring cutie, sexual deviants, and a dance contest at a kitschy 50's-style restaurant.  And then there's the briefcase...<br /><p>Weirdly enough, the film amounts to a kind of hipster/mob sitcom.  Characters get themselves into outlandish situations, and a lot of the film's humor derives from their frantic dialogue as they attempt to extricate themselves.  It's full of quotable quotes, most of which I can't list here, and memorable bits by Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf, a guy who fixes problems.<br /><p>What's in the case?  It doesn't matter.  What matters is, like that fabled macguffin's mysterious contents, this film dazzles.  It even created a genre, and helped spawn an indie film renaissance of sorts.  Of course, we're probably all a bit weary of smart-alecs with guns popping off rounds and dialogue referencing 70s tv.  And don't worry:  "Pulp Fiction" is not nearly as violent as its reputation; for the most part, Tarantino actually cuts away from the gore and leaves a lot to the viewer's imaginations.  That in itself can be a bit off-putting for some.  For others, bite into this slab of cinema that's as meaty and tasty as a Big Kahuna burger.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>I just watched this movie for the first time since it opened (1994). Time has not diminished it's impact. All the acting is BRILLIANT, but, I think, especially JOHN TRAVOLTA (he excels in everything he does) and SAMUEL L JACKSON (always stellar). Add Chistopher Walken and HARVEY KEITAL--Geez, it doesn't get any better. I must, also, mention Uma Thurmon. Maybe, her best performance ever. Plus Bruce Willis (very good), Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer and more. WHAT A GREAT CAST!!<br />Hats off to Quentin Tarentino, who both wrote (not everyone will appreciate the subject matter) and directed this film. He also appears in this too. The time lines and structure of this movie are genius, but this style is truly the mark of Tarentino's work.<br />What's it about? Mostly it's just a day in the life. Of who? A couple hit men, a boxer, a gangster, some wanna' be's, a drug dealer, low rent robbers, perverts and whoever crosses the path of the afore mentioned. It's grisly and there's humor. Plus, the sound tract is great.<br />I have the two disk set, and there are all kinds of good stuff on it--great special features. TAKE NOTE--NOT FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY NOT FOR KIDS, (ie graphic violence, sex, perversion, Drugs, offensive(?) language--you name it. It's a great movie. Quentin Tarentino has one totally,amazing BRAIN.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>I'd only seen Pulp Fiction on television, and apparently every version I have seen was heavily edited.  I never knew about the Gimp!  Though I always loved the movie, this version brought to life the full effect of the film.  Great quality.  You may not know what you've been missing until you view this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />The first time I saw this I was like, 12 years old, and it was on VHS. It looked cool at the time, but my teenage brain couldn't handle anything past the loud voices and constant cussing, but kudos for style points. The second time I saw it (maybe another 12 years after the first) I believe it was supposed to be a DVD rip, but the sound encoding was atrocious, so I only enjoyed it in part. The the third time I saw it (about 3 months ago) was off of Netflix streaming with decent enough audio, but not so great video. Ironically enough, the one time I finally get to see and hear the darn thing with quality A/V is on Blu-ray. That being said, it should go without question by user vote on IMDb, critic appraisal, or any number of awards and accolades given to this film that Pulp Fiction has cemented itself as a true game-changer in the halls of cinema legend. Be it the achronological storytelling, the sassy script, the dark humor, the quirky characters, or just the amazing level of star power involved from every which way, there's a lot to like about this film. For me, personally, it's the method. I don't mean the cut-up timeline (which is enjoyable in itself and keeps you on your toes), but how so much of the dialogue is "just there" from a purely jovial or character-developing perspective. Talks of Amsterdam and their legalization of drugs, the differences between European and American culture, the frivolous comparison between a foot massage and going down on a girl, the significantly comedic monologue of a P.O.W. storing his best friend's watch up his anus for years only to deliver it to his son, and all kinds of other seemingly random stuff "capped off" by a stride at redemption would make you think otherwise about this being nominated for seven Oscars, right? Well, as most people often say about Quentin Tarantino films, "you should just see it for yourself to know what I mean." And the result after almost 20 years? It's a part of our modern day pop culture with all kinds of quotable lines, a beacon of entertainment and inspiration within the industry,and, for all intents and purposes, one really fun movie to watch. Is it for everyone? Of course not. But most would say it is.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The front and back of the slipcover and the back of the cover art says that this transfer was supervised by Quentin Tarantino himself and even has a copy of his signature on the slip, so what you see here was what the director intended. And I have to say, after 3 very poor video outings (VHS, a crappy DVD rip, and Netflix streaming), I have to say I've never seen the movie look this good (literally). The production budget was only $8 million, which by today's standards would still only be about $12 million. But wow, am I glad Tarantino used some quality film stock. First and foremost, I have to commend the black levels. All the tiny little details, linings, reflections, and textures look absolutely pristine on this presentation. Particularly, the wetness of Jules' Jheri curl, as laughable as the look is intended to be, adds a nice aesthetic sense of throwback to the Blaxploitation genre that Mr. Jackson's character is portraying. And then you have the hallmark scene where Vincent is taking Mia to Jack Rabbit Slim's, which is FULL of dark lighting, and yet still manages to display an amazing amount of detail around the restaurant itself, its patrons, on Thurman's hair, and in Travolta's suit in addition to the smoke he's blowing. Colors, while somewhat muted from an art direction standpoint, are surprisingly bold. The scene where Butch is taking money from Marsellus in the bar is full of red light, but in comparison to other brightly red-lit backdrops (which isn't many), I'm pleased at how a lot of the detail still remained intact. Then, of course, is the blood. Maybe it was more so the stuff they used to be the blood, but when it splatters, it looks great. Not real per se, but it's one of those artistic subtleties that Tarantino does well in his films. I am also happy to report that there is very little, if any, hints of dirt or artifacting. There's a fine layer of grain (and I mean very fine), but it doesn't seem like any DNR was added. Edge Enhancement? Not too sure, I'm typing this review with only 4 hours of sleep and might've seen a tiny little bit, but it's hard to say when I'm not all there. Regardless, though, I can tell you everything else looks superb, especially for its age.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Another big part of Tarantino's films outside of its aesthetic and literary homages is the sound, particularly the music. As soon as Surf Rider starts playing it's easy to tell that this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track will do its job and do it well. LFEs are at their most prominent when any of this great soundtrack starts playing. Even as the radio switches to Jungle Boogie in the opening sequence, there's not a discrepancy to be heard. But how do the rest of the sound elements hold up on this seemingly quaint sound design? I mean, how can 230 pages of script possibly earn a 5 point rating? Oddly enough, this film's sound scape has a LOT of immersion. Shortly after the credits have done their thing we get a great audio treat in the first scene where Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are contemplating their change in venue for an upcoming robbery. I actually wouldn't even know this if I hadn't accessed all the extras, but the trivia track says that even in this very first scene, despite the achoronlogical plot structure, if you listen hard enough during Pumpkin and Honey Bunny's conversation you can distinctly hear Jules talking to Vincent in the background from a scene to be shown later on in the film. How cool is that? And while the weak point of the sound effects may be in the meager gunshots, the sheer sense of engulfment that every other crowded scene has to offer is sonic gold. Directionality and separation sound wonderful during these parts putting you right there in the thick of things. Meanwhile, high and low ends still manage to be very well-calibrated, specifically in the scene where Mia is getting her adrenaline shot between all the paper raffling around and the eventual thump on her chest. Oh yeah, and the dialogue couldn't be any clearer. From Jules' intimidating preacher vibrato to Fabienne's sweet and sexy accented-English, the movie has never looked OR sounded better. My favorite scenes to test the audio would be the aforementioned robbery attempt at the beginning of the film and the always-exalting trademark scene of Vincent and Mia going to Jack Rabbit Slim's (when they walk to their table and when they start dancing).<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Wow, I should really have taken a nap before work instead of trying to rush this review out for everyone to get a fresh take on the product, but I'm glad I at least got to learn a lot of things despite my soon-to-be headache at the crap hole at which I work. At any rate, this BD is loaded with extras. Most of them are DVD ports, but I'd never seen this on DVD anyway, and thus, am just seeing all of this for the very first time.<br /><br />- Not the Usual Mindless Boring Getting to Know You Chit Chat (HD; 43:01)<br />A new HD retrospective with most of the film's actors discussing how they were cast, how the shooting went, and all of the things that ensued after the film came out. There's a lot of information here about the movie itself, its writing, and how a lot of the actors felt working with Tarantino.<br /><br />- Here are Some Facts on the Fiction (HD; 20:37)<br />Another newly-produced featurette that shows a roundtable discussion with critics and their thoughts on how Pulp Fiction has affected the industry, their favorite parts, and some of the things that make the movie so good.<br /><br />- Pulp Fiction: The Facts - Documentary (SD; 30:31)<br />Is from the Special Edition DVD (as is everything else from here on out) and is something of a mishmash of the pre-production, filming, and reception of the movie up to 2001.<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 24:30)<br />Feature commentary for 4 out of the 5 scenes by Tarantino and are enjoyable, if you want to at least take a one-time look.<br /><br />- Siskel & Ebert At the Movies: The Tarantino Generation (SD; 16:00)<br />Is a short look at the quick rise of Tarantino's status and whether or not they think he was legit at the time. It comes off rather pretentious, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />- Charlie Rose Show (SD; 55:27)<br />Features a GREAT interview with Tarantino and discusses a lot of his film-making roots, his philosophy as a movie-lover, and what he believes makes a good film.<br /><br />- Independent Spirit Awards (SD; 11:29)<br /><br />- Cannes Film Festival - Palme D'Or Acceptance Speech (SD; 5:20)<br /><br />- Marketing Gallery (SD; 16:13)<br />Lots and lots of trailers/teasers.<br /><br />- Still Gallery<br /><br />- Enhanced Trivia Track<br />A trivia track that pops up all sorts of tidbits of information in the subtitles telling you all the quirks about the film itself, if any of you like that sort of thing (and some of it being very funny).<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />As fervid as my review sounds, I'm actually not that big a fan of Tarantino. Aside from seeing this and Inglorious Basterds more than two times each, I've only seen his other films once. I didn't really get into Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bills were stylish enough, but keep in mind it's been nearly five years since I've seen those, and five years is a lot of time for my brain to better develop. But to the point, yes, Pulp Fiction is definitely one of those films that somehow managed to turn a bunch of dialogue into a fun and raucous movie. It's well-written, especially well-acted, and is a good way to spend two and a half-hours. With top-notch A/V quality and over 3 hours of specials, an SRP of $19.99 is practically nothing for such an renowned title that finally made its way to a proper BD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Words cannot express how much I love this movie, but I will try my best.  "Pulp Fiction" is one of my favorites.  Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.  Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.  But I will get to that later on in this review.<p>I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.  There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so; I mean, my laserdisk at least had three different trailers of the movie.  So, of course, I was very excited to learn that this movie was being re-released in a fully loaded special edition.  Re-buying the movie was well worth it, for this edition of the movie is far superior than the other one.<p>The movie really consists of three different stories; not in any order.  Any one of the stories could be their own little movies.  The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with "666" for the combination.  You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.<p>The acting is more than superb; including one terrific cast with some heavy hitters (Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, etc.).  Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  Especially when it comes to writing.  I have never heard such clever and brutally honest dialogue in any other movie.  I have said it before, and I will say it again; Tarantino reminds me of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.<p>Now, on to the special edition of this DVD.  Is it better than the previous version?  YES!  Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.  Picture looks very clear.  And the sound is also a lot better.  You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.<p>Special features.....where do I begin?  There's a ton of them!  It's not even funny how much stuff is loaded on this bad boy.  And every one of them is great.  Features include a documentary, an interview with Tarantino on "The Charlie Rose Show," trailers, filmographies, and many more.  If you love special features, then you will not be disappointed.<p>"Pulp Fiction" is a great movie, and the new DVD edition is outstanding in every way.  If you still have the older DVD of this movie, get this one now!  If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!  Of course, with any other movie, there is a chance you may not like this movie.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  Don't let hype ruin your preception of the movie, just watch it as if it were any other movie.  You like it, great; if not, well, at least you gave it a shot.  Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, "Pulp Fiction" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is like a novel with five chapters that was ripped apart and put back together with the chapters all mixed up in random order -- where does it start and where does it end?  That said, it's a  hilarious crazy-quilt of a movie, superbly directed by Quentin Tarantino.  And yes, there is a straight story line throughout... chronologically, the  actual story begins with Samuel Jackson and John Travolta on their way to a  hit ordered by their boss Ving Rhames, and ends with Bruce Willis and his  pregnant girlfriend zooming out of town on a homicidal maniac's stolen  motorcycle.  Each short story in the movie is complete in itself, and yet  each makes up part of the whole.  The actors are terrific.  Jackson and  Travolta are great as the two hitmen Jules and Vince; Uma Thurman is just  right as the boss's wife; Bruce Willis is funny and yet moving as the boxer  who saves the boss's life after the boss ordered a hit on him, and Harvey  Keitel steals the whole movie with his performance as the almost inhumanly  efficient Wolf.  Even Tarantino himself can't resist joining the fun and  plays the role of Jules's sometime partner Jimmie, very annoyed at being  roused out of bed at the crack of dawn to help dispose of a semi-headless  corpse.  There are so many priceless scenes in this film that it's hard to  pick a favorite.  It's a wild, crazy, mind-boggling movie that gets better  and better each time you watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction was a groundbreaking film in a couple of different ways. It was an independent release and its success opened the door up for all kinds of maverick filmmakers and companies to release films that otherwise would have never been made. It also had a profound stylistic influence. It was a hip movie with sharp dialogue, graphic violence, cool soundtrack and intricate plotlines. In the wake of its success, many movies try to copy this style, but most failed as they lacked Quentin Tarantino's unique vision. Mr. Tarantino was able to pull John Travolta out of a decade long funk and directed him to the finest performance of his career and one that garnered his second Academy Award nomination. He also pushed Bruce Willis to a stellar performance that showed he was more than just an action hero. The cast is first rate including a beguiling Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Rosanna Arquette and Christopher Walken. The best performance of all is given by Samuel L. Jackson who is absolutely amazing. It was a crime that he did not win the Academy Award for the role. Pulp Fiction is broken up into three parts and includes flashbacks, flash-forwards and twists and turns and some mysteries that are never revealed. It is a rare film that is both stylish and full of substance.  The new Collector's Edition is a huge step up from the original edition which offered virtually no extras.  The sound and visuals are crisper and cleaner and the extra features are great. One excellent extra is a Siskel &amp; Ebert show dedicated to the Tarantino phenonmeon, which looking at it eight years later is quite interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Almost everyone I know who has seen this film either loves it or hates it but all agree that it is almost impossible to take your eyes off of the screen. Pulp Fiction not only attracts our attention, it demands it. Much credit must be given to director Quentin Tarantino who co-authored the Academy Award winning best original screenplay with Roger Avary. The influences on his development as a filmmaker are too  numerous to list here but it is worth noting that Orson Welles, Daffy Duck, Akiro Kurosawa, Dashiell Hammett, Spike Lee, and Francois Truffaut would be on it. Many believe that this film saved John Travolta's career. His portrayal of the dangerous but somewhat dimwitted hit man, Vincent Vega,  is brilliant. In fact,  Tarantino assembled an outstanding cast and somehow coordinated the various plots in which they are involved. Destinies intersect, sometimes causing violent collisions. The film's accelerated pace, however, does not preclude "eye of the hurricane" moments as when Vincent dances with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) in a nightclub or when Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) are held against their will by a psychopath. Tarantino has a very traditional view of film making: He wants vivid PICTURES and he wants them to MOVE. He also cherishes effective use of language, almost to the point that some scenes seem "talky." My guess (only a guess) is that because Tarantino seems to be a compulsive conversationalist, he and members of his cast and crew never stopped talking about Pulp Fiction from the beginning to the end of its production and that many of them are still discussing it nine years after it was first released.<p>This is a nasty, sometimes violent, occasionally hilarious, but never dull film. To those seeing it for the first time who almost immediately become uncomfortable, my advice is to be patient and allow the narrative to continue. You may end up being repulsed. Fair enough. But you may also find yourself enjoying what is deliberately and pre-eminently an unorthodox examination of how MOVING PICTURES can tell a story with compelling impact. For me, the vivid images and my emotional reactions to them dominate the literate, at times loopy dialogue. FYI, the special features provided with the DVD Miramax Collector's Edition include "Pulp Fiction: The Facts" (an original documentary), behind-the-scenes montages, a production design featurette, a Siskel &amp; Ebert At The Movies feature (&quot;The Tarantino Generation&quot;), Tarantino's Cannes Film Festival - Palm d'Or acceptance speech, his appearance on the Charlie Rose Show, and various reviews and articles which discuss the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I have never seen a movie like Pulp Fiction in that some scenes or parts of the film I loved and some I hated.  Why I am not sure since most films that are shot in or take place in Los Angeles I usually enjoy very much.  I thought the part towards the end with Harvey Keitel in it was great, yet some of the drug scenes were just not interesting.  This movie reminds me of so many other films that are based out of LA like 'crash, from 2005', '2 days in the valley', in how the movie was developed and plays out.  Must be the atmosphere that Los Angeles brings to the movie making process and that it is the nicest place I have ever been to in this country.  Overall, the film is very popular and has a great cast to it.  Maybe a little less drugs for me and I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>After `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' is the film that cemented Tarantino's place in the film world as a director/writer of distinction.  On repeated viewings you can see why and I still marvel at the style of this film.<br /><br />This is made up of a series of vignettes around LA and with a core of the same characters, until everything comes full circle and ties up at the end.  This delivers a fast paced, gritty storyline and whilst the humour is certainly dark, it can't help but make you laugh.  The cast is outstanding and Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis all turn out stellar performances.<br /><br />It goes some way to show how enduring a film is if lines or scenes from it are still quoted many years after it was made and this is definitely one of those film.  The amount of times I have seen a pastiche of this or heard lines from it on TV or from friends is incredible.  The direction is amazing, with a few scenes standing out (like Willis leaning against a wall in close up, with Ving Rhames character chasing him down an alley in the distance),simple perfection.  The plot is excellent too with the non-chronological vignettes unweaving the story as it goes.  The soundtrack, as in most Tarantino film, is a key element and each song matches the scene perfectly and the interaction between the music and actors is a sight to behold (again I`m thinking of the now iconic scene where Uma Thurman dances the twist with Travolta).<br /><br />This is highly lauded and beloved by many fans for good reason and if you haven't seen this yet then snap it up and if you have seen it, then add this to your discerning film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>I think Quentin creates films that are masterpieces of creativity, just like Kubrick uses imagery. This film has really great characters who just come across with dialog that doesnt so much ring with wit but with imagination. The film uses actors who just turn their roles into scene stealers again and again. It is about gangsters who work for the big boss Maurice. Maurice doesnt show up too much except for a cat and mouse run that turns into a trial of shame and pain for this heavyweight criminal. Willis doesnt say  too much, but he reflects his nonverbal as stoic until he turns into a baby talker with his uniquely attractive french girlfriend with a very round apple face. The two main thugs are Fishburne and Travolta, they both do a good job. I like the way Fishburne uses his speech and articulates so eloquently, he finally feels his bible verse during a murder raid, which will change his life. He decides to become a savior to another mixed up couple during a coffee shop burgler gone wrong. Travolta and Thurman are the most inventive and I loved when they share an intimate outing with drugs overtaking the real connection. They do the twist at a rock a billy diner with the old caddy cars as booths for the lucky few. Keitel plays an organized yuppie sweeper almost seen as godlike by his fame of handling dirty jobs so perfectly. He has a short take but its another creme de le creme character. The things I liked were the cool connection of the Travolta and Thurman, the twist and the fun of showing off their style. I liked Thurmans camera director meeting with him. She displays this air of creativity and in the moment fun even though on a high. Filming is fun, I liked to do little short character takes or shooting your friends like an interview. It was different. I liked the coffee shop. I liked the motel with the anonimity and intimacy they shared, with the overcast skies. I liked the thought of a big breakfast with blueberry pancakes and sausages with lots of maple syrup. I liked that they could go anywhere and experience great adventures like Bora Bora. I liked that Willis went back to help the oppressor out of so much degradation. I liked the way Fishburne wanted to walk the planet, meeting others sharing moments and being open to life. A must see flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film in 1995, I didn't quite get it, since then I have gotten almost all of Quentin Taratino's films ("Jackie Brown", "Deathproof", "Kill Bill 1 & 2", "From Dusk til Dawn") & now this one, why I ignored this one for so long I don't know, AMC aired it recently & I found myself enjoying it much more than I did in 1995, & had to get it too, Taratino is the kind of filmaker that Hollywood used to have many of, but no longer has anymore, his writing style really jumps out at you, Samuel L.Jackson is at his usual best, no one can swear like Jackson, his swearing makes me laugh every time, I have just about all of his films, he is definately one of my favorite actors that I feel doesn't get the recognition he deserves most of the time, & Taratino revived John Travolta's career here just as he revived the late David Carradine's in "Kill Bill", even Michael Keaton & Robert DeNiro took a pay cut to work with Taratino on "Jackie Brown", & I think Bruce Willis did too on this one, anyway in this one, you have three interwoven stories with Jackson & Travolta as hitmen for Ving Rhames(Con-Air, Dark Blue) who is a  boxing promoter who is married to Uma Thurman (Kill Bill), with Bruce Willis as a boxer who crosses Rhames after refusing to throw a fight, but the real highlight is Jackson & Travolta's moments, the one with Taratino himself, the one with Harvey Keitel as a fixer somewhat, & especially the diner sequence where Jackson belittles a would be robber (Tim Roth), I get this one now, I think what I didn't like when I first saw it, was the mixing up of scenes, but now I get it, & this is definately Taratino's crown jewel, & a must own DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino became a household name after the release of "Pulp Fiction" in 1994. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Roger Avary depicting the underbelly crime scene of the greater Los Angeles area. John Travolta's career took an upward turn after a series of Hollywood flops in this masterpiece playing a hit man who works alongside another psychotic maniac, played superbly with unapologetic force by Samuel L. Jackman. The story mainly deals with their encounters with many shaddy creatures in the drug trade as the film's backdrop. Uma Thurman plays the wife of a mob boss who "loves to powder her nose" frequently. Uma's portrayal in "Pulp Fiction" is downright disturbing as well as being hilarious which adds to the different elements of her character. Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitell have supporting roles.<br /> "Pulp Fiction" would receive a whopping seven Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture. Quentin and Roger Avary would win one of the most acclaimned Oscars, for Best Original Screenplay.<br /> On a paltry budget of $8,000,000, "Pulp Fiction" has so far grossed an incredible $212,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice becoming one of the biggest films ever.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses, including documentaries, Quentin's appearance on PBS' "The Charlie Rose Show", featurettes, TV Spots, still galleries, deleted scenes, and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction is inspired by the old novels of the same name.  The characters in the movie remind you of the 1930's -40's cheap crime novels full of familiar characters like boxers willing to throw a fight, mob bosses, calculating wives and bank robbers like Bonnie and Clyde. Tarantino is the director and must have tongue in cheek throughout!<br /><br />Pulp Fiction is set in Hollywood in the 1990's and combines three stories that focus on two characters.  The first story is about Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). Jules quotes Ezekiel 25:17 to his victims before blasting them.  Jules and Vincent are two hit men that work for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).  Marsellus has a beautiful wife, Mia (Uma Thurman).  Marsellus wants Vincent to entertain his wife and takes her out to a 1950's themed restaurant.  She takes a liking to Vincent, and is also a drug addict.  She overdoses and the scrambling and the scenes scrambling saving her from death are hilarious.  The second story is about a boxer who is asked to throw a fight (Bruce Willis) by the big boss Marsellus.  He decides to make money himself by doing the opposite and wins the fight, killing his opponent in an early round.  The third story is about a pair of lovers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) who discuss a career change from robbing banks to holding up a diner.  They decide a diner is easier and more money.<br /><br />There is also an interesting character named Wolf (Keitel).  He is a mobster cleanup man who instructs on how to do the job.<br /><br />The film's stories weave in and out, there is a lot of dialogue that is mesmerizing.  Talk about Big Mac's in Paris and why someone was killed because he massaged the feet of big boss's wife, Mia.  Sometimes the dialogue goes so long you know it is on purpose - like a rhythmic "riff" to the ears -  The movie is original and bright though the theme is dark in the noir way.<br /><br />There are lengthy scenes presented out of sequence.  I don't know how the movie is held together unless the a feeling of the playfulness of the actors as they enjoy their characters.<br /><br />The final scene brings the movie together - ties it in a neat little package.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>An inside look at a memorable community of criminals.

Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue.

As far as standard version dvds go this is as good as it gets although it'll be very interesting to see how the Blu-ray version will eventually look like.<br /><br />No one tells a story as entertainingly and as uniquely in-your-face as Tarantino and this blackest of comedies is for me his very best work.  In lesser hands a tale told as disjointedly and with little care for chronology as this one does would fall flat on its face but fortunately for us the hands are Tarantino's.  There are many great performances here but surely Jackson's and Travolta's stand out.  I also thought Walken's brief contribution was extremely humorous and worthy of honourable mention as well.<br /><br />Shocking audiences upon its initial release I did find it interesting that the overall moral is still about hope for even the worst of the worst as they either find redemption after a life-changing experience e.g. Jackson or death/trauma (Travolta/Rhames)for their crimes and even the underdog has his day (Willis).  Despite the graphic violence and in-your-face vice the ending still seems to suggest good triumphs over evil in the end in true Hollywood fashion.<br /><br />Very unique, enjoyable and certainly a classic that should continue to age very well.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarentino made his mark with this well-executed, finely-textured and magnificently fascinating movie featuring an all-star cast. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames ignite the screen in this action-packed, character-driven, multi-layered story. John Travolta proves he's still got the moves in a dance scene with Uma Thurman. This movie is much better than "Jackie Brown," a misfire with me, but Tarentino got back on track with "Kill Bill." He should act more in his own movies. The movie should not have been rated R, but PG-13 for some violence and mild language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction is still regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and why should it change from that rank? This movie is basically a crime drama that follows the stories of different gangsters and what happens to them throughout the movie. The movie can be really funny in certain areas while giving you the classic drama feel, along with a recreation of how people seem to live. There is drug use and a lot of language, so parents shouldn't let there kids watch this movie, because it's an adults movie, and plus most kids don't know how to appreciate something this good(Stupid High School Musical!

His quality deserved him the Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay for 1994.  The movie combines three different stories that brilliantly connect one another by editing.  John Travolta makes a triumphant comeback, making this his best performance since &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.  Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and he are well-deserving of their Oscar nominations for their acting roles.  The Travolta and Thurman dance club scene is unforgettable.  Thurman's next scene is when she shines more than anywhere else(can't say how).<p>It may have to be watched a second time to fall in love with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  After that, it's addictive.

It's a grand journey - two days in the L.A. underworld guided by hitment Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Whitfield (Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and a dream cast of colorful supporting characters (including Harvey Keitel as the mysterious but resourceful Mr. Wolf). And even when the nearly 3-hour ride gets dark and violent, it's impossible to miss the tongue-in-cheek hilarity of Tarantino's colorful and endlessly quotable screenplay ("I'm gonna get medieval on yo' a$$"). Submerged in director Tarantino's deep love of film, it plays like a gift to cinephiles of all ages that thankfully never fumbles into parody or blatant tribute. Instead, Pulp Fiction takes its inspirations and molds them into something entirely original. It restores one's faith in the future of film itself - so much that nothing better has even been seen yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's ultra-hip film that put John Travolta back on the map is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films in cinema history. The top cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis are all great in their decidedly off-beat roles. The unique approach to the material is played out in the grandest sense, with the &quot;backwards&quot; events and commendable wayward camera techniques. The classy soundtrack (one of my favourites) is equally impressive. At times confusing, it's a film that has to be watched several ways through get the jist of it. Tarantino's hard-as-nails direction makes this one somewhat hard to sit through. With the comical M.O taken with people getting four shades of guano blown out of them, it proves to be an uneasy watch.

"It's too violent," they say, without even having seen it. And in several cases, these are the same women who love Carl Hiaasen's books. You want wacko violence? Read Hiaasen. Soooo, what's with not watching Pulp Fiction?<br /><br />Get over it. Watch it anyway. You won't regret it.<br /><br />For about ? of the movie, you just have to take it on faith that the seemingly random bits of action are eventually going to merge and make some sense - and of course they do. The business of waiting, however, is NOT boring; a little confusing maybe, but definitely not boring. There are such spectacular, tongue-in-cheek bits of acting, violence, insanity, horror that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Right now, one particular one comes to mind (no, no, not the one with the brain matter splattered throughout the car's interior): Bruce Willis knows this bad dude is being tortured in a basement dungeon by some even badder guys, and sort of against his better judgment he decides he's gotta do something about it, even tho the guy being tortured has been determined to kill him (Willis). So he's in this store on the main floor, looking for a weapon - and meanwhile you hear the horrible sounds of the guy to whom terrible things are being done - and Willis is taking his sweet time, weighing a big gun against a mace against a pistol against a cudgel against a - - -  Aha! At last, just when you're ready to scream "THE GUN, TAKE THE GUN" at him, he finds what he's looking for: a samurai sword. And off he trots to save his would-be assassin.<br /><br />And what a cast. In addition to Willis, you've got Uma Thurman, Samuel L.

There's countless moments in it to treasure, many of which have even become famous, especially Travolta and Jackson's conversation about the Royale with cheese.  Cult movie fans should also be acquainted with the debate over what really was in that suitcase: diamonds, a human soul or even a Royale with cheese!<p>The story has three basic threads - revolving around two hitmen (Travolt and Jackson), a boxer (Willis) and a couple robbing a store (Roth and Plummer).  The cast itself is formidable, with Thurman and Travolta being especially good.  Yes it's violent, and has set off various arguments over the validity of such thrillers as valid cinema.

I didn't hesitate for one second when I noticed that the poorly packaged Blu edition was selling for about eight dollars. I placed the order, the plan being to simply replace the DVD's movie disc with the Blu and get the best of both.<br /><br />It was a gamble because not all Blu re-issues are noticeable improvements over the original DVD releases but this edition of Pulp Fiction is. Very much so. Anyone who's watched the Blu issues of '2001' or the Blu James Bond Collection or The Godfather probably knows what I'm talking about. Its like someone washed the camera's lens and everything that was to be sharp is even more so and all shades are nuances are now perfectly rendered. Add to that the spectacular Loseless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack and, especially at this price, the Blu Pulp Fiction should be a must buy.<br /><br />As for the extra content, this one-disc release carries almost everything (DVD resolution) that the Collector's edition has, minus the DVD-ROM features and adds 2 new featurettes containing more recent interviews with the cast and some critics discussion on the movie's role in the history of cinematography.<br /><br />The presentation is in line with this edition price: done cheaply: cheap looking blue plastic case with cutouts to reduce the costs by a couple of pennies and... nothing else.

What I still find odd is that the film quality is still disappointing.  Apparently the original source has problems that can't be fixed.  It's not a huge problem, but there still remains scenes which are not as sharp as they should be for a film that is under 10 years old.  I've seen older films with pristine transfers.</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>this is one of the must see crime movies. very funny and never dull. great acting. not actually that hard to follow like some reviewers say. there are not that many jumps between time. the dvd is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>This ground breaking movie has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. <p>This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script has been much imitated and will continue to do so. The fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie fans. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - &quot;believe the hype!&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>O.K this movie was a good movie don't get me wrong, basically its about Hitmen and various other people that meet there fates over a few days.  <p>Parts of it are very funny and you find yourself growing attracted to the characters dispute the fact that they are mostly bad guys <p>I really liked the part in the diner with the two robbers(the pros meet the wannabes kinda thing)<p>However I finished watching this movie with the same feeling I got watching "Natural Born Killers".  For some of these scenes what the heck was the point?  <p>The most glaring case in point for me was the whole Zed/Butch/Mahshalus sex scene.  Now why was this scene even in the movie?  I know people don't take this film literally but it still ticks me off(check out where I'm from).  What if a guy never travled below the Mason-Dixon in his entire life and only saw "Pulp Fiction"</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>This is dark-comedy at it's finest.  Whenever you find yourself laughing at something that you shouldn't find amusing, you know you are watching a good movie. This was also John Travolta's resurrection.  He is incredible  as Vincent Vega.  Sam Jackson is also hysterical as Jules.  Overall this  film keeps you wrapped up and interested.  You only see all the  significance if you watch the whole thing intently.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely fantastic. Brilliance in acting all the way, sensational writting and directing by Tarantino, everything about it is perfect. I really couldn't tell you what it was about, there is something  different happening all the time. I'll just say go see it. Recommended for  everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>I never get tired of this movie.  I don't think I ever will.  It is so original.  This Quentin Tarantino classic has become the blue print for so many other movies out there.  Even though they try they can never come close to this masterpiece.  This collector's edition is great.  Many bonus features and anamorphic widescreen.  I wish more movie directors and studios would take the time to make actual great collector's editions like these folks did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>I love everything about it. The different yet related stories and actors. Yes, a great film indeedy!</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I have made two previous attempts to sit through pulp fiction, both unsuccessful, I'd see a little more in each and then dismiss it.<br />I finally gave the whole thing a watch. To say that I'm overwhelmed would be a fitting analysis. I had to go pee after watching the last scene.<br />I do not think any thriller will match it's quotient. Loved the definition of divine intervention and I highly acclaim Tarantino's style of dialogue and conversation flow he adds to films making you forget you are watching a film like nooone else does. At his best, he is better than Speilberg, Martin Scorsese and even my Godfather Sam Mendes.<br /><br />Have you seen 12 Angry Men? If not, I highly recommend it.<br />I do think like me you have seen Pulp fiction in parts but that would be a product of wishful thinking.<br />You might have seen the whole thing.<br /><br />One of the best films I've had a privilege of seeing.<br />It makes Death Proof, Departed, Kill Bill look rather tame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>This movie is the pinnacle of excellent movie making. While Quentin Tarantino stays in my mind as one of the strangest individuals in the entertainment business after perhaps Crispin Glover and Michael Jackson, I think his ability to creat a cinematic masterpiece is of the highest level.<br /><br />This movie stands as one of the greatest movies of all time. The intertwining of movie making and storyline are what make this movie so wonderful! Casting was top notch, as well as makeup and costume design. I liked watching the movie, not being sure if I was watching mid-80's or present time. For the record this movie came out in 1992.<br /><br />I think Samuel L. Jackson deserved an oscar nomination for this one. It was phenomenal watching him on the big screen, especially during the shootout in the apartment. I also very much enjoyed the dialogue between him and John Travolta, especially before the shooting, as they are waiting to enter the apartment.<br /><br />I give this high marks, and hope that others will take the time to watch this wonderful movie.<br /><br />Two thumbs up! MC White says check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Anyone who has seen the Kill Bill movies can understand Tarrantino's style.  This one has a series of stories, some of them related and most of them with John Travolta.  One of my favorites involves Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who shoot a guy in their car.  They need to clean themselves up and get rid of the "mess."  Enter Harvey Keitel as a take charge kind of guy who approaches the problem like a swat team giving everybody orders of what to do, how to do it, and how long each step will take.<br /><br />Another tale involves Bruce Willis trying to guard a watch that was handed down from his grandfather to his father and then preserved by his father's friend (Christopher Walken) in his rectum during internment at a POW camp.  Willis trying to get the watch back gets into a big fight with a crime boss and while they are fighting they are captured by sex fiends for torturous games.<br /><br />The movie breaks all rules and like Blue Velvet, is like no other movie I have seen before.  I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Wonder boy Quentin Tarantino's second film, PULP FICTION, became the standard-bearer and trendsetter for cinema in the 1990s. The tangled story centers on and around two philosophizing hit-men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and their dark adventures entertaining their boss' drug-addict wife, and killing off his failed business partners. One of these partners is a prize fighter (Bruce Willis), who actually wins a fight when he, well, wins a fight; one that he had promised to lose, and lives to bask in the anonymous glory. <p>However, unconventional as the story lines are, the plots are not the point of this picture. In fact, despite the off-the-beaten-path plots, the events depicted in this film leave one with a sense of emptiness and unfulfilled expectation. Nothing happens in the film that matters, perhaps, because so much does happen, that the viewer is desensitized to the moral ramifications of the acts that are depicted. What ultimately redeems this film and, in fact, raises it above the league of most commercial movies is that it is so well crafted and audacious in its approach that it stands as a uniquely fresh masterpiece in American cinema. <p>Among the film's strident innovations is the elegance of the dialogue given to otherwise despicable characters. But, vying for equal attention is the ubiquity of stylized violence and the glorification of low values (such as drug use) that seems to pervade this film. Additionally, Tarantino, the product of a leading film school (U.S.C.), is adept at staging visually-lush sequences. One of my favorite and most innovative shots, for instance, involves the Bruce Willis character's conversation with Jackson and Travolta's boss (Ving Rhames). For the entire scene, especially, the first, extended shot, the camera avoids the conventional head-shot of Rhames while Rhames is talking. Instead, the camera focuses on Willis, who remains silent for several minutes, minimally responding to Rhames' dialogue with understated facial expressions. In another unusually staged scene, John Travolta delivers a soliloquy in a bathroom about why he should not go to bed with the boss' wife. <p>Tarantino's movies are also distinguished by the quality of their sound tracks. Pulp Fiction is no exception, being a trendsetter in its use of ultra-hip, and sometimes, revivalist choices. Of course, this `retro' philosophy is echoed in the casting choices that are made in his films, as we note that Pulp Fiction breathed new life into John Travolta's screen career, while tapping also new talents, such as those of Samuel L. Jackson. Finally, Tarantino's films are also distinctive in the way in which they develop a story line; they are seldom linear, stirring up disparate subplots, which are synthesized together by a meandering, often non-consecutive time line. <p>All of these elements in tandem - the clever dialogue, the rarefied violence, the retro soundtracks, and the unconventional story arches present us with a bold, new vision for movie making. Let there be no doubt; this movie is not for every palate. And, social critics have charged that its casual dispensation of gratuitous violence has led to a coarsening of our culture. But, putting aside those concerns, there can be no denying that Tarantino has taken film into previously uncharted waters. <p>PULP FICTION is the best effort so far that Tarantino has made to challenge and invigorate the cinematic arts in America. Every scene in this movie is powerful enough to stand on its own. In combination, however, they make for a very powerful film; one that overcomes the challenges that it, itself, raises. A must get DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction, the 1994 film which stunned the world.  Critics hailed this film as "the film which has redefined motion<br />pictures in the 20th century," and it surely did.<br />  Quentin Tarantion followed up with Pulp Fiction after his superb debut, Reservoir Dogs, infact it's hard for me to say which I liked better, because they're equally phenomenal.  Pulp Fiction also led many actors on the road to stardom including John Travolta who delivered a great performance, but the real star here is Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield.  Jackson just has a presence on screen which is fantastic, his portrayal of anger is displayed so realistically and whenever he recites a certain passage from the Bible, it makes you quiver in a sense.<br />  The film revolves around three different stories, one involving two hitmen, Travolta and Jackson another involving a boxer (Bruce Willis) and the 3rd involves a couple planning on robbing a restaurant (Tim Roth and Plummer).  Also features nice performances from Ving Rhames who plays the manager of Willis who soon gets involved in a huge dispute with him, Uma Thurman who plays Mia Wallce, she's the girl John Travolta has to babysit.  Eric Stolz as Lance, Harvey Keital as Mr. Wolf, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino also show up in some cameo performances.  Tarantino along with Roger Avary won the oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the 1995 Academy Awards and it's easy to see why.  This is one the best films of the decade, and still remains to be, it's a cult classic.<br />  Pulp Fiction is rated R for Strong Graphic Violence and Drug Use, Pervasive Strong Language and Some Sexuality.  The violence is graphic, and you're obviously going to be expecting that, I mean come on it's a Quentin Tarantino film.  Violence includes bloody gunplay and fisticuffs.  The profanity is excessive and non-stop essentially and it's also quite strong.<br />Drug Use and sexual innuendo, there is a nasty and unpleasant rape sequence, but not exceptionally explicit.  There's also implied nudity, specifialliy when Bruce Willis gets out of the shower and we really don't need to see, well I'll leave that to your imagination.  All in all, a fine picture and definetly is worth owning on Video or DVD, specifally the Collector's Edition on DVD, it's packed with special features.  Add this to your collection and check other Tarantion films: Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 and soon to be released Kill Bill, Vol. 2. (April 16, 2004).</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>Like some of Taratino's films, this one is no exception to his "random acts" style of film (ex: how the film isn't straight through and how scenes are in different order like in RESERVOIR DOGS).<p>This one's got several scenes like that that seem a bit random but when the movie ends, and you put all of the scenes together you think nothing less than "WOW!". Honest to God, this is a great film and it's really funny as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together in this one. Along with an All-Star cast of Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Eric Stolts, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis, you can't go wrong!<p>This is a definite pick up! There is a lot of swearing in this one and also some drug ise and it's violent too but other than that, a great film and easily out of all of Taratino's movie, PULP FICTION is one of his best! Also check out RESERVIOR DOGS, DUSK TILL DAWN and for a great laugh from Tarantino, check out FOUR ROOMS!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Finally the movie that sits atop my Amazon Listmania List of "Flicks That Will Leave a Permanent Impression" gets Blu Ray treatment. And 1994's Pulp Fiction epitomizes a flick that leaves a permanent impression.<br /><br />If you said to me that you've never seen Pulp Fiction I'd be very surprised (unless you're a teenager or younger). This movie is so classic, from it's stellar out of order storyline(s) to the memorable quotes throughout the film.<br /><br />Pulp Fiction houses Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in a film ever, and most of the memorable quotes involve his perfectly portrayed character Jules in some way, shape or form. Jackson should have gotten the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his only Oscar nomination. But it went to Martin Landau that year for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood. I remember like yesterday as they announced the winner of the award they showed all the Best Supporting Actor nominees in their own little windows, and when they read Landau's name you could see Jackson mouth the words in true Jules fashion, "Oh, that's b***s***!". I agree, Sam...I agree.<br /><br />This is the movie that also revived John Travolta's slumping career. Maybe revived isn't the right word...perhaps saying this movie put Travolta in a much needed refreshing light would be better said. Pulp Fiction took Travolta from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J2Q">Grease</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXH5">Staying Alive</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJMJHA">Barbarino</a> character into a tough, take-me-seriously character. Travolta got the Best Actor nomination for his role as Vincent in Pulp Fiction, but he didn't win (the winner was Tom Hanks for his Forrest Gump role which was a lot more understandable than Jackson's snub).<br /><br />Pulp Fiction has some of the best screenwriting in any drama that I've ever seen; and at least the Academy agreed with me on that as the Best Screenplay nod did go to Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino. Every lead actor in this film really shines; Tarantino really got the best out of his all-star, A-List cast.<br /><br />Pulp Fiction on Blu Ray is a long awaited addition to my collection. The movie looked great with its 1080p transfer and the DTS sound (with such a great musical score) was terrific. I haven't watched the Extras on this new Blu Ray release yet, but at some point I will find the time for all 6+ hours of them from interviews with the cast, to behind the scenes footage to deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />Step aside, Butch. Pick up this movie....This is a tasty burger!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino raises the bar after the excellent "Reservoir Dogs" with this ultra violent crime drama.  I guess what makes Tarantino interesting is that his excess in violence is augmented by goodly amounts of humor and wit.  In this multi-faceted take on organized crime, the primary focus is on 2 hit men.  One is a black man with a jerry curl (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner is a white dude with stringy long hair (John Travolta).  Their business is strong arming people and killing them if necessary.  They work for crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).<br /><br />The movie opens and closes on a restaurant where a "wired" couple (Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer) are in the process of robbing all the customers.  In between the two scenes with get the hit men botch a hit on drug suppliers holding out on Marcellus.  It's graphic but hilarious at the same time.  Then in one of the great scenes in film, Marcellus wants Vincent (Travolta) to squire around his antsy wife Mia (Uma Thurman) for the evening.  Not wanting to risk anything with Mia, Vincent injects a little heroin.  After the classic twist contest at the rock `n roll diner, Mia discovers what she thinks is cocaine in Vincent's jacket and snorts it.  A no no.  She goes into convulsions, so Vincent takes her to his dealer where the famous scene where they inject adrenaline directly into her heart takes place.<br /><br />In another tangent storyline a boxer (Bruce Willis) is set to throw a fight at the order of Marcellus.  He doesn't so he must escape quickly after the fight.  In an unlikely coincidence Marcellus and Butch (Willis) run into each other at a stoplight.  They nearly kill each other but stumble into a KKK/Nazi-style pawn shop where they are bound and gagged and prepared for...well, rape.  Tarantino's movies aren't like any other.  There is nothing ever traditional about them.  They purposely go way over the top.  The detail is finely honed, right down to Jules' (Jackson) wallet in the final scene.  Watching this movie 18 years after its release, I'm still entertained and exhilarated.<br /><br />This single disc Blu ray has an excellent 2.35:1 video transfer and a DTS-HD Master Audio sound layer in 5.1.  For some reason I had to crank the volume level up a few notches more than usual to get all the dialog.  There are plenty of additional features including interviews, critic's retrospective evaluation, a couple featurettes, a clip from Siskel & Ebert's "At the Movies", award show footage, deleted scenes and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>Funny, entertaining, creative and thought-provoking are words that best describe "Pulp Fiction." The movie moves around in many different directions and there isn't a centric plot or theme. Instead it's like little plays woven together to form a work of art. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional  performance that was both unique and meaningful. John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch. The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in "Pulp Fiction" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays. If you try to follow the story you'll probably get lost, so don't. If you don't take things too seriously and don't mind mindless violence with a little bit of crude language thrown in for good measure than this movie is assuredly for you. This movie deserves to be on blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Even thought Reservoir Dogs got him noticed in the States, it was this film that really made everyone see that a genius story writer and director had been born. Always paying homage to the kinds of films he grew up with, Quentin comes through with Pulp Fiction. A brilliant story about two worn out hit men that are basically tired of their jobs, at least one of them is. The side-story of the Boxer who has a bounty on his head for not throwing the fight is equally as interesting of a story.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman...the list goes on about how many great actors and actresses are in this film. If the characters aren't believable, the movie is a bust and not good, but each did a great job at fitting their roles perfectly. The acting added a lot to the well written story. There is even a cameo by QT himself in the film. I don't know. This film is so great; it's hard to put into words on how great it is. Words don't really do it justice; it has to be seen to be believed. You will love this movie if you haven't seen it already. It's definitely one of the best films to come out of the 90's.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino's (director of Kill Bill) 2nd movie. And it just happens that PF is his best movie. It has an all star cast, and plus, some great action.<br /><br />STORY: This movie is actually 3 stories: The first one is about a man named Vincent Vega returning home from Amsterdam to a girl he meets named Mia Farrows. The second one is about a boxer, who forgets his watch at Vincent's apartment, then finds the therapist and tries to kill him. After the attempt to kill the therapist fails, he ends up running from the therapist. The third and final story is what happened before Vincent  and the other guy (I forget his name) left back home for America.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: What a work of art!

Great acting by everyone involved and a great script that allowed all actors to rome as free as their acting skills could take them.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Well, I've finally seen Pulp Fiction.  After weeks of being asked to see it by a friend of mine, I finally sat down and watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie, although I'm not sure how anyone can watch this more than once.<br /><br />There really isn't "a" story; it's more about a group of people who's lives intersect through a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) in four short stories.  While most of the characters overlap into different stories, there is usually one or two core characters in each tale.  One of the stories is about two robbers (played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who plan on holding up a diner.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play hit men working for Wallace who screw up a job.  Later, Travolta's character Vincent Vega (brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega in Resevoir Dogs) has to take out Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) when Wallace is out of town.  Then, there is a bit about Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, a down-and-out boxer who is going to take a fall in his last fight.<br /><br />The way the stories are told is done very well; things are not completely chronologically, which leads viewers to wonder how different characters got into certain situations.<br /><br />Now, about what I was saying earlier.  This is a really good movie, but its replay value is severely limited.  This is definitely a movie that can only be fully enjoyed once by most people (people who are die-hard Tarantino fans will probably be the ones doing multiple viewings).  But don't let that comment stop you from checking it out at least once, as you'd be doing yourself a disservice.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>It rocks.  It jumps.  It moves.  It's flashy and clever.  The acting is excellent.  The direction is interesting...  I could write a book, but what I kept thinking was how much the audience worships not just the violence, but the power.  How much they love the Fascist criminal, the mob boss who must be obeyed and shown loyalty to.  Uma Thurman is just decadently sexy.  John Travolta is amazingly lovable as a "low-rent" hood and Bruce Willis is believable as a prize fighter who turns the tables and wins the fight instead of throwing it (and, in an up-to-date spin, bets on himself-seems right!  How come they never did that before?  They probably did, I just missed it.).  Samuel Jackson is interesting as the Bible-quoting black hit man.<br /><br />Naturally they make us root for the bad guys; indeed the bad guys are almost always the heroes in the modern Hollywood.  We can really explore ourselves only as bad guys.  The pro-mo's for cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, booze and decadence are getting a little thin, however.  A Hollywood movie, a commercial flick, is always a clich&eacute;.  The art part comes from doing spins on the clich&eacute;, in putting a new twist on the old BS, on the old standards.  Ironically interesting was the sensuous indulgence of dinner for Travolta and Thurman.  He's shot heroin, she's done a few lines, they smoke some pot, they smoke some cigarettes, but they really get off on milk shakes and vanilla cokes, steaks and hamburgers.  Poor Hollywood.  They've done it all and now must find real indulgence in fat, salt, sugar and meat, which for the stars really is an indulgence.  If your life span is only sixteen to about thirty-five, then the forbidden things really are fat, salt, meat and anything else that puts on the weight.  Cocaine and cigarettes can't hurt you because by the time the ill effects kick in, your career is over anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>As this movie already has hundreds of reviews (many by much more knowledgable movie fans than I) I just had a few brief comments on this film, mostly related to a particular aspect of the movie that I liked that I hadn't seen discussed yet.<br /><br />Probably Tarantino's best or at least well-known film, the movie is filled with ironic twists of fate or perhaps ironic juxtapositions (I'm not sure what else to call it). For example, the two main characters (played by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) are a couple of amiable hit-men who are perfectly friendly and civilized as long as you're not on their little list of people to eliminate, as they go around cheerfully discussing philosophy, sex, and the meaning of life while offing their boss's enemies. But Travolta himself comes to an untimely demise after sitting on the pot after leaving his gun in the kitchen when Bruce Willis goes back to retrieve his father's watch. The watch makes an interesting symbol, because neither Travolta nor Willis has time to lose messing around with, in Travolta's case, nature's call, or in Willis's case, sentimental keepsakes. Marcellus Wallace, their employer, is busy trying to screw the boxing fans by fixing fights, but he in turns gets, well, the same treatment from the two B & D types in the store. Not to mention what happens to Wallace when Willis in his car meets up with Wallace in the crosswalk, and the fact that Willis double-crosses Wallace by refusing to throw the fight, thereby double-crossing the double-crosser. And so on and so on. I enjoyed this clever and funny aspect of the movie and it probably remains my favorite among Tarantino's films. Plus Harvey Keitel is great as the guy who can fix even the worst of Travolta and Jackson's screw-ups and misadventures.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>My last review should not be listened to, see because when i wrote that i hadn't seen the whole thing i got up to the rape scene and said screw this.  But now that i have seen it again i must say that it still isnt that good.  Although it certainly is not a bad movie, it still lacks action and the story isnt all that interesting.  The movie is too long for the story, it fairly simple its a basic hit man crime story all about a simple job involving taking a case, showing the bosses wife a good time, then jewels goes good and vincent gets shot by butch, thats the story very uninteresting.  The rape scene is unecessary and could have been toned down, there is no other real action just some shooting, of course there is style and good music, this is tarantino were talkin here, but i feel this is his worst movie and could have been better.  Overall its a half decent movie that has a certain good feel to it at the end, its got some funny things like "damn i just shot marvin in the face".  Kill Bill is much better, this is a movie you should see once, and i understand why most people like it alot, but for me it just doesnt provide me with has much fun as Kill Bill, but its defintly worth a look.  Quentin is now working on a war movie called Inglorious Bastards, which definetly sounds good, Tarantino doin a war movie, o hell yes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Had I writtent this review after the first time I watched this Tarantino splatter fest back in 1994, my rating would have been one star.  Apart from the unusual way in which Tarantino tied together and revealed the interaction of the stories out of chronological order, I saw nothing of even remote social redeeming value in the film.<p>Having not seen other Tarantino flicks at the time, I did not understand that Tarantino's medium always involves extreme, stylized violence, the more outrageous the better.  <p>Whenever my reaction to such an iconic film is so intensely negative, I always try to revisit the film at a later time, as much to understand the root of the phenomenon as to make sure my initial perceptions weren't skewed.  In this case, I believe they were, by the gratuitous and graphic violence and strong language.  Upon re-viewing the film, I discovered some of the subtler moments of really good acting, particularly Samuel L. Jackson's final &quot;Ezekiel speech&quot; in the diner and Bruce Willis' uneasy reconciliation with Ving Rhames after their encounter in the pawn shop.  These moments alone make the investment of time in the whole, lurid journey worthwhile.<p>While I was still utterly repulsed by Orlando Jones'character accidentally getting his grey matter spread across the interior of Jules' car, the perverse humor of this and other situations in the film were more amusing when considered in the context of what Tarantino was trying to present.  At first, I simply could not get past the combination of the temporal displacement of the exposition or initial shock value of the lurid subplots Tarantino's characters constantly found themselves in.  <p>Pulp Fiction is film that definitely benefits from multiple viewings--if you can stomach watching it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>I don't have the time to waste on telling you how great PULP FICTION is: YOU already know or you wouldn't be coming here. But if you want to know about the incredible stuff packaged in here then let me tell you that this DVD set is worth it. <p>The scenes that were edited out were extraneous, although I enjoyed Uma asking Travolta whether he was a Beatles or Elvis fan. The international trailers for the film were okay. But for any fan of this incredible film, what makes the set worth the price are three things: the synchronized trivia game, the independent spirit awards footage, and, if you missed it, the dialog with Charlie Rose. All together this will tell you why PULP FICTION is an established classic already, and will be for generations to come.<p>Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>I finally saw this movie for the first time last night and, wow. I've always heard so much hype about this movie like people getting offended, and people falling in love with it. It's just simply a love it or hate it type of film. There isn't that much action, but there's so much blood that it makes up for the lack of action. It would be very hard to determine the catergory of this movie...if you think about it, it's a dark comedy, but also a drama, and also an action, but also an epic...AHH. It's funny in a twisted way and uses what hit men talk about before they kill to stir up laughs. The soundtrack is explosive as almost all surf guitar. After watching it, I thought about how this movie had no plot. But I realized that it was 4 or so stories mashed together in one, sort of like Magnolia. This movie is not for the faint of heart, innocent blood spraying everywhere...most of it is presented comical. There is so much bad language and racial slurs that it just adds to the film's ruthlessness. The DVD is quite good, one of the best I've seen next to the fat four disc extended edition of the Lord Of The Rings. If you love the movie, get the Collector's Edition because it really is very cool. One of my favorite scenes is the whole thing with Butch going back to the apartment to get the watch and the incident that happnes there, and then more on the streets and the shop. So many memorable scenes in the movie, no wonder why it's on AFI's top 100 greatest movies ever made list. This movie's a real thinker with out-of-order scenes and hard situations. So if you are willing to let yourself get caught up in a profane, gory, disturbing, yet comical concauction of a movie, I suggest you see this now!</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>When "Pulp Fiction" first made it onto DVD, the disc's images had all the charm of an over-inked Dick Tracy strip, garish and pummeled by artless contrast. This criminal neglect is avenged -- and then some -- by Miramax's terrific two-disc release of "Pulp Fiction: Collector's Edition." <p>A lot of the "Pulp" extras appeared on Criterion's laserdisc, though a few recent interviews are cut in. Those seeking Quentin Tarantino's take on his work and cinema in general have plenty to chew on. Some of the most interesting and coherent material comes on a pre-"Jackie" interview by Charlie Rose that appears on "Pulp." DVD-ROM links that lead to script/movie comparisons. The script viewer's version of "Pulp" includes scenes taken out during editing, as they would have appeared. Travolta does a lot of stunting with his lines, but they still come out Tarantino.<p>"Pulp's" outtakes are less compelling, mostly chatter cut for quality reasons. On-the-set footage includes the shooting of Travolta's big twist-contest number with Thurman, adding a few moments of music and dance to the delicious scene. Just off camera, Tarantino twists along to Chuck Berry's "You Can Never Tell."<p>The celebrated soundtrack to "Pulp" sounded OK on the original DVD; here it's elevated into audiophile territory. Dick Dale's pipeline guitar gives shivers; a cover of one of Neil Diamond's old hits erects a wall of sound. "Pulp" audio options are DTS and Dolby Digital, but the mix is mostly stereo, with some tasty reverb echoes from the rear now and then.<p> "Pulp's" video transfer takes a while to reveal its finesse, but the images are rich in leather-booth reds and shell-shock whites. Detail such as sesame seeds on a bun pop out at times, while other scenes deliberately go with the grain.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>It's been about 10 years since I sat myself down and had the Pulp Fiction experience. I took another look at this film after watching Tarantino's recent tour de force &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. Must has been said about Pulp Fiction, from being a violent bloodfest to a spiritual journey; but one thing is certainly true: Pulp Fiction is a cinematic classic.<p>Pulp Fiction is really three films wrapped in one: the story of two hitmen sent out on a job to retrieve a briefcase, a boxer asked to throw a fight, and an actress with a habit that nearly kills her. These stories are intertwined effectively and effortlessly, the seems between them are negligible, so when one character from another story suddenly pops up in another one, its understandable. <p>It took Tarantino's vision to pull this off. Clearly, he's at the forefront of this movie, from its look and style. First, the sharp script, dialogue heavy, is extremely well written. When the Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield dish about Amsterdam McDonald's burgers, you realize you are listening to golden words. This isn't your average violent flick.<p>What also sets Pulp Fiction apart from your average violent flick is that much of the direct violence is never seen, or handled offscreen. Give Tarantino credit for making us think it's a bloodfest, but in reality, other films that have violent scenes that run for ten minutes, compared to Fictions quick scenes, you see the difference. Tarantino manages to build suspense and tension, in order for us to think it's more violent than it is.<p>In addition to that scene, the other classic scene occurs between Vincent Vega and Uma's slinky Mia Wallace at Jack Rabbit Slim's. I was totally entranced by the absolute perfection that scene has. From the stylistic 50's diner atmosphere, to the oddly weird and normal twist contest Mia and Vincent enter, it's brilliant from start to finish. <p>Pulp Fiction is a cinematic feast from beginning to end. Thanks to Quention for preparing it for us, and may we gorge for many years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarrentino is truly great. At a time when movies weere starting to become formulaic and unoriginal, Tarrentino all of a sudden burst on the scene with 1992's "Resevoir Dogs", a sprawling, intensely violent crime drama that was the most groundbreaking and original movie to come out in years. Next came "True Romance". Though Tony Scott directed it, the film would not have worked without Tarrentino's excellent screenplay, which featured some of the best dialogue ever commited to film in addition to some bitingly funny humor and nonstop action. Those first two films were excellent, but nothing could prepare Hollywood for tarretino's next film. "Pulp Fiction" was indeed a unique movie: rather than have a plot revolving a central character or characters, "Pulp Fiction" was four films in one. In addition, Tarrentino loaded the cast with A-listers that normally wouldn't take a role in one of Tarrentino's independent based films, then again, when you have a project like this thrown in your face, how could you refuse?<br /><br />Well, "Pulp Fiction" turned out to be a smash with both critics and audiences around the world. First, it won the Palm d'or (a foreign film award) as best pciture, than it won over critics around the world with its unique storytelling and excellent cast. Finally, the $ 8 million movie grossed over $ 100 million at the box office, got Tarrentino an Oscart for best screenplay, and rescued the careers of former Hollywood heavyweights John Travolta (who received an Oscar nomination) and Bruce Willis (whou should have received an Oscar nomination).<br /><br />"Pulp Fiction", as I said earlier, is essentially four films in one. One deals with two hitmen, Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson, who chews the scenery like a steak every chance he gets). Vincent and Jules make small talk about religion, animals and McDonald's in Paris and Amsterdam. Meanwhile, down on his luck boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis) has been ordered by crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) to throw a fight while Vega take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) on a date, which leads to a dance-off and disaster. Next thing you know, Coolidge wins the fight, kills Vega, and him and Marcellus are held hostage in a weapons shop (the best scene in the film). The last sequence involves Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) helping Jules and Vega (in case you're wondering, this film is not in chronological order) disposing of a body with the help of Jimmy (Tarrentino himself). To cap things off is a showdown at a local dinner between Jules and Vincent and two crime loving lovers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer).<br /><br />A little confusing, hah? Well, if the plot is a little too much to handle, than you should just watch it for the wonderful cast assembled for it. Some members (Travolta, Willis, Jackson, Thurman, Rhames) are focal points who dominate the film, while others (Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Plummer, Roth, Keitel, Maria De Medeiros) hardly appear at all. The point is, when they're onscreen, they command it. If this film had thrown Nicholson, Pacino and De Niro into the mix, than I'd consider it the rgeatest cast of actors assembled for any film. If "Pulp Fiction" had nothing else going for it, the cast would still shine through with their wondeful performances.<br /><br />However, "Pulp Fiction" has a lot going for it. It is perfect. And this special edition two disc dvd just adds to that perfrction. The extras are outstanding. One of the best se's ever. However, even if this film had no extras, it would still be worth it for the film alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction is now a classic.  It is the most satisfying of Tarrantino's movies as he artfully weaves together a compelling set of stories into a riveting film.  This film also saw the welcome return of John Travolta as a very hip hitman.  But, what distanced this movie from other &quot;art house&quot; action movies was Tarrantino's consumate skills as a storyteller.  &quot;The Watch&quot; was a wonderful piece, woven seamlessly into Bruce Willis' memorable role as the boxer.<p>Unfortunately, Tarrantino has not been able to match this effort in subsequent movies.  Pulp Fiction may go down as the Citizen Kane of the &quot;thrill kill&quot; generation. It brings together a great ensemble of actors playing their roles to the hilt.  Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the Ecclesiastics-driven killer.  Tarrantino may have made this look like an off-hand effort but there are few throw-away lines in this movie.  He ties all his stories together with a keen eye for social commentary. He has given a strange and even beautiful meaning to the chaotic world of violence we now find ourselves associated with, a definite notch about the Peckinpah-inspired violence of Reservoir Dogs.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>i watched this because it was the only thing on. boy am i glad i made that decision. this is one of the coolest movies ever made and they don't skimp on the violence do they. it is a great film  made with great improvement by a weird genius.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>I will admit to being a huge fan of Pulp Fiction from my first 10 minutes into the theater and getting yanked by my shirt colllar into the story and not being released until the final credit rolled. OK, so I'm biased.<p>BUT...it's not without well-earned bias. This movie easily qualified as an instant classic. The story is top notch, even though it comes in several different, smaller packages, Tarantino earns his directing stripes in effortlessly taking these seemingly random tales and believably weaving them all together. The acting/casting doesn't leave any stone unturned (It's Uma Thurman's best performance to date, Samuel Jackson WAS the best supporting actor winner that year, even if they didn't give him the trophy. Even Willis demonstrates some wicked acting chops in a beautifully understated performance. Christopher Walken, too, provides the most satisfying and memorable cameo!), and even the choppy editing style works. <p>Casual movie lovers will enjoy this as just a great film. Movie fanatics will love this DVD for the satisfying extras it provides. <p>Too good a DVD for you to pass up!</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction has often been hailed as one of the greatest films made-certainly one of the best in modern times (along with Fargo, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Star Wars trilogy). And it is easy to see why. Beside being a great film, it catapulted Tarantino into the public's eye, revived the dead career of John Travolta, introduced us to Tim Roth, reminded us of Harvey Keitel and Ving Rhames, gave us so many catch phrases, and ingrained itself into American pop culture. This is arguably Tarantino's best film (only Reservoir Dogs can compete with it) and after watching it, there is little room for doubt about the greatness of the film. As a film, volumes can be written on it, and I can't say enough of it here.<p>Now, on to the dvd... We've waited 10 years for a special edition. But has it been worth the wait? I think so. It is a 2 disc set, in an attractive slipcover case. Disc 1 contains the movie and an enhanced trivia track. No, there is not a commentary track, but the trivia track fills in (somewhat) nicely. I do wish Tarantino had chosen to include a commentary track. There is also a section called `Soundtrack Chapters.' Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction (or any Tarantino movie for that matter), knows how important music is to the film. This option allows you to jump to the various music selections in the film. Disc 2 contains deleted scenes, a behind the scenes montage (weak), a documentary ("Pulp Fiction: The Facts"), the Independent Spirit Awards (where Pulp Fiction won), the Palm d'Or Acceptance Speech, a production design featurette, Siskel and Ebert's "At the Movies" segment on the `Tarantino generation,' Tarantino's appearance on the Charlie Rose show, as well as trailers, tv spots, stills, and articles and reviews. And it is loaded with dvd-rom extras. The dvd was worth the wait (even without a commentary track), and it is finally nice to see dvd worthy of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is very surreal and amusing at the same time. I know this movie has been trashed by self-proclaimed moralists, but the film is a vivid reminder that the world  is not the way we want it to be.<p>John Travolta stole the spotlight; his  portrayal of Vincent Vega is, by far, the best work he's ever done. Samuel  Jackson was also great. I also enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer -- his  performance was quite impressive. I also enjoyed Uma Thurman and Rosanna  Arquette in their supporting roles.<p>I recommend Pulp Fiction. The acting,  the incredibly witty script, and the way it was put together is a piece of  work! This should be on everyone's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Let's start by saying most people think Quentin Tarentino is a genuis or a hack.  I feel closer towards the later.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick created the non-linear time movie with his masterpiece, The Killing.  The reason that it worked in that film was that Kubrick used this technique to simplify the storytelling.  He took each scene to its conclusion.  Then went to the next scene from the start even if it was before the conclusion of the last scene.<br /><br />In this film it is used as a way to cover a mediocre script and direction.  This film was not editted in time sequence.  The film jumps back and forth in time with no reason.  For example, there is a scene where one of the characters is killed and five minutes later he is alive again.  The reason why, who knows for sure.  The one thing is that most people who loved the film usually are talking about all the graphic violence not the plot.<br /><br />Critics hailed this film but most were not talking about the movie by the film maker.  This is another case of critics wanting to create a new star (and in their own way become the one who discovered him.)  This was one where they talked or wrote more about Tarantino and not the film.<br /><br />The one good thing in this film was a stellar performance by Samuel L Jackson.  He is one of those actors that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with and he once again shows his great talent. (But I would say don't waste your money on this if you are a fan of his there are many better films.)<br /><br />If you want to see a great action pact film with great style then get Kubrick's The Killing, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Make mine a Royale with Cheese. This is the big kahuna of mixing hitmen with high society (which is not always as pretty as it is made out to be). Yes, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson do marvelous jobs, which is especially interesting for Travolta as his early entry into being "bad" (his later entries were less convincing). Not to meantion Bruce Willis doing a smaller part that is also a bit of a departure for him -- a bad guy that wimps out but does the "right thing" (well, sorta). You get to see all sides -- cold-blooded business man, compassionate, woman-lover, deserter-turned-loyalist, sucker. The editing and sound are excellent (I also bought the soundtrack, but it includes too much dialog to be really enjoyable). I am always torn between "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" for the best in the genre. They are different just enough to almost be in separate categories, but if you like mobster like films, go with "Reservoir Dogs" and if you like more dark-side-of-high-society, go with "Pulp Fiction".</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Pulp Fiction was the movie to see in 1994!  A huge ensemble cast, insanely hilarious story(s), a killer soundtrack, and top notch direction from  Quentin Tarantino make this one of the best jaw-dropping films ever!  It's  hard to pick a favorite performance:  There's John Travolta's ultra-cool  (but not to smart when it comes to taking a dump at a potential hit's  apartment) Vincent Vega , way suave with the ladies and super responsible  to the end.  Or there's the scripture spouting, jerry-curl toting Samuel L.  Jackson, the voice of reason who always keeps his cool.  The tough as  nails, don't tread on me, boxer played by Bruce Willis.  The beautiful Uma  Thurman in a heart stopping performance.  Ving Rhames as the violated crime  boss.  Eric Stoltz as the hippy drug dealer.  Tim Roth as the small time  crook.  Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf (or is it Mr. Clean).  Tarantino himself  as a way too stressed, slur spewing owner of a garage and some really dorky  clothes.  <p>Extreme in its violence, outlandish in its performances, the  best part of the movie is in the dialogue alone.  Theological discussions  over murder or just a reason not to eat pork the magic in Pulp Fiction lies  in the script!  At least Tarantino wasn't gipped out at the Academy Awards  on that front.  A timeless  classic that is definitely not for the kiddies.  If you don't own the movie or the soundtrack you either weren't born when  this movie came out, aren't human, or have a serious lack of a social life.  A truly essential movie to add to your home collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>'Pulp Fiction' is and will always be remembered as one of the defining moments in cinema today.  Upon it's release it opened eyes and paved the way for films to come that will continue to draw from this masterpiece of a film, never being able to capture what made this so brilliant in the first place.  With his second film, follow up to 92's 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino solidified his Hollywood status as a brilliant director/writer.  The story behind 'Pulp Fiction' is one we've never seen, and one that will never be seen again, at least not to the original brilliance here.<br /><br />The film opens with a conversation between Pumpkin (Roth) and Honey Bunny (Plummer), lovers who are about to knock over a restaurant.  This whole film is about conversations, conversations that may or may not pertain to the events about to occur but which add depth to the characters you're watching on the screen.<br /><br />The next scene introduces us to hit men Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) as they are about to make a hit for mob-boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).  The conversation that ensues is fluent, natural and not what you'd expect.  It's called a brilliant script coupled with brilliant acting.  Besides being ordered to make this hit, Vincent has also been asked to tend to Marsallus's wife Mia (Thurman) while he's out of town on business.  After hearing that Marsellus is quite the jealous type (having just thrown a man from a five story building for allegedly rubbing Mia's feet) he's a bit edgy about tending to her needs while Marsellus is away.<br /><br />Marsellus is also taking care of some business with boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis), a prizefighter whom Marsellus has just paid to take the fall.  When Butch decides to renig, winning the match and attempting to split town with his girlfriend Fabieene (de Medeiros) Marsellus hires Vega to take him out.<br /><br />These three stories get interwoven in not so chronological order giving us three great stories that make one really awesome movie.  Uma is stunning and captivating, Travolta is o top of his game and Jackson is scene stealing in his best role ever.  Willis and Rhames feed off each other perfectly and add a side story that is both hilarious in it's own seriousness.  Great film most everyone can enjoy.  There's a reason this film is considered legendary!</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>I reviewed PULP FICTION a few months ago, but decided to review it again, to simply state that I absolutely love it.

The ending reveals this moment: the conversion of a bad man into a true prophet of God and not a false one who liked quoting Biblical verse before killing his mark, also the doom of this converted man's partner, a non-believer who continues on an evil path until he's struck down.<br /><br />You may remember early on that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are shot at from close range and the bullets seemingly pass through them without harm. Jackson correctly recognizes this as both Divine intervention and a message that if he doen't change his ways he will surely die. In the diner, Travolta dismisses this as bunk, goes on to try and "hit" Bruce Willis, a boxer who was supposed to take a dive but didn't, and ends up dead when Willis uses Travolta's own automatic weapon to shoot him down.<br /><br />If I were to put the film in correct order it would be:<br /><br />Travolta's and Jackson's recovery of a briefcase filled with who knows what, the early morning murder of two men who had the case and the miracle.<br /><br />The accidental killing of the third man in Jackson's car.<br /><br />The scene at Tarantino's house with "fixer" Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Jackson's revelation in the diner about becoming a righteous wanderer and Travolta's rejection of the miracle message, an act that seals his doom.<br /><br />The diner being robbed by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, with Jackson now demonstrating his newfound holiness: he lets them both live.<br /><br />Travolta's non-date with Uma Thurman that almost ends in her OD death.<br /><br />During this same evening, Bruce Willis wins a fight he's ordered to lose, then tries to escape the wrath of mob boss Ving Rhames.<br /><br />The next morning, Willis goes to his apartment where he recovers his wristwatch and kills Travolta.<br /><br />Immediately after, Willis encounters Rhames on the street; the two of them end up prisoners at a s&aacute;distic p&egrave;rv's gunshop.<br /><br />Their narrow escape from death here is the story's actual end. There's a grudging truce between Willis and Rhames, but Willis must leave town. Jackson has gone off to be a prophet, Travolta is dead.<br />.<br /><br />Supporting cast includes: Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney and the film's producer, Lawrence Bender.<br /><br />Trivia:<br />At the 1950s retro burger joint, Buddy Holly is played by Steve Buscemi.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>I watched this last night. Boy, was I amazed! Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film by Quentin Tarantino, who also made the entertaining Kill Bill movies.<br /><br />  SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br /> The story tells about a crime gang and their adventures. The first story is about one of the hitmen, Vincent, taking care of the boss's wife, Mia, while he's gone. [Mia is played by Uma Thurman, the same person who played The Bride in KB. She looks WAY different in this movie!] But, oops!

The film is filled with rich dialogue and performances.<br /><br />A neat 3 story line ingeniously woven into an unforgettable movie. John Travolta and Samuel Jackson became instant box office gold from their portrayals of two hit men in this film and Travolta's career went from almost nonexistent to top dog. Eric Stoltz portrayal of a stoner drug dealer is pitch perfect as is Rosanna Arquette as his wife. Bruce Willis as Butch the boxer is also in top form and Uma Thurman has never been better. The smaller character roles by Roth, Plummer, Keitel, Walken and Rhames are equally impressive and there isn't a false note in this ultra entertaining rollercoaster ride of a movie.<br /><br />Tarantino's sly use of tired story lines that he turns upside down is nothing short of genius! It's a film that needs to be seen several times to be fully understood. If you haven't seen it you have missed one of the best films of the last 20 years.<br /><br />The two discs set sports an excellent transfer and has a ton of great extras including commentary, on screen facts, excellent deleted scenes explained on screen by Tarantino, trailers, TV spots, Siskel & Ebert show devoted to Tarantino, Charlie Rose show devoted to Tarantino, on the set documentary, feature-ette, montages and the list goes on and on!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Roger Ebert once quoted on At the Movies (the episode covering Pulp Fiction is included on here) that Quentin Tarantino is the first movie director to be called a rock and roll star.  That's entirely true.  I really have never felt this passionate about a movie before, as well as Quentin Tarantino himself.  I will, and have, go to some lengths to defend.  Whether or not  Tarantino does or does not care about his fans, well, maybe he should tone down his quality in his movies if he doesn't want my exuberant praise (but I'll bet you anything he'll enjoy that notion).  It's your own fault, Tarantino!  While his other masterpiece, Reservoir Dogs is a bit more concise (and features monologues that are possibly better), Pulp Fiction is wild, never lets up, a bit more original (even though I don't like City on Fire, you got to give it credit for being a plot line).  And I love it! Not bad for a movie I thought would just be something I watch once then forget about it.<br /><br />Sure, Pulp Fiction sadly sometimes becomes the whipping boy of self-righetous, _________ film ________ who think they know everything (stupid ________), but those who love this movie know the other people are just too unfortunate to realize what an incredible movie this is.  Pulp Fiction, while not heavily stylized artistically (as in art direction), is first off, set in an arguably wonderland of crime-ridden LA.  That's all it needs to do, because Pulp Fiction takes no time in immersing you in the crime ridden world of Pulp Fiction.  As one critic noted (hey, I don't like critics but have no problem with the praise it gets), it's like entering a rabbit hole into LA, even moreso.  Your there in Jack Rabbit Slim's, chilling with Mia and Vincent, feeling the 50's "wax museum with a pulse". When Butch and Marsellus are being held captive by two really perverted dudes, your feeling (which is pretty wrong, props to Butch in the end) it with them (not exactly a good feeling, unless it's your fantasy or something.  Yeck).  You fall in love with your surroundings and the characters, not something that comes naturally for some movies.<br /><br />Some film buffs say that Tarantino's directing skills are a smorgasbord of "copied" camera techniques (like  even though this or this may not be true (but I really don't give a ______), I don't think the movie would be the same without them.  Besides, I've said before that Tarantino isn't the style master (David Fincher, Darren Afronsky, Tim Burton, and David Lynch for starters outwit him), but I still don't think there's single ordinary use of camera (well, maybe not).  His wide array of close up shots, tracking shots, and his knack for making facial expressions add to the characters believabiltiy really show that Tarantino knows how to direct.  Besides, True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn show (Natural Born Killers was his, but Oliver Stone did a lot to it, it probably did not even look like a Tarantino movie anymore) that Tarantino's scripts ebenfit when he directs them himself.  His vision comes to full force when he's behind the camera.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is one of my favorite and most memorable.  Admittaley, I'm not surprised that each Thurman, Jackson, and Travolta were just nominated.  I didn't like Forest Gump but I feel that Tom Hanks was more accomplished, Uma Thurman wasn't quite the best, and Jackson faced tough competition from Martin Laundua from Ed Wood (another great performance from a great movie from that year).  However, although Travolta and Jackson did not win giving the competition, the all star cast is still one for the ages.  John Travolta's sagging career got a great revival with his best role to date, and Thurman's classiness makes for a believable Mia Wallace.  Samuel L Jackson's performance as Jules is also his most memorable ever, his sheer bad@$$ery, along with some of eh most quotable lines, makes him one of the most imitated and well-loved characters in the Tarantino canon.  As a matter of fact, there's no dull moment with Jackson.  But that's not all, either!  Christopher Walken's spot on portrayal as a veteran is significant despite his low screen time, and Bruce Willis's cementation as a bad @$$ mother_______ (no doubt from movies like Die Hard) rocks as well.  The rest of the cast rule, from Tim Roth (finally dropping the annoying fake American accent),  Amanda Plummer, Harvey Kietel, Rosanna Arquette, and the paranoid stoner portrayed by Eric Stoltz.  Lance is particulary well portrayed.  He's so paranoid and his exaggerated actions (watching him freak out after Vince crahses into his house is hilarious) Heck, even Tarantino's character, Jimmy, is funny.  Tarantino's isnt' the greatest actor (he was really annoying in Death Proof), but he's not half as bad as some people make him out to be.<br /><br />The crowning jewel of Pulp Fiction is, of course, the dialogue.  _________ Coen Brothers (the single most overrated film-makers on the planet) wish they could write dialogue as good as this (Fargo?  Oh please), or dialogue that's even remotely entertaining.  While his other movies are worthy of mention, none of them is jam packed with this much dialogue.  While admittaley, some of the lines are not exactly super-cool one lienrs in the vein of such lines as "Rosebud", "I'm gonna Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse" or "You Talkin' To Me?", it transcends the one-liner notion.  Pulp FIction is the kind of movie where you quote whole bits of dialogue, with hardly any filler, and paying much attention to detail.  The characters themselves each talk in their own distinctive way, something that Roger Ebert himself noted.  Oh, and I've never as much fun swearing in my life in a Tarantino movie (because, I of course, talk along with the dialogue).<br /><br />Oh, and it probably has one of the best compilation soundtracks I've ever heard, but you probably already know that.  The soundtrack is used in the best way possible, and the movie itself doesn't benefit for a score, silence falls when needed, and the right music captures the right mood of the movie perfectly, whatever mood it's in.  Some of the dances are iconic, as well as the instant classic twist scene, as you all know of.  But many moments are highlighted and burned into your mind with the music tracks. From the theme of Misirlou and Jungle Boogie, Son of A Preacher Man, and the extensive use of Surf Rider at the end of the movie, these songs gain meaning when used in the movie (as well as any Tarantino movie), and add a hell of a lot to it.  The soundtrack proves that music beyond traditional film scores can, and do, highlight and create the exact same thing that traditinal film scores do so well.  It's not just meaning to be witty, it's just Tarantino's way of using music and what he chooses.  No wonder Paul Thomas Anderson creates so many scenes with popular music (I think they have a healthy rivarly, regarding the two).<br /><br />There are some petty criticisms for me, as the movie does fall a bit in the Gold Watch Segment,(especially during the pointless sex scene between Butch and Fabianne), but come on, the criticism were in one ________ sentence!  The two disc set is amazingly good, with a bevy of features and interesting articles (Roger Ebert especially).  It's all you wanted to know about such a well-made, fun movie.But anyway, Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and what I mean by masterpiece is it's done by a master, in a masterful way, and I _________ mean that _______________!  Needless to say, Pulp Fiction deserves to be much higher than in the 90's on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, among the other established "classics" on that list.  That, and even higher in the IMDB list (Only 5?  Come On!).<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>If somebody pointed a gun at me and said,"You gotta have an opinion -about what the best movie of the 90s is" I'd tell them to point that gun away from my head before it accidently goes off. And then for lack of a better answer to this impossible question, I would answer PULP FICTION. In anycase, anyone crazy enough to point a gun at somebody while asking their opinion about what the best movie of the 90s is might not like other answers I might come up with as much.<br /><br />I think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store. There are no flaws in it. It's perfect. Quentin Tarantino cannot ever top it and will probably never even come close. When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION. His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. All of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the "f" word and the "n" word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. There is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work.<br /><br />Tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. It's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time.<br /><br />The dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the Bible readings that SAMUEL L. JACKSON quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner.<br /><br />UMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA. The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like Marilyn Monroe, Ed Sullivan and Mamie Van Doren doing their stuff while platters are served. They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.<br /><br />It's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a "cleaner-upper" who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. His brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. They don't call this "pulp fiction" for nothing!! Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.<br /><br />Summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I will admit I loved this film, and didn't originally buy it for myself - but I'm definitely keeping it now! But what I don't see is why it's considered such a cult. (Sorry) Maybe I'm not seeing it. I did see similarities with Trainspotting, with all the drug taking, and Quentin Tarantino had a certain je ne sais pourquoi about his directing. I loved how when he was first introducing characters, he only showed them from behind, and all you could see was hair (Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames - or no hair in his case).<br /><br />When the film first started, I was feeling a bit iffy about it all. And then the soundtrack kicked it. It's amazing how you've never seen a movie before (honest) but you know it instantly about the soundtrack! And then the film really kicked off, and I found myself enjoying it. And it has some great music in it (guess what I'll be getting next?) I found myself humming along to "Let's Get Together" by Marvin Gaye (mainly cos it was used in another movie, Down To You), so I definitely think this soundtrack will be great.<br /><br />My favourite bit in the whole film was Uma Thurman's joke. I'm sorry, I really like corny jokes!!! I was in fits throughout the rest of the film - it should really have been shown more towards at the end of the movie, cos I'm sure I missed a good bit after the joke was told! I was literally crying afterwards! For anyone who missed it, or hasn't seen the movie: <p>Three tomatoes are walking down the street. Daddy Tomato, Mummy Tomato, and Baby Tomato. Baby Tomato is lagging behind, so Daddy Tomato goes back, squishes him, and tells him to "ketchup"! <p>I'll never hear the word "ketchup" in the same way again. I think my main problem was I kept seeing the image in my head. It's such a funny image. <p>The person I was most shocked to see in this movie was Bruce Willis! Why didn't anyone tell me he was in this before? I definitely would have seen it long ago! He was quite sexy in it, apart from where he was first introduced - he never moved a muscle, and looked a real hard nut. But he became more gentle and tender when his girlfriend was introduced, and the way he acts towards her will make any girl go weak at the knees! He was definitely a cutie in this. <p>The most memorable moment from the whole film (apart from Bruce Willis coming out of the shower - HELLO he moved too fast, you nearly get a glimpse of something! Will need to watch that slower) is the moment that is always shown in TV shows etc, publicising this movie. It's what I know it for, and that's the tiny dance segment between John Travolta and Uma Thurman. Funny how Uma shakes her pretty black bob a lot during this, but it there's never a hair out of place - tell me that was a wig!<br />Towards the end it does get a bit confusing, but thankfully, unlike some other films, it does tie all the loose ends up, and you're satisfied at the end. <p>Definitely a must-see, although try and replace Johnny Boy with the guy he was in Grease. I may have to watch it a few more times before I consider it a cult.</p></br></body></html>

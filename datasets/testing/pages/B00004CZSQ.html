She chose the celebrated Tamm Academy of Freiborg.  One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy Airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 10:40 PM, local time."<p>So begins a journey that the American girl would never have anticipated in her wildest dreams.  A student, Patty Newman, is seen leaving the in the pouring rain scared...  That is nothing compared to the gruesome manner of her death at her girlfriend's flat.  It ends with the painted ceiling glass bulging out and shattering towards the foyer, followed by Patty's garrotted, bloody body crashing downward from a worm's eye view.  Exquisite!  Bulging is also used in Inferno when the body of Mark's fellow student crashes down in front of him.<p>Suzy is the only likeable character here.  She is pretty, shy, humble, but most important of all, she is intelligent and intuitive, which helps her during her stay.  And Jessica Harper makes her a credible unique person the viewer roots for.<p>Alida Valli is also effective as the forbidding Miss Tanner, a typical supervisor-type Guardian.  1940's star Joan Bennett (Madame Blanc) is a more tempered Guardian, but nevertheless gives the presence that she is in charge.  I don't know who plays the fat piggy-eyed servant.  The character, who plays a semi-important role here, seems to have been raised on ugly pills all her life.<p>This movie if anything, is representative of Dario Argento's wild use of lights.  Red and blue are the key colours here.  The exterior of the academy is red, as are the carpeted panels in the hallways.  My favorite use of red is when the girls are in the practice hall, converted to a makeshift dormitory.  The hall is bathed in a hellish red glare.  The shape of the directress behind Suzy and Sarah is nothing compared to the guttural, asthmatic snores emanating from that mysterious personage.  Creepy with a capital creep!  Red is also the colour of blood, and there is a lot of that here, as well as the wine Suzy has to drink during her restricted diet.<p>Blue light is seen when Ms. Tanner marches up the attic to find out where the maggots are coming from.  The creatures fall down through ceiling cracks and into dorm rooms, causing mass hysteria among the girls.  Suzy freaks out, but that's nothing compared to the reaction of the other girls.  Pandemonium, to say the least.  The way Argento stages their emergence is unexpected and gradual.<p>And Goblin's wild and weird score of screams, insanely pounding drums, guitars, echoing hisses of "witch" and of course sighs (Suspiria is Italian for sigh) might as well mirror Argento's perverse mind.<p>Suspiria is more a triumph of design and suspense rather than logic (e.g. why kill Daniel the pianist?), and it's important to remember that in order to enjoy this stunning film.  American and British horror have nothing on this masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>While shopping for horror dvds, my favorite store had a sale on a bunch of movies. I picked this one up and it sounded like a great film. The movie starts off in a rain storm and in a creepy home. Then a murder which Entertainment Weekly called the most vicious murder scene ever filmed. Ive seen alot of films and I didnt think it was vicious. Then the movie kinda of drags on from there. It has a good atmosphere but never really delivers the goods. It was alright but I probably never will watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I think it's fair to begin with saying "Suspiria" usually counts as the best work of Dario Argento. I wouldn't agree actually, not because I don't like it but because I have other personal best. But anyway whatever other Argento's film is your favourite, you'll have to admit "Suspiria" is a tremendous achievement on all levels.<br /><br />As Argento says himself many directors use their dreams for their story-lines and for the visual expression of their movies. And Dario admits he uses his nightmares for this purpose. I never had a chance to get into Argento's head and see what nightmares he's having, but they are definately very morbid and at the same time extremely picturesque. Although his films have obvious plots which are quite realistic, Argento manages to wind some surreal and dreamy details into them. And it makes his works truly an unforgetable experience. I won't concentrate on "Suspiria" plot-line, because everyone who wanted already knows what it's about. But as in most of Argento's movies here it's "how" that's more important, not "what".<br /><br />The whole ballet-school in "Suspiria" looks so surreal though pretty realistic. The setting reminds of old German expressionist features like "Cabinet of Doctor Caligari", only in color. All those colorful and twisted interiors look improbable yet still realistic. If you look close enough you'll notice the door knobs are placed rather high giving an impression that school-girls, who look about 18-19 y.o. in reality, are ten years younger. This antinomy invokes strange feelings, and in a documentary dedicated to the film Argento reveals couple of other secrets about creating his atmosphere of unease and irreality. Acting and music add a lot to it, I think Goblin's mesmerizing soundtrack for "Suspiria" is one of the most memorable in movie history. Even if you are not a horror-film aficionado, you're going to like "Suspiria" because it's a real piece of art, taking any aspect of cinematography. And if you are a fan of horror and Dario Argento in particular, I'd like to say "Suspiria" Anchor Bay 3-disc limited edition is your best choice. It has explicit "Suspiria 25th anniversary" documentary, trailers, posters and still gallery, cast and crew filmographies and biographies, 32-page color booklet, and what's important - CD containing Goblin's OST for "Suspiria". This edition is now OOP, but I'm sure you'll find a way to get it if you really need it.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>In 1977 SUSPIRIA was considered an extremely violent film; in the wake of the slasher genre, however, the violence involved seems less horrific than you might expect. What continues to work, however, is the look with which director Argento endows the film, particularly in regard to the set designs, camera set-ups, and use of color. Visually speaking, this is an amazingly beautiful film, with Art Nouveau designs, deceptively simple cinematography, and washes of intensely artificial color that dazzle with intensity. Even in the midst of its horrors it is almost impossible to take your eyes from the film, such is its strange beauty.<p>The cast is equally strange. Leads Jessica Harper and Stefania Casini are very typical of 1970s ingenues, but they each have a quality that sets them slightly apart from the young actresses of the time. Barbara Magnolfi makes an impression as Olga, one of the school's students, as does Susanna Javicoli as a harsh instructor. Even Udo Kier, cult star of Andy Warhol's FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA puts in an appearance. But oddest of all is Hollywood's Joan Bennett, who gives a truly flawless turn as the seemingly lady-like and ultra-respectable Madame Blanc.<p>Less successful is the story itself, which is so slight as to be almost incidental. Young dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has enrolled in a famous Italian ballet school--and upon her arrival finds another student fleeing the school in hysterics, a student who is not long after murdered in a horrifically brutal way. Odd incidents follow, and when Suzy's classmate and friend Sara (Stefania Casini) goes missing, Suzy begins to piece together the truth.<p>Another flaw, at least to my mind, is the soundtrack. While it has been widely admired, I can think of few film soundtracks that are quite as heavy-handed in their dynamics as SUSPIRIA. That aside, and while the film has considerable creepiness, it isn't frightening per se. In the final analysis, this is a film which I think is best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it. Recommended, but rent it first.<p>--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>I felt two stars was harsh so I give it three, although that's being rather kind. Before I watched "Suspiria" I had read a lot of things about it-- how good it is, how scary. Well, it wasn't. At least not for me. To some people this may be a frightening and effective horror film. Loud, annoying music and the overuse of vivid colors do not make a brilliant horror movie.<br /><br />This tale of an American girl arriving at a European ballet academy and discovering its sinister secrets is interestingly and strangely executed but it may leave viewers perplexed and nonplussed. (As it did me!) The best thing in this film is the first murder. It's truly over the top and operatic. But the film overall lacks a lot in substance, scares and story. For example: Maggots? What was the point of that, plotwise? There was none. And I had to stifle giggles when I saw the bat on a string, and when I heard the headmistress snoring. Not scary. I know "Suspiria" has many admirers. But maybe they saw the movie without hearing all the grandiose hype beforehand.<br /><br />So I would suggest that it's worth renting to see this film that is on so many of the 'Greatest Horror Movies' lists. You may find yourself, like I was, wondering where the real horror was. Personally I'd rather watch a truly scary 1970's horror movie like "Black Christmas" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />Much of this movie comes off as truly laughable, unfortunately. I don't think that was the intention.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The only thing scarier than the first ninety minutes of this movie are the last ten! Suspiria is a film that I have been holding back on for some time now. The first reason is that I believed it could not live up to the hype. The second is that I have been recently disappointed by some of Dario Argento's latest works. I picked up the guts to go and watch it and this movie was sheer hell for me from start to finish. I was behind the sofa for most of it, howling. I am a grown man and I screamed and screamed! Grown men are not supposed to do that now are they?<p>Suspiria looks stunning and is only second best in terms of look to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond which has much better camerawork - however the set design, color and use of lighting in Suspiria are world class achievements in cinematography and motion picture strategy. The premise is a simple one. Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American ballerina who heads to Germany to attend dance school. When she gets there she witnesses another girl running away from the school and overhears her saying something in the process. These words are important and she remembers them later in the last moments of the film. The running girl ends up staying in her friend's house and both are murdered in what has to be the most visually brutal slaughter yet committed to celluloid. That sequence alone is worth the ticket here. Back in the school more murders take place and Bannion tries to figure out what is the mystery behind the school and the deaths that are occurring there. At its bible sized hole in the heart, Suspiria is a murder mystery and you are left guessing as to what is what and who is who. There are several very scary sequences in this film and Argento manages to pull off a stunt with a blind man and his guide dog that right comes out of the blue. This film was non-stop horror entertainment from start to finish with a whooping ending to boot. My God what a finish! That was a sheer nerve-wrecking experience. <p>The whole film is one big payoff. The music is dead-on, one hundred percent accurate for this type of movie (and you can be damn sure that there is only ONE movie of this type!). It plays itself out like some kind of kid's fairytale-come-nightmare. Suspiria almost seems like a Tim Burton movie that is instead in the hands of raving sadistic maniac who knows how to make you jump and soil your pants twenty times over. If you watch this film with other people you will hear plenty word's around you to the gist of - "My God, I've just had ANOTHER accident."<p>Suspiria is NOT a gore / splatter fest like most of the other works from Argento. Yes, Suspiria does have gore and plenty of blood, but this movie is damn near the scariest films I have ever witnessed and I have seen literally hundreds in this genre. <p>This is a perfect horror film to "susperience?!"</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>SUSPIRIA<br /><br />(Italy - 1977)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Technovision)<br />Theatrical soundtrack: 4-track stereo<br /><br />In a short essay which accompanies Anchor Bay's special three-disc edition of Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA, Travis Crawford offers the following observation: "For the small minority who may be experiencing the full-throttle sensory assault of Dario Argento's...horror masterpiece SUSPIRIA for the first time...I envy your innocence." As it turns out, Travis' envy is wholly misplaced. It breaks my heart to say it, but Anchor Bay's disc - prepared under the auspices of Lucasfilm's much-vaunted THX program - is one of the biggest disappointments in the short history of DVD.<br /><br />Of the four soundtracks on the disc which I was able to access through my my 5.1 audio equipment (I'm not DTS-equipped), only the French version - in lowly 2.0 surround - has anything like the kind of sonic impact which Argento originally intended. Several layers of music on all the others, including the Dolby Digital EX track, have been mixed so low that they might just as well not be there at all! Crank up the audio as much as you like, but it won't make a blind bit of difference...<br /><br />My main point of reference has always been the (in)famous double-assault which takes place near the beginning of the film, one of the most genuinely frightening set-pieces in movie history. But much of the scene's effectiveness depends heavily on Goblin's deafening music score, which adds electric guitars (I'm assuming that's what they are) to a soundtrack filled with drums and screaming vocals. Here, several vital musical elements sound like they're buried under tons of cotton wool, completely diluting the overall effect. Just LISTEN to the difference in the French version, where the soundtrack has a depth and clarity which explodes out of your speakers like the Crack of Doom!<br /><br />But even this sounds a little muffled beside the old Image laserdisc (released in the late 1980s), which featured a -literally! - room-shaking surround track, providing a level of reference that Anchor Bay's DVD doesn't even begin to approach. Strangely, AB's disc is also missing a number of significant music cues, sound effects and (apparently) some stray lines of dialogue which all appeared in the laserdisc edition.<br /><br />Two things add insult to injury: First, the DVD's picture quality is ABSOLUTELY SUPERB - Anchor Bay has delivered an utterly stunning print of the film, and the Technovision frame is perfectly preserved on this anamorphic (2.35:1) disc. Secondly, there are dozens of reviews all over the Internet which praise the DVD's soundtrack for its strength and vitality, presumably written by people who are largely unfamiliar with the way it SHOULD sound. Frankly, their enthusiasm is completely baffling! Listening to the old laserdisc over this DVD is akin to having an obstruction suddenly removed from your ears - the difference is obvious and immediate. Perhaps the DTS version is better, I don't know, but the Dolby tracks are extremely poor and should never have been allowed onto the disc in this condition. What on earth were the guys at THX listening to when they approved this appalling travesty?!<br /><br />Simply put, this disc represents only half the movie that Dario Argento intended you to experience. And if you ARE seeing the film for the first time and you think it sounds OK - believe me, you ain't heard nothing yet!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>SUSPIRIA is indeed a hyper-colorful, dreamy, horror tale. The first time I saw it I was overwhelmed by it's beautiful sets, hypnotic music, and vicious assault sequences. It took several viewings for my mind to focus on the actual storyline! I love it. Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at a prestigious ballet school in Germany, just in time to see a former student fleeing from the place. Suzy hears a few of the girl's parting words before she disappears into the stormy night. These words return later as keys to the entire mystery that Suzy finds herself involved in. The girl ends up butchered by a figure with a big knife, that just might not be human. The victims in this movie are all people who have seen / heard too much. They are a danger to the secret within the academy. We all know it's a coven of witches, but Argento goes all out to make it as bizarre and as interesting as possible. The "maggot invasion" and "room of coiled wires" scenes are especially memorable. Joan Bennett (Dark Shadows) is cold and enigmatic as Madame Blanc. Alida Valli is supremely menacing as Miss Tanner. I got the distinct impression that she could easily have been the she-wolf of the SS in her younger days! SUSPIRIA is a movie to be seen many times. I notice something different every time I watch it. For instance, check out the killer's fingernails in the "open-heart surgery" murder near the beginning. Also, look at the "wine" Suzy dumps in the sink, it's pretty thick doncha think?? SUSPIRIA belongs in the upper level of supernatural horror films, right next to THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. A masterpiece of terror and suspense...</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Genuine chills and gore aplenty from shock-meister Dario Argento, "Suspiria" is anything but subtle, with some obvious dubbing work likely to cause some opening nervous chuckles. But you won't be laughing for long, as initial eeriness quickly segues to scenes of sheer terror. Not recommended for kids.  An ideal Halloween movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Considered one of Dario Argento's best, most suspenseful and most beautiful films. Suzy Bannon [Jessica Harper] arrives in Munich to attend one of the foremost dance academies in the world. But the dance academy has a dark past, a history of dabbling in the black arts, and some of the students think the teachers may still be involved in these nefarious activities. Suzy is the antidote to the evil that has seeped into the school over the centuries, but it will take skill and determination to pierce the innermost walls and secrets of the school. With its over-the-top Art Nouveau sets and Argento's signature use of primary colors, Suspiria is like being a voyeur is someone else's nightmare.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary edition contains two discs of additional material which will be of interest to any Argento fan; those who are not fanatical about Suspiria will enjoy the less expensive, more readily available standard release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>When I first read the reviews about "Suspiria", I knew that I had to watch it.  Many of the reviews are quite right about this flick as it is quite stylish and definitely unique.  Argento does a terrific job presenting the audience with a different kind of horror that is largely based on atmosphere and the supernatural element of pure evil.  With a creepy soundtrack, loud colors and an eerily weird storyline/plot, "Suspiria" delivers a solid horror viewing experience.<br /><br />As many have suggested, Argento's plot are rather thin and poorly developed.  Argento seems to play on the strange storyline and the audience sees a lot of flamboyance and stylish scenes that sometimes don't make a lot of sense.  Indeed, it is somewhat hard to follow, but that is part of Argento's genius that his plots are always overshadowed by stylish scenes and an eerie atmosphere, yet his movies are still effective at producing horror.<br /><br />The color used in "Suspiria" is so wild and flamboyant, the viewer becomes mesmerized in the dark world that is "Suspiria".  The basic plot involves a young American woman who has travelled abroad to enroll in a ballet dancing school.  However, this is no ordinary dance studio, in fact, this is a witches's coven with a very dark and sinister character.<br /><br />***BEWARE SPOILERS*** (read this part after viewing the movie)<br /><br />The beginning of "Suspiria" is quite scary as the audience observes a couple of the most graphic and horrifying death scenes in the history of horror cinema.  This scene is very scary and disturbing to some as this young lady is brutally murdered.  Unlike many directors and modern horror movies alike, Argento always succeeds as using blood and gore as an incidental mechanism to increase horror in the audience, and not as his only means of producing horror.  In other words, Argento does not use blood and gore as his only vehicle to create horror, but it is the setting, suspense, the situation, the story and the horrifying atmosphere that Argento employs that are actually scary.  Consequently, the killing in and of itself is a lot scarier in this movie than it would be without the dreamlike atmosphere and tension build-up that Argento uses to effectuate horror.  Therefore, when the violence, blood and gore actually occur, there is already a foundation for the horror upon which the kill scenes work to magnify and/or accentuate, solidify and finalize such horror.  A perfect example of this would be the bathroom scene towards the beginning of the movie when a girl is killed by a witch or some creature as it came through the bathroom window.  This scene in "Suspiria" is a perfect example of how Argento presents a horrifying death scene that was preceded by building tension, ascending atmosphere, and horrifying suspense.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />From this point, the movie centers on the experiences of the young American lady named Suzy Banyon, who eventually becomes quite suspicious of the "goings on" of this dance school.  After a friend of Suzy disappears, Suzy becomes determined to find out what is going on behind the scenes of this dance school.  Ultimately, Suzy discovers a world of evil, darkness and horror that she could not have possibly imagined.  The ending is very good when Suzy confronts the master or head witch and realizes the sinister nature that lies within the walls of the so called dance academy.<br /><br />In general, the acting is pretty good although I thought Jessica Harper's was dubiously adequate at times.  The directing is very good, especially at presenting a unique and horrifying atmospheric experience for the audience.  Argento's scary mixture of a dreamlike and nightmare-like atmosphere is very effective at creating a solid basis from which horror can be derived.  The make-up, special effects and gore are very good for a flick made in the 1970's, and even now, remains unrivaled to a large degree.<br /><br />Argento's "Suspiria" is not for everyone and only die-hard horror movie fans like myself will be able to appreciate its brilliance.  That being said, there is no question that Argento's stress on style in "Suspiria" overshadows a weakly developed and poorly structured plot.  However, strangely enough, this is part of Suspiria's charm.  In fact, one could argue that the audience is thrown into a world of chaos in "Suspiria" and that this chaos in and of itself produces more horror than something that supposedly "makes sense".<br /><br />Watching "Suspiria" is like being hypnotized by a beautiful yet horrifying nightmare.  In short, "Suspiria" is one of the best flicks the horror movie genre has to offer and is a must own for all serious horror movie lovers.  Like a fine wine, "Suspiria" gets better and better with age and after repeated viewings.  I highly recommend "Suspiria" as one of the scariest movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Let's give credit where credit is due.  Suspiria has beautiful colours, fantastic camera work, and a nice transfer. It ends there.  The basic plot and appalling acting let the film down.  As for the horror scenes - well, let's remember that it was made in 1977 and the horror scenes would have frightened audiences then - the R rating was fitting for the time.  Times have changed, and audiences expect more of horror films.<p>DVD SUMMARY:<br />If you are like me, and heard so much about Suspiria, you will want to see it to satisfy your own curiosity.  Aside from the bad points regarding the acting and plot, I am pleased to tell you that Anchor Bay have delivered a STUNNING print of this movie on DVD.  It's so pristine that it's hard to believe it was filmed in 1977.  Everything about the print deserves 10 out of 10.  It should be reference for how to restore an old film.  I have the Single Disc edition DVD, which is probably the best version to buy if you haven't seen the film.  You still get the same version shown on the 3-disc, and some extras (but not the documentary), and also the DTS soundtrack.  <p>Suspiria is a difficult DVD movie to find to rent, so if you are interested in seeing it, just buy the single edition DVD (it's cheaper).  Despite the fact that I don't really love the movie, I am still glad to own it because of the camera work and colours - as well as the excellent DVD transfer.  Nothing can quite prepare you for the incredible restoration work that Anchor Bay have done.  Bravo Anchor Bay.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>a influential horror classic. while the acting is atrocious, this is one of the most visually surreal films i have ever seen. the colors, sets and camera work all combine with a dizzying effect of unease and sheer "creepiness"- there isnt another word for it. this film is just plain creepy, and so good!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Argento's skill lies in visuals, not storytelling, and that's never been more apparent than in Suspiria: the film's characters all talk like 8 year-olds (Argento wrote the script for younger characters and never changed it) and there's no real mystery whatsoever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Suspiria has a very ominous beginning, and great musical score that is not only slightly scary, and used throughout as foreshadowing, but also appropriate for the plot and main character: Suzie, a ballerina traveling from NY to Germany for a dancing scholarship.  Upon arrival to her new academy she encounters an eerie, gruesome murder of a recently expelled student.  Soon thereafter she falls understandably ill after seeing an anonymous, hideous looking woman (picture the offspring of Capt. Lou Albano and an Eastern European bearded-lady carnival worker) who looks after the schoolmaster's creepy, Little Boy Blue nephew.<br /><br />Essentially, the movie breaks down as a mystery; the killer, cause, and source of evil is completely unknown and secretive until the final suspenseful moment.  It's psychotic and seductive, a true horror tale that leaves the exposition as minimal as possible and saturates the senses with prolonged action and climaxes.<br /><br />This is where Argento's reputation is well deserved.  While the story and acting are average, the framing of colors and shadows are wonderful contrasts that can't be avoided; they simply grab a viewer's attention.  The camera angles and scenery are stupendous, with soul piercing close-ups and epic, wide-angle work, each scene is framed with a deliberateness that works perfectly.  At one point a shadow is so masterfully filmed during a chase scene that it appears to be the tormentor or evil entity that seems to be ever-so-elusive in Argento movies.  Brilliant.<br /><br />For those who want to jump into Argento, learn from my mistake and begin with Suspiria; because, Inferno is not where you need to begin.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>American, Susie Banion, has just started at the prestigious Tam Dance Academy in Switzerland, but something isn't quite right. On the day she arrives, one of her fellow pupils is murdered, and in the weeks that follow a number of strange occurrences happen. Could it be that the dance academy is really run by a coven of witches? Why would a coven of witches even want to run a dance academy in the first place?<br /><br />Along with Dario Argento's previous film, "Deep Red", "Suspiria" is considered to one of Argento's masterpieces. I recently watched both films, one after the other, and in my opinion, although "Deep Red" has the better plot ("Suspiria" is barely coherent at times), visually, "Suspiria" is the better film. Dario Argento is renowned for making some of the most visually stunning horror movies of all time (this man can make a gory murder a thing of beauty) and in "Suspiria" he has some of the most visually stylish shots of his career and of any film that I have ever seen. "Suspiria" also has a chilling score, written by the Goblins, that perfectly sets the scene and is my favourite score of all time.<br /><br />"Suspiria" is the first film in Argento's "The Three Mothers" trilogy, the second film being "Inferno", and the third film being the recently released "Mother of Tears", which was made 30 years after "Suspiria".</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>The premise as most know a girl Suzy Banyon, an American ballet dancer arrives at a well known European dance academy run by mysterious teachers where nothing is as it seems.  As Suzy arrives at night in a horrible thunder and lightening storm a girl is leaving in a frenzy yelling a secret into the night, what follows is as Entertainment Weekly calls "the most vicious murder scene ever filmed".<br /><br />Director Dario Argento "paints" an effective horror story, he puts relatable people in relatable situations so we can buy into his film.  Then very cleverly has dreamlike sets bursting with colors, we as viewers subconsciously know something isn't right and I believe this use of color subtly keeps us on edge.  Even the title of the film, What is Suspiria?  I googled it to find it is a film by Dario Argento, so even the title has us subconsciously unsure going in.  Although I could be wrong on that.  Then add an unrelenting, nerve wracking, and haunting score by Goblin (one of the most effective I've experienced).

I'm speaking these words after watching &quot;Suspiria,&quot; one of the most frightening and terrifying horror movies ever made. Created by Italian director Dario Argento, the movie manages to be menacing and gory at the same time, and Argento fills his canvas with a vast array of vivid yet bizarre colors, eerie lighting and camera techniques, and a soundtrack to top all horror soundtracks. In short, this is one hell of a scary movie! <p>The plot is a basic one, more of a vehicle for Argento's explorative imagination. It begins with a storm, as young Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to attend ballet school. Argento wastes no time in creating a sense of unease, from her cab ride to the school, as she watches the colors of street lights in the pouring rain, to the gruesome and outright malicious murder of a runaway student. All of this happens within the first ten minutes, which should be a message of what lies ahead (in other words, be prepared). <p>The movie then takes us to the school itself, a dazzling array of vivid colors and elaborate set pieces that put the house in Robert Wise's &quot;The Haunting&quot; to shame. Susy is shown the many rooms and introduced to the staff and students, though discovers that she will be rooming off campus. That is, until she begins to get suspicious about strange occurrences, and the staff relocates her to the premises. Her suspicions mount higher, and she begins to wonder if there isn't more to the ladies that run the academy. <p>You may find yourself forgetting the plot behind all of this mayhem, but that's perfectly reasonable, given the fact that Argento seems to be more interested in attacking our minds than provoking them. And he succeeds in doing just that, taking us into the darkest depths of horror with his adept use of gore, bursting colors, camera movements and creepy sounds from all around. <p>This is extremely unsettling stuff here, some of the most elaborate yet unbearable set pieces ever constructed for a film. The beginning murder sequence is a true shocker, one that we see coming, but never in such a gruesome manner. Other sequences involve a blind man being attacked by his own seeing-eye dog, multiple stabbings, a girl's corpse coming back to life... it never stops. <p>But it all works due to Argento's ability to get under our skin before shocking us out of it. Before each scene of brutality, there is a wonderful buildup of suspense and terror, because even though we know what's going to happen, we're totally in the dark as to how it will occur. He keeps us waiting impatiently by employing a slowly building soundtrack, heightened by slow camera movements that center on the faces of the person involved. <p>&quot;Suspiria&quot; will remain in the memory long after its first viewing; in fact, you may never forget it. It stands out as a visionary masterpiece, one for the senses and the mind, a horror film that transcends the boundaries of the genre. I was intrigued by every minute of this film, which keeps you in the moment long after it's already passed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>This is one i had to watch twice to experience all it has to offer. Surreal is a good description with a good body count for those of us who like our horror horrific. My first Argento movie, at least uncut Argento and the one that sparked my interest in Italian horror. The sound and picture quality of the DVD is excellant. I have the single disc version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>On the plus side, I liked the overall creepiness; the music by The Goblins (which helped in a big way to bring about that creepiness); and the many unsettling and scary individual scenes throughout the movie.  I'm just not sure how well the whole thing held together as a coherent, satisfying story.  But the movie is at least worth a look, especially with the good job Anchor Bay did in sprucing it up for a new generation of movie fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>Stunningly photographed and outlandishly set-designed, SUSPIRIA has an opulence and elegance that you don't normally find in a slasher horror film. Its predominately female cast and a virtual lack of sex and nudity are also quite unusual in films of this type. Yes, it does have a few horrific murder scenes that would have gotten the film an X rating (this Anchor Bay DVD is unrated and uncut). But the majority of the film takes the "high road" in horror film-making -- rather than drenching you with blood and guts and wall-to-wall violence, it stirs up creepy atmosphere, builds up suspense, and punctuates them with shocks that are created with originality and brilliance.<p>The DVD's THX-certified video transfer is SUPER, with sharp picture, rich colors, and fine details. The Dolby Digital and DTS English surround soundtracks are clean and strong, but channel separations are sometimes quirky. There are no subtitles of any language. But it does have English closed captioning. <p>Anchor Bay released 60,000 copies of the 3-disc Limited Edition, which includes a second DVD of a new 52-minute documentary, and a music CD of the movie's music soundtrack. The documentary is essentially a collection of interviews of the cast and crew, who talk about the conception of the film ("Snow White" was an inspiration), the score, the style of the film, and their favorite scenes and anecdotes. The first disc contains the other extras: 2 trailers, 3 radio spots, 1 TV spot, about 100 stills, a music video of the movie's theme music performed by Daemonia, and bios of the director, writer, and star. There is also a 30-page DVD booklet containing an essay on the film and an interview with star Jessica Harper. Also included are replicas of eight of the production stills.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Suspiria,&quot; directed by Dario Argento, tells the story of a young American woman who goes to study at a ballet school in Europe.  But a gruesome murder early in the film indicates that horror lurks behind the school's elegant facade.  More horrors unfold before the true nature of the school is revealed.<p>I must admit that while a lot of hype seems to surround this film, I didn't find it to be as shocking or horrifying as I expected--perhaps the passage of time and my experience of more shocking films made after it has blunted its impact as a work of pure horror.  For me the enduring power, pleasure, and importance of &quot;Suspiria&quot; lie in its blend of visual and musical style.  Virtually every frame of the film--including the goriest and most violent scenes--is a lovingly crafted work of art.  Set design, costumes, etc. all come together to enhance Argento's brilliant use of color, shadow, shapes, and visual motifs.  At his best Argento creates an enchanting poetry of sadistic violence.  This visual genius is marvelously enhanced by Goblin's creepy, bold musical score--it's music that at times relentlessly assaults the listener. <p>&quot;Suspiria&quot; has been given a lavish treatment in this 3-disc DVD edition, complete with a wonderful booklet about the film.  Disc 2 contains a well-made documentary that commemorates the film's 25th anniversary.  It features interviews with the film's stars (Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, and the marvelous Udo Kier), director Argento, the musicians who created the unforgettable score, and other key behind-the-scenes creative talents.  Disc 3 is a CD of the score.  It's a total package that really enhanced my appreciation and enjoyment of this remarkable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I've read a lot of rave reviews of this classic film by Italian filmmaker Dario Argento. And I bought this 2-disc special edition at the mall recently, simply because of its reputation. After all, Entertainment Weekly rated this film #18 out of the top 25 scariest movies of all time, and said it had "the most vicious murder scene ever filmed." But just like a lot of the other so called horror "classics", I feel that this film is a bit overrated. Not to say that this is actual "bad" film, but what exactly separates this film from all the others? Its certainly don't think its the story. Though the main plot isn't bad, there's nothing real special about it. The story is about an American dancer who arrives at an European dance school and has odd occurrences begin to happen to her, including disappearances/murders of fellow students. Later she finds out that the school is simply a front for a coven of witches who practice a diabolical black magic. Again, not bad for a story, but nothing amazing about it either. The acting is not terrible; Jessica Parker does a decent job with the lead role as the American dancer, but there are really no stellar performances here. Now, as far as the "most vicious murder scene ever filmed" that happens just minutes into the film, I gotta say I was somewhat disappointed in it. It wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected, and the blood look a bit fake (it was too bright). Nevertheless, the scene was done pretty well, with some good suspense. With this opening scene, the film did fool me a bit. I thought it was going to be more of a slasher film than anything, but turns out, its not. The special effects weren't nothing great, again, my biggest complaint was the blood being way too bright in color. As well as the body count being fairly low, which I suppose really has nothing to do with this type of film since it isn't a slasher film or anything, but thats something that I do look at when rating horror/thriller films. Now as far as the strong point in the film, its got to be the atmosphere, lighting, and overall mood of the movie. This is something that Argento did exceptionally well. The soundtrack to the film is creepy and dark, the unconventional lighting, mostly bright red and blue, are really good as well as some great camera angles. But I feel that in some parts of the film where the story bogs down a bit, the mood and atmosphere try to carry the movie by itself, which really doesn't work. Yes, I think the overall feel of a movie is very important, but there has to be some substance to it as well. And I just feel that the overall story doesn't match intensity with the mood at most times. Again, like I said before, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, believe me. But I'm not sure why this film is so highly praised by some people. Perhaps after a couple of more viewings, I'll see what some of you are talking about. Meanwhile, I do recommend watching this movie to any horror fanatic, however, I would suggest to watch it before you buy, unless you find it fairly cheap to purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Dario Argento is the German version of Alfred Hitchcock.  *Suspiria* is one of the best horror/thriller films that I've seen, even though it was made in the 70's.<br /><br />Susy is a young American dancer who has flown to Germany to attend one of the best ballet schools in the world.  Upon arrival in a dark stormy night, Susy immediately faces drama at the door.  A young woman opens the front door and shouts something back and disappears...only to be murdered later.<br /><br />Almost right at the beginning, Susy doesn't feel right at the school.  She's fainting, getting nosebleeds and hearing strange noises outside her room.  She isn't the only one...another dancer hears them as well.<br /><br />All of this is building up for a surprise ending.  If you really pay attention throughout the movie, you could probably guess what the surprise is.<br /><br />I love the props, especially the wallpapers, and the lighting throughout the movie.  They were really eye catching.  I have a feeling that the wallpapers inspired *Lucky Number Slevin* because the same thing is seen in this movie.<br /><br />Anyways, I liked *Suspiria* even though some parts can be a little corny.

Stylish, atmospheric, with a memorable score by Goblin, but ultimately, there's very little story, which becomes a major hindrance when the bloody murders and the suspenseful build-up to them aren't present. Acting's subpar, too, but it seems a bit frivolous to mention that.

As with all Argnto's films there is a good deal of unneeded blood and graphic scene's to keep you woundering why the hell you are watching this. The story developes very slowly so by the climax you really have lost intrest and you watch it to see what happens almost out of obligation.<br />Over rated and dim witted this film leaves a bad taste and an even worse memory.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>and FLUNKS!

Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD. <p>And scary ... Not At All.

It seems even a new generation of horror fans seem to think they aren't a real genre pro if they don't like this film. So, it is about a ballet school run by Beulah Ballbreaker. Tacky late 70's overkill on the colors, looks like Willy Wonka meets Liquid Sky. Take away the colors and sets, and what do you have? A long, boring film. I am afraid I will have to discredit any reviewer who includes this as the greatest film ever made. This film is to horror movies, what American Idol  is to the indie music scene, a total annoyance. Run for your life if you come across a person who says this the greatest film, they haven't a clue what they are talking about...if you come across a website citing this as the best horror film, click exit and keep searching for new sites. I know a lot about Italian cinema, yes I am a Lucio Fulci fan. So I know this just doesn't stand up to all the praise.

This movie is very good. I like it. If you are interested in Horror cinema or just visually intriguing films in general you need to check this out. All right then, on with the specifics.<p>The plot is easily summarized. Suzy Bannion is an American ballet student in Germany. There a bad goings-ons at the academy and she must investigate and defeat the evil to survive blah blah blah.  None of that really matters. Even the staunchest defenders of this film often admit that the plot/script/dialogue are not particularly inspired, and frequently kinda lame. I tend to agree with this belief, but as I said before, it doesn't really matter. However, contrary to what many people say, I didn't find this film to be the least bit confusing. I'll admit that not necessarily everything that occurs makes a whole lot of sense, and that some things are shown which are not terribly vital to the plot, but it's hardly difficult to follow. The acting isn't so great either, with the protagonists coming off a bit flat much of the time, and the antagonists overdoing it, particularly the whacky Miss Tanner, whose got a weird female concentration camp commandant thing going on.(or maybe I'm thinking of Madame Blanc, I get the names confused. If you see it you'll know who I'm talking about.) Still, it's a masterpiece visually.<p>When people talk about this movie they almost invariably describe it as being nightmareish. I don't really care for this description, because it exaggerates the surreality of the film. Visually, it isn't hyper-abnormal, it's really just surreal enough to seem just beyond the bounds of reality, so that nothing in the film seems quite real. This is particularly effective in the Academy itself, which mixes stately, classical looking architecture with extremely garish and tacky, extremely 70s-ish decoration. The night/horror scenes are all the more effective, with natural coloring being essentially abandoned, with everything then being bathed in eerie colored lighting.  The two most prominent colors are blue and red, with a smattering of green now and then. On the whole it is startlingly eerie, and can add immense power and atmosphere to scenes where essentially nothing happens. A good example of this comes when they are forced to sleep out in the ballroom due maggot infestation.(which is itself an example of a creepy thing that happens that has nothing to do with anything)  Nothing really happens here, but it's bathed in an intense, absolutely hellish red light which gives it immense power. To accompany these visuals is the much-hyped score by Goblin.  It is extremely effective, though occasionally weakened by the odd cheesy synth line. It's mostly eerie keyboard lines playing menacing, repetitious melodies, thunderous percussion and random, rumbling bass overlaid with demonic voices whispering and howling.  It also gets points for sounding like actual music, rather than the auditory exclamation points that most horror films provide you with.  Despite all this, this movie isn't all that scary, but it's pretty eerie and atmospheric, and is just damn cool.<p>The film suffers slightly from starting off too well, so it's unable to maintain it's level of excellence, and suffers from a rather anti-climatic ending. Still, the opening scenes of the film are absolutely great.  Suzy's arrival in Germany during a fierce storm sets the tone for the film, and establishes most of the visual motifs.  It is perhaps the most surreal portion of the movie, with the heavy rain obscuring most everything, and particularly random seeming uses of lighting.(The weird forest they pass through is especially cool)  The first murder scene, which is early in the film, is easily the best of the horror set-pieces.  Although it isn't really all that gory it's a truly brutal scene and ends with some genuinely horrific imagery.(I'll admit that the effects are dated, but they still work very well in this scene, imo)  The other horror scenes are reminiscent of the first, indoors, with the use of phony looking set decoration and colored lighting, with one exception.  It takes place out in the open, and the normal colors are abandoned, instead opting for utter blackness and plain white and grey coloring on the surrounding, neo-classical architecture.  It's also got some great, Leone-esque staging and camera work, as it drags the scene out as long as dramatically possible, alternating between extreme long-shots and extreme close-ups. It's a great scene (other than some dated gore) which is made all the more effective by how it contrasts with the rest of the film.(I should mention that despite the supernatural trappings of the film, the killings are generally done manually, with slasher-esque staging and methods. This film has witches, but they ain't much like what you usually see.)  As I said before, the ending isn't so great. It's a bit abrupt, and doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before, but just re-iterates old motifs in an inferior manner, and suffers from some bad acting on the part of the main antagonist.(Well, now that I think about it, it does have one great scare, which is unexpected and unlike what we've seen before, but overall it's just not nearly as good) Also, there's a scene with a bat which is unintentionally funny. That bat's just so damn adorable.<p>Well that's about it. Some flaws, but it's a horror masterpiece anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Suspiria is one of the horror classics that seems to divide horror fans; some cite Suspiria as a masterpiece of the genre and one of the greatest horror movies ever made, while others see it as boring and nowhere near the hype it has gotten. And at first I was one of those who would state it as boring and over hyped. Upon my first viewing I was like this is the classic Argento movie people hail as one of the greats? At the time I wasn't really into Argento. While I didn't dislike him I can't say I was a fan.<br /><br />But than I went back and gave his films another chance and suddenly found myself loving these movies I originally thought were about average. So I figured might as well give Suspiria another chance; and watching it the 2nd time I hoped my opinion would change, but I still expected the absolute worst. But my 2nd viewing I just fell in love with this movie and now I'm one of those people who praise it as a masterpiece of the horror genre.<br /><br />Dario Argento has a very strong visual style and more often than not the plot takes a backseat to his visual style and I understood that going into this film and all his others. But for some reason I just couldn't get into his work where as now you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger fan of Argento than me. I would recommend to anyone out there who didn't like Suspiria to give it another chance. If you still dislike it than maybe it's just not for you, but I know besides myself a lot of people disliked Suspiria at first and now love the movie. Suspiria really is one of those movies that gets better and better on multiple viewings.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi and if you were to find any flaws with Suspiria this would be it. While not badly written at all the script is the only weak point of the film. I always mention in my reviews for Argento movies that he at times can be a good writer. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red had very solid scripts and even though I thought The Cat o' Nine Tails was about average the script wasn't bad. The only problem though is in my opinion Argento has never written a really iconic character even in his better scripts. Around the time of Suspiria is when the writing took a backseat to his visual style and use of colors.<br /><br />The script wasn't bad, but just suffers from weak characters; while I wouldn't say the characters are bad or anything they do lack of depth and aren't fully developed, but oddly enough I'd rate Suzy Bannion played by Jessica Harper as one of Argento's better characters despite any lack of depth. The script does mostly work, but this is the kind of movie that without the right director would be a boring disaster of a flick. Sometimes you have movies that while aren't poorly written or anything like that, but could be very boring.<br /><br />As director Dario Argento crafts a masterpiece of a film; the opening act is downright chilling and after that Suspiria does slightly slow down, but Argento's visual style keeps Suspiria creepy and interesting even if it's a bit slow. The use of colors in this movie is just simply amazing. Suspiria just might be the best looking movie I have ever seen, but you can actually make a case for several Argento movies, but Suspiria just might be the best. The look of Suspiria is very much like a nightmare and that is something most Argento movies have going for it. It's also like this twisted fairy tale and all these elements are what elevate Suspiria to a classic of the genre. The best way to describe Suspiria is it's like a nightmare that may not make a whole lot of sense, but is quite chilling.<br /><br />There is so much that goes into directing besides simply storytelling. Granted that is the most important aspect, but there is more to it than that. Dario Argento may not be the best storyteller in the case that his flicks sometimes have a weak plot and maybe characters that lack a little depth, but what he might lack in that area he more than makes up for with suspense, tension and plenty of scares. And again I go back to Dario's visual style, which is what makes him stand out so much and again that is what makes Suspiria so brilliant. As I stated before the opening act is downright chilling and while the movie might slightly slow down it never loses the eerie feeling. The visual aspect and use of colors are the most amazing I have ever seen. Again Suspiria is simply a beautiful movie to look at.<br /><br />Another thing Suspiria has going for it is the score by Goblin; these guys are just amazing and have worked with Argento several times and Claudio Simonetti of Goblin has worked with Argento on almost all his movies and he's probably my favorite composer of all time. The score by Goblin is just mind-blowing and their score adds so much to the movie and makes it downright chilling! It's really hard to say, which score by Goblin is their best these guys have done such great work with Argento and with other filmmakers as well, but in the case of Suspiria, well this could easily be rated as their best score.<br /><br />As I stated earlier in my review if you've seen Suspiria and didn't like it give it another chance and if your opinion doesn't change than the movie just isn't for you. But Suspiria is a movie that might take a couple of viewings; many fans of this movie disliked it at first and like I said I was one of those people as well. Forget the plot and all that and watch Suspiria for its visuals and you might just start to like it.<br /><br />Suspiria in my opinion is a classic horror flick and deserves all the hype it gets. Many hail this as Dario Argento's best flick and while I understand why I'm not sure I would rate this as my favorite by him, but no doubt it's in my top 5 and in my top 20 favorite horror flicks of all time. For those new to Dario Argento I would recommend you check out his work in order; this way you can see how he evolved as a filmmaker. Suspiria is a movie you'll love or hate, but I urge people who disliked this to give it another chance and if you still dislike it that's fine, but Suspiria is very much a movie that takes more than one viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>WOW!!!  Talk about flirting with disaster!!  So, clearly I'm not an Argento-phile.  The pig I alluded to would be the film "Suspiria".  The lipstick is Dario Argento's visual style.  What I ended up with was a very visually appealing film that could have been 20 minutes long and still not have been nearly as interesting as the hype.  I can clearly hear your cries of protest and disbelief; "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MORON!!!  Believe me, I've been here before.  I'm use to it.  You would present as evidence of my suspect intelligence, approval of films like "Hatchet" and "Slugs".  Yet, I have watched this movie twice and a half and have recently watched four other Argento "classics", some of which I enjoyed to a certain degree.  So armed, I will endeavor to explain why this film didn't do it for me on a complete level (yea, this is serious stuff!!!).<br /><br />-THE PROVERBIAL PIG.<br />Of course, the "pig" in "Suspiria" is the story.  Everybody who loves this film, including the amazon.com reviewer up there, willfully dismisses the admittedly convoluted story as extraneous to the brilliance of this film.  I guess I'm screwy because I think that idea is just appalling.  Let me qualify this by saying that I am a professional artist.  I have knowledge of most of the visual arts including photography.  I'm a visual person by nature.  Yet, the visual experience in "Suspiria" was not enough for me to give the bloated and shallow story a free pass.  I understand surrealism and the attempt at a nightmarish atmosphere.  Though visually achieving these goals, the story was not given nearly the same attention to detail and thus suffered. Since my first Argento film (Tenebre) my opinion of Argento's story telling has been that he's "clumsy".After watching several other Argento films, that opinion has been greatly reinforced.  Not surprisingly, I felt the story could not match the drama of the visual experience.  My bad for expecting the Director to at least find a way to keep things moving.  The result is that I spent a lot of time waiting for something to happen... ...ANYTHING!<br /><br />-THE LIPSTICK.<br />There is just too much to say about the visual nature of this film.  Given the time it was made, it is slightly rough around the edges yet visually alluring.  From what I can tell, Argento basically invented the now clich&eacute; use of red and blue lighting to elicit a creepy feel.  Heck, I use that same lighting on my Halloween displays at home to great effect.  However, the images in "Suspiria" are more than just lighting tricks.  He clearly intended to use the primary colors with a few tertiary colors as a palate for everything in this film.  This would include bold paint schemes for the architecture.  Speaking of architecture, as an artist, I love the building locations Argento chooses for his films.  So many classic styles are on display. I almost felt I was watching a documentary on early 20th century design styles. I particularly enjoyed the Art Nouveau interiors of the dance school.  Add this to Argento's love for the creative shot and you have visual heaven.  My favorite shot in this film puts all the elements together as we look through a light bulb; beautiful.  Clearly I enjoyed the visual experience of "Suspiria".  To deny that would just be... ...pigheaded.<br /><br />-LIPSTICK PART II<br />I'm not sure how many people realize this, and it might be a key to why so many are wowed by "Suspiria" on a visual level, but this film was the very last film ever to use the "Technicolor" dye transfer process.  This highly stable process insures long term quality of color and a highly saturated color palate. Given these two advantages, this DVD and the film in general, have eye popping colors on top of the bold palate Argento employed.  Though Technicolor was not as realistic a depiction of color as other film, it actually added to the surreal quality of the visuals in "Suspiria".<br /><br />-ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSIC SCORES.<br />See, I'm not a total loser!  I thought this music was incredible and on the cutting edge of where music was going at the time.  There are two main themes that get played over and over again, and I have to admit, I kept anticipating them eagerly.  Since this film was made when I started High School, I was much more into the music trends of the day.  This music greatly anticipates the "New Wave" African rhythm trends of the late 70s and early 1980s that Peter Gabriel so fervently promoted.  I happen to be an old Gabriel fan so this sat well with me.  The music is simultaneously very intense and sublime while heightening a sense of dread and anticipation.  The problem occurs when not much usually happens in the story to accompany the music.<br /><br />-SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH PIGS!?<br />I have no problem with pigs in general, even when used as a metaphor for a screenplay.  Heck, I love "Evil Dead II" and that has the loosest of story threads bordering on nonexistent.  But I love evil dead because it's off the wall and wildly entertaining.  I'd kiss that pig any day.  My troubles with the "Suspiria" story are lack of dynamic or interesting developments.  Now here is where many put up the red flag and say "you miss the point".  Of course I would argue that I didn't.  I've heard explanations of Suspiria's story that go kind of like this:<br /><br />"...things happen which don't always make sense or get explained, and things move slowly.  But this adds to the surreal, nightmarish experience of "Suspiria"."<br /><br />I agree with two of those points.  As far as the nightmarish experience, I'm not feeling it.  Oh, visually and musically this film has "creepy" and "nightmarish" written all over it.  However, more often than not, there is nothing going on in the story to make me feel that way.  Often, defense of the bloated story sounds like excuses to me.  This is a story that could be told around a campfire in 20 minutes.  I don't mean to oversell my dissatisfaction with this film.  I didn't hate it.  But when the most brutal and frightening moment in the film occurs in the first 15 minutes, everything else is a bit of a letdown.  Ultimately, it was the lack of fear or dread compounded by overwrought attention to mundane action that bored me with "Suspiria".<br /><br />-FLAP, FLAP, SCREAM, WAVE, FLAP, FLAP...<br />To further the lack of scariness, a few very silly and unintentionally funny scenes appear in "Suspiria".  One involves what might be the worst fake dog head ever.  Other things about that scene are funny too, but I've said enough.  The other is a scene with a bat that highlights why this film lacked the proper ingredients for me to bestow greatness upon it.  In this scene, a character is attacked by a little, fat, motorized bat.  Now, this sounds funny enough, but there is more.  Said bat attacks for what seems like 5 minutes.  All the while, his victim waives arms and screams with little conviction while standing in one spot.  Finally, the bat flies off into the corner and apparently tries to flush the toilet.  I'm kind of joking because I'm not sure what the little bugger was doing.  Finally he decides to attack from the ground; "hump, hump, hump", he thumps towards the still stationary victim.  It ends quite beautifully but I won't elaborate.  Unfortunately, I laughed very hard at this stuff.  Immediately after this diabolical bat attack, the mood of the film was completely moot to me.  Nothing happens after that to make up for a complete lack of dread or fear on my part.  It just wasn't good enough.<br /><br />-IT'S SCARY BEING ME.<br />Sorry Argento-philes; the story here is just too uneventful for me to bestow greatness on "Suspiria".  The film does a lot of things in a great way but the overall story lacked the required substance to keep me on edge.  Not even the glorious visuals in Technicolor combined with one of the best soundtracks ever in a horror film could make me sit on the edge of my seat or scare me for that matter.  I will admit that the second viewing was better than the first, so thank goodness I deferred reviewing after one look.  However, the enhanced enjoyment wasn't because the film got better in my eyes; it was because I knew to pay more attention to the visual and musical aspects than to invest effort into the story.  Yet, all the coolness of image and sound could not overcome the hype of how scary this movie is supposed to be.  A little bit edgy?  Okay.  But without a flowing, eventful, scary story, this film will always be incomplete to me.<br /><br />Visuals....5 Stars<br />Music......5 Stars<br />Acting.....3.5 Stars<br />Story......2 Stars<br /><br />Average....3.88 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This film is utterly amazing to look at.  Dario Argento was a master at these kind of films from 1975 to 1987.  During that time, he made 6 films, several of which are masterpieces.  This is his signature film, the only that he will always be known for.  It's a worthy film to be known for.  It's one of the most terrifying films you'll ever see.  Seeing it letterboxed on DVD is the 2nd best way to see it.  I would love to see it in a theater (it was shot in 2.35:1).  It was shot on 3 strip Technicolor stock, which is why the colors are so vibrant and startling.  It was one of the last films to be shot on the old Technicolor stock (the same stock used for The Wizard of Oz).  The film's plot really doesn't make a lick of sense, but the visuals are utterly amazing.  Most of Argento's films have the same plots.  An English/American artist of some kind goes to Italy and gets involved in a murder mystery.  But his visuals overpower his stale plots.  The music by Goblin (who scored several Argento works) is one of the most amazing soundtracks in film history.  Argento made a few more masterpieces after this (Inferno and Phenomena), but this was his peak, and he's never come close to repeating or surpassing it.  This is a masterpiece...</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This flick is completely lost on me.  Lugubrious plotting with an ocassional shocking scene to enliven the proceedings.  Even these scenes that were meant to shock are tedious and amateurish.  I'd give this flick one star but it was too boring for me to truly hate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>The way to enjoy Suspiria as a horror film is to put aside all consideration of logic and drama.  For above all else, Dario Argento is a weaver of visual palettes married to blatant scores, and in that area he  has no peer in the horror-film genre. Even if George A. Romero is an  infinitely better director of actors, editor and writer; even if John  Carpenter is subtler -- Argento surpasses them all in imagery, composition  and lighting, and Suspiria is his masterpiece in that regard.<p>Much has  been made of the film's use of outdated stock and wild colour schemes and  that still stands.  Suspiria is one of the few films willing to abandon  reality almost entirely.  There's no physical reason why this room is blue  and one spot by the bed is red...but why not?  Suspiria is a horror show,  and its merits lie not in the construct as a whole (the writing is very  shaky and the narrative even worse), but in key sequences of almost  delirious power.<p>It helps that Jessica Harper gives what may be the best  performance in an Argento film to date (Daria Nicolodi in Tenebrae and Asia  Argento in Trauma come close), saying little but expressing much with her  face and mannerisms.  The Goblin score proves the power of rhythms and  motifs within a film score (instead of the boring classical film scores  coupled with Carpenterian &quot;stingers&quot; in most '90s horror films)  and is entirely horrifying.  And the set pieces -- a room filled with  barbed wire; the famous maggot storm; the seeing-eye dog plaza sequence;  the incredibly vicious stabbing on the ceiling; the final destruction --  are breathtaking.<p>Get past the bad performances (Harper excluded) and  terrible writing (dialogue *and* plotting), and just absorb this film with  your senses.  Suspiria is a sensory experience, and on that department it  carries enormous power.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>this movie is so powerful and hypnotic that i find it hard to imagine exaggerating it's importance to the horror genre and film as a whole.  although i was appalled by the violence in it and have trouble understanding people who like argento's work solely for the brutal and repugnant scenes of misogyny and over the top murder, every other aspect of this movie was damn near perfect.  it something of a puzzle, truly a paradox and a fascinating one to reflect on:something i can't quite articulate about it prevents it from being an empty exercise in style and gives it substance, be it not of an intellectual or moral kind. if you describe this movie to most people they will shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;sounds like a cheesy, stupid horror movie.&quot; and indeed the plot sounds so absurd (a dance school run by a coven of witches), that before seeing the movie we would probably think this ourselves after being told about the plot. but when you actually experience it, there is something incredibly effective and absolutely unforgettable about it, and the earnest viewer cannot doubt after one viewing that argento is nothing less than a horror movie genius in the league of tobe hooper or alfred hitchcock. a terrifying and utterly engrossing plunge into the world of the imagination and the supernatural, this movie has a surreal and otherworldly beauty that simply defies description.  argento is the ETA Hoffmann of horror films in that he can come up with the most ludicrous and laugh out loud plots and somehow allow us, through the sheer magic and overwhelming atmosphere of fear and terror, to suspend our disbelief and critical intelligence and lose ourselves in the movie.  susy banyon is a none too bright or extaordinary but strong willed and talented young woman (jessica harper's performance is a bit one dimensional and doe eyed but still memorable) who transfers to a prestigious dance school in another country and slowly discovers the terrible truth about the academy she has so eagerly decided to attend. i personally couldn't take my eyes off it from the opening scene in the airport to the last sequence where susy has an unfortunate encounter with 'mater suspiriorum'.  the soundtrack is in itself a classic and fits perfectly with the movie, and provides a perfect compliment to the dreamlike, multi colored glow of the academy's interior.  this movie is so frightening and eerie that it made a friend who i introduced to it, a film student, very uncomfortable and as i could immediately tell after about half an hour, just plain scared. this is not only a must see but an absolute necessity, not to be rented but to be bought and bought fast.  argento's later work is a joy to the horror/surrealism fan as well, but this is undeniably his best movie and the masterpiece on which his cult following rests.  the best movie he made next to &quot;suspiria&quot;, i feel, is &quot;inferno&quot;, which is a sequel (of sorts) to the latter in that it deals with &quot;the three mothers&quot; and their power over the world.  in both movies, although &quot;inferno&quot; is clearly the lesser, argento creates captivating and dreamlike world of terror and malevolent forces secretly working against unsuspecting victims who are unlucky enough to accidentally gain knowledge or awareness of these not very kind women.  buy both movies, and see all of his work.  this guy's stuff should be known to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Dario Argento clearly originates from the Hitchcockian school of suspense. In typical Argento fashion the characters and plot are all but ignored in his effort but it seems difficult to imagine why his films seem of such high quality. There is not a better director with regards to camera angles and lighting that I have ever seen, it is no wonder he writes all of his own screenplays. His films do not need dialogue or deep character development because it simply isn't what he sets out to do. Argento intrigues you and allows you to trust a film and then is willing to completely shift it's direction just to scare you. The plush colors and impossible camera angles that consistently make you wonder how the hell he got up there to get that incredible shot are what make Argento's films great and clearly his own.<p>Susperia is Argento's masterwork. Albeit, Tenabrae and Inferno are also both done very well, this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and not enough people have seen it. Argento's style is accentuated in this film and he is free to do whatever he wants visually because of the broad script he works with here. The film is like any nightmare you have had that sticks with you for most of the day. I have no question that may be where Argento gets some of his bizarre ideas. The beginning of the film simply shows a girl walking through a thunder shower and the way the scene is filmed and the music is placed makes you realize just how good Argento is at creating suspense in a scene that would normally be filmed with far less attention. Another thing that makes Susperia a great horror movie is the soundtrack, a soundtrack in which I would argue is more frightening than both Halloween and The Omen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great horror (there are few great films in that genre), although Argento's style is often difficult to appreciate at first to those accustomed to conventional film work.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Dario Argento's Suspiria has been called the horror auteur's best film, alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KRNG4U">Deep Red</a>. The first film in his "Three Mothers" trilogy and the last film to be processed in Technicolor, Suspiria showed Argento moving in a slightly different direction from the giallo subgenre. Suspiria is not a murder mystery nor is it technically a giallo, although many of the defining elements are present. Suspiria is more supernatural than any of his previous films and includes one of his most legendary death scenes.<br /><br />Filmed in English, the film stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon, an American who leaves New York to attend a prestigious ballet school in Germany. When Suzy arrives, she sees a young girl fleeing the school and Suzy herself is denied entry into the school. After Suzy leaves, the girl returns only to be brutally murdered in one of the most lauded death scenes ever filmed. It deserves the praise, as it's well-staged, well-shot, and quite memorable. Once Suzy returns the academy she meets Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), one of the instructors and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the headmistress. There's talk of a mysterious directress who's apparently "traveling abroad." As bizarre events occur (a seeing eye dog attacking people, maggot infestation, etc.) and bodies pile up, Suzy finds that something more sinister may be happening at the school.<br /><br />Suspiria is a slow build, despite that first death scene occurring only a few minutes into the film. I didn't find the film boring, but I could see why some viewer's do. The pace does lag and it doesn't jump right into the "mystery" of the story like Deep Red did in its opening scene. Argento co-wrote the script with his then-girlfriend and Deep Red star Daria Nicolodi. The script, apparently based on "true" stories told to Nicolodi by her grandmother, is possibly the weakest element of the film, with tacky dialogue marred even further by unconvincing delivery. With lines like "I once read that names which begin with the letter `s' are the names of snakes (hiss)," the actors can hardly be blamed for not sounding thrilled.<br /><br />On that note; many of the European actors weren't comfortable with the English language and their lines were dubbed. The dubbing is noticeable, but as annoying as it could be due to Argento's stylistic ability.<br /><br />Suspiria does have masterful set design and cinematography. The sets (the school in particular) are wonderful. The school is beautifully colored and exquisitely crafted, looking more like an elaborate painting than movie architecture. The cinematography by Luciano Tovoli is splendid and rather complicated. Tovoli works with constantly changing light and effortlessly makes the colors onscreen seem either vibrant or frightening.<br /><br />Goblin, with the assistant of Argento, delivers a brilliantly creepy musical score that compliments each scene and has become almost as famous as the film itself.<br /><br />Despite all these brilliant qualities the film has, I didn't fall in love with it the way I fell in love with previous Argento efforts. It's commonly called Argento's masterpiece and a masterpiece of horror cinema, but it's got those who've seen it pretty divided...I think this is due to the script. People who like their horror quick and to the point will find things they like here, but the film does plod along. Those who call it a masterpiece and are devout lovers of this film likely factor the film's style and creativity into their opinion. Suspiria is a well made film of any genre and, as a horror film, it is a masterpiece. It's got creative, memorable, and suspenseful death scenes and, unlike most horror films, it's made by people who know what they're doing but the plot lacks a central hook and didn't draw me in completely.<br /><br />I won't remember the film for its plot, but for its style and imagery. Argento clearly possesses such a visual creativity he could've easily worked outside the horror genre and joined the ranks of Italian filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni. Since Argento found his calling in this genre, he did provide audiences with some of the best examples of horror filmmaking out there. Suspiria does prove, even more so than Deep Red did, that horror can be both beautiful and scary...It can be art. I don't believe Suspiria is Argento's masterpiece, but it should satisfy many horror fans and certainly fans of Argento. It really is an impressive effort of any genre.<br /><br />GRADE: B<br /><br />NOTE-The lack of subtitles on the DVD is maddening, as some of the dialogue (especially when whispered) is difficult to understand at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Like myself, many Dario Argento fans have long awaited the American release of "The Mother of Tears."  It is the third installment of the Three Mothers Trilogy.  (At the Toronto International Film Festival, Argento hinted at a fourth film, a prequel.)  The classic horror film, "Suspiria" is the first installment.  Before seeing "The Mother of Tears" for the first time, I wanted to revisit "Suspiria."<br /><br />  First, let me give you some history about the Three Mothers.  In the eleventh century, there were three sisters who were evil witches.  They traveled the world, accumulating great wealth and spreading death.  The oldest one (Mater Suspiriorum or the Mother of Sighs) was Helena Markos; she settled in Germany.  She established a school of witchcraft which the locals condemned.  Helena was killed.  Soon afterwards, the school began teaching ballet instead of witchcraft.<br /><br />  An American student, Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper of "Minority Report"), arrives at the ballet school.  The teachers, she soon discovers, are witches who are viciously murdering anyone, students and faculty, who offend them.<br /><br />  Critics and fans have hailed "Suspiria" as a masterpiece.  Allow me to quickly explain why it remains a favorite of mine.  "Suspiria" is the perfect movie to watch on Halloween.  It is spooky, creepy, and nightmarish.  Filmed in primary colors of blue and red, "Suspiria" has a nightmare quality.  It is obvious that Dario Argento was highly influenced by the Master of the Macabre, Italian film director Mario Bava.  The soundtrack, provided by Goblin, is positively eerie.  The death scenes are some of the most vicious I've ever seen.  The supporting cast is awesome.<br /><br />  Joan Bennett, who portrayed Madame Banc, was a treat to watch.  She is the veteran actress of the daytime soap, "Dark Shadows," which was the essence of gothic.  This soap opera had ghosts, witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural creatures of the occult world.  She was a perfect choice for portraying a witch.  The stern, masculine Alida Valli was the perfect choice for the intimidating Miss Tanner, another witch.  She was in Mario Bava's "Lisa and the Devil" and would later act in "Inferno," the sequel to "Suspiria."<br /><br />  While watching "Suspiria," the usage of telekinesis and the fiery climax reminded me of "Carrie."  Also, the witch conspiracy was reminiscent of "Rosemary's Baby."  Both movies are horror classics.  "Suspiria" is also a classic that is required viewing by all horror fans.  Every fan of Dario Argento has seen "Suspiria."  It was the movie that turned me into one of his biggest fans.  I recommend watching it again before seeing "Mother of Tears."</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I had wanted to see this movie forever, none of the local video stores carried it. The reviews and Bravo's reccommendations made me sure I would love this. I did not. The color and sets were amazing. The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Watching the American trailer to this made me laugh especially when the background speaker whispers the title to this film. For all I can see this film is not about plot...it's about experience. This is the opposite formula of American horror. As a matter of fact, Suspiria pretty much throws out the rules of cinema in favor of the logic of dreams...to put it bluntly, Suspiria is the definitive cinematic nightmare, a wildly colorful and dazzlingly stylish fun-house of blood and beauty. Take it seriously and you'll laugh. Take it too lightly and you'll be bored. It demands a degree of intelligence and sophistication from the viewer, but this does not mean that it necessarily follows any archetype, and it certainly should not be discredited for its lack of conventional movie wisdom. I read from lots of Argento's fans and critics alike attack his films for bad acting, but I would have to disagree, particularly in the case of Suspiria. All of the actors in this film are fine actors, and if their performances seem "dull" or "weak" it's because Argento instructed them that way,<br /><br />Suspiria is, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying films ever made. At times, I find my nightmares to be far more frightening than any horror movie or ghost story or strange noises in the middle of the night. However, fear is a far more subjective emotion that people give it credit for-witness the unbelievably extreme responses to 1999's The Blair Witch Project-and thus it's not fair to blast Suspiria based on whether or not it frightened you. On a personal note, One of my all time favorite horror film is Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street...yet it has NEVER scared me. Contrary to what American filmmakers profess, horror films are about much more than simply scaring an audience. Essentially they are just conventional dramas, pushed to the extreme in terms of visceral emotional response and, often times, the explicitness of onscreen content. Such a definition could and should be applied to Suspiria.<br /><br />The most popular theory about Suspiria is one shared by many critics and many fans, and that is that the film is a technical masterpiece...period. This is something with which I partially agree, AND vehemently disagree. First off, Suspiria definitely has an emotional component to it. It's not as present as in other popular horror films of its time-Halloween, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.-but its there. And while the plot gets criticized, its apparent "weakness" is crucial to the effectiveness' of the film; if the movie made sense; it wouldn't be scary at all! With all that having been said, I must admit that the strongest elements of Suspiria are its technical merits. In all honesty, this film is one of the best horror movies I've seen recently in regards to 1). Cinematography, 2). Musical editing 3. Camera movement, and 4. Framing and composition. The minutest details are splashed across the screen in Argento's wonderfully fanciful style, and the result is....SUSPIRIA. Watch it in the dark so the colors would get at you ten times more.<br /><br />Thanks to the horror crew that insisted this film to me which eventually turn out to be far better then my last film by this director. Now I need ya'll to Scream!</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Since I seem to be on an Italian horror kick, it's essential that I touch down on Dario Argento, and what better example than Suspiria.  In the much shunned subgenre of Italian horror, Dario Argento is one director who actually won the critics over a time or two.  You look on any top ten scary movie lists, you can bet Suspiria is on it.  This film isn't really frightening-in fact most people think it's stupid and/or corny- but it's certainly original.  The plot isn't much to brag about, this film is all about style.  I've always thought you could make a movie about anything and make it interesting if you presented it correctly.  Usually it's only the film snobs that pick up on the wild visual style Argento uses, but you certainly don't have to be a film snob to see it.  Alot of the people I suggest this to usually think it's boring and silly.  Granted these people aren't familiar with the genre and get scared to death by films like The House On Haunted Hill remake.  Sure, Suspiria has it's parts that  drag a bit, and the dubbing makes it sound corny(as usual), but all I can tell you is to view it with an open mind.  Go into it understanding that the Italians make horror films different from  American directors. And don't mistake different for dumb.  Argento's movies are pretty whacked out(in fact, he's pretty whacked out, check out his documentaries), and not all of them are masterpieces, but he's really got vision.  He's not a schlockmeister like his fellow countryman in Italian horror, Lucio Fulci(schlockmeister perhaps, but I love him to death), he's the kind of director that's likely to be studied in a film class.  He doesn't go for the all out gore attack like Fulci, but Argento's violence is certainly not for the squeamish.  The first murder scene in Suspiria is probably one of the most intense ever put on film.  I'll guarantee you everyone in the room will stop what they're doing to see it!  It may not have the Fulci gore, but it's got ten times more intensity.  I've rarely seen music used to such a great effect.  So, I'd definitely check this one out if you'd like to see Italian horror with an artsy edge.  In fact, you should see Suspiria just to say you've seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>Called the "Italian Hitchcock," Dario Argento has made some of the most memorable films I've ever seen. "Suspiria" is widely praised as his masterpiece, and it is a masterpiece in certain ways. It is full of all the things a horror film should have: Good shocks, an eerie musical score, exquisite lighting, and effective camera moves. Any director who's ever made a horror film knows that the camera has to become like the third character in a scene where two people are talking, and the music is the fourth. Creepy music and precise visuals make a horror film memorable. "Suspiria" has both, although the dubbed over dialogue (I still don't get why he does this, even if it is to avoid working with boom mics, having them drop into frame on accident or something) can get your bad attention, and the acting is somewhat subpar for the most part. But as a rule, horror films have never thrived on excellent performances ("Carrie" is an exception), so it doesn't truly matter. We have our final girl, who we care about, and the school that makes as an excellent backdrop for the film's terror.<p>The film centers around a dancer who has enrolled in a school of dancing somewhere in Italy probably. It is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by woods for what could be miles or merely a few hundred yards. Jessica Harper is our final girl and she fills the role nicely, using her wide eyes and girl next door looks to capture our sympathy as things happen to her. When she finds out that the school is actually a front for a witch's coven, all hell breaks loose, and she may be the only one with the brains and the information to end it all. That's pretty much it. There are too many surprises to really say much more. The film begins almost immediately, letting characterization come along for the ride instead of wasting a half hour of valuable time on introductions to all the dancers and teachers at the school.<p>The real stars of the film are the music and cinematography, which when combined make a truly atmospheric and freaky experience. Dario Argento's personal Goblin group composed the music for "Suspiria" and they are in their highest form. Their score is equally compelling and wicked. Argento's camerawork is some of the best he's done, using his lighting to fill in the gaps of what could have been a boring scene. It's a real joy to watch a film like this which takes so much delight in scaring the wits out of you. Argento has real style, and it shows.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>The Italian maestro of horror, Dario Argento's first installment of his "Three Mothers" trilogy begins with "SUSPIRIA" (1977); arguably the most beloved of his films in the 1970s. There has always been debate among his fan base whether this film or "Deep Red" is his masterpiece. Some say it should be "Tenebre". For me, I am still somewhat undecided. I like his psychological "giallos" as much a his occult films. Whatever you prefer, "Susperia" is a dark fairy tale that will forever be remembered in the journals of horror films.<br /><br />One dark, dank and stormy night, an American ballet dancer named Susie Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in a ballet school in Freiburg. This European ballet school is ran by a mysterious woman named Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). A number of mysterious deaths and horrific crimes begin to occur in the school shortly after her arrival. Apparently, they are linked to the school itself; while the area on which the school stands on has a relation to a certain "Black Queen", a practitioner of the dark arts of the occult and witchcraft.<br /><br />The film's plot is quite light when compared to "Deep Red" or even "Tenebre", but this fact doesn't make this film any less eerie or suspenseful. From the opening act the film exudes a dark and moody feel, Argento's magnificent eye for visuals are at its best. It took me at least two viewings to truly appreciate "Suspiria". The use of vibrant colors I've read became a revolutionary palette for the horror maestro, and to think that he used obsolete Technicolor film rolls to shoot his film.<br /><br />The first act of the film remains as one of the most memorable sequences in horror. The opening act's death scene is truly violent and very "artsy"; that it grabs the viewer by the throat just to let him know what he is in for. This is a familiar formula for Dario Argento, as displayed in "Tenebre" and "Deep Red". Most of his films display a shocking murder and/or death sequence as "shock value". The director really does know how to get under one's skin with an unnerving sensation. It is quite curious that Argento (with co-writer Daria Nicolodi) owes his inspiration for "Suspiria" from a Disney animation--"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". I've read that the film was originally intended to use a children's school as its backdrop but for reasons unknown to me, that idea was abandoned. (perhaps it would generate too much controversy?)<br /><br />"Suspiria" has a decent share of ominous atmosphere. Argento uses vibrant colors, intimidating and spooky architecture, the use of shadows, combined with Goblin's ominous music all contribute to the film's effectively creepy screenplay. The film also applies some lore from witchcraft and the occult as it takes a look at the mythology about witchcraft. Food does spoil a lot faster when it is within the confines of witches, at least according to legend. I do think the director has a certain curiosity about witches that led him to create one, if not the most involving tales about the subject. The scientific definition of the occult is also defined which adds to the film's credibility. Daria Nicolodi is to be credited for some of the film's creative inputs as she supposedly told Argento about her grandmother who had a similar experience in a school that practiced black magic. Whether this is fact or a rumor I would not know.<br /><br />The performances by the cast is quite decent but not entirely flawless. Jessica Harper does give a decent performance but I rather thought that she lacked some chemistry with Stefania Casini. Nonetheless, Argento is able to make this a very minor setback as he bombards the screen with his signature ingenious camerawork along with cinematographer Luciano Tovoli. I was in awe as to how the death of the blind piano player was set up. It was suspenseful and freaky, with great use of pans, reverse zooms, close-ups and moving shadows. Aside from the opening's death scene, this would be my favorite sequence in the film. Argento is a master of simple visual manipulation. I was a little disappointed that this installment had no nudity but I supposed it fit the film's pace. There are quite a few gruesome scenes carefully placed in the film's proceedings.  "Suspiria" has definite Giallo influences in its opening marks just before it goes into overdrive.<br /><br />Dario Argento may have more style in his supernatural films. His Giallos and his occult films are like apples and oranges, they`re both good but can`t be compared. Regardless, however you may feel about "Suspiria", whether this is your first Argento film or you're a big fan; the creative death sequences, the maggot attack (or shower), the dog mauling are stuff that are truly noteworthy in the film. For a film made in 1977, it is way ahead of its time. The use of colors, manipulation of the senses and very creepy atmosphere make this film one of Dario Argento's most celebrated works, and it still holds up to this present time.<br />Highly Recommended! [4 ? Stars]<br /><br />The 2-disc 25th Anniversary Dvd by Blue Underground has a THX-Certified re-mastered picture and the sound mix has both 5.1 Dolby Digital and 5.1 DTS. For a film made in 1977, it looks real pretty.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>All right, I know that some people aren't going to like this movie, but as of me: I LOVE SUSPIRIA!!!!! Just wanted to make that clear, heh.<br />-Now, I will admit that in between the murders, the pace can slow down a bit. But if you're a horror lover or a gorehound, you NEED to see this movie, if only for the kills! Watch in the first where the girl that runs away from the ballet school gets absolutely SAVAGED! It's no wonder Entertainment Weekly referred to it as "the most vicious murder in a horror movie".<br />-The supernatural feel, surreal images and tone, amazing color and unfamiliar setting are absolutely beautiful. This has got to be the most beautiful and mesmerizing display of shocking horror cinematography ever. The foreign setting definitely helps, and captivates the viewer, especially if they're looking for a movie that's just as atmospheric and supernatural as it is bone-chillingly terrifying. So surreal and astounding...LOVE IT!<br />-I found the two-disc version at a very reasonable price, and this is, of course, after I saw it four times before owning it!<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE. IT ISN'T THE MOST FAST-PACED MOVIE EVER AND IT MAY SEEM TO RUN A LITTLE LONG. BUT IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE, WANT SOMETHNG HORRIFYING, VICIOUS, BEAUTIFUL, SURREAL, GENIUS AND GROUNDBREAKING, SUSPIRIA MAY BE AS GREAT A MOVIE TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME.<br />So as you can tell I think this movie rocks! Just watch it with an open mind, be patient, and expect the hardcore horror mastery via Italian director Dario Argento. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>I could of probably lived without 10 over-the-top seconds of "Suspiria."  Those 10 seconds are graphic to the point of porn.  No doubt Argento fans would say that such scenes are what make Argento Argento.  Whatever.  That said, this is a really good movie with a terrific look.  Argento's use of colors and architecture to establish mood (dread) is simply astounding.  I have to believe Kubrick borrowed from Argento, heavily, in his making of  "The Shining."  I almost didn't finish watching "Suspiria" due to a graphic murder in the beginning.  What kept me hanging in there was the stylish way Argento was framing his scenes.  Hairy and taloned arms appearing out of the dark, a haunting run through the woods, wild and/or garish art deco interiors that have you thinking Jack the Ripper picked out the colors and patterns, and a building that looks like it was designed in Hell. <p>The plot?  It's ok.  Not as weak as some have suggested, but it does have holes - holes you don't spend much time pondering, since it's your eyes and ears Argento is after.  Acting?  Almost seems beside the point.  You have your various grotesque characters, some with very big teeth, doing evil things. Jessica Harper is, however, very good as the waif-like ballet student.  Her physical slightness, her big eyes, all contribute to the impression that she is surrounded by monstrous horror.  How will she escape? Watch and see.  The soundtrack, especially if you have surround sound, is effective and eerie. Lots of evil whisperings and other ominous sounds jump from unexpected directions. So the makers of the dvd are also to be applauded.  It's as crisp a picture as you can imagine.  (Guess Argento wanted those "reds" to really show.)</p></br></body></html>

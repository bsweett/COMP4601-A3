Rather than speaking loudly into the microphones to be heard over the cacophony of noises in the room, the candidates (and more Liev Schreiber's character than anyone else) speak in soft, conversational tones.  It looks like what is really was  --  not performed live but rather put together in post-production.<br /><br />In another scene at the end, a scene where the winning candidates are celebrating their election victory, the news graphic shows a two-bar graph of the voting count.  The winners received 70% of the vote, yet the bar graph shows that the one marked 70% is the shorter of the two.  That is impossible.  Any graph bar of more than 50% will be taller/higher than each and every other graph because it is the largest proportion.  If the shorter graph bar is supposed to represent 70% of the vote, what was the taller one supposed to represent? Maybe 110%?  The graph is a measure of 180% of the vote?  No wonder the voting system is so confusing.<br /><br />Did I catch these details the first time I watched the film?  The speeches, yes, the not the graphs.  There are several "false moments" like this in the film (and in a lot of films, to be fair).  But those are the moments that can "take you out of" the film, and when they draw attention to themselves you lose your interest in the story and focus more on the details that the filmmakers either were too busy to catch or hoped you wouldn't notice.<br /><br />If you are eating a meal that has a lot of stuff in it you like but one single, solitary, tiny-proportioned ingredient that you don't care for (and is cooked into the food and unable to be picked out), pretty soon that single ingredient is the only thing you taste or think about when you eat the meal.  It effectively ruins the meal for you.<br /><br />I liked this remake the first time I saw it but now I can't sit through it without the "little things" jumping out at me.<br /><br />Aside from that, however, it is a decent enough movie.  A well-cast film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I was aware of the basic premise of this film before watching it and not having seen the original I didn't come to this with any preconceptions. With that in mind, this is a fairly decent thriller movie, that although slow paced, still manages to keep you interested for the duration. The story has been updated for this remake to take into account modern conflicts and scientific developments, but the key idea remains the same. A US soldier is brainwashed to commit a political assassination when he returns home. The film is based around this basic idea and also how to uncover the plot and motivation behind it. Washington turns out a decent performance and Streep, whilst being a parody of the evil domineering mother, still manages to be fairly convincing. Liev Shrieber is the last part of the acting puzzle who manages to lift this film from mediocrity to something half decent. This has flaws aplenty and as I mentioned before it is slow paced and dragged in places, but it still a reasonable film and worth a watch at some point. It has made me want to see the original to see if it as good (and as superior to this version) as I have heard.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I think this movie is supposed to feel chaotic like a dream where scenes flash into the next in an upsetting manner but it leaves the impression that this movie should have been better.  I get the feeling that I am missing something no matter how may times I rewatch this movie and I think that is the intended effect of the film.  In any case, the performances are strong including an enjoyable outtake of Meryl Streep talking about her ambitions for her son.  I recommend it because I enjoy Liev Schreiber but don't expect an excellent movie, just excellent but brief performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with soldiers gambling. The flames suggest the Iraq war of 1991. There is an ambush. Sergeant Raymond Shaw won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. Years later Major Marco tells the Boy Scouts about this event. Corporal Melvin tells of his bad dreams. A news program tells of problems for the American people. Congressman Raymond Shaw makes a speech to cheers. "We can prevail." [Who is "we"?] Politicians pick the party ticket. Elly Shaw pleads for her son Congressman Shaw as the VP. It works. Does Major Marco recover a forgotten memory? "Don't touch me." Marco gets his orders and meds. Shaw practices his rhetoric on the public. Later he has a strange experience. What about his brain? "Do you remember me?"<br /><br />Marco meets Eugen&eacute;e Rose on the train to New York city. Who would implant a chip in his back? [Does the film start to drag here?] Does the conversation between Shaw and Marco seem real? Is the confrontation too dramatic? "He hit me!" Did the Army experiment on its soldiers? Will that physician work on Marco? Can a brain be rebooted from a crash? Can he recover his memory? [Is the story becoming weird?] Marco reads about "Manchurian Global". Senator Thomas Jordan explains it to Marco. Later he discusses this with Raymond and Eleanor Shaw! Does Jordan have a suggestion to regain the VP slot? Will this problem be neutralized? Jocelyn runs out of the house without a cell phone or firearm! Does it look like an accident?<br /><br />Is the Shadow Unit watching Marco? Could a powerful corporation use scientists to create global changes? Will friendship trump sworn duty? Does Elly have more balls in her game? There is another meeting between Shaw and Marco. Was this foreseen? Is there a diabolical plot? Will the country be saved? Will there be a dramatic and shocking ending? [You know its coming.] Will the plan go wrong? And so another "lone gunman" changes history again. Will history be rewritten again?<br /><br />This more complex recreation of the original isn't as good. But it is good enough if you never saw the 1962 film or read the novel by Richard Condon. Was the personality of Elly based on a well-known politician? There was no need for "Manchurian" in the title given the extensive changes in the story. "The Corporate Candidate" would be more apt. Corporations have been controlling politicians since the Civil War era. Before that the privilege of limited liability was reserved only for those who served the public need (water supplies, canals, railroads).<br />[I wonder if the original story of a lost patrol that led to political success was a subtle parody of PT-109? What would happen to America if someone became President because his father was a powerful politician or Executive?]</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>1962's "The Manchurian Candidate" was an outstanding classic of an earlier era of movies, crisply shot in black and white and featuring a talented cast and a tightly wound, haunting plot firmly embedded in the tensions and paranoia of the Cold War.  2004's remake also features a talented cast in Denzel Washington, Liev Schrieber, Meryl Streep and Jon Voigt, but misses badly as a movie.  Produced for an audience that might only dimly remember the Cold War, the substitute premise of a rogue corporation selling arms fails the plausibility test, while a major change in the plot undercuts the credibility of one of the principal characters.<br /><br />Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is a veteran of the Gulf War, suffering from nightmares that seem to present an alternate version of a fire fight in which his life was saved by a Sergeant Raymond Shaw.  Shaw, played with disquietingly detached deameanor by Liev Schrieber, is now on a greased path to political stardom, coached by his ambitious and prominent mother, played by Meryl Streep.  Marco's attempts to resolve his nightmares lead him to contact Shaw and to suspect that his experience in the Gulf was an illusion.  Marco's quest for the truth will lead him into a nasty conspiracy involving brainwashing, with a shocking outcome for Marco and Shaw.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" has a good build-up, as Marco relentlessly seeks the truth of his experience in combat.  However, the movie loses its way in its closing stages.  An effort to be original by introducing changes in the basic story makes for an incoherent and implausible ending.  2004's "The Manchurian Candidate" may well be a perfectly acceptable movie for someone who had never seen the original.  For those who saw and appreciated the original, this remake is a missed opportunity, worth a look mostly for the outstanding cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />As far as remakes of beloved films go this one isn't too bad, with good performances by Streep and Schrieber and a reasonably successful updating of the original's premise; however, the ending is such an uninteresting copout that the film as a whole is just barely not worth recommending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Boy, if you thought that Meryl Streep was a meanie in 2006's The Devil Wears Prada, she took mean to the extreme in 2004's The Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />A bit too far-fetched at times, The Manchurian Candidate still delivers a 2+ hour, twist filled thriller. I am surprised that Director Jonathan Demme didn't keep a better hold on reality with his great track record for doing so in movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Philadelphia under his belt.<br /><br />Credibility gets a bit lost in The Manchurian Candidate by the suggestion that access to a vice presidential candidate would be so easy in order to execute the evil deeds that need to be done by his conspirators. Even more ridiculous is the notion that a vice presidential candidate could escape surveillance in order to commit heinous crimes...let's say for example...a double-murder.<br /><br />Regardless of the sensational conspiracy, the movie is quite entertaining. Good story. Good story-flow. Good actors. Meryl Streep does a terrific Mommy Dearest. Denzel Washington is, as always, on target. And Liev Schreiber plays a zombie well.<br /><br />Definitely a worthy rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>1962's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, John McGiver, James Gregory and Leslie Parrish is a cinematic classic. It is a modern day tale of unspeakable psychological horrors. Frankenheimer's style of mixing tension and political cynicism span the gamut of dark humor to nail biting anxiety of the white-knuckle variety. Underneath it all Frankenheimer never loses sight of the cost of these transgressions and he subliminally reminds us of the human tragedy and loss caused by them, which is somewhat what this entire film seems to be about. 2004's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a bit of a conundrum and almost seems like a homage to Frankenheimer's classic. The script based on George Axelrod's original, which in turn was based on the novel by Richard Condon, is confusing and ethereal. Lost in this script is Frank Sinatra's original character of the dedicated and logically minded, yet intuitively driven, army officer Marco. Here Washington is a sympathetic and frustrated failure. Liev Schreiber's performance as the human pawn Raymond Shaw is much more successful but the viewer truly has to read between the lines when compared to Laurence Harvey's brilliant, poignant and tragic performance in the original. Meryl Streep's performance as Raymond Shaw's mother is laughable and is not anywhere near the stature of Angela Lansbury's penetrating performance in the original. 2004's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE's is a curiosity piece and may actually be making a statement about cinematic re-makes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington (Training Day, Man On Fire) gets a case of paranoia in this updated remake  of the 1960's classic, the one with Blue Eyes in it. Anyway, so Washington was saved in Gulf War supposedly he thinks by candidate Liev Schreiber (Scream Trilogy, Kate & Leopold) who is running for vice president. Schreiber's mother is played by Meryl Streep (upcoming Prime with Uma Thurman, The Hours) who gives a good performance here as she fools everyone around her, giving speeches and so on. So, Washington becomes really paranoid, asking questions, figuring things out and making sense of it if it's real or not. Not bad remake delivers some weird things with a partially good Denzel Washington....towards the end he wears off. Schreiber is real good in this as well. Also starring Jon Voight (National Treasure, Midnight Cowboy) and Kimberly Elise (John Q., Set It Off).</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...the creepy Shaw son here reminded me of Anthony Perkins' performance of Norman Bates and while I generally dig Meryl Streeps' scene chewing, her acting here only whets your appetite for classic Streep overreaching like in Postcards from the Edge or more recently Angels in America...I mean to say, the director and editor don't allow the viewer to revel in Senator Shaw's maliciousness--hence Streep's fine acting--for too long before the story is quickedited along. Denzel does a good job as the soldier whose memory of a certain event during the Gulf War haunts him in unforgettable dreams. I was not pleased at how the thriller came to a close. My problem is that the last 10 minutes lets down the suspense and tension cleverly built up in the earlier three-quarters of this version the film. But if you've seen the original, you will appreciate this remake and you will appreciate casting Streep as the power starved Mother (although her scenes seem too short)....</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>This film delivered on all fronts. Suspense, acting, tight direction...another feather in Demme's cap!<br /><br />Washington is great, as usual...but it is Meryl Streep as the ballsy Senator that really steals this show (as usual)! Every scene she was in brightened and you coudl tell she really had a blast chewing the scenery. Hopefully she'll get an oscar nom for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: If you were to go to The American Film Institute's website you would see that the original Manchurian Candidate sits at number 67 for the best 100 movies in the last 100 years. The only question that strikes me here is why fix something if it's not broken? The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War. The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers. This new version uses the same idea of &quot;control&quot; except that instead of pointing at communism it's pointing at the idea that we live in a corrupt world, that our government is corrupt. Okay. . .I'm pretty sure that idea has been presented before, and in reality our government is corrupt in some ways and we know that. The movie does show us an almost fictional way of how the government is being controlled and that can raise questions like &quot;does the executive branch really have the most power or are they influenced enormously by others?&quot; While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex. The problem with the movie here is that the issues raised in the movie are way too fictional and far out to have any reference to our daily lives. Microchips implanted in our nation's leaders' brains is something that someone would say &quot;yeah right!&quot; to. The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time. While the new modern version has the similar formula of the original movie, the main ingredient has been changed and the flavor just doesn't seem right.<br /><br /> ACTING: This is a movie where if they had mediocre actors then the movie would have been considered an insult to John Frankenheimer. Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie. Meryl Streep pulls off the role of the evil mother, but I still find Angela Lansbury's performance much better. The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained. Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close-ups for character shots. Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen. This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: What if someone said that Hollywood was going to remake Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, or Ben-Hur . . . exactly! This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>As a stand-alone film, the &quot;re-visitation&quot; of Frankenheimer's 1962 classic is quite good. Washington, Shrieber, and Streep acquit themselves admirably in roles previously covered by Sinatra, Harvey, and Lansbury. Kimberly Elise does well in the tremendously altered role of &quot;Rosie&quot;, originally assayed by Janet Leigh. And Jeffrey Wright is on screen briefly, but memorably, as a soldier tormented by the same nightmares that plague Washington and Shrieber.<br /><br /> The different elements of plot between the two films are reflective of the times in which they were produced. Demme continues to use his technique of having the actors speak directly into the camera. This adds an eerie touch to the presentation, making the viewer feel as though he is part of the action.<br /><br /> There are a few slow passages and the convention hall sequence near the film's end seems protracted.<br /><br /> I saw the film with a mixed group, half appearing to have seen the original while the others were totally alien to the classic. The latter had no frame of reference and could possibly appreciate the newer version better.<br /><br /> As an owner of the Sinatra film, I found myself comparing and contrasting the two. This may have resulted in my giving the newer movie less than five stars.<br /><br /> Lansbury as the first &quot;Mrs. Shaw&quot;, along with James Gregory as her befuddled Senator husband, were just too awesome and memorable to erase from my brain.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington is pretty good in this remake of the Sinatra thriller brought up to date for a modern audience. Here playing Ben Marco, a captain (and now Major) in the US Army whose tactical unit were saved from being wiped out, by Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Shreiber) single handedly in Kuwait before Desert Storm, or so it would seem. Sounds straight forward, but the only problem is that Marco's unit have all since disappeared or suffered an untimely demise, and this accompanied with his strange dreams and flashbacks have led him on a one man mission to find the truth. The erstwhile saviour and hero Shaw, now riding on his heroic exploits is proudly sporting his medal of honour, and steered with political avarice by his State Senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep) is in the running to be the next Vice President. As the story unfolds we see a connection between Shaw, his mother and "Manchurian Global" a huge conglomerate simply reeking of political back dealing, corruption and outlawed scientific experiments in mind control, as Marco starts to fit the pieces of the jigsaw together. I'm not going to give the story away, because the movie actually does that on it's own about half way in, and tries but never really delivers on the suspense or credibility front, rather bumbling with a tepid predictability instead. Comparing this to the original (for those who have seen it) is interesting for the similarities. Both movies paint their villians well as almost insidious and faceless power figures, or puppet masters working behind the scenes, and ultimately wielding all the power, and if one had too choose, this version is probably more believable on paper. In the Sinatra movie it was of course the Communist Red Chinese (it was 1962 after all) and now it's a comparitive of virtually any modern powerful conglomerate. The movie was OK, but really had way too many improbable scenes for me. Another question I kept asking was why the villians were even tolerating the existence of Washingtons character in the first place, when he could have easily been made to "disappear" once he had begun to air the can of worms he had opened. Jon Voight has a nice Cameo as Senator Thomas Jordan who helps Marco, and one or two red herrings and twists help the picture hold your attention. All that said, 129 minutes is a bit long, and the constant flashbacks, and fade to black camera shots get a little tiresome. Washington is believably engaging as the paranoid shell shocked Major, and Schreiber also works hard to lift the film, but this is not something that will appear too near the top of either ones Resume I suspect. DVD extra's are standard, plus a featurette and commentary section. Unless you're a collecting fan renting is probably best advice. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>'The Manturian Candidate' has two great things to offer, and one of them is the cast, Densel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber plus many supporting actors whose names you might or might not know -- Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, Jeffrey Wright, Miguel Ferrer, Ted Levine, Simon McBurney, Dean Stockwell, singer Robyn Hitchcock, and wow! Bruno Ganz of German cult classic 'Wings of Desire'!  And I though I saw the face of Roger Corman.  And is that Walter Mosley the original book writer of 'Devil in a Blue Dress'?<br /><br />Besides these faces, the film effectively presents the paranoia suspence story with very brooding, atomospheric touch.  The results are often unnnerving, and almost successful in making us forget the plots and gimmicks that look no longer fresh and convincing as before.  Still, the film is worth your time.<br /><br />The film is about Ben Marco (Denzel Washington good as always) who keeps on dreaming wierd dreams since he came back from the Gulf War.  Back in Kuwait, Ben, knocked down by the emeny attack, was saved single-handedly by Sgt. Shaw (Schreiber), who beat the Iraqi army.  So America hailed Shaw as war-hero, and with Shaw's fiercely power-hungry mother (Streep), Shaw is nominated for vice-president.candidate, while Ben is still tormented by the nightmares.  And going to therapies does not help.<br /><br />But because of curious things, like a 'tiny sliver chip' Ben Marco finds in a strangest place, Ben starts to suspect that there is something going on within himself, within America's political system, or within America itself.  Is there any conspiracy going on around presidential campaign?  But is that possible?  And if so, how can Ben prove that when he knows his words would not be trusted anymore?<br /><br />The film's premises are no longer fresh and intriguing as used to be, and director Jonathan Demme knows that.  Instead of the straight-forward approach, Demme uses his unique camera works (like frequent close-ups or characters staring into camera) to establish the brooding sinister atmosphere, which prevails the whole picture with downplayed but shrewed use of such props as news flashes.  And if a character experiences hullcination in Demme's film, he does not see the so-called 'dream sequence.'  Instead, he walks on, right through the wall of the room, and quietly accepts the 'reality' of the next room.<br /><br />[WAHT'S MANTURIA?]  The original 'The Manchurian Candidate' starring Frank Sinatra (1962) has been thought one of the greatest political and paranoia suspence films ever made.  As it's classic status will not be likely to be replaced, Demme changed the meaning of 'Manturia' to something else.  The Korean War is now the Gulf War, and when the soldiers play cards, they just play cards and that's all.  Well, don't compare the original and the remake, and that's all I want to say.  You may think some changes are pointless, but Tina Sinatra (Frank Sinatra's daughter and co-producer of the remake) said OK, so it's OK.<br /><br />Not as great and unsettling as the original, 'The Manturian Candidate' is still a well-made thriller with good acting and the dark and effective tone.  But don't try to think about its John Carpenter-type story or its scientific accuracy.  The film is interesting in the same way as the famous story about Coke and the subliminal message.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays Major Ben Marco, a veteran of the Gulf War who keeps having disturbing dreams about a mission he led in Kuwait.  The mission included Raymond Shaw, a man whom Marco recommended for the Medal of Honor, and who is now running for Vice-President of the United States.  Shaw is constantly manipulated by his mother, played with conniving perfection by Meryl Streep.  Soon Marco begins to discover that there is some truth to his dreams and he realizes that he and Shaw, along with their whole unit, were programmed to act as they did.  There is some overkill in the plot and the intensity of the characters, but all in all this is a riveting movie which keeps the viewer guessing until all is revealed at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>I just saw it tonight and i thought it was good but at times confusing.

In this movie you have to pay attention to every scene because it can get confusing.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>When I read that director Jonathan Demme was remaking "The Manchurian Candidate" with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, my original reaction was to gasp in horror. It seemed practically blasphemous to take a movie as good, as shocking and as original as the Frankenheimer classic and turn it into some "Charade"-into-"Truth About Charlie"-style mess.<br /><br />But I was wrong. "The Manchurian Candidate" is Demme's best film since "The Silence of the Lambs," and this remake still has the power to shock and impress, combining the same old twists with some startling new ones. Knowing the original as well as I do, I was still on the edge of my seat at the end of this one, and I left the theater thoroughly satisfied.<br /><br />Denzel Washington turns the character Bennett Marco into an over-the-edge potential-psycho, making Marco far more colorful than Sinatra did in the original. And that move essentially shifts the main focus of the film from the once-main-character of Raymond Shaw onto Marco, allowing for all sorts of new twists.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, taking on the Angela Lansbury role, also takes the original character into new directions, though she maintains Mrs. Shaw's innate, delicious viciousness.<br /><br />I was in doubt, but the remake has converted me into a believer.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>The original version of this movie is one of my all-time favorites. It was one of the most thrilling movies of all time, sure, but it showed a true mastery of the medium: the pace of the movie, by and large, is slow, but it creates such an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and paranoia that you had your eyes glued to the screen for every second. The original Manchurian Candidate was excellently written and acted, and really funny--it really holds up after 40 years. When I heard it was going to be remade, I was a tad concerned, but finding out that it was going to be helmed by Demme and have a cast headlined by Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, etc., I was understandably excited by the possibility. The themes of political treachery and paranoia could be well applied to the terrorist age, and I was anxious to see a different director's vision of this story. I had high expectations, but the end result turned out to be, well, average.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the acting is superb. Denzel is in top form, cast against type, playing the Sinatra role in a considerably more haunted manner than the Chairman did. Liev Schreiber channels Lawrence Harvey and proves capable of taking over Harvey's classic performance. Meryl Streep, it goes without saying, is great. Jon Voight, though, gives probably the most balanced performance of the film, as a Senator who has to juggle idealism with pragmatism learned by hard experience--it's quite an accomplishment, and rings true in this age of the 'axis of evil'. Although this film didn't get any acting nods come Oscar time, it did have fierce competition, and in another year it just might have. The problem is the screenplay. If you haven't seen the original, you might imagine that this is a smart, satirical political thriller. However, if you look up the definition of those words in the dictionary, you will find the movie poster for the original incarnation of this movie. It's a tall order to remake one of the best American--heck, Earth--films of all time, and it might be unfair to criticize the movie by comparing it to the immortal source, but it is inevitable upon an undertaking like this, so here goes.<br /><br />Little of what made the original film special is present here. The comic unreality of the brainwashing scenes is replaced with standard-level atrocities, the humor is replaced with such grimness that the movie draws you in easily, but it is hard to enjoy. I saw it with two rather smart people (I'm no dunce myself), and none of us could completely figure out the contradictory motivations of some of the characters, or the message of the movie. It's obviously an indictment of corporate power politics, but that is so obvious that I just imagined there had to be something more to it. The original was an indictment of McCarthy-era politics, but it also did so much more: for example, people are likely to stick with a President if something horrible happened during their term, regardless of whose fault it was. This isn't a Bush metaphor, although it applies, but the same thing happened to FDR. The message of political assassination for promotion is still provocative, since many people still believe that LBJ was in on the JFK assassination. To paraphrase Pauline Kael, that movie has some of the most sophisticated political satire ever committed to the screen. The new movie has some of the most obvious political satire ever committed to the screen: Corporations want more power? There are power-crazy people in Washington? More breaking news: there's a military-industrial compex that doesn't want peace so that they can keep their jobs, and the media is obsessed with ratings instead of being our check against power. I take a more optimistic picture of our government than the movie does, so its dripping cynicism doesn't quite hit home for me. Ultimately, Demme deserves credit for not doing a shot-to-shot remake of the original, but this movie shows how hard it is to recreate a classic movie that's just as memorable. Now, before they remake Casablanca with Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson and Natalie Portman, we should probably let the studios know that remakes are ten times harder to pull off than an original film, especially if the original is a classic, and that if they're hell-bent on remaking films, they should use bad ones so that the new ones look good by comparison. I'm thinking Ed Wood here, how about Glen or Glenda with Joaquin Phoenix and one of the Desperate Housewives? I'd sure go to see that one, and I do trust film executives to come up with a movie that's better than one of the worst of all time, but not much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>The original "The Manchurian Candidate" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The movie has such a great story line, acting and ideas.  So when I heard that Hollywood was remaking a classic, I was very skeptical.  But now after seeing the new version, I am pleasantly surprised of how good of a job Johnathan Demme did with handling a classic.<br /><br />This version takes place after the first Gulf War and I believe that the movie is in 2004.  Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is having a re-occuring dream about what one of his fellow soldiers, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), did when they platoon had got ambushed during a battle.  Raymond Shaw, who has won a Medal of Honor for his actions in the Gulf War, gets into politics and gets put on a ticket as the Vice-Presidential candidate.  Capt. Marco's dreams becoming more clear to him and another former member of his platoon admits to him about having the same dream.  Capt. Marco comes to the realization that him and his fellow soldiers that were captured were all brain-washed and can still be controlled.  Now Capt. Marco's mission is to convince Raymond Shaw to undergo further testing and to find out who is controlling Raymond and himself.<br /><br />This movie had many good things in it.  Great performances all around by Washington and Meryl Streep.  Streep will probably get an Oscar nomination for this performance.  Maybe Streep and Angela Lansbury will both be winnners of Oscars for playing the same character?  Liev Schreiber does a good job as Raymond Shaw.  Of course, this cast cannot be compared to the original that contained Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey.<br /><br />The story line in this movie was obviously updated from the original, but throughout, the main story and even some of the dialogue remained the same from the original.  The only problem that I had with this movie is that it may have been a little too long, but not too long that you lose interest in the movie.  I would highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and see both versions of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a fast paced, tension riddled, timely, well-performed and well-directed summer audience-geared action movie.  Leave it at that and you have plenty of reasons to escape the heat by sitting in an air-conditioned theater to watch the heat!  Meryl Streep continues to prove she can take any part and make it her own; Denzel Washington is once again Denzel Washington - and that is a good thing, just not monumental;  Liev Schreiber fills the shoes of his role with delicacy and aplomb.  But where is the original novel and film that have become icons?  Not much of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE  remains: the story has been so very updated and mechanized and futurized and manipulated and distorted that only the seed idea remains. Not a bad reason to remake a good film - to "make it relevant to today's political and global environmental squalor" -but don't expect the sub rosa subtleties  of the original, the suggestion of a deeper relationship between Marco and Shaw, the far more terrifying aspects of mind manipulation from the time of the Cold War to the MATRIX mentality and gadgetry of 2004.  For those, buy the original DVD or book.  But given the absence of these values, this CANDIDATE is worth your time as it touts some wonderful performances.  Too bad these same gimmicks are used so often the entire summer movie genre that they, by themselves, are growing stale.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" takes inspiration from both Richard Condon's novel and its memorable 1962 film adaptation. Screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris have updated and rewritten this paranoid thriller for today's political climate. When Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a reconnaissance mission into Iraqi-controlled territory in 1991, his unit was attacked, two men lost, Marco was injured, and a Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) emerged a hero, after he fought off the enemy and guided his unit to safety. Over a decade later, Congressman Raymond Shaw is pursuing a very upwardly mobile political career at the urging of his controlling, ambitious mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep). A visit from a former Desert Storm comrade causes Ben Marco to suspect that his frequent nightmares of brainwashing, torture, and murder may contain clues to what happened to him and his men all those years ago, as well as information vital to the integrity of our political system, considering that Raymond Shaw has just received a Vice Presidential nomination.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate"'s themes are powerful and provocative, but the narrative is so far-fetched that they don't hit home. That might also be said of the 1962 version of the story as well, but the emotional impact of these characters isn't enough to overwhelm the film's implausibility. There was no reason to make the technologies of mind manipulation so laughable or so prominent. The character of Raymond Shaw is kind of creepy and so unstable that he's not credible. A neuroscientist is introduced out of nowhere to help Ben, but he seems to exist in a vacuum for no other purpose. It's difficult to tell if all of this brainwashing was done to advance the cause of corporate ambition or political tyranny. Politics makes strange bedfellows, but demonizing two separate parties, neither of which would need to result to such tactics, is confusing if the film is trying to make a socio-political statement -which I think it is.<br /><br />I have to compliment Meryl Streep's performance, though. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw is a thoroughly detestable individual whose self-possession and sharp tongue make her charismatic nonetheless...and easily the most interesting character in this film. She's an ambitious ideologue who will stop at nothing to see that her country conforms to her vision. Streep's performance reveals both the character's commitment and the dangers of her fanaticism. Streep claims to have modeled Eleanor Shaw's manner on a real person, whom I assume to be Senator Hilary Clinton. That is not to say that Senator Clinton is villainous, but that her career and disposition superficially resemble those of Shaw. The interesting thing is that the two women are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" is mostly fluff. It's a passable thriller that requires a little too much suspension of disbelief. Apart from that, its themes are poorly articulated. -Except in the character of Eleanor Shaw, the Senator from hell. Viewers will either love her or hate her. Or maybe both sides of the political spectrum will see an ugly reflection of themselves in her. Her ideals and her methods are insightful, provocative and perfectly realized by Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 5 deleted and extended scenes, 2 outtakes in which Eleanor Shaw is being interviewed by the press, a Liev Schreiber screen test, some discussion by amateur political pundits, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Demme and co-screenwriter Daniel Pyne. "The Enemy Within" (15 minutes) is a making-of documentary that features interviews with the director, producers, writer, and cast in which they compare the film to the book and discuss the film's conception. "The Cast of the Manchurian Candidate" (12 minutes) explores the three main characters: Ben, Raymond, and Eleanor and includes interviews with the actors who play them. "Liev Schreiber Screen Test" (3 minutes) is the scene in which Raymond asks his mother to help Ben. "Political Pundits" (10 minutes) includes three conversations, each between two people, about a loose socio-political topic: Beau Sia and Roy Blunt, Jr. discuss voting in America. Fab 5 Freddy and Anna Deavere Smith discuss "gangsterism". And Sidney Lumet and Reno discuss American power and a disinterested electorate. The audio commentary by Jonathan Demme and Daniel Pyne addresses the decisions made in writing the script and in constructing the film. Demme and Pyne occasionally discuss the film's relationship to current events or give background information on the script, but the commentary is mostly about writing and directing. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Against the odds, the 2004 version of "The Manchurian Candidate" succeeds, mainly because it doesn't just try to remake the 1962 original.  Yet this isn't so much a bold re-imagining as thoughtful one - skillfully written, masterfully played, and wonderfully shot.  As you can always expect from Jonathan Demme, it's a beautifully crafted film.  If you've seen and admired the original, you won't be bored.  While the plots are similar they're far from identical, and Demme unfolds his with perfect smart-thriller timing and a contemporary narrative style, often deploying a highly economical use of images, voiceover and inter-cut scenes - an excellent device for delivering maximum information in the shortest possible time.  There's also a lot to enjoy in the performances.  Denzel Washington manages to be simultaneously charismatic and pathetic, perfectly capturing the essence of the damaged solider.  Meryl Streep is destined for her fourteenth Oscar nomination, and possibly a win for Best Supporting Actress.  While she doesn't deliver the same kind of desperate mania as Angela Lansbury's original (a performance Streep deliberately avoided seeing before the shoot), she manages to be equally creepy, mainly because her ruthless and cunning  character is so disturbingly familiar to any observer of politics.  The Oedipal bath scene is particularly chilling.  Overall, this is a satisfying film: not only a respectful remake, but a solid thriller in its own right.  And it's worth noting also, in what is surely the most wonderful irony, that forty years after the original movie the Red Menace has been replaced by capitalism's darkest and equally dangerous breed - the global military-industrial corporation, with designs on political power.  What isn't so funny is how close to reality it is.  Bush doesn't have a chip in his head, but he does have a piece in one ear and Dick Cheney in the other - which is probably somewhat worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Comparisons and contrasts between this film and its predecessor of the same name directed by John Frankenheimer (1962) are inevitable. Both were based on Richard Condon's novel (1959), although it seems to me that this remake owes more to George Axelrod's screenplay for the original film. The comments which follow, however, are limited to the 2004 version directed by Jonathan Demme and co-starring Merl Streep (as Eleanor Shaw), Denzel Washington (as Captain Bennett Marco), and Liev Schreiber (as Raymond Shaw). Although their performances as well as those of a few others in supporting roles (notably Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, and Simon McBurney) are first-rate, I think this film has serious flaws.<br /><br />Here are four. First, the implausible, at times cartoonish "villains." Specifically,the senior-level executives of Manchurian Global corporation who have devised and then implemented a plan by which to gain and then sustain total control of the President of the United States by placing their candidate, Raymond Shaw, in the Oval Office. He is a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism during Operation Desert Storm. What is their motive? What else? Potentially trillions of dollars from sales worldwide of military products and paramilitary services. I also had problems with the narrative which suffers from confusing  transitions from the past to the present to the past and from one location to another. My next criticism concerns Demme's ineffective use of what could be called the "Mad Scientist" device, in this instance Dr. Noyle. He is an infamous geneticist whom foreign countries as well as multinational corporations hire to conduct human implant procedures "by which to gain and then sustain total control of...." You get the idea. I just wish Demme had developed the Noyle character as brilliantly as he did  Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lams (1991). For me, the most serious flaw is the dysfunctional coda which I will not discuss out of respect for those who have not as yet seen this film. I will suggest, however, that it raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />As Eleanor Shaw, Streep dominates every scene in which she appears. Near the end of the film, there is one with her son Raymond which suggests all of the passions which have driven her, probably for decades. Washington does the best he can with what is, as presented, a muddled character. He communicates intensity better than almost any other actor since Rod Steiger in his prime. As Marco, he also communicates torment. As for Schreiber, I think his is the most difficult character to portray because, pre-implant, Raymond Shaw was an especially unlikeable person. Post-implant, although in many ways still unlikeable, he is nonetheless a victim who is never permitted to deviate from the assignment for which he has been so thoroughly, scientifically prepared. There are brief (albeit subtle) indications of Raymond's humanity as when he is obviously pleased to see Jocelyn Jordan (Vera Farmiga) again and then later when he begins to realize that Marco's various suspicions may indeed be true.<br /><br />For the reasons indicated, I think Demme and his associates created a film which lacks both thematic cohesion and dramatic impact. It is OK but....</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I recently watched the Manchurian Candidate, and was blown away. The story is great, and keeps you guessing the whole time. A couple of scenes are particularly chilling, "you'll se what I mean."<br /><br />Overall, an excellent film, with a great plot, and lots and lots of suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was very good. Sometimes predictable, but often enough you are pulling for Washington, so the anticipation is higher. Acting is very good (I still dislike all the roles Streep plays, including this one). With current technology, it is much more believable then it might have been 40 years ago when it might have been written off as cold war paranoia. Scary. Not surprising that Demme also directed "Silence of the Lambs", where the scariness is more in the mind than in blood and gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Within the last ten years or so I saw the original 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate on video.  I remember feeling tension and getting caught up in the plot.  I can't say that much for this newly released version.<br /><br />The world is different than it was in 1962.  We're all jaded from the politics around us.  And we crave something more than a science fiction story that tries hard to include elements of modern politics.  For example, the threat now is really corporate greed rather than communism.  And there are references to recent incidents that seem right out of today's headlines as well as political speeches that can be attributed to a wide variety of real-life candidates.  I think that's what interrupted my involvement with the story line.  I was just so busy trying to figure out how it all applies to what is going on right now that I just couldn't get caught up in how the hocus pocus of implanted computer chips would impact a presidential election.<br /><br />The actors all did a great job, especially Denzel Washington, cast as a former Gulf War officer who is trying to solve the mystery of his frequent nightmares and memories that don't seem to make sense.  Liev Schreiber was once a member of his patrol and has come home a war hero and is now running for the vice-presidency of the United States.  Schreiber's mother is Meryl Streep, an outspoken senator who will stop at nothing to get her son elected.  Much of the time, however, I had to struggle to follow the plot and, later, when I tried to put it all together, I found too many loose ends to make conclusion satisfying.<br /><br />One of the problems with this film is that it tried too hard.  The modern politics didn't ring true, especially when we're surrounded every day with the real thing.  There was some sort of political statement hidden in the story that never came across as authentic.  And, in spite of good acting, I never cared about the characters.<br /><br />I can't tell you not to bother with this film.  It might make you think about some of the horrors of corporate takeover of the world.  But this particular story is too convoluted to make that meaningful.  I therefore give this 2004 version of The Manchurian candidate no better than a lukewarm recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>The remake of the Manchurian Candidate starts out slowly, buildings intrigue and suspense, and then jumps into pool filled with giant rubber balls and rubber ducks.  No, not literally!  But there is a moment in this film--when Denzel Washington starts surfing the net to find answers--that the film sets off on a trajectory so implausible, so goofy, and so ridiculous that all the build up, all the visual grace, all the fine acting (Meryl Streep in particular), is utterly and completely wasted.<br /><br />Now, the trajectory in question is not so different than the original, but the tone of this version is so somber, so serious, so heavy, that you can't abandon the need for gritty, realistic answers halfway through the film.  The original Manchurian Candidate didn't take itself half as seriously, and that's why it succeeded where this version fails.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  Meryl Streep is channelling Hillary Clinton (her denials notwithstanding), and Denzel Washington obviously watched a bunch of Pacino films before settling on this character.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>The newest version of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; has an almost insurmountable chasm to overcome what with the superior reputation of the 1960's version of this story staring it in it's proverbial face. And even though on most counts the new version equals or surpasses the aforementioned film, in one crucial point...it doesn't. And that one crucial point is in the performance of Meryl Streep.<br /> Now, there is no doubt that Streep is a National treasure and that she has given us many indelible performances but her Eleanor, is too mannered, so much of a &quot;performance,&quot; that she loses her character thread early on and her portrayal becomes caricature. Compare her Eleanor to Angela Lansbury's in the original: Lansbury is all motherly, Oedipal, crafty, intelligent, cunning, a &quot;real&quot; amoral snake willing to do anything to gain power.<br /> Updating the Richard Condon novel, director Demme and his writers have done an exceptional job of turning the red-scare, Cold War era of the early 60's into our post 9/11 times. The main theme remains intact, though: the underlying feeling and sense that our government is somehow, someway turning us into robots, playing with our minds or at least experimenting doing so. It's the &quot;1984,&quot; Big Brother is watching thing that is just as strong now as it was 40 years ago.<br /> Denzel Washington dominates this film in a performance that is the logical extension of his performance as the beat-down, lonely, alcoholic Creasy in &quot;Man on Fire.&quot; In this film he has shaken off all remnants of his hero persona and dug as deep as he can go to his core: he's frightened, he's crazy and he's a man with a mission; a very potent cocktail of character traits.<br /> Unfortunately, a telling and shocking moment between Eleanor and her son Raymond (Liev Schreiber) has been cut since the preview that would have added much to the final form of the movie. But nonetheless, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a wallop in the stomach of a movie. One that you will not soon forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>If you saw the original you will understand.  Total waste of time.

Read the book or see the original, NOW That's ENTERTAINMENT!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>This movie doesn't live up to the hype. It has some good things going for it, not the least of which is the acting. Meryl Streep has to be the greatest actress of her generation and can do anything. She is amazing here, particularly in her Oedipal scene with Liev Schreiber, who is also well cast. Denzel Washington does a fine job as Major Marco and is convincing as a deeply troubled veteran of the gulf war. But actors need a good script. This one jerks and starts. At times it's silly; at other times the action is repugnant. I do not need to see a man choked to death as he vomits in living color. Thank God for the Greeks for believing that sometimes less is more. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the film is set in the present. I'm not sure what kind of parallels we are to draw here. Is Streep supposed to remind us of Hillary Clinton? She has the drive, the ambition and the haircut but not the political philosophy. Someone drops the phrase &quot;conservative vigilence&quot;. Are we to think the second George Bush here? And a multi-national corporation (Manchurian Global) putting one of its brainwashed own into the White House? Why buy the cow when the milk is free already? The White House welcome mat has always been out for the Enrons and Halliburtons of the world. Let me rephrase: one Halliburton lives in the vice-presidential quarters now.<br /><br /> The writers, to their credit, do not attempt to copy the original and have changed the plot considerably. If only it worked better. Although the movie certainly has it moments, there's a lot of not very interesting, confusing times between the high points. It was a very long 2 hours and 15 minutes for me. I checked my watch often, something I never did in the original movie. Although this film is neither in the league with &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; nor the 1962 version, it is certainly worth seeing if only for the performance of the incomparable Ms. Streep.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I think that this is Denzel's best move in a while.

This superbly crafted and well acted re-make of the 1960s political thriller, "The Manchurian Candidate" bears little resemblance to the original, a taut but relatively conventional psychological drama based on the premise of the selective brainwashing of a platoon of American soldiers during the Korean War by the North Koreans. In the original, the storyline revolves around the nightmare ruminations of a military officer (played by Frank Sinatra) who comes to realize all hinges on a fellow prisoner, the scion of a wealthy, influential, and politically ambitious family becoming a sleeper assassin who will be activated to act out his part in a diabolical plot to stage a deft and ostensibly peaceful coup-d'etat of the American government.<br /><br />Here Denzel Washington underplays the part of the officer to the point of perfection, yet the story-line is much more of a postmodern twist, involving corporate geopolitical ambitions for a Halliburton-like firm who tries to use the brainwashing during the Gulf War of 1991 to ensnare and brainwash the sleeper agent (played well here by Liev Schreiber, once again the scion of a wealthy, influential, and politically star-crossed family). Meryl Streep plays against type as a brash and arrogant neoconservative senator who uses her bully pulpit to spew imperialistic venom. There are many contemporary touches and twists to the script and the plot that make this a quite artful, albeit obviously fictional, philosophical diatribe on the state of current American politics seen through the eyes of Hollywood intellectuals (or is that a contradiction in terms?).<br /><br />All that said, there is indeed much beyond these blatant attempts to examine the current state of the American polity to recommend the film for your entertainment. It is a forceful and mind-expanding whirlwind ride through the threats we face both within and without our borders, and it offers a number of interesting and diverting scenes of people swept up by and then caught helplessly within the crosshairs of circumstances way out of his or her control, and in that sense is a timeless statement of how much the particulars describing each of our lives depend in the unique set of historical circumstances we find ourselves enmeshed within. This is quite a rollercoaster ride, and one I highly recommend for your viewing entertainment. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>I was getting tugged on multiple sides when I decided to rate and review this film. First, and most obviously, was that I loved the original with Frank Sinatra. I think it was probably his defining role as an actor and was my personal favorite Sinatra movie. Second, I was worried that I might try and draw too many comparisons between this new film and its predecessor and thus end up hating this one. Third, I like Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, and PRAYED that they didn't put these two excellent actors into roles that they either weren't made for or couldn't live up to.<br /><br />So basically I stressed out over nothing. The movie was good. Not great, not the best of the year, but good enough to hold my attention and keep me up later than I normally would be.<br /><br />The film: Denzel Washington takes on the role of Major Ben Marco (Sinatra's old Captain role), a desert storm officer who's come back from the war with terrible headaches, undecipherable dreams, and a member of his team who won the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br /><br />Liev Schriber plays Raymond Shaw, the powerfully connected Sergeant who wins The Medal. He comes back to the States and is swept into politics. And he's being primed for the vice presidency.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's hard-nosed mother who NEEDS to have her son in a position of power. The family name MUST be upheld and put into the history books. Mrs. Streep plays probably her most creepy role to date; I loved it. Her character infuriated me one moment, and then made my stomach turn the next. A perfect performance.<br /><br />Instead of Manchuria being involved, this time we have something known as Manchurian Global, a company that wants to rule the most powerful nation on Earth by controlling one of its most powerful leaders. But who's behind this global corporation? Does the military know? IS it the military?<br /><br />Denzel pulls off a decent performance as the conflicted soldier who wants to do the right thing, but is hampered by what's "inside his head". His decline into near insanity is more like a landslide (i.e., felt rushed), and those around him can't hold a candle to his more adept acting abilities (with the exception of Mrs. Streep who practically stole the show).<br /><br />Will I watch it again? Probably not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I'll be the first to admit that I've never seen the first Manchurian Candidate made in 1962, or even heard of the novel by Richard Condon, so I viewed this remake without any preconceived notions. The first thing that struck me about this movie is how relevant and topical the subject matter is, especially in times of multicolored terror alerts. The themes of media manipulation, the corruption of power, and the perversion of democracy are all woven into a tightly knit thriller that steadily pulls the viewer in. The Manchurian Candidate is a chilling account of what results when political and technological power converges and is used for the wrong reasons. The idea that private interests can rule government, that research regarding brain science can be used for harm rather than good, and that vast conspiracies can ensure that the public are kept ignorant and uninformed, are all urgently, and incontrovertibly relevant today.<br /><br />The movie centers on Sergeant Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a Desert Storm veteran and current Congressman who is competing for the U.S. Vice Presidency. Shaw, if elected, will be the first vice-presidential candidate created solely for use by the private sector.  A private corporation called Manchurian Global is investing in him and is backed by the prestigious reputation of his family name. Raymond's ever-present, media-friendly mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep), is a driven, egoistic and self-absorbed politician with a corrupt nature that will do anything to have her son elected to the White House. But Raymond's actions are perhaps driven not by his own motivations to be a good public servant, but from the brainwashing he underwent while serving in Kuwait.<br /><br />Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is the paranoid leader of Sergeant Shaw's unit in Desert Storm. Marco has never really mentally recovered from his traumatizing experiences overseas. Plagued by devastating nightmares, he embarks in a quest to discover whether there's any truth behind these unsettling dreams. As the pieces of the puzzle come together, Marco discovers that the nightmares are from the effects of brainwashing, rather than from Gulf War Syndrome as was previously thought. Everyone surrounding Shaw does not want to discuss what happened in Desert Storm and even Shaw admits that he doesn't remember performing the heroic acts that handed him a Medal of Honor. As the mystery expertly unfolds, Marco comes to suspect that he and his men were brainwashed in order to place a sleeper into the White House that could one day, potentially, bring about the end of American democracy, as we know it.<br /><br />The Manchurian Candidate is an actor's movie, and it's refreshing to see three of the finest actors working today delve into their roles with passion and veracity. Streep gives probably the most disturbing and creepy performance. She brings a possibly incestuous, morally evil, surely demented mother, to electrifying life. Live Schreiber gives a well-modulated, unemotional and often scary performance that makes one question his true loyalties. Denzel brings a depth of character and a range of emotion that one has come to expect from the actor, and Kimberly Elise is excellent and suitably spunky as Rosie in a crucial role. Viewers will be treated to a great story and a very well acted movie when they see the Manchurian Candidate. This is probably one of the best movies of the year so far, and is definitely one of the most affecting, disturbing, and powerful political thrillers of the past few years.

Being of generous spirit, I will resolve the issue by rating it up a half rather than down. The original was the truly gripping version. In the original, the bad guys were communists from Manchuria seeking to take over the government. In this somewaht lame remake, the bad guys constitute a corporation named Manchurian Industries. Without saying more, just think about it ... which premise is the real thriller? In both versions, a brainwshed war veteran is under the control of his domineering mother. Both Angela Lansbury in the original and Meryl Streep in the remake are convincing in that role. Indeed, the highpoint of the film my be an erotic, borderline incestous moment between mother and brainwashed son in the remake. Otherwise, however, the original wins hands down.<br /><br />The setting and relationship between the characters is much better in the original. There, a braiwashed son of a senator and his wife is programmed to do what is necessary to help his father, the vice presidential candidate rise to the top. It is the mother, rather than the father who has the brains. The father, who is the candisate is merely the dopey sooge. in this remake, however, the brainwashed son of Meryl Streep's character (she plays the senator) is the candidate for vice preesident. Excuse me but yeah right!!! That's really believable, that a zombied out brainwashed, unlikabe cad could actually be a candidate for vice president. Additionally, there are scenes where this vice presidential candidate goes off on his own to carry out orders he is programmed to obey. Again, excuse the sarcasm but puleeze!! That's really believable that a vice presidential candidate who would have a secret service detail can somehow just go off on his own.<br /><br />The ending of each movie has a slightly different twist brought on by the fact that in one, the father is the candidate whereas in the other, the brainwashed individual is. I can't reveal the ending because it would ruin the suspense. Trust me, however, the ending works much better in the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Doing a remake of a first class movie is asking for it. Not only should the remake be at least as good as the original, but the remake has to fight all the recollections of those who saw the original...and, I suspect, of a lot of the recollections of those who didn't.<br /><br />I thought that this remake did a first-class job for two-thirds of the way, but then lost it a bit. Even so, it's a solid movie in my view with a nice twist on the original.<br /><br />For me, the acting and emotional impact of the original centered on Angela Lansbury, followed by Sinatra and then Lawrence Harvey. In the remake, I'd put Washington first, followed by Schreiber and then Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The original seemed to me to be all about paranoia, and made all the more effective because Harvey, as an actor, had such a stand-offish personality. "It's not that Raymond Shaw is hard to like. He's impossible to like!" A lot of people felt the same way about Harvey. I think that's the main reason he was so effective in the role. That, combined with the poisonous ego and ruthlessness of Lansbury's role as the mother, made a real psycho study. Lansbury's kiss on her son's lips created, for me, a "Whoa, wait a minute" moment. Streep's approach to the kiss, but with it not shown, didn't have the same impact at all.<br /><br />The remake, for me, teetered more into relationships, with Washington more dominant in the movie, with Schreiber next and being more sympathetic and likeable, and with Streep being less poisonous and much funnier. If Lansbury with her performance stole the show in the original, Streep with her performance kind of set the remake off center. I thought the original ending, with Raymond's death and Sinatra speaking what Raymond's real medal of honor citation could have been, had a lot of emotional power. The remake's version (after the twist) was much more conventional.<br /><br />I hope this turns out to be a turning point for Liev Schreiber's film acting career. He's done a number of films but has never broken through. But the guy is a powerhouse stage actor who can handle anything from Shakespeare to Pinter, and regularly does. Everything I've read about him underlines how he can dominate a stage. Brainwashing is a little old hat nowadays, but Schreiber make's Raymond's situation believeable. He's an actor to keep an eye on.<br /><br />And while I think Meryl Streep's performance keeps the movie a bit off balance (its such a showboating turn), she genuinely is repellant, funny and scary all at the same time.<br /><br />Richard Condon wrote the book these movies were based on. If you enjoy paranoia, read another of his books, Winter Kills. It's a good read, and made a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>The Manchurian Candidate is an excellent remake of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.  I didn't think the original movie could be remade, but director Jonathan Demme has succeeded.  During the Gulf War in Kuwait, Sergeant Raymond Shaw saves his squad during an ambush and receives a Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery.  Twelve years later, he becomes the Vice Presidential candidate in the presidential elections.  His commander during the Gulf War, Maj. Bennet Marco, has been having flashbacks about what he thinks really happened during the ambush and in the days afterwards.  Marco begins to investigate his nigtmares, and finds a huge conspiracy invovling politicians, terrorists, and mulit-conglamorate corporations.  What makes this movie good is that it does not try to be an exact duplicate of the original.  The basic storyline is the same as the 1962 classic with little twists and turns throughout, especially the ending, that keeps the viewer interested. The 2004 version is an excellent movie that can stand on its own and is almost as good as the original.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />  Denzel Washington is excellent, when isn't he?, as Major Bennet Marco, the Gulf War veteran trying to find out what really happened on that night in Kuwait.  Washington is very believable as a veteran struggling with post-war traumatic stress.  Meryl Streep plays Senator Eleanor Shaw, Raymond's mother, who has more than a few aces up her sleeve.  Watching her transformation as the plot reveals itself is creepy, although not as good as Angela Lansbury's performance.  Liev Schrieber stars as Congressman Raymond Shaw, the Vice Presidential Candidate who wants to believe what Marco tells him, but ultimately cannot.  Jon Voight also stars as rival senator Thomas Jordan, who Marco confides in.  The movie also stars Kimberly Elise, Ted Levine, Miguel Ferrer, Simon McBurney, and Bruno Ganz.  For an exciting, suspenseful thriller with an impressive cast and excellent story, check out The Manchurian Candidate!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>If you like movies about the big, bad corporate evil stalking innocent civilians and making unholy alliances to further their already outlandish power and profit, then you are going to love The Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />Ben Marco (the excellent Denzel Washington) was a Captain in a Gulf War incident, where his squad was attacked by the enemy and suffered two casualties.  The movie begins with him speaking to a troop of scouts about his Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (played expertly by Liev Schreiber) and how Shaw won the Medal Of Honor for his bravery in saving the squad.  Just outside this small meeting, Marco runs into Al Melvin, a disorientated squad member with a bizarre notebook containing sketches of his dreams.<br /><br />Like a slow leak, Melvin's revelations incite the unraveling of Marco's mind also, who attempts to confront Shaw with his own dreams that mirror Melvin's.  But Raymond Shaw is running for Vice President, a position that his mother, Senator Ellie Shaw (brilliantly played by Meryl Streep) used her power to manipulate him into.  Shaw seems a little strange, a little bit robotic, and reluctant to speak with Marco.  He seems torn by a force that is hidden inside him.<br /><br />Under all the political treachery lurks an enormous Corporation, Manchurian Global, contributing to both sides of the political dance but in fact backing a candidate they can completely control.  Ellie is obviously a tool of this conglomerate, but believes with pompous narcissism that she is always the one in control.  Running against her son's ticket to the white house is Senator Thomas Jordan (superbly played by Jon Voight), a man with enough power and experience in politics to thwart Ellie's plans for her son.<br /><br />Time reveals secrets unraveled, brainwashing, mysterious co-incidences, and a nasty evil-doctor villain named Atticus Noyle.  Ben Marco is in a race for time against his own sanity, and the only one he can rely on is a new acquaintance named Rosie (played by talented Kimberly Elise, who also appeared in John Q. with Denzel).<br /><br />You really must see the film, because nothing is what it seems to be, and at the pace that both discoveries and sanity unravel, it is truly a nail-biting experience.  Some of the scenes are a little disjointed, which in my opinion, follows the slide through Marco's mind.  There is a very bizarre dream sequence, and a very disturbing "incest is best" scene between Ellie and her son Raymond.<br /><br />A little reminiscent of vast deregulation spree of the 1990's, The Manchurian Candidate takes corporate greed and takeover-hunger to new heights of insanely dubious behaviors, one that we hopefully won't see in our own non-fictional future.<br /><br />Far outshining any other aspects of this movie is the absolutely spectacular performance of Meryl Streep as Ellie Shaw.  I thought she had reached her pinnacle when she made me laugh so hard in `She Devil', stealing the show from every other actress in it, but I would resolutely state that this is her finest performance to date.  She comes across as hard yet feminine, determined and demented, powerful and righteous.<br /><br />Teamed up with such a successful actor as Denzel Washington, for me it was a no-miss simply from the performances of these two actors.  Liev Schreiber is fantastic in his portrayal of Raymond Shaw, reminiscent of a talented cross between Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollak, very adept with facial expression and depicting emotion.  Jon Voight is phenomenal as Senator Thomas Jordan, and my hat is also off to character actors Miguel Ferrer and Bruno Ganz for their roles.<br /><br />If you like intrigue, brainwashing, evil corporations, and sinister doctors and dreams, then you should like The Manchurian Candidate.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme's retread of the old goofy-creepy conspiracy theory classic "The Manchurian Candidate" is a cheese sandwich.<br /><br />You read that right: this movie is a Cheese Sandwich.<br /><br />No, you haven't gotten back from a super-secret patrol deep inside Iraqi-controlled territory. No, you haven't been ambushed, sprayed by helicopter gunships bearing the gift of Better Living through Chemical Weapons, manhandled and hauled off to a super-duper-secret Gulf island laboratory/torture-center, and jacked up with implants.<br /><br />It's not the implants talking, Soldier---not now. This movie is a Cheese Sandwich.<br /><br />I mean that, quite simply: it's competently put together, nothing special, and does its job. And in an hour, not only won't you remember the Cheese Sandwich, but you'll be hungry all over again.<br /><br />Pretty dismal that with all that talent on-board (Denzel Washington, Jon Voight, Miguel Ferrer), a big sleek Hollywood budget, and one-time uber-director Jon Demme at the helm---with all that, the best Demme could do is a Cheese Sandwich?<br /><br />This time Commies are out, Corporate America is in, because we all know there's nothing more terrifying than a Private Equity firm (Manchurian Global) teeming with blue-pinstripe-suited bankers poring over their Wall Street Journal and checking their stocks while plotting global perfidy. Right? And also, because Commie China would never try to brainwash a U.S. President.<br /><br />Nope. Nosirree.<br /><br />I'm not a stickler for logic with either movie, though the remake is a little murkier: I can see why the nefarious Russians & Chi-Coms would brainwash Raymond Shaw---their automaton gets fingered, they have total deniability (and fairly hard-to-get at zip codes).<br /><br />But let's put ourselves in the cushy leather boardroom chairs at Manchurian Global, Remake Territory. Run it by me one more time why Managing Director Carstairs (ya know, the guy down the hall in Accounting) and I should put everything on the line---our careers, manor homes, Bentleys, family, fortune, freedom---to do this little Black Ops job on Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) and company.<br /><br />I mean, you take all that risk, and for what? At the end of the day we get a U.S. President you can flip on and off like a light switch---and who can double as a stone-cold killer on those days when you need an assassination done and the CIA isn't checking its voice mail?<br /><br />Ummm, I think not. You want your man in the White House? There's an easier way: it's called campaign contributions.<br /><br />Anyway, Demme's remake isn't a bad movie, nor, as some claim, is it a politically offensive movie. It's too unsure of itself, and ultimately far too bland, to be edgy enough to offend.<br /><br />It's stylish, sleek, techno, suitably paranoid and edgy. It's got Denzel Washington totally owning the Ben Marco role and making it his own, right down to grinding teeth and bulging, terrified eyes. It's got Liev Schreiber, who starts out as a creepy nutball and ends up as a creepy nutball & hot political commodity! See, brainwashing ain't so bad!<br /><br />You get a funky Wyclef Jean rendering of John Fogerty's old protest song "Fortunate Son", which gives the remake some wry, cynical street creds early on and sets up the mood. You get Miguel Ferrer and Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill from Demme's "Silence of the Lambs")---don't blink or you'll miss 'em. You get seriously, skin-crawlingly creepy Arab women wandering around showing off their insanely bad henna jobs. You get about an hour of taut, paranoid nastiness that had me thinking I was going to get a conspiratorial feast instead of---well, instead of cheese, bread, and a little mayo.<br /><br />Oh, you also get an appetizer of John Voight, who, after "Anaconda", should know to stay far away from the water. You get Meryl Streep confusing loud shouting for acting, yet again.<br /><br />But in the end, this is an amazingly stupid, sadly generic flick that will exit your mind, never to return, as soon as the credits roll. Think about it this way: you manage to dig an electronic implant out of your back, proof, finally, that there's something to these night terrors after all.<br /><br />Then you fumble the little gewgad, and it flies out of your slippery hands and down the drain.<br /><br />Now, stay with me here, Soldier---you're telling me that you---an Army Major, a combat vet, obsessed with getting a shred of evidence that those filthy corporate McNasties are running you like a little flesh-&-blood Rayovac---you're telling me you don't know you can remove the sink drainpipe to retrieve the damned thing?<br /><br />Terminate with Extreme Prejudice.

The original Manchurian Candidate that starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Landsbury (who won an oscar) and Laurence Harvey was a superior film and DIDN'T REALLY NEED A REMAKE.<br /><br />Yet, somehow, they managed to get me there. Strangely enough, when the movie started, I found myself there. Enjoying it. Into it. Wondering what was going on.<br /><br />There are some quality moments of UNEASINESS. Frightening scenes. Meryl Streep did an outstanding job filling Angela Landsbury's shoes. A terrible person. Not to mention, the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the realism in cutthroat, no mercy, do anything to win election poltics.<br /><br />But then, the movie dropped right off the planet for me.<br /><br />Everything was fine until, in order to get to the finishing point of the movie, two characters made decisions, based on conscious thought while under a hypnosis that couldn't be previously broken.<br /><br />A worthy attempt at a remake of a immortalized classic, dropped right into the trash can with a very very very convenient and poorly thought out finale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>While the ending of this film was basically given away somewhere in the first half hour of it, there was indeed one big surprise for the viewer: that director J.Demme delivered such a sad mediocrity.<br /><br />  With the storyline offering great possibilities for a great and very dark atmospheric film, Demme and the other contributors managed to make a boring saga that will have you reach for the fast-forward button in desperation.<br /><br />  The story is indeed full of holes (as other reviewers mention as well) and on another surprising note D.Washington is actually pretty mediocre here too. Someone either forgot to tell the scriptwriter or Washington himself that being brainwashed does NOT mean walking around in total stupor and half asleep.<br /><br />That is really one part of the film that borders bad comedy as Washington's interpretation of the brainwashed veteran trying to find out who's pulling the strings behind the New Order plot he's unwillingly involved in is simply horrible.<br /><br />  To make things unbearably worse, you know far too early what the actual score is (and if you failed to figure it out early enough i'm stupified myself). But that's not the main problem. That would be that the film is so unengaging that even if it did manage to keep its plot twist unrevealed till the end it would still be boring.<br /><br />  Aside of Merryl Streep who's probably the only bright spot of this flick, the casting is actually a disaster. The senator candidate looks like someone out of a toothpaste commercial and acts like someone out of a toothpaste commercial. Granted, some politicians do look and act that way, but this is not what this film needed. The rest of the cast are simply putting in a good day's work, grab the check and go home.<br /><br />  The biggest failure here is by far the script. Had the script been adequate the actors would've (perhaps) put in a better and more engaging performance. But that's as iffy as the plot itself if not more so. In a film like this, where the storyline has to be super tight in order to capture the audience it's exactly that element that falls loudly apart. Early on too.<br /><br />  All in all, keep this on your rental list for when you've run out of all the better and even lesser choices you've got. I'm sure that list is ever-expnading.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>When Major Marco (Denzel Washington) begins backtracking into the dim recesses of his mind that may have been tampered with by a global conglomerate, he finds that there is some solid truism to the movie cliche: "You know you are not paranoid when they really are out to kill you." A decade earlier, he and a congressman's son, Sgt. Shaw (Liev Schrieber) fight a winning battle with Iraqi insurgents with Shaw winning a medal for bravery.  At least that is the official army version. What happens from this point is a series of logical flaws that undercut the otherwise fine acting of Washington, Schrieber, and Meryl Streep in an over the top Hillary Clinton rant as the power hungry mother of Shaw.<br /><br />Marco believes that his entire patrol has been brainwashed for reasons that do not become clear until the film's close. What director Jonathan Demme tries mightily to do is to capture the relentless pressure that director John Frankenheimer managed to generate in the 1962 version of the original.  In this version, the focus was on the clash between a satirical poke at the political left and right that feared a communist was hiding under every bed. In the newer version, Demme substitutes a military-industrial conspiracy hodge-podge that replaces a red under each bed with a microchip in each cranium. The problem with such theories is that audience credibility  concerning the validity of the secrecy of such an all powerful group is strained when the number of conspirators exceeds the number of those killed by those same conspirators. Further muddying the plot is an odd Oedipal subtext concerning Streep and her film son Schrieber.  When a far too attractive and youngish Streep gets down on her knees in front of her semi-nude son and plants a non-motherly kiss on his lips, one shouts out: "Relevancy!"<br /><br />What is supposed to emerge from Demme's reworking of the Frankenheimer original is a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing a shadow government to call the shots in deciding a nation's political destiny.  What actually does emerge is a pseudo-thriller that instead points to the need for current script writers to remember what passed for true suspense in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>One has to wonder why re-makes are made of good movies.  The bad movies should be re-made to try to make them better.  Good movies are good, so why try to re-make them . . . I always enjoyed the Sinatra/Harvey original, which was crisp, credible, and where one can identify with the characters, and have feelings for them.  In this remake, there is very little, if anything or anyone that deserves empathy.  It is presented in a backdrop of doom.  Washington never smiles thoughout the movie and his character is so dark, one wonders how he can get up in the morning.  Raymond Shaw jockeys between a glad-handing and inciteful politician to a fruitcake, which makes him lose any credibility he might be fishing for.<br /><br />The plot centers on a shadowy corporate entity controlling much of the industrial and military activity in the world and which seems to be run by a cadre of silent and mysterious automatons.  How they can get into and out of the minds of the protagonists is kept well into the shadows, with little explanation.  Who are they, what are they going to do with all the power that they are accumulating . . are they supposed to be an update of James Bond's SPECTOR?<br /><br />I found nothing worthwhile in this movie.  It only made me want to see the original again, which was a real classic.  Can you imagine trying to re-make Casablanca?

I found THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE to be an interesting movie but a little confusing and lethargic. I found it primarily interesting because of the enigmatic performance by Liev Schreiber as Sgt. Raymond Shaw. Denzel Washington as Major Marco, the main character looked dazed and confused throughout the entire film and was a rather static hero. However, Schreiber's performance managed to gain more sympathy. Raymond Shaw is the most tragic character in the film and Schreiber brilliantly underplayed this role. Playing a character that basically shows no emotion throughout the entire film Schreiber's performance full of little nuances here and there brings the catharsis of this tragic figure to an emotional finale. It is only then that it becomes apparent that Denzel Washington as Major Marco must live with his demons. This film is riveting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Jonathan Demme<br /><br />Cast:  Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Liev Schreiber, Jeffrey Wright, Kimberly Elise, Anthony Mackie, Adam LeFevre, Ann Dowd, Simon McBurney.<br /><br />Running Time:  129 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence and some language.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" is "Silence of the Lambs" director Jonathan Demme's remake attempt at the 1962 classic.  In the new film, the villainous force isn't Communism, but capitalism, or more specifically, a vaguely defined corporate entity that hopes to rule the world. As such, in giving us a generic corporate villain, the film has all the gravity of a James Bond adventure. The change is revealing in that it shows the political correctness of Hollywood thinking (in not wishing to slur any ethnic group, or for that matter any specific political party), plus it shows the lack of creative thinking in Hollywood (by playing it safe and trite with the usual stereotypical band of rich, white, male Western capitalists as the baddies).  Denzel Washington plays Colonel Ben Marco, who we first meet delivering a speech to a Boy Scout troop about his experiences in the first Gulf War, and how Congressman Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, who deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) saved his platoon from an enemy attack. Marco, we soon discover, has been having mysterious dreams that say otherwise. Dreams of torture, medical experimentation, brainwashing, and murder. He is motivated to investigate the dream when he finds out from a former platoon mate (Jeffrey Wright) that he's not alone in wondering what really happened that night.  Meanwhile, Raymond Shaw has just been positioned as his party's reluctant nominee for Vice-President of the United States thanks to the machinations of his nightmarish mother (Meryl Streep), who is a US senator. Marco visits Shaw and tries to get Shaw's help in figuring out what happened, but Shaw is reluctant to get involved. he suspects Marco is insane. Little does he know, his mind is being controlled by the very same people Marco's been dreaming about.<br /><br />Arguably, the actors in this remake are better than the actors in the original, or at least Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber give more nuanced and complex performances. Yet, better isn't necessarily better. Frank Sinatra's Capt. Marco was a troubled man, who still was in control, he grounded the film; Washington's Marco is progressively more unstable and somehow less satisfying as a-man-no-one-will-believe clich&eacute;. Schreiber, who even looks a little like a baby-faced Laurence Harvey, plays Raymond with a gentle vulnerability, which would make him appealing as the would-be candidate, but it was Harvey's unrelenting nastiness that made it so ironic in the original that he ultimately became both heroic and sympathetic. This film begs you to like Raymond Shaw; the previous one dared you to. Even Kimberly Elise, whose Rosie is now an intricate part of the story, lacks that cool charm and dry humor of Janet Leigh's mysterious and ultimately irrelevant character in the first film. The characters have been rewritten, but not reenergized.  Streep, with the thankless job of trying to fill the iconic shoes of Angela Lansbury, gives her character a controlled ruthlessness that is perfectly believable; but lacking that mix of cold-blooded ruthlessness and cheerfully vicious opportunism that made Lansbury's performance a classic. Streep gives a fine performance; Lansbury gave a unique performance. Plus, by making Streep an actual Senatorm logical, given the times, her power is made obvious and the character is the weaker for it. Lansbury, on the other hand, was playing Lady Macbeth, a power behind the throne whose dominance was all the more frightening because it was unexpected, inexplicable, yet unquestioned.<br /><br />To their credit, the filmmakers have tried to follow the blueprint of the original film, while still adding twists and clever surprises to make the story different, if not fresh. Unfortunately, many, if not all, of the changes don't work or don't improve anything. Despite a reasonable effective start the film begins a downward arc, right up to a twist-upon-a-twist ending that makes the unlikely plot seem simply stupid. It says something when you end a film with a political assassination and still can't generate suspense. And it doesn't help that the convention and rally sequences all look totally fake.  Some films are simply products of their times; they don't translate to different eras. Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate" is one; it plays as fresh and exciting today as it did them, but it is nonetheless an artifact of the Cold War era. It tells us something about America, circa 1950-1965. All Demme's "Candidate" tells us about 21st century America is that Hollywood has gotten lazy.  Not a bad film by any strech of the imagination, but not up to the original version.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>My Dad and I used to have this conversation.

The answer is absolutely.<br /><br />Yet we all know of some flops where great technology and acting couldn't carry the show. And this is certainly one of them.<br /><br />First of all, Meryl streep is fantastic. You might have only expected that but still beautiful, powerful, manipulative, evil, sexy . . . she plays it to the hilt. And Denzel also does marvels with what he has to work with. Laurence Harvey was more sympathetic-creepy as Sergeant Raymond Shaw but Liev Shrieber does a credible job.<br /><br />That's it. The plot is so convoluted that by the end, you have no idea of what's going on. Holy Cow it was an incredible (as in virtually unbelievable) story (Richard Condon) to begin with but Sinatra (I never thought I'd say this) and Harvey and Janet Leigh gave us a road to follow and we did. Here, by hour number 2, Meryl Streep's having conversations with people that I suppose I'm supposed to understand play a significant role but I can't figure out what it is. Or who they are.

The story, of course, has been updated beyond its Cold War roots, meaning the communists aren't the villains anymore.  (I won't tell you who they are, but aside from Nazis, who is a villain of convenience nowadays?)  That also means that the plot is needlessly top heavy with details and machinations, turning a story that originally was chilling in its simplicity into something cumbersome, as well as more brooding than frightening.<br /><br />Likable Denzel Washington steps into Frank Sinatra's venerable shoes as Ben Marco, the Army major unfortunate enough to have his squad turned into diabolical experiments in mind control.  This time, he isn't suffering only from nightmares but from what seems the worst case of Gulf War Syndrome on record.  Lacking the pathos of Lawrence Harvey, Liev Schreiber makes for a reptilian Raymond Shaw, the soldier at the center of what may be a fantastic assassination plot, only this time, he's a senator with designs on the White House.  (This script jettisons the Johnny Iselin character, thus robbing the movie of some of the original's bitingly satirical moments; it also maddeningly reduces Shaw's near redemptive romance with a political opponent's daughter to an expository footnote and trades the functions of some characters.)  But perhaps the biggest flaw is Meryl Streep's generally histrionic approach to the role of Raymond's mother.  As acclaimed an actress as she is, Streep's portrayal seems a burlesque of Angela Lansbury's stunning foray into villainy.<br /><br />Demme's direction is less taut than in "Silence of the Lambs" and showier but often less effective than John Frankenheimer's - oddly enough, some deleted scenes show a better grasp of the concept than what made it into the theatrical version.  The original, an almost perfect film, remains the definitive version.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>While being accompanied by a member of the press during the Persian Gulf War, an army unit is ambushed.  The men of the unit don't remember much of what happened after the attack but they all remember that they were saved because of the actions of Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber).  After the conflict, Shaw was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor by his commanding officer, Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington).  Shaw won the award and the recognition he received allowed him to successfully run for political office.<br /><br />Years later Major Marco runs into another member of his unit, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) from those days who questions Marco about what really happened in the desert and asks him if he ever has any dreams.  Marco politely dismisses Melvin's accusations, but he knows he speaks the truth because he hasn't stopped having any dreams since he returned home and he spends his time off duty as a broken man.  Melvin's meeting sets off a chain reaction with Marco's brain and he begins to remember things better.  When he sees that Raymond Shaw has been nominated for a Vice Presidential nomination, he sets out to meet with Shaw and discover the truth.  It's a journey down a rabbit hole more terrifying than anything Alice ever met: from mind altering implants beneath the skin, convenient murders, brainwashing, with an international corporation known as Manchurian Global trying to covertly take over the world.<br /><br />When I first heard that Hollywood was going to remake THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, I was very skeptical.  The original film has become a classic example of political intrigue.  That film was made in the heyday of the Cold War and not only captured the hovering suspicion leftover from McCarthyism, but also portrayed the attempted assassination of a president, eerily foreshadowing what actually happened to President Kennedy just a few month later.<br /><br />Two generations have passed since original THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and the geopolitical landscape of the world has changed drastically.  Except for the overpopulated nation of China and a few small countries scattered around the globe, Communism no longer poses a threat to democracy.  In its stead we are faced with a new type of conflict that has no national, political, and religious borders.  This new conflict provides the opportunity for businesses to engage in legal international war profiteering, something that the world has never seen the likes of.  It is against this backdrop that the new THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is set warning not of sabotage from a foreign power, but of a secret and sublime internal takeover brought about by corporate greed.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  The acting is top-notch with fine performances from all lead actors (Washington, Schreiber, and Meryl Streep as Eleanor Shaw give Oscar-worth performances) and most of the supporting cast.  The script has been rewritten in such a way that it doesn't mess with the spirit of the original film and novel, but is able to add some new twists and present the troubling concept as a very real possibility more relevant than ever in our current political landscape.  The film has a great plot, wonderful writing, and some very powerful artistic and directorial techniques that add to overall tone.<br /><br />Of course, even if I believed otherwise I might not say it because even now they're watching you, you know.<br /><br />The DVD includes a commentary with director Jonathan Demme and co-writer Daniel Pyne, a couple of featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, outtakes with optional commentary, and Liev Schreiber's screen test.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>First of all: I haven't seen the original movie "The Manchurian Candidate", so I can't compare both versions of the story as many other reviewers have done.<br /><br />The present movie is a techno-thriller more or less routinely done without any outstanding feature.<br />If you consider that director Jonathan Demme has directed "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) and "Philadelphia" (1993) and expects a film on par, you'll be disappointed (as I was). On the other hand the movie is quite entertaining, even if it is a minor opus, enough to deserve being watched.<br /><br />The story follows Maj. Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran, that little by little realize something "strange" has been done to him and his patrol mates pending a three day lost period in desert.<br />He starts a one-man crusade against all odds to uncover the dreadful plot leading to manipulate next USA's Vice-President.<br /><br />Denzel Washington as Maj. Marco and Liev Schreiber as the Candidate give solid characterizations. Nevertheless, in my opinion, is Meryl Streep as Sen. Eleanor Shaw, the candidate's powerful and ambitious mother, who gives the best performance of the film.<br /><br />This movie is a good standard pastime.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>Updated to contemporary times, "The Manchurian Candidate" opens with a sense of foreboding and unease, feelings effectively maintained throughout the film, during the days of Gulf War I as an Army platoon is ambushed in the Kuwaiti desert. Although two soldiers were killed in the firefight, the rest were led to safety by Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), including the platoon's leader, Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington). As a result, Shaw, the son of the esteemed Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), became a Medal of Honor winner and parlayed his heroism into a political career. Marco, on the other hand, spends his days giving speeches where he mindlessly recites the details of the firefight and spends his nights suffering from surreal nightmares that suggest that there might have been more to that fateful night than what he remembers.  Or what he thinks he remembers.<br /><br />Political junkies will have a lot of fun with the jabs the film takes at the gullibility of the news' media and the buying and selling of whorish politicians.  From Saudi Arabia to John Kerry to Halliburton, the movie rarely stops to take a breath from drawing parallels between its fictional world and the world we reside in.  Sometimes it comes uncomfortably close, giving the film a sense of dread that will most likely only be noticed by the politically conscious.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Demme does his best to keep the film entertaining for the apolitical with his snazziest directing since "The Silence of the Lambs".  The dream sequences are frenzied, distorted and disturbing.  Demme achieves the same sense of dread here as he did in "The Silence of the Lambs" with numerous flashbacks and nightmares just as in John Frankenheimer's original.<br /><br />This film is blessed with an incredible cast.  Meryl Streep gives a truly creepy performance as Senator Eleanor Shaw, a virtual Hillary Clinton clone.  Liev Schreiber manages to be scary, frightened, threatening and vulnerable, all in the same scene.  Denzel Washington gives one of the most compelling performances of his career as Ben Marco.  Washington manages to hold his own against constant comparison to Frank Sinatra's portrayal of Marco in the original.  The fear Washington's Marco is feeling washes over the audience and kept everyone on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" is a smart contemporary film that takes familiar genre conventions and gives them a reasonably intelligent spin. True, it doesn't hold a candle to John Frankenheimer's original and it never comes close to approximating the boldness of the original film. However, it is a slick thriller that contains some first-rate performances and moves along quickly and efficiently.  Unlike "The Stepford Wives" remake, "The Manchurian Candidate" is a good film that can stand on its own two feet; a sign of a decent remake.  While it doesn't hold a candle to the original film, 50 years from now people will still be watching Frankenheimer's version, it doesn't do it any grave dishonor either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Hollywood remakes or reworkings, especially if the originals are considered masterpieces, are very hard (if not downright impossible) to equal, let alone top.  Such is true with Jonathan Demme's 2004 remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 masterpiece THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  But while it can't really match the impact of the '62 original, it still scores in its own way.<br /><br />This time instead of the Cold War, the setting is in the aftermath of the first Persian Gulf War.  Denzel Washington is Captain Bennett Marco (the role played by Frank Sinatra in 1962), who suspects that the man who saved him durng an ambush in the Iraqi desert in 1991 may have undergone brainwashing.  That man is Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, in the role first played by Laurence Harvey), who is now a potential candidate for vice-president of the United States, all the while being fiercely manipulated by his calculating, cold-blooded mother (Meryl Streep, doing Angela Lansbury's role).  The villains in this film are not the Manchurian Chinese of the '62 original but a big-time corporation called Manchurian Global, who have implanted Harvey (and Washington, for that matter) with electronic devices that can force the subject to do the company's bidding...even if that means making one of them commit a political assassination to put a corporate lackey in the Oval Office.<br /><br />Having three big pairs of shoes to fill, Washington, Harvey, and Streep do very fine work all the same, with some slight differences.  Demme indulges in many face-on shots (a stylistic trademark of his reminiscent of what he did on PHILADELPHIA and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), which is a bit irritating after a while, but otherwise his direction of the film is quite good, and he gets fine performances from his three leads, as well as Jon Voight in his role as a senator vying for the spot Havey wants and whom Streep hasn't the time of day for.  Veteran character actor Charles Napier and Demme's low-budget director/producer mentor Roger Corman also have cameos here.<br /><br />Although the climax is a bit disappointing in comparison to the disturbing aura of the 1962 original, the 2004 version of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a smart and cunning political thriller all its own, well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep is the kind of actress who impresses you no matter what she does, be it mediocre (she was the lone bright spot of Stuck on You) or masterful (she was a powerhouse in Angels in America), so I was kind of scratching my head a bit when I realized that Streep, reprising Angela Landsbury's notorious role in this remake of the 1962 political paranoia thriller, doesn't have much screen time. That's right, folks, one of the greatest living actresses on the face of God's green earth comes on breathing fire and brimstone in a great scene in the beginning, pontificating and pointing that slender finger like a knife...and then she kinda disappears for a while, letting the revamped plot of Candidate take hold.<br /><br /> And as a plot, it's a little iffy. In 1962, the villains and instigators of a high-level plot to control politics were the commies and Laurence Harvey's Raymond Shaw was merely a noted war hero. Demme and his screenwriting team have made &quot;Korea&quot; into &quot;Gulf War,&quot; &quot;Commies&quot; into a corporation called &quot;Manchurian Global,&quot; and (*scratching head*) Raymond Shaw into a possible Vice Presidential candidate (???). I know Demme and his writers were trying to transfer the movie's pertinence into an area we recognize today, but the contrivances of its plot ever-so-slightly feel just like what they are: a director desperately trying to turn a remake into as much of his own as possible.<br /><br /> Demme is a talented director, though, and he does keep the early scenes of the film charged with a looming paranoid feel that did have me feeling the vibes of the original. And homeboy can do a great close-up, too; those camera-up-your-nose shots Demme favored in Silence of the Lambs are nearly as effective here, especially in a scene where a psychologically damaged Gulf War buddy (Jeffrey Wright) comes to inform Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) that he, too, has been having dreams that something else happened on a mysterious night overseas. These dreams that both have been having send the paranoid Marco on a quest to find out the real truth about Raymond Shaw (aptly played by Liev Schrieber), and that consumes most of the film.<br /><br /> Problem is: it's not deliriously engrossing, like the original made it. Marco begins realizing he's right more and more, jumping through the loops of a prevalent conspiracy, and this just kind of goes on and on and on. As I said before, Meryl Streep's Eleanor Shaw disappears from the film, we never see anyone from Manchurian Global, and Kimberly Elise really botches her reprisal of the sultry Janet Leigh role (also changed, in its relation to the plot). Demme turns the movie on a kind of auto-pilot, fading out scenes in a hastily edited fashion, permitting Washington to stammer and yammer like he's posessed by Woody Allen, and even alters the emotional pull of the movie.<br /><br /> I have no problem with a director trying to elicit emotion from his cast and building a scene fraught with it. But, in my opinion, characters in a political thriller should not cry. Case in point: a scene in which Marco and Shaw are together alone in a room. Shaw gives him more and more information about how he might be brainwashed, the ominous (and repetitive) score by Rachel Portman gets heavy in the back...and then Shaw elicits a single tear. WTF?<br /><br /> But Liev Schrieber triumphs, despite that insipid little weeper of a moment. Denzel Washington, on the other hand, can't really escape the way the part has been written for him. In the (yes, I'm bringing it up again - that happens when you remake a classic) original film, Frank Sinatra's Bennett Marco was a strong man who was deeply disturbed by a dream he knew was right. Put in the present day, Washington's Marco never seems confident for one minute; in fact, he seems to be crushed by the very volition of the movie, and you should never crush Denzel Washington. Only if he decides to act like he did in Training Day.<br /><br /> I think I know where they were going with the whole &quot;let's make Denzel a pussy&quot; deal. And that, friends, is this - botching the ending of The Manchurian Candidate like nobody's freaking business. If you've seen the original, you're likely to hang yourself with your underwear when you realize that Demme actually changes who does what in the film's climactic scene (I was ready to). More than that, though, I came to a realization that the grave misstep that the movie makes in that big scene, well, negates the entire purpose of The Manchurian Candidate in the first place. I want to run up to Jonathon Demme right now and scream, &quot;What in the hell were you thinking???&quot; It's that ridiculous.<br /><br /> And it's kind of a shame. The Manchurian Candidate, had it stayed closer to both the plot and the emotional resonance of its predecessor, could have been a gripping yarn that succeeded on technical, narrative, and character levels. Demme's movie has altered all three, and he comes up a little short in each case, which is kind of a bummer for such a great cast (Meryl Freaking Streep!) and such haunting material. The movie has its moments (I sure liked seeing Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire, but that's just me) since it's well-photographed and occasionally suspenseful, but in the end I still can't see any point in its existence. Denzel, Meryl, Liev, and Demme could have all made great, original contributions to film instead of this unneeded remake. All this movie does is reminds you how much of a masterpiece the original was.

In pre-Desert Storm Kuwait, Captain Ben Marco (Washington) and his convoy are attacked and captured.  Three days later, they are found alive - supposedly rescued by Raymond Shaw (Shreiber), a member of the convoy.  He is awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor, and thirteen years later his is running for vice-president.  But Marco is having nightmares about those three days; days that are blurry in his memory.  He comes to believe that Shaw may not be the hero that everyone believes he is (himself included), and begins an investigation into matters.  When he finds others in the convoy are also suffering from nightmares, his paranoia increases.<br /><br />I have never seen the original, but this remake, from director Jonathan Demme, delivers a sufficient amount of mystery and intrigue to keep you on the edge of your seat almost until the credits roll.  My only complaint is that they attempted to deliver a type of "happy ending" to the film.  To some extent, it takes away from what has happened just before it.  That is all I can say without giving it away, but if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.  Denzel Washington gives another excellent performance as the tormented Ben Marco.  Meryl Streep offers up the right amount of bitchiness and creepiness as Raymond's Hillary Clinton-like mother, Eleanor.  This movie was definately better than I anticipated, and I would highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Despite a great cast headed by Denzil Washington,Meryl Streep & Jon Voight, this remake is extremely disappointing.

Demme is no John Frankenheimer, his direction is competent but plodding and I found myself waiting for this film to end rather than being tied up in knots as I did with the original. Washington may be a better actor than Sinatra yet the original contains proof that Frank was a fine film actor (also check out "Man with the Golden Arm" to verify this!)and he delivers.

Like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake. Or Chinese cinema. "We will tell you what to think." The locals might mistake it for a documentary. I quit watching after 30 minutes.<br /><br />You just can't carry an entire movie with a "fake war hero via hypnosis" plot. No movie should hinge on a single plot point, and if it does, please don't make it a boring one. No disrespect to Denzel Washington intended. He played Frank Sinatra so well that co-producer Tina Sinatra probably got goosebumps. And what a waste of Meryl Streep.

The original is a landmark film, a timely incarnation more appropriate for release at the center of the Cold War when brainwashing soldiers and/or government officials was not met with as much cynical skepticism as it is today.  Having said that, this remake is actually a surprisingly professional creation with director Jonathan Demme at the helm.  His best work remains "The Silence of the Lambs" and he continues with his penchant for close-up full frame shots of peoples faces speaking directly into the camera as if the audience as a whole comprised the character being spoken to.  He is a good director but all directors have their trademark signatures.  The entire cast shows up this time around, as well, each and every performance adding both texture and believability to their roles.  If I am pressed to point out any singular performance here it has to be that of Meryl Streep.  I will place a significant wager that she will receive yet another Oscar nomination for her reprise of the now infamous Angela Lansbury performance of a conniving, power hungry, manipulative Arch Angel protectorate who will see her son reach the height of political power at any cost.  She has many outstanding moments.  But all the paranoid intrigue this story invokes is not all that amazing now at the heart of the Information Age as it was during the Cold War.  If you have not seen the original then this film might seem inspired, albeit sometimes incredible to entertain.  My advice is to compare the original version with the one here then buy the one you prefer.  The original version is oftentimes mesmerizing and highly inventive, while this updated version is professional and caters to a more modern audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>When I first learned there would be a re-make of what may be my favorite movie I cringed.

If youhaven't seen the original, stop now and go rent it.<br /><br />Taking on a remake of one of the finest films ever created takes stones. Jonathan Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne (The Sum of All Fears) and Dean Georgaris (Paycheck) decided to do something exceptionally risky; not only sis they update the script for The Manchurian Candidate to the present day, they also wrote a "based-on" screenplay that would twist things so that those who have seen the amazing original would still not know what was coming. It was, to say the least, an admirable idea, and had it worked, this new version of The Manchurian Candidate may well have stood with the original as a piece of American film history. Unfortunately, the practice didn't quite gel with the theory.<br /><br />Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a troop of men in Kuwait just before Desert Storm. The men, now known as the Lost Platoon, were ambushed, and Marco was knocked unconscious, leading the way for Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), after taking out the enemy, to lead the troop back to civilization for three grueling days across the desert. In the time since, Marco has stayed a career Marine, while Shaw has gone onto a career in politics, driven by his obsessed mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep). Thanks to Eleanor's machinations, Raymond snatches the vice-presidential candidacy out from under the nose of Tom Jordan (Jon Voight), with whose daughter Jocelyn (Vera Farmiga of the TV series Touching Evil) Shaw had been involved before joining the armed forces. Or, at least, that's how everyone remembers it. Marco is approached by one of the Lost Troop, Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright of Basquiat fame), who's been having disturbing dreams about those three days. Marco's been having the dreams, too, and he undertakes a quest to figure out what really happened to them during those three days in the desert.<br /><br />The Manchurian Candidate may be a remake, but it's informed by a number of things that have come between (most notably Jacob's Ladder), and so the updating-to-the-present-time part of the screenplay works better than one would expect it to. The new plot twists also work on a number of levels. Where the film fails is in its attempts to bring the original screenplay into the mix. A number of scenes (especially the garden party) and characters (most notably Jocelyn) seem as if they've been left in for the purpose of pacifying fans of the original film, and serve no real purpose in the remake. What actually happened in the desert is presented here in far more impressionist fashion than what happened to Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey in China in the original, and the whole things ends up being confusing, rather than illuminating. (Kudos to the screenwriters for keeping the title relevant while changing the setting, even if they did take something of an easy way out). The film's other stumbling block is that one of the new twists gives portions of the climax an overly moralizing tone that really wasn't necessary.<br /><br />All that said, the usual suspects turn in some amazing performances. The infamous kiss shared between Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury in the original film is played with even more understatement here by Streep and Schreiber, and it's just as shocking in 2004 as it was in 1962, though more open to interpretation. Some time in this (or any) review of the film should be given to the performance of Liev  Schreiber, who has quietly amassed a resume of excellent performances under the Hollywood radar, and blossoms here, albeit as a supporting actor. (Washington's Marco has morphed into the film's main character, whereas Frank Sinatra played the supporting role to Laurence Harvey in the original, despite Sinatra and Harvey having roughly the same relative status in Hollywood in 1962 as Washington and Schreiber have today.) If anything good comes from this film, it will hopefully be Schreiber seeing more lead roles.<br /><br />An interesting flick, but one that pales in comparison to the original. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>You're not paranoid if they are out to get you.  Remakes are programmed to succeed. Give the audience something familiar and their more likely to go to it. It's like comfort food for the eyes.  Remakes are a tricky business. Change the plot too much and you risk alienating fans of the original film. Don't change the plot enough and fans of the original will be bored. Meanwhile, those that DIDN"T see the original will wonder what all the fuss is about. Usually the result is a film that gets lost and that no one sees. Jonathan Demme's failed remake of "Charade" was a case in point of everything that can go wrong with a remake. Luckily, "The Manchurian Candidate" succeeds where that remake failed by touching on the themes of the original film, updating the story for a post-9/11 world and through careful casting. Although it's flawed, it's still a powerful film that will leave an impression with audiences. Hitchcock liked to point out that suspense thrillers aren't really designed to connect with common sense or answer all the questions we expect. That would be true of "Silence Of The Lambs" and also the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" as well. Demme realizes, like Hitchcock, that suspense thrillers don't necessarily have to have the orderly clock work precise logic of a mystery. They have different purposes. The former is a mind puzzle the latter is just designed to keep you glued to your seat.<br /><br />In the midst of the Gulf War a platoon of soldiers fight off an enemy advance with their Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) fighting off the enemy single handedly while his commanding officer Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is incapacitated . Or did he? It seems that members of Marco's platoon are having nightmares about what happened and these nightmares, which seem vividly real, suggest that something else entirely happened and that, in fact, Shaw killed one of their own and that this is some sort of weird plot to deceive the American public. Since Marco and others members of his troop appear to be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome and symptoms of paranoia, their observations are discounted until Marco discovers some troubling information<br /><br />A number of interesting extras include the usual "making of" featurette. The best featurette is the one on the cast of the film. We get to hear the cast discuss their characters, their reasons for interest in a remake of a paranoid thriller/political satire. There's also deleted scenes (which help to clarify a couple of plot points but aren't essential) as well as the screen test that actor Liev Schreiber did with Meryl Streep for Demme prior to production. Schreiber clearly was the perfect candidate for the movie with his boyish good looks and undercurrent of vulnerability. There's also an option to watch the uncut faux news program hosted by Al Franken with optional commentary as well.<br /><br /> Director Demme and co-screenwriter Pyne discuss not only the nuts and bolts of working on the movie but what their intensions (even if they don't always work and they'll admit it themselves first) were. Both clearly enjoy each other's company and compliment each other very well covering material that the other hadn't thought about.<br /><br />An exceptionally good remake that updates this classic paranoid satire for contemporary audiences, "The Manchurian Candidate" brings Richard Condon's novel and John Frankenheimer's classic 1964 film to life with nice unique touches all its own. While Demme's decision to make the political satire more subtle is questionable (based on a lot of reviews here some folks missed that angle), Demme's sure hand and the script by Pyne and Gregarious provide the perfect canvas for the cast to express themselves. The outstanding cast manages to make their characters uniquely their own. If you're unsure of the film, I'd suggest renting it first and seeing if appeals to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The decline of Jonathan Demme into derivative hackery has often been put down to the curse of Oscar, but it's to be hoped that after his horribly misguided remake of The Manchurian Candidate the only way is up. Even were the original not such a terrific movie, this one would fall on its lack of wit or imagination, not least because of a strikingly poor script by Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris that not only fears what's best in the novel and the original film but also lacks logic, momentum, satire, characterization or, most crucially for a thriller, suspense or even cheap thrills. There are a few positives: the red menace now becomes Haliburton - sorry, Manchurian Global - the romantic interest has a more valid reason for involving herself with an obvious psychiatric case and there is one neat switch in the finale. Unfortunately they're all thrown away, with an epilogue that is truly absurd, while the political commentary is never embedded in the narrative but crudely pasted on in the form of news reports. And is it just me, but why do the hands-on villains have to be Brits? Can any nation have treated their allies in not one but two Iraq wars with such open contempt?<br /><br />Even on a technical level, at times it's strikingly clumsy, be it the often crude editing, the inane nightmare sequences or the literally unbelievable sound mix (those cheers on the nomination speeches set a new low in credibility). But the biggest problem, along with chronic overlength, is that you never care about anyone in the film. Whereas Laurence Harvey's pathetic cold fish latched onto Frank Sinatra's Marco even though he knew he despised him out of a terrible and desperate loneliness born of self-loathing in the original, Demme and Levine keep the two apart for most of the film, denying both of them the relationships with `normal' characters that highlighted their damaged psyches in the original. Nor are the actors able to draw you in much either. Denzel Washington is on poor form for much of the film until his paranoia takes him over Parallax style. Liv Schreiber fares better, but seems to be channelling Robert Foxworth circa 1978. But the real nail in the coffin is Meryl Streep, an actress who may have heard of subtlety once but has since gone out of her way to avoid it at all costs, giving the worst performance of her career, displaying an unbelievable assortment of ridiculously over the top mannerisms that put you in mind of a drunken Robert Newton playing Widow Twankey in a rundown seaside town's annual Christmas panto. Her Wicked Witch of the Far Right constantly screams "LOOK AT ME!! ME!! ME!!! I'M ACTING!!! I'M ACTING!!! AND I'M GREAT AT IT!!!" through a megaphone. Her every scene is just painful to watch in a rather silly, drawn out film that aspires to be average and almost makes it.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a remake of the 1962 political thriller.  This time, Captain Bennett Marco is played by Denzel Washington.  The movie kept reminding me of the new dream thriller "Inception" where planting ideas in the brain by invading one's dreams or subconscious.  The Manchurian Candidate had the same thesis of planting thoughts and erasing how they got there.<br /><br />This newer version of "The Manchurian Candidate" focuses on soldiers from the Iraq War as the test subjects.  Capt. Bennett and Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) are taken captive during the first Iraq invasion, The Gulf War, and brainwashed to rebel once they return home.  Ten years later, Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep) is determined that her son become president, and pressures the Convention to get him on the ticket as vice president nominee.  She gets her way and we soon realize this is just the first step.  Shaw's mother has taken over Shaw's life.<br /><br />As Marco begins to unravel the brainwashing, he does Internet searches and soon remembers the geneticist that plants ideas.  Not only has he found a microchip in his back and Shaw's, ideas are planted deep inside the brain.  Soon it becomes a race to beat the brainwashing plot.<br /><br />This film holds your attention as this political thrills to the amazing climax.  I think it is better than the 1962 version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme's version of "The Manchurian Candidate" was a favorite film of mine that recently came to my DVD collection as the result of a great price.  Demme won the Oscar for directing "Silence of the Lambs" in 1991.  I enjoyed watching the DVD extra interviews with him, only wondering why he didn't use a razor.  :)<br /><br />There is no doubt that with two Oscars for "Kramer vs. Kramer" in 1979, "Sophie's Choice" in 1982 & numerous other nominations, Meryl Streep is one of the most acclaimed actresses of our time.  However, it was this film for which she was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes that really made me a Streep fan.  To watch her glide through Eleanor Shaw with elegance, polish and the cold-blooded instincts for political survival was incredible.  The scene where she's wearing purple sunglasses and swirls around lecturing the other Manchurian Global bigshots was breathtaking.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber who I recently enjoyed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a> does an excellent job as Congressman Raymond Shaw.  Schreiber has been nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a TV movie or miniseries for "RKO 281."  As Shaw, he does a masterful job of playing the polished politician with perhaps too strong ties to his mother's apron strings.<br /><br />That said, Denzel Washington turns in another blockbuster performance as Maj. Bennett Marco.  Washington has two Oscars for "Glory" in 1989 & "Training Day" in 2001.  The levels he achieves -- from the stable military commander to the unstable programmed assassin to a confused man trying to figure out a puzzle -- result in a varied & excellent performance.  Demme particularly complimented Washington on the scene where Marco tells Shaw that there is a strong bond between the two of them.<br /><br />Jon Voight who won his Best Actor Oscar for "Coming Home" in 1978 as a stressed out veteran does a good job here as Sen. Thomas Jordan who gets squeezed out of a vice presidential nomination.  Vera Farmiga who I'm enjoying in the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001840TU8">Never Forever</a> and who played in "The Departed" performs well in the cameo appearance as Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of Sen. Shaw and the past romantic interest of Raymond Shaw.  Her demise is as strangely beautiful as it is violent.  Kimberly Elise who was in "The Great Debators" plays Rosie with depth, the F.B.I. agent who becomes sympathetic to Washington's Bennett Marco.  Jeffrey Wright who has recently played in "Casino Royale" as well as the new James Bond film "Quantum of Solace" does a masterful job as the unstable Al Melvin who is haunted by his dreams, writes them down in a journal and scribbles disturbing drawings on the wall of his flat.<br /><br />Demme keeps the pace moving, the intrigue breathtaking up to the final shots in the film.  This was a great picture whose performances make it worth viewing.  I also found the issues of just how much control the people actually have in a democracy when those elected constantly try to control the outcome to be relevant to present day.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme's "The Manchurian Candidate" is a superb and timely 21st Century remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 classic of Cold War terror and paranoia.  For this new version, the Cold War has been replaced by the War on Terror as the menacing background against which the story unfolds, but, apart from that, the major plot points in both films are virtually the same.  Both involve a group of soldiers who are brainwashed into believing that one of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, is a hero whose unquestioning bravery and quick thinking on the battlefield saved the lives of most of the men in that squadron.  (The original's Korean War setting has been updated to the Gulf War's Desert Storm).  In fact, upon his return, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, a tribute he eventually parlays into a career as a United States congressman.  After several of the men in the squadron begin having the same recurring nightmare in which they are being subjected to murderous hypnotic suggestions, one of them, Captain/Major Bennett Marco, comes to suspect that they may all be the victims of some nefarious scheme to implant them with microchips to get them to believe something that is not true.  One of the few key differences between the new version and the old version is that the "Manchurian" of the title no longer refers to the Communists who do the brainwashing but rather to a mega-corporation (called Manchurian Global) that has positioned itself as the master puppeteer pulling the strings of government behind the scenes.  And in its scathing vision of modern day politics, the film asks just how much of our freedom and civil liberties we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for "security" and "safety."  No theme could be more timely.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to "The Manchurian Candidate" to reveal too much about its ingeniously contrived plot, which is chock full of intrigue, suspense and larger-than-life events and people.  The dominating figure in the nightmare scenario is Eleanor Shaw, an uber-powerful senator and the ultimate Machiavellian matriarch, whose unrelenting and nefarious effort to get her craven, mediocre Congressman son elected Vice President, serves as the engine that pulls the story forward.  Thus, while Marco spends his time trying to piece together some semblance of the truth out of the fabricated memories and distorted half-truths spinning around in his jumbled memory and mind, Eleanor works her way to the ultimate position of power.<br /><br />This new "Candidate" gleans its topicality and its contemporary significance by zeroing in on the nexus that exists between politics and the corrupt military-industrial complex - a connection made even more frightening when the latter, working in a moral vacuum, is able to employ the latest in technological advancements to further its cause.<br /><br />Although the surrealistic elements are probably less shocking today than they were in 1962, the film still does an amazing job replicating the dislocation and fragmentation of Marco's mind, establishing a beautiful balance between the world of "real" reality and the world of virtual reality, a concept that seems far less incredible in this day and age of ubiquitous computer technology.<br /><br />Denzel Washington takes over the role of Marco, originally played by Frank Sinatra, and Live Schreiber replaces Laurence Harvey as the mother-dominated Shaw.  Both actors are superb.  But it is Meryl Streep, stepping in for Angela Lansbury as the Big Bad Mama Supreme, who walks off with the film.  Her portrayal of a ruthless and icy Lady MacBeth who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is bone-chilling and unforgettable.<br /><br />In an age in which most thrillers are formulaic, empty exercises in high-tech wizardry and flash, perhaps it was necessary to reach back 42 years to find a work of power and substance to remind us of just how dangerous it is to allow modern technology to fall into the hands of the power-hungry and the ruthless.  Indeed, what this gripping tale of an attempted coup against the United States government manages to do is to remind us that, even in this age of international terrorism, the greatest threat to our unity as a nation and our safety as a people may actually come from within.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>I am generally against remaking old classic movies.  However, there are some that have worked for me; KING KONG, THE FLY, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, even the current WAR OF THE WORLDS.  The reason primarily is that they were genuinely REMADE with the current times.<br /><br />CANDIDATE retains the basic premise of mind conditioning and Raymond Shaw's rather twisted relationship with his mother.  The film starts in 1991 Iraq and follows through to the post-terrorism paranoia of today.  There are many other changes in the story as compared to the original film, which, like it or not, is what remaking a movie is all about.  If not, you end up with an inferior carbon copy of an original, like Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO (what the hell was that idiot smoking when he came up with that idea???).</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Note:  Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />This movie was one that required your utmost attention throughout and still you missed things. The DVD version is much better than the theater run because you can rewind and re-watch for things you missed.  This makes it worth owning.<br /><br />A group of soldiers are brainwashed to think that one of them was a war hero, when in fact nobody was in combat.  The "war hero" was being pushed by his ex-senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep in her first truly "evil" role) into politics and is on the verge of a possible nomination for the vice presidency.<br /><br />Some of the men start having recurring dreams that make them doubt what they thought was reality.  Denzel Washington, who was leading the soldiers back in the Gulf War, wants to get to the bottom of it.  Each time he gets close to some information he is told that he needs to continue taking his "medication" for the Gulf War syndrome.<br /><br />Things really get confusing when Denzel is being followed by government people and locates a computer chip in his back, that has capabilities that Denzel's friend who is a computer expert says could not possibly exist.<br /><br />The viewer can kind of figure out the Manchurian corporation is somehow behind everything and that it is all an elaborate plot to get the "war hero" into office.  The tension mounts however, where the viewer doesn't know how things will play out and if Denzel's character will come out of it alive.<br /><br />I</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.<br /><br />This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.<br /><br />Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).<br /><br />By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.<br /><br />Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.<br /><br />Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>The political importance of The Manchurian Candidate, a movie based on the novel written by Richard Condon, is excellent because it teaches us how power corrupts and absolute power has the ability to corrupt people, process and society absolutely. Lina Navarini and I set out to see the version played by Frank Sinatra in 1962, followed by this remake by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />The first movie takes place during the aftermath of the Korean War, but now the plot takes place after the Gulf War. Now played by Denzel Washington, Bennet Marco is an infantryman who experiences recurring nightmares because he was kidnapped and through an implant on his back and another in his teeth, the enemy is able to plant false memories in his mind and in particular, in the mind of Raymond Shaw. Mr. Shaw, candidate to Vice President of the US, upon receiving a phone call that triggers his mind to do whatever he is told, is capable of murder, without "guilt or fear" therefore, little risk of being discovered.<br /><br />The purpose behind altering the neuron connections and re-wiring the brain of these Americans is a desire to place a man in the White House that would do anything the enemy desires. Imagine the power the enemy would have if they were to control the United States of America.<br /><br />But Bennett Marco is haunted by dreams with images that make him question reality. The platoon told the world that Sergeant Raymond Shaw, played by Liev Schreiber had rescued the platoon soldiers, to the exception of two who perish. He has told the world that Raymond Shaw saved them, when in his dream, he remembers Shaw murdering one of the soldiers.<br /><br />Shaw is decorated as a war hero, given the medal of honor, a distinction that is rarely awarded, but his dreams make him question whether they have been brained washed to believe Shaw had saved them. At first, Sinatra feels that he may be going mad and goes to see military medical personnel in search for help and support. They too believe he is experiencing post traumatic disorders, and they remove him from any duty, asking him to go on vacation and to rest.<br /><br />But another member of the platoon is also having the same type dreams and soon they realize that there is more to this story than meets the eye. Denzel Washington becomes Mr. Shaw's nightmare as he gets close to him and unravels a rather sad personal story, where we learn that Shaw's mother has manipulated her son's life in search for fame and glory for she has plans for him, to transform him into the President of the United States. The mother's role is masterfully played by Meryl Streep, now a Senior Senator who took over the vacant seat left by her husband. She is ruthless, displaying a Machiavellian attitude that the end justifies all means to get her son elected and we soon find ourselves hating this manipulative, controlling, and mad woman. As with the first version, this movie is simply a magnificent political thriller, don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I have to give credit to screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris for the way they played with the original 1962 screenplay by George Axelrod based on Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate."  The original film is a classic and for all those who have seen it this 2004 version provides minor twists and turns for all of the major characters and plot points.  You know what is going to happen, but not exactly, so that Jonathan Demme's film works pretty much equally well for those who have seen the original and those who have not.<br /><br />Of course, for those who have seen the original Denzel Washington plays the Frank Sinatra character (Captain Marco), Liev Schreiber the Laurence Harvey character (Raymond Shaw), Meryl Streep the Angela Landsbury character (Raymond's mother), and Kimberly Elise the character played by Janet Leigh.  Forty years down the road politics has changed enough that now Raymond's mom is not married to a U.S. Senator but one herself and Raymond is now the title character.  The "Manchurians" this time around are not Chinese Communists but a multi-national corporation, which actually makes the situation more realistic than the original (at least in terms of the villains).  Despite the appearance of liberal gadfly Al Franken as a television commentator, there really is nothing to really pin down which political party we are talking about here, which is fine, because it works either way.<br /><br />On the eve of Desert Storm a reconnaissance mission is ambushed.  Most of the unit survives and Sergeant Raymond Shaw is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.  When he returns to the United States he is elected a Congressman from New York and is pushed for the vice president spot on the party's ticket by his Senator mother.  But Marco and the other members of the unit have been having the strange dream and are becoming convinced that the story they have been repeating is not what really happened.  By the time Marco finds something under the skin on his back, it seems there is something at work here that is more serious than depression or Gulf War syndrome.  Could it all be some giant conspiracy?  Oh, you had better believe it.<br /><br />One of the ironies of watching this version of "The Manchurian Candidate" this particular week is that as Raymond Shaw is suddenly put on the presidential ticket while there are media references to "the Lost Patrol" that he saved, there is no effort by the media to contact Marco or any of the other members of the unit.  This week everybody who ever stepped foot on a Swift Boat during the Vietnam War, whether they knew John Kerry or not, gets to be on television.  But Shaw the war hero has no contact with the men he supposedly saved and nobody in the media seems to notice because that would make playing out the game here a lot more difficult.  So we make allowances.<br /><br />Washington's Marco does not get to be as heroic as Sinatra was in the original, not only because the script takes a slightly different tack but also because we have a different expectation today of what happens to people when their brains get messed with my mad scientists.  Schreiber does a nice job as the man who is caught in between who he is, who he wants to be, and who he remembers he was once upon a time.  I think that those who insist on seeing Hilary Clinton in Streep's performance are missing the point, because I see sure signs of the hyperbolic female talking heads on television news programs.  Pyne and Georgaris get special credit for fixing the major hole in the original film, which was why Janet Leigh takes up with Frank Sinatra (it always bugged me since it suggested it was setting up something but was not).<br /><br />In case it is not clear, if you have not seen the original version of "The Manchurian Candidate," then you should do so.  At this point you should probably wait until after you have seen this one and if for some reason you feel you should only see one version then it should definitely be the original, but it does belong on your must see list, even if it is in black & white and the Cold War means nothing to you.  For everyone who has seen both films, I definitely doubt that anyone will prefer the new to the old, but I also think that few viewers will consider this remake (or updated version) to be an insult to John Frankenheimer's original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It's natural to compare a remake with its original. But I may be one of the few who like the pacing, the look and feel, and the general acting of this new one better. It's just easier to watch on the DVD and the theme is easier for me to relate to. Sure, the script could have packed more punch and pastiche (certainly our present world lends very well to notions of impeding danger, both on a national and corporate scale) but as it were, taken on its own merit, this is still a very taut thriller. Certainly a decent rental, at least, as just about anything with Meryl Streep usually is.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>I have seen the original THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE since I saw this remake, but I must say this film was very different from anything I have seen before at the time. I found THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE to be an interesting movie but a little confusing and lethargic. I found it primarily interesting because of the enigmatic performance by Liev Schreiber as Sgt. Raymond Shaw. Denzel Washington as Major Marco, the main character looked dazed and confused throughout the entire film and was a rather static hero. However, Schreiber's performance managed to gain more sympathy. Raymond Shaw is the most tragic character in the film and Schreiber brilliantly underplayed this role. Playing a character that basically shows no emotion throughout the entire film Schreiber's performance full of little nuances here and there brings the catharsis of this tragic figure to an emotional finale. It is only then that it becomes apparent that Denzel Washington as Major Marco must live with his demons. This film is still riveting in its own way.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The script is the spine of a film; I guess there must not be any doubt about it. And this is, precisely the main default: there were too unfinished many details and the cast direction was really terrible.<br /><br />Let's start with the FBI female agent: simply unbearable; I really couldn't believe it: this role was a fundamental piece in this puzzle script and facing her with Denzel Washington the difference increased exponentially: inexpressive and extremely flat acting without hues.<br /><br />What happened with Meryl Streep? This character wasn't understood; the perversity, cruelty level and moral depravation shown by Langsbury can not be reduced to a cynical smile and some frenetic raptures. The audience does not know anything about her past; there wasn't a simple flash back about her relationship with her husband; Streep was extremely monochromatic, vapid if you want if you consider her actress status, she seemed to be absolutely absent. I just think in three actresses who perhaps could match with this extremely complex role: Jessica Lange would have been my first choice, Glenn Close (Dangerous liaisons and Fatal Attraction are enough evidences she likes and even handles those border edge roles), or Helen Mirren.<br /><br />What's up with the implant as dramatic support?, insipid and imprecise.<br /><br />What about with the wasted talent of Mr. Voight?  his lines seem be written by a personal enemy. The dramatis personae about a crisis of such magnitude were not polished at all.The dialogues do not reflect the real magnitude of what's goin' on.<br /><br />In the other hand, Denzel saves the game with his undeniable talent but it wasn't enough. Roland Shaw character was OK but Demme doesn't feel comfortable with this political thriller. I just can think in three directors that know this land and domain the multiple involved implications: Phillip Noyce , Wolfang Petersen and Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Finally the pretentious twist of fate of the original script at the end of the film, was a true anticlimax.<br /><br />It would not be fair to compare this remake with Frankheimer's original. It would be a sin and besides an insult!</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>First, this is not a new movie with the same script. It has just enough differences to keep you interested, if you knew the original, while staying close to the original.<br /><br />Sometimes, it was eerily close. Meryl Streep played the role that Angela Lansbury originally had - I had never noticed the facial resemblance before. Liv Schreiber took Laurence Harvey's position as Raymond Shaw, and brought close resemblance to that role as well. The whole nervous tone of the movie was another good match. The constant background murmur of newscasts kept terrorist attacks, arms buildups, and the rest at the edge of attention. It worked fairly well in place of the original's Cold War jitters. And of course, Denzel Washington worked well - but he always does.<br /><br />A few things didn't quite keep the tone of the original. There's a weird edge to the Shaws' mother/son relationship - enough to reinforce the over-all badness of the bad guy, but otherwise gratuitous. There's also an attempt at a happy ending that just didn't work for me. Still, those weren't enough to turn me off to the movie.<br /><br />For once, a remake approaches the original movie. It replaces the Cold War bad guys with more contemporary villains, and doesn't try to follow precisely in the original's footsteps - changes that I'm sure will offend some viewers. Still, it's a good attempt and a good movie in itself. The only problem with this is the impact and importance of the movie that it follows, giving this one an impossibly high standard to meet.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie had very good acting: Washington, Schreiber and Streep were all excellent. The plot was tight and suspenseful. The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own. The remake filled in some of the pot holes that were opened in the original and created some of its own. The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters. However, Denzel's character very sympathetic.<br /><br />I am stuck because I don't want to reveal the changes in the plot. The original Manchurian candidate has the Cold War as its milieu. The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings. It is just not as scary as the communist scare.<br /><br />It is a good movie and the acting is very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The first time I saw "The Manchurian Candidate." I went so far as to think it was the worst film of the year. But then I noticed that everyone around me started to like it, so I figured. Why not? I watched it again and you can tell by my review that I liked it this time. The film is truly brilliant, it's got great cinematography, the acting is spectacular.<br /><br />Academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme (Best Director, "The Silence of the Lambs.") is just amazing. The only true problem(s) I have with the film is, the ending which is way to drawn out, the beginning credit sequence (which is WAY TO DRAWN OUT) and the acting by Liev Schreiber is at some times horrendous. Schreiber is quite possibly one of my least favorite actors. The movies main character is Major Bennet Marco (Two Time Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington, Best Supporting Actor "Glory" and Best Actor "Training Day"). Marco served in Operation Desert Storm along side Raymond Shaw (Schreiber). The way things played out is rather mysterious to Marco. After the enemy opened fire, Shaw saved the entire crew and won the medal of honor. But, the crew also disappeared for three days. Now, Shaw is running for vice president (the man also happens to be somewhat of a mommas boy for Senator Eleanor<br /><br />Shaw (the terrific Meryl Streep). Marco begins having dreams and begins to uncover a conspiracy that involved Shaw and Manchurian Global, a big time company. Now, before I saw the film I wasn't familiar with what was gonna happen. I didn't know about the conspiracy part which is what I think turned me off about the movie. But, after my second viewing I noticed that this movies melds (perfectly) a number of genres:<br /><br />Drama, comedy, horror, action, paranoid thriller, etc. One of the most entertaining films of 2004, see "The Machurian Candidate".  A-<br /><br />PS, I have never seen the original. This review is for this film and is not compared to the book or original film in any way.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a sleek, stylish thriller about power, politics and paranoia. It is a remake of a truly classic 1962 thriller, which was directed by John Frankenheimer and starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.  While the new version is both scary and entertaining, the original is powerful enough to blow the viewer away.<br /><br />The film starts in Kuwait in 1991 just before The Gulf War officially started. A US army patrol, led by Capt. Ben Marco [Denzel Washington] is attacked. Allegedly due to the heroism of Sgt. Raymond Shaw [Liev Schreiber], who receives the Medal of Honor, all but two members of the patrol are saved. The mysterious thing is that after the attack, three days elapse before another unit finally locates the `lost' patrol.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2004. Sgt. Shaw, son of powerful US Senator Eleanor Shaw [Meryl Streep] is now a US Senator. Eleanor, the mother of all pushy mothers, sees Raymond as a candidate for Vice-President. Aided by her allies at Manchurian Corp., a huge multi-national company to which she has sold her soul, she can achieve this. Enter Capt. Marco, who has spent the last several years trying to figure out what happened in those `lost' days. Raymond is clueless. Eleanor has all the clues and more. Can Marco thwart a diabolic plot to overthrow our government?<br /><br />The new version has an advantage over the original. It is far more likely that our nation will be taken over by giant corporations rather than by Communists, as the original foresaw.<br /><br />The original triumphs because it is both a monument to great filmmaking and a product if its time. As horrific as 9/11 was, it can not compare to the fear of 1962, which was nuclear holocaust - the end of civilization as we know it. People today can not fathom what paranoia was back then.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>SUPERB, ON A LEVEL WITH MR. DEMME'S 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"! THE ACTING BY MS. STREEP IS CERTAINLY OSCAR WORTHY, MR. WASHINGTON FINALLY HAS A REAL ROLE AGAIN THAT HE THROWS HIMSELF INTO, AND MR. SCHRIEBER GIVES HIS BEST EVER PERFORMANCE. I WAS SO INTENSLY INVOLVED, I HAD TO PAUSE IT TWICE-YOU JUST DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT'S HEADING, OR WHOSE SIDE IS PLAYING WHOM, INCLUDING THE FEDS. IT'S A BRILLIANT, BREATHTAKINGLY PACED TWISTING THRILLER, WITH A FINE SCRIPT, LAVISHLY PHOTOGRAPHED, AND A MUST OWN FOR ANYONE'S DVD COLLECTION.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>I loved watching the original for historical perspective (the scripting and wardrobe....etc), but the "communist front" threat used in that same release is no longer a credible threat in modern American politics.<br /><br />Now... corporate influence is an entirely different story.<br /><br />This screen play in this version was honed just right that I actually forgot it was a remake. Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep lead a cast of highly talented actors. Because they are not 'just going through the motions' of an earlier script, viewers will leave with chills....and food for thought.<br /><br />The high adaptability of politics to constantly changing times also means the 'new' ending does not detract from the enduring film message (which itself has not changed): Candidates which apparently seem too good to actually be true are likely fronting for another organization.<br /><br />Better than Michael Moore's documentary, 'The Manchurian Candidate' makes an excellent argument for increased voter participation and independent candidate scrutiny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>The Manchurian Candidate had me on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie. During one of the scenes I actually jumped and my candy fell on the floor. That how intense the movie was.<br /><br />Just watching the scenes where the military are brainwashing the soldiers - is so frightening and scary. When I left the movie, I was saying to myself "Now that was scary". Just the Sci-fi elements added to the brainwashing techniques were amazing.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gives an outstanding performance as the over-bearing political mother who will do anything to get her son elected to office. But I think at Oscar time Liev Schreiber will be on everyone's list. He certainley does an excellant job portraying the brainwashed political candidate. Denzel is also great as the military man who is the one that figures out the truth of what is going on.<br /><br />One of the best and most suspenseful movies of the Summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>This summer thriller entitled &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a really scary but also really well executed update of the 1960s original version of the novel. Featuring a stellar cast of Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, and Jon Voight.<br /><br /> Denzel Washington is the center actor in this movie playing a horribly scarred Gulf War veteran who returned home from the war in Iraq in 1991 after liberating Kuwait from the Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. More than a decade later, he has been having recurring nightmares about the memories of what really happened during his time in Kuwait and he beleives that he was the subject of a medical experiment where a medical device is implanted in the brain to brainwash the subject and use them for sinister purposes. The devices are the products of a corporation called Manchuria Inc.<br /><br /> However noone believes him except a friend who was also a veteran of the Gulf War. Now he must convince his friend not to run for president of the United States but his mother is a power-hungry individual who 'cares' deeply for her son but isn't exactly what she is thought to be.<br /><br /> This movie is really chilling and really delivers the scares through it's suspenseful tone and the frightening portray of what it's like if criminal corporations actually brainwash their victims to cover-up lies, crimes, and other horrific deeds. The acting is superb by most and the directing is excellent. One of the scenes was very hard to stomach however but overall, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a thriller worth seeing on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Why remake The Manchurian Candidate?  The original is perfect.  Meryl Steep and Denzel Washington are great, but how can you replace Angela Lansbury and Frank Sinatra?  Jonathan Demme is one of my favorite directors, but lately he's only doing remakes of superior films (he remade Charade as The Trouble with Charlie).<br /><br />That being said, The Manchurian Candidate is about as good a remake as could have been hoped for.  On the downside, we all know the key plot point.  However, the story itself is so good, so timeless, and so TIMELY, that it seems new.  There are several key differences between this version and the original that mark the passage of time.  The character of the Mother need no longer be relegated to a senator's wife - she is a senator herself (thereby completely doing away with the need for the Johnny Iselin [Joe McCarthy] character).  The methods of brainwashing in this film are more sophisticated but, unfortunately, they have done away with the game of solitaire.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest challenge for the filmmakers was the title itself.  In this film, to mark the changing times, it is evil corporations and not communists that are trying to take over America.  The evil corporation is Manchurian Global (get it?).<br /><br />I have to say that some of plot points in the newer version make more sense than the original.  The original Raymond Shaw was just an assassin; there are enough willing assassins in the world, unfortunately - they don't need to brainwash anybody.  In this film, Raymond Shaw IS the Manchurian Candidate.  The good people at Manchurian Global make sure that their time with Ben Marco isn't wasted either.<br /><br />In the end, this is a good movie - another variation on theme.  You can watch it and enjoy it, but it will never replace the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>I must confess that I found it difficult to follow the plotline of this movie, although Meryl Streep is superb as the ultimate in controlling and domineering parents. The premise is that during the first Gulf War a supposed Iraqi attack on a patrol is staged by Americans. The surviving members of the patrol are carefully programmed to believe that one of their members, the son of a powerful politician, acted heroically to save their lives. That soldier was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and is now being pushed as the vice presidential candidate for the party that will most certainly win the election.<br />  Denzel Washington plays the leader of the patrol and he is having uncontrolled and disturbing flashbacks that contradict the official history. He also encounters another member of the patrol suffering from the same condition. As the story unfolds, it is a deep conspiracy to carefully manufacture a background that will win the vice presidency and then remove the president so that the programmed candidate will assume the presidency.<br /> Because the conspiracy is so deep, it is at times difficult to follow the sequence and you wonder what the truth is. However, the constant of Streep as the Dragon Lady of manipulation keeps the sequence going and provides an anchor. For you understand throughout that she is pure evil and power hungry, willing to destroy her own son in order to acquire political power.</p></br></body></html>

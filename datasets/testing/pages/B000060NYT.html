However, take someone with you to hold on to.  It has the ingredients of classic horror flicks of the past and the sounds, scenes and expressions are a script for terror.  I felt my skin crawl for the first hour and jumped out of it (my skin, that is) five times.  It's been a long time since a film has had that effect on me...and I'm an avid horror flick fan.  It has bits and pieces of &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and a little-known low-budget classic &quot;The Funhouse&quot;.  I give the first hour FIVE stars.  It drops to an overall rating of 4 as the horror dwindles and dwindles and dwindles.  But you are so frightened from the outset, it keeps you on your seat till the end.  Only two nagging points --- the sound of the failing transmission in Trish's Chevy...and Darryl's overused facial expressions of terror.  Other than that...GO SEE IT!  It'll give you the creeps...jeepers creepers, that is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Man, talk about bad timing!<br /><br />Let's say you're happy-go-lucky college kids heading home for college break: brother Darius (Justin Long), sis Trish (Gina Philips), two kids motoring it across those lonely, barren stretches of miles and miles of---well, miles and miles.<br /><br />You'd think that in America these days, we've digitally connected and sewn up every last b*stard inch of the Great Lonely Howling Spaces, that we've blasted microfiger and digital optic networks and cable stations with five-thousand channels into the back of beyond: that there really is no wild stretch of highway where the normal laws and conventions of society hold sway.<br /><br />Oh, but there is. Go on a road trip: look at all those lonely diners marooned along vast, forsaken strips of blacktop. Take one of those empty little roads to nowhere, three turns away from the Interstate: go bumpity-bump down a dusty trail to a gas-n'-go that closes shop on Sunday because---well, there's just no business in these parts on Sunday, Old Hoss.<br /><br />Flip the radio on right about now: chances are you're going to get a load of Jesus. Come to the Lord! Hell awaits! Satan stalking the Earth, hungry as a lion, seeking those who He can devour, Hallelujah!<br /><br />Thousands of Americans disappear every year, in our great interconnected Republic: it's true, many run away, change their names, disappear, start new lives.<br /><br />But it's also true, I think, that many of them set out on road trips, and get eaten alive.<br /><br />So you're Darius and Trish, and you have the worst timing ever. Because, see, on this particular stretch of blacktop, you've got this Thing. A Troll, let's say: an Ogre, the Boogeyman, a Monster. Every twenty-three years it awakens: for 23 days, it gets to Eat. And by Jesus, it sure is hungry!<br /><br />Timing is everything.<br /><br />Now: director Victor Salva is a real sicky: I'm going to avoid into the man's history of pedophilia---though I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way. The Creeper doesn't just stalk Darius---he has a lark sniffing his undies!<br /><br />But look: the true ghoulish glory of "Jeepers Creepers" lies in its simplicity: you're on the road, you're tired, you're hungry, you want to sleep. Without meaning to, you see a dark, hulking figure---all inky shadows in its duster and broad-brimmed hat---dumping what appear to be bodies down a corrugated pipe, into God knows where.<br /><br />It sees you.<br /><br />And oh God, though you wish it weren't so---though you later wish desperately you hadn't seen *it*---it comes hunting for you.<br /><br />It's outside your window right now. Looking in.<br /><br />That's the guts and bloody viscera of "Jeepers Creepers"---forget the goofy psychic lady, forget the gratuitous Eileen Brennan---and focus down on the dark, stark, deeply twisted sickness of this flick about the Boogeyman hot on your trail, looking you up, coming calling to your bedside to give you one of those great parting gifts and---oh yes---a long, sweet kiss in the Dark.<br /><br />Pucker up.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"Jeepers Creepers" is one of the ultimate horror movies, scary, awe-inspiring, emotionally powerful, and outstandingly made.  Like its sequel, it's the kind of movie that starts off extremely strong and compelling, and doesn't lag for a single second, right through the end credits.  What it starts out with is a brother and sister driving across the prairielands on a crosscountry trip home during a college break, when they encounter something dark, sinister, and dangerous, but which they're left compelled to investigate because of the simple fear that others may be in deep danger if they don't.  What they encounter is the Creeper, and his lair; and one of the most inventive and flat-out awesome of all horror mythologies to ever spring out fully formed upon the screen.  Twists and turns abound, all of them superbly played out.  Excellent characterization, cinematography, and special effects.  An all-time great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>Terrifying<br /><br />the ending shocked me the most<br /><br />see this movie<br /><br />quite an amazing horror movie to watch<br /><br />scarier every time I watch it on my dvd player</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>This is actually a well plotted above average teen horror flick from director Victor Salva(most recently seen in the drama film Powder)<br />The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are truly tense and quite scary as we find a young brother &amp; sister travelling home for spring break in an old car. As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common &quot;in your face&quot; horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &amp;  the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.<br />The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;. There are several short scenes of gory violence, but not too much to warrant an R rating otherwise. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>For all virtually unknown actors of the film, Japanese release of "Jeepers Creepers" was a national-wide, theatrical one, which is surprising, even considering the fact that it has got the U.S. No.1 position of weekend box-office chart.  But the reason was to be soon clear: for the film was executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola, and on the Japanese poster his name was printed prominently, as if Coppola himself directed this work.  I wish he did.<p>Justin Long and Gina Philips are ordinary pair of a brother and a sisiter on the way home until they saw a lusty brown truck rushing from behind.  Not a usual sight on the country road, you know, and nearly they got killed by this spooky truck flying like a bat from hell, they get duely curious.  It ia a foolish thing, of course, but as some wise guy said long time ago, to err is human.  So, they decide to stop the car in order to get a good, clear peep into the place where the truck pulled over.  But wait a minute, the driver might be someone you should never meet, someone not very friendly.  <p>"Jeepers Creepers" is, indeed, a scary movie if you could devide the whole work into three parts, and see them one by one.  In fact, the film's script is made as if having three segments, each of which shows this weird "driver" in point in  different forms.  However, this is the part where many inveterate horror flick fans' opinions divide; some say the film changes its rules too much, making it a nonsense in the end; others say it is a unique, good, old-fashioned horror movie.  The truth is, the director Victor Salva ("Powder")  gives his own visions as a homage to old, classic genre films -- thriller, horror, monster flick, respectively -- but fails to hold them together with a tight grip.  Each scene is shot with a keen eye to details, to be sure, and the introduction of "Jeepers" is really a knockout scene: just look at a dashing truck coming suddenly from the back of the car, which surely gives you a genuine thrill.  <p>However, the stylish visuals of the film is made, sacrificing its storyline, which eventually recedes into a series of simple homages to films in the past.  The first part is clearly inspired by Spielberg's "The Duel"; the middle part with ominous ravens is a homage to Roger Corman productions like Poe's adaptation; the final chapter, showing a winged strange craeture, naturally reminds us of the monster flicks made in the 40s and 50s -- such as "The Thing" as you may remember.  The total effects of the film, therefore, never go beyond that of those past masterpieces, and as a result, its shocking wrap-up scene seems to be covering up the fact that the script of the whole film needs re-writing, which would have definitely saved this rather uneven, illogical horror film from being what it is. <p>The two leads are good, if not particuarly superb, showing exactly a realistic bond of sister/brotherhood, and Eileen Brennan's cameo adds a propelling power that "Jeepes" sometimes lacks.  I know there's a plan of sequel, but hope they take more time to produce it next time.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>As ridiculous a title as this movie has, you might assume that it's a teen slasher gore-fest. But the graphic violence is minimal, and much emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two adolescent siblings, Trish and Darry. Their sibling rivalry, with its petty bickering and silly games that only the two of them understand is refreshingly accurate, and they don't become all lovey-dovey when trouble comes their way.<br /><br />And trouble they have. A demon who, according to psychic Jezelle [Patricia Belcher] is permitted to feed for 23 days every 23 years is on day 22 of its eating binge. It captures young healthy people whose scent makes it wild with desire. It takes only certain parts, eyes to help it see, hearts to help its own heart stay strong and beating, and so on. Then it sews up the corpses to preserve them in a quilt, which it keeps in the basement of an old church (desecrated, no doubt). When Trish and Derry see one of the demon's sewn up, quilt-bound bodies dropped through an old pipe that leads into the basement of the church, they feel compelled to go back and see if they can help the victim. But the victim is beyond help, and now the demon has their scent, and it loves what it smells of one of them--which one, we do not know. But the demon is after them as a final addition to its collection.<br /><br />Along the way, Trish and Darry never suddenly turn into best friends--they annoy the heck out of each other up until the very end. But they do band together, as siblings will, and their private games and one-ups-manship tells us that their relationship is deeper than either would admit. The love-hate feelings of siblings is very well done, and is one of the highlights of the movie. Too, like most horror movies with teen protagonists, we never see parents, and parents would be of no help. This movie, and others like it are an allegory for the transition to adulthood that we all must make on our own.<br /><br />I do wish they'd thought more about the title, but Jeepers Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>I remeber seeing Jeepers Creepers my sophmore year of college and thinking it was one of the scariet movies one I'd seen in the theater since Pitch Black. The film reminded of Spilberg first film Duel. The script is fast paced and the acting it top notch from the young cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Trisha (Gina Phillips) and Darry (Justin Long) are a college-aged brother and sister driving home on Spring break.  Typical of that age, Darry is bringing his laundry home for his mother.  All is normal until they encounter someone with what appears to be the most severe case of road rage ever.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, a massive, paint smeared, rusted, ominous truck appears.  It even comes with the loud, obnoxious, fog horn.  In a matter of no time, it's on the kid's bumper, tailgating and honking, scaring the hell out of them.  They eventually let it get by, and the license plate is revealed: BEATNGU...foreshadowing.<br /><br />Just as their fear and worry has subsided, they run upon the same scary truck parked at an old, abandoned church.  The driver is outsie of the vehicle, and appears to be tossing bodies wrapped in bloody sheets down a large pipe of some sort.  Unfortunately for them, the person sees them and quickly jumps in the Fearmobile for the chase.  This time, however, the truck starts ramming the kids' car and scaring Darry and Trish until they run off the road.<br /><br />What follows is a tale of fear, as brother and sister go back to investigate the pipe, and uncover a grisly reality that will shock and terrify them.<br /><br />The unfortunate part of this movie is that the bad guy turns out to be a completely cheesy, winged, alien of some kind.  When it is presumed to be a mysterious, evil man, the fear is much more palpable.  But when the large human/bat/chicken thing shows itself, the tone is completely different.  And don't even get me started on the whistling - completely stupid.  After an entire movie of mystery, suspense, and genuine terror, the killer's ridiculousness acts as the cold shower to the movie's built up heat.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>man, when i watched this movie all i saw were good things. from the previews alone i knew it was going to be scary good, and i was not let down. jeepers creepers, it's a name you won't soon forget. it's not about a gorefest movie, or things like that. it's more about the suspense. it gets pretty intense at some points. i really enjoyed it, and i've watched it many times since. first off, big points for coming up with a wicked looking demon. man, that was nice. pretty unforgettable you know. the whole idea and concept of the film was bangin. this demon comes out to hunt for 23 days and all he does is eat. eat what? well human body parts. whatever he's lacking or has a hunger for if you've got it he wants it, and he won't stop following you until he gets it. he sniffs you out and he decides from who he will take by smelling your fear. now that was nice. unfortunately he's been doing this for a long time, and two innocent kids just happen to stumble on him while riding on this deserted road. they see him, they get curious, and bam he's onto them. the chase is on. he follows in his beat up truck, very eerie looking, and he doesn't give up. the kids are up against something so horrible they have no idea, and by the time they do it's to late. it keeps you at the edge of your seat, and gives you that shiver right down your spine. the ending is great. didn't see it coming, but those screams down in that dark place gave me the chills. what a piece of work. after this you can't help but wonder what's really out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>A brother and sister, heading home on college break down a highway that looks like the never ending "route 66" have a encounter with a big, black, ugly van that holds an evil presence, in the form of a part man, part bat and part devil/evil.<br />I do have to say that this isn't your usual horror, cut-em-up, splatter flick. It actually is a creepy, spooky, intelligent scare movie with fantastic acting.<br />Because the main characters are teenagers the basis for this old fashioned horror has elements of innocence, fear, and the overt feeling that these kids are really terrified and alone in their nightmarish isolation.<br />This movie really got under my skin because it delves into the true psychological nature of what truly terrifies us----"the unknown."</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>This movies has a real mood that hits dead on the mood and style of 70's horror flicks (much like Cabin Fever) although it doesn't really do much other than use certain camera techniques and a psychic woman it does it pretty well.  The Creeper is a very cool creature, and the arguing brother and sister aren't really a common set of main characters in other movies, so they help with the believibility of the story.  The story pretty much revolves around two siblings trying to get away from a monster guy who drives a really sweet (yet durty and old) truck and tries to eat them.  The whole point is that he likes to scare people and that's why he doesn't kill them at first.  He only is awake for 23 days every 23 years (I own the movie and I'm not for sure on that though).  There are some pretty cool scenes that add a little suspense and some locations that add to the overall creepy (no pun intended) mood of the story.  Victor Salva, who has an interesting past that I won't go into, does not focuse as much on blood and gore as he could, but goes more for suspense and scares, which is cool since we get enough gore in this day and age.  I think horror fans should go for this, but I'm not sure if the casual moviegoer will enjoy this.  They might not understand it's purpose.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>I personally believe the Horror movie industry began a slow decline in the mid 1980's. It seemed like every possibility had been used up and audiences could not longer be spooked with gory special effects or imaginative use of the cinema camera. Auteurs like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, George Romero and even hacks like Lucio Fulci began to get progressively worse as the 1980's wore on. At this time, American horror movies began the development of "character" driven horror movies (since the good guys where all victims, only the baddies could get character development) and this led to serial series including horror stalwarts such as Freddie Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voohees as well as lesser knowns like the Tall Man (Phantasm). These serial horror movies (Jason X, Freddie VII, Halloween H20, Puppet Master 15) led to the downfall, because while the series runs out of ideas after the second movie, the movies are continued to be made.<br /><br />The 1990's brought some interesting ideas. I liked movies like People Under the Stairs (1991), Scream (1996) and others, but the genre has not recovered. In the early 1980's, Jeepers Creepers would not be considered much of an atmospheric movie (compared to movies like "The Fog" or "The keep"), but in a genre in which movies like Jason X and The Haunting exist, Jeeper's Creepers does pretty well.<br /><br />The movie starts with a brother and sister pair going home for Spring Break. Darry (short for Darius) is the younger brother, who is a goof and easy going. Trish is the older, more cynical sister. As they drive, they play silly road games (like we all used to during long road trips) and pick on each other, however, there is always an air of tension in the air that lingers even in the most lightest moments. It is helped by the fact that the soundtrack is very much in the background, not manipulating the audience.<br /><br />Terror does appear in the form of an old battered truck that terrorizes the teens. It is an homage to Duel, one of my favorite movies of the 1970's. However, soon we find out the identity of the driver as the kids pass by and see him dropping body bags into a sewer. In a scene that defies all logic, but falls under the "rules" that govern horror movies, the two go back and investigate what is happening. What they find is horrifying, but not too original (Salva and his production designer must have seen one Coffin Joe movie too much).<br /><br />The being catches their scent and begins tracking them down and the movies turns into a cat and mouse game, with the protagonists frantically running and the antagonist turning into the indistructible shape. While the movie begins to term generic and the baddies turns into another Freddie like character, the ending was great and does provide a slight twist.<br /><br />Victor Salva, who was notorious as being the "child molester" director has directed two movies that I have seen. Clownhouse is a low budget movie that was fairly well done, but his first big budget movie "Powder" was simply horrible. With Jeepers Creepers he starts out well, but as the story develops, the audience learns too much of the creature and it begins to lose it's mystique (One of the reason why the movie Duel was so great was because we never understand the motives of the crazy trucker). At the end we find out he's just another movie monster, another demon that has no appeal because the only thing that makes it interesting is taken away from it.<br /><br />The brother and sister duo do better. They are believable as siblings and do what they can with the simplistic script. However, they are not given a chance to progress their relationship past the setup phase so when one of the siblings are taken away from the other, we don't feel the great sense of loss that we should.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is good in a genre that has consistently given us crap over the past 15 years. But, this movie is in no way going to be a classic.....Rating: C+<br /><br />The DVD has several featuers, but it is not full of them. The minimalistic soundtrack gets creepy at the right momemts and has decent (but not great) dynamic punch. The transfer is average...DVD features rating is C.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>A sister and brother are making a road trip home, and when they enter a small town, they get an adventure they did plan on.  They almost get run off the road by some psycho driving an ugly brown truck.  Then the brother decides they should investigate the psycho driver dumping bodies near an old church.  This will be one time they wished they minded their own business!!!<br /><br />This movie was not fantastic, but it was decent enough to keep my attention.  I even jumped a few times watching this movie.  The only reason I'm giving this movie a 3 rating is I like it when a horror film gives you some background on why the monster exists.  We knew why Jason, Freddy, Micheal Myers, Chucky, etc were the monsters they were.  We knew why they killed.  With this creature all we knew is every 23rd spring, it would eat for 23 straight days.  We knew it choose it's victims by sniffing out their fear, and taking the parts it wanted.  We knew it could regenerate, and that's all.  I wanted to know where this creature came from, and why.  This movie left too many unanswered question, and trust me they won't be answered in the second movie Jeepers Creepers 2. Aside of that this film has the right amount of suspense, and gore to keep horror fans happy.  It's not worth buying, but it's worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>from the horrifying beginning to the horrifying end, this movie is purely a adrenaline pumping ride, fueled with a believeable creature and a good cast, but that crazy lady who sees visions seems a little miscast and annoying some times. favorite part has got to be the ending. followed by a sequel 2 years later</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This movie start well and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

They can lag in other areas, but if they deliver chills, shreiks, winces, gags (I mean the kind you make with your throat, not the kind you play on your friends) and a sense of, well, the creeps, that runs the whole film, you know you're on to something. "Creepers" does this and does it well. It's a short, well-crafted, brutally compact horror movie that uses storyline and atmosphere rather than buckets of the red stuff or an enormous kill-count to get your fear glands pumping. The story revolves around two sibling college students taking their ancient 1960s-era beater home on spring break via what looks to be the worlds longest and most desolate highway. On the way they spy a sinister-looking man dumping what appears to be bodies down a drainpipe, and here they commit their first "Horror-Movie Mistake" -- they investigate instead of getting the hell out of there. Turns out there is an extremely nasty surprise on the end of the pipe (think Sistine Chapel as designed by Dr. Lecter), but it's not until the two finally decide to split the scene -- and who wouldn't want to stay in a sewer pipe  -- that their troubles begin. Seems the mystery guy is on their scent (literally), and wants something from them, which he intends to remove without benefit of anesthetic. That's his gig, and he does it pretty well (hint: hiding in the police station will not help). "Creepers" is not a perfect film -- horror movies usually aren't -- but its flaws are the flaws of the genre and don't do much to detract from the tension. My biggest gripe is the design of the Creeper himself -- fully revealed, he is ugly but nothing you haven't seen trading barbs with Patrick Stewart on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" ; and the movie ends so abruptly and brutally that my initial reaction was that somebody had forgotten to put the last half hour in. But better an abrupt ending than a predicatble one, right? Simply put, "Jeepers Creepers" was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually creeped me out. Definetly worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers is one of the better recent horror films. If it's director and writer, Victor Salva, had been able to sustain the mood he created in the movie's first third, it might have been a great one. Shortly before production began, he was informed that the picture's budget had been slashed. The result was the cutting of the shooting schedule from forty-five days to thirty-one and a lot less money for the art department, which is the one that creates special effects. In light of these constrains, he probably did the best he could.<p>Trish and Darry [Gina Phillips and Justin Long] are returning home from college. Trish, who was recently dumped by her boyfriend, wants to take the long way home, a decision that takes the pair down a lonely country road. In the middle of nowhere, an ominous, rusty old truck roars up behind them and nearly causes them to crash. It finally passes them, but a few miles later, they spot it parked by an abandoned church. They see its occupant tossing something large wrapped in a blanket down a big drainpipe. In a decision which could only happen in this kind of movie, they go back to investigate. What they find there is scary enough, but what put it there is much more so. And it knows who they are.<p>Horror movies come in several forms and often spill over into other genres, such as the psychological thriller. Jeepers Creepers is in the old-fashioned monster movie category, with shades of the occult. It's a cut above most recent efforts of this type. The music is quite atmospheric, and the photography and lighting are very professional. Salva knows how to set a scene up to maximize the effect on the audience. <p>Salva is a good film maker who needs to polish his scripts a little more. He does a really excellent job of making his main characters more interesting and believable than those we usually encounter in such fare, but this makes the dumb things they do seem particularly unlikely. Still, I liked Trish and Darry more than most horror movie main characters. After Darry sees what lies at the bottom of of that drain pipe, he goes into shock. I think this is a much more likely reaction than the emotionally dead, macho reaction you usually see. <p>Justin Long and Gina Phillips are quite good. Many actors seem to get their starts in horror movies. Jack Nicholson comes to mind. You can often spot the good ones, because they consistently give a fine performance whether the material demands it or not.<p>Some people don't like horror movies. For those who enjoy them, this is a good choice, especially considering how thin the selection has been recently.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers, to me, was a bit on the dull side because of its:<br />1) Predictability<br />2) Characters<br />3) Plot<br />First, the movie hits the same cords that most other mainstream drivel does these days. In fact, it does it so well that the good parts of the movie, including a nice room coated in mutilated corpses, seem to drag a bit. As I watched on, all I wanted to know was now long it would take to start the car this time, and when the main characters were going to die. O, how I hoped for their deaths.<br />This brings me to my second problem, the characters. Normally, I enjoy meeting the characters of a movie so I can feel their pain vicariously. Normally, but not this time. Even in movies where I wished for the characters to start dropping like flies, I don't usually think this because of the quality of the actor or because of the predicability of their reactions. To understand them, think "stupider than even a believable horror victim" and you've got yourself a role.<br />Thirdly, the plot was a mind-numbing sleeper that simply didn't cut it. Now, I'm not insulting the flesh-eating "demon" part or some of his handiwork, but the Jeepers Creepers insertions, the "psychic" that warns us of these, or the "it drives a scary truck and has your scent, so you'll never be safe" pinnacle the horror structured around was a bit too much for me.<br />All this said, there were still a few, scantly numbered, memorable parts in the film. The "cat lady's" death, a demon loose in a police station taking out cops, and the ending gave this movie a little breath of life. Still, watch at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers. When I first heard the title of this film and saw the teeny bopper cast from the promos, I was pretty sure this film would be a waste of time. But, then a funny thing happened. I started to hear from friends who said Jeepers Creepers was really scary and I read an endorsement on the newspaper ad from the &quot;master&quot; Clive Barker who said &quot;...The Scariest Film I've Seen in Years.&quot; That was enough for me. The film doesn't waste much time getting right into the plot which is good. The plot is also very basic, a brother and sister driving home along the backroads from college. They are menaced off the road by a maniac in an old fashioned car. After surviving the scare of their lives, the loony drives away and the kids think all is well. As they continue driving they spot the maniac's truck at an abandoned old church. They see the guy chucking what appears to be bodies into a sewer drain. The story progresses well from here incorporating elements of the supernatural and standard horror. The director of Jeepers Creepers is the true star of the film. You can tell he is an avid fan of the genre and knows exactly what buttons to push to scare the hell out of you. The last scene is pretty grizzly but one that will stick with you every time you mention the film hereafter. Overall, great direction and some scary moments add up to a worthy addition to any horror collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B350OHYHQTGX.html">A1B350OHYHQTGX</a><br/><p>Personally I love HORROR movies and I was surprised that I didn't hear about this movie earlier although it was extremely scary! You just can't take a breath for full 1.5 hours. To me the best part was the first half an hour. It was well made. The car scenes, truck scene and the pipe adventure was SUPERB.<p>The weak points I found were:<br />1.  It is a monster movie which I find difficult to swallow, I prefer serial killers characters!<br />2. There were few mistakes that the director overlooked such as:<br />a) Trish (Gina Philips) being able to run after the monster kidnapped her brother at the end of the movie although the Police station doors were electrically locked.<br />b) The policemen not shooting the monster's wings (before he flys with Trish) at the end of the movie although they had more than enough time to do so.<br />c) The dead bodies in the Church basement were so obviously fake.<br />d) Darry (Justin Long) body & face at the end of the movie was so obviously fake.<br />3. In the DVD bonuses (the making of the movie) I didn't like the comments & big ego of the director (Victor Salva). I found his claim that he can do better than the movies "The Sixth Sense" & "Blair Witch Project", very much offending.<p>But in the end, this movie was successful enough to scare me! And I'll look forward for part 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>Just knowing that there is a sequel to this movie led me to want to see this movie.  After watching it, the reason is obvious.  The first movie answers little to nothing.  If anything, this movie was one big question mark.<br /><br />Without going into detail of the story, suffice it to say that the main characters, the police, the psychic, and we the viewers have no idea what the creature is.  For horror aficionados, the creature is well done and scary.  Ideas of demons and or animal hybrids may come to mind.  Unfortunately for us, the movie never goes into detail.  The attempt of the creature to appear somewhat human is thrilling.<br /><br />The main characters are a brother and sister traveling home from college.  Part of their discussion, as well as their trip to begin with, border on urban legend.  The siblings argue back and forth as only siblings can, but these actors do almost too good a job.  Before too long into the movie, I found myself completely siding with one and losing my temper with the other.  (Who hasn't yelled at the TV?)  Although this seems to detract for the story, the emotional response added to the movie experience for me.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen the next one, I would hope that it answers the questions raised in this one.  Given that, I would recommend not watching this unless you are going to be watching the sequel soon afterwards</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Trish (Gina Phillips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are on their way home from school in Trish's old car. On a long, lonely stretch of highway, they encounter a maniac driving a suped up truck that's as fast as a rocket-sled! Said maniac keeps crashing into the rear of their car and zooms off around them and into the distance. While still recovering from this experience, Trish and Darry see this guy loading what appear to be bodies (wrapped in bloody sheets) down a pipe by an old abandoned church. Of course, they simply MUST investigate or there wouldn't be much of a movie now would there? So, when the big guy leaves, they go to the pipe, where Darry hears what sounds like a faint human moan. He scoots into the pipe, only to fall in and down into the damp darkness below! Once there, Darry discovers not only a poor dying kid with a stitched-up chest, but also an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of well-preserved victims of the madman in the truck! This is no ordinary stalker / slasher story after all. Darry, now in shock, staggers up and out through the church and Trish drives them to a diner to call the police. It just gets creepier from there. A psychic calls them at the diner with information she couldn't possibly have. The cops arrive, while outside, the "creeper" has gone through Darry's dirty laundry, getting his scent. The creeper is one of the better movie monsters (nope, he ain't human) I've seen over the years. He'll definitely stick in your head! Cops have no hope against him / it as he comes for what he needs / wants from Darry. The beginning is a lot like Spielberg's "Duel" in it's relentless chase between car and truck. The unveiling of the creeper's cathedral of death reminded me of the discovery of the queen's egg-chamber in "Aliens" or the livingroom scene in the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", shocking and disturbing. Also, there's a scene at the police station that reminded me of Arnold's infamous "I'll be Back!" sequence in "The Terminator". I don't consider these ripoffs. I call them tributes. JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. It's certainly better than most of the lame "Scream"-ish clones floating around. Great acting, eerie situations, a scary monster, and a continual sense of dread should be enough for any fan of this type of spook-fest...</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHV42BTJSVON.html">A2RHV42BTJSVON</a><br/><p>Well actually, I'd give it 4stars, but I think all these 1 star reviews are being a *little* harsh. I mean for a horror movie, this is pretty good. Its gruesome, fairly frightening, and has some actual character development. WOW!!! I mean I was pretty scared after having seen this film. I've never thought of the song "Jeepers Creepers" the same way again. :p<p>  Basic plot, a brother and sister are driving home on a country road and are being chased by a maniac in a beaten up truck. They then decide to follow the truck and see bodies being dumped into a drain pipe. And of course they go, and check it out, and well you'll just have to see the movie to know the rest.<p>  I thought the acting was convincing between the brother and sister, I felt sympathy for them, I didn't want them to die(and that's a good thing), they had great chemistry. Would I watch it again? I think so, the final image in the film really haunted me. <p>  I'm a horror movie maniac, and I thought for a horror movie, considering that most horror movies suck, this was above the normal standard. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars, primarily because of the characters stupidity. :p</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>One of the best things about JEEPERS CREEPERS is the on-screen interaction between the brother and sister characters played respectively by Justin Long and Gina Philips. Like regular teenagers, they sardonically bicker, tease, and pick at each other when things start out, but when faced with a life-threatening crisis, the genuine love and respect that they have for each other shines through.  In fact, so genuine are their performances that, after watching the film, it is difficult to accept the fact that the two actors are not actually siblings.  Hopefully these excellent young performers will go on to even greater stardom as their talents mature and they fine-tune their art.<p>But the two young stars aren't the ONLY good thing about this movie.  No siree!  With JEEPERS CREEPERS, writer/director Victor Salva has pulled out nearly all the stops to craft an enjoyable old-fashioned spook-show.  Most of the action takes place in a rural setting during what appears to be early fall, and this creates a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere that harkens back to Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  In fact, aficionados of the genre will no doubt notice that JEEPERS CREEPERS is replete with nods to horror greats from the cinema past, including not only Hooper's cult classic, but also such films as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, PSYCHO, Spielberg's DUEL, HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th,...and the list goes on and on.  In addition, Salva playfully and lovingly pokes fun at many horror clich&eacute;s--worn-out devices like the old dark house, the darkened tunnel, the urban legend, the barely audible warning from a dying victim, the phone call from a stranger, the warning from a psychic, and many more--yet he does so in clever and witty ways that add to the fun of the film and the logical progression of the story.<p>What would an old-fashioned monster movie be without a monster?  And does JEEPERS CREEPERS ever have one!  Somewhat reptilian in appearance and extremely cunning and intelligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).  Extendable and retractable facial appendages, a mouthful of sharp teeth, big fold-out bat-like wings--all this, and it sews, carves wood, and drives, too!  And in keeping with the nostalgic undertones of the rest of the film, this monster also has characteristics that are reminiscent of nasty cinema favorites from days gone by: DRACULA, the FRANKENSTEIN monster, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, television's GARGOYLES (1972), the aforementioned titular ghoulie from ALIEN, and more contemporary monsters like Freddy, Jason, and even HANNIBAL the Cannibal.<p>Filmgoers who enjoy the fun creep-shows of yesteryear will get a real kick out of JEEPERS CREEPERS, but it is also modern and hip enough that younger, less nostalgic genre fans should enjoy it, too.  The DVD from MGM is loaded with cool extras, not the least of which are a feature commentary from writer/director Salva, alternate openings and endings, and some interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes. This one's well worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers had so much potential but the director and I suppose, the producer blew it. What was that dialog about the mother all about at the begining? It went nowhere. The plot holes are just too big to forgive. If someone runs you off the road what do you do? You call the cops on your cell phone or you drive off and report it later. The brother and sister in this movie decide to go check the "guy" who nearly killed them out. You see the weird dude who nearly killed you stuffing what looks like a body into a pipe. What do you do? Get the heck out of there, right? No...these idiots decide to investigate.  Obviously the brother and sister had to run into the Creeper some kind of way to get the movie started but this was simply idiotic.<br />The Creeper does this every 23 years, so how come no one in town seems to have noticed missing loved ones? In fact, how come the folks in town don't just go on vacation during the Creeper's feeding time?<br />The Creeper himself is a scary creature until you see all of him then he becomes a laughable special effect. Okay, I'll admit that the last iamge of the movie was impressive but that's five minutes in an otherwise dopey movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>It's been a long time since we've seen a movie that can shock us with a dark and suspenseful atmosphere. I like movies that can take me for a ride but I also like movies that can take me for ride not knowing where the movie is taking me and leaving me in the suspense and the anticipation of surprise. &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; succeeds quite effectively where other horror movies fail miserably. First thing; we have two unknown actors who play brother and sister, you're given a little bit of back-story, you start the movie with some character development and it's kinda slow. This is the first rule in making a great movie! Not just horror movies but all movies! IMPLEMENT SOME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Make us care about the experience these characters are going through. Victor Salva does a great job making these points clear in the film and to the audience. Second thing; the audience must have moments where they need to squint their eyes when being drawn into a scene that doesn't give everything away immediately. Great examples of this can be found in classic horror films like John Carpenters, &quot;The Thing,&quot; and of course &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street.&quot; Part of the successful fear factor those movies presented were the outstanding way the director presented things, &quot;darkly.&quot; Third thing; give us an ending that isn't Hollywood fluff, where the heroes triumph and the villain is cast away failing his/her mission! This is one of the biggest mistakes in horror movies because it dilutes everything the story was made from, &quot;sheer terror!&quot; The terror must keep going even as the credits are rolling and the people are leaving the theatre. I think the &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; was successful because you knew before even starting the movie the three filmmakers were reported missing. In John Carpenters &quot;The Thing,&quot; you have an ending that is quite simply the creepiest ending I've ever seen. Aside from horror, "Titanic," called to the masses because everyone knew it was a doomed voyage, even though, "Titanic," isn't a horror movie, people are magnetically drawn to doom-possibly because everyone one of us knows our days are numbered:(  The similarity from those movies and, &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; is that in all of this, you're seeing a story of doom on the horizon and it's inevitable. That's what makes a great horror movie! It must have doom and the doom must be inevitable from the get-go. So there you have it! &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; is most certainly not the greatest horror movie of it's genre but it definitely reinvigorates conventional Hollywood horror flicks by following the essential rules above. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Jeepers Creepers" is about two teenagers who come in contact with an evil enitity known as The Creeper. This creature goes on a killing rampage inflicting terror on those who come in contact with him. "Jeepers Creepers" went on to be a huge boxoffice smash making nearly $60,000,000 and spawning a sequel called "Jeppers Creepers 2" that was just as good as the original. Producers have stated that a Part 3 and Part 4 will be made in the very near future with Victor Salva coming aboard again as the writer and director. This 2 disc DVD set features a slew of bonuses including deleted and extended scenes, an alternate opening, director's audio commentary, a featurette called "A Collection Of Mini-Featurettes on the Making of The Film", original trailer, and more.

After doing that, tell them to see this movie. I was not expecting much of anything since the movie got a horrible average rating. Don't let that fool you. The movie isn't great art, but it's wonderfully put together and delivers an hour and a half of innocent entertainment. A brother and sister are traveling back home for spring break. The brother's name is Darry(Justin Long), and the sister is Trisha(Gina Phillips). Their road trip seems to be pretty typical. Playing licence plate games and talking. They seem to hit on the subject that their parents' marriage is iin trouble, and that Trish's own relationship is over. Things go horrible when a big, dumpy looking truck begins tailing them on the highway. The truck scares them a little and then moves on. The siblings later see the truck parked at an abandoned church. A strange looking figure is taking objects wrapped up in sheets and dumping them down a pipe. After another cat and mouse scene between the two cars, the two go back to investigate, thinking they were bodies and that someone else may be alive. Once they find out that it was bodies that were being dumped, Darry also discovers that there are hundreds of bodies in this basement that are preserved and sewn up. From this point on, the brother and sister team struggle to contact help and to flee from this psycho. When they have an encounter with a psychic named Jezelle(Patricia Belcher), they learn of what is really going on. This monster is a regurgating monster that needs to eat body parts to stay alive. Whatever he eats, and you know what he eats, becomes a part of him. Every 23 years, he feeds. She also tells them that whenever the title song plays, something terrible is about to happen. It all ends with a climax that takes place in a locked down police station that was exciting and shot nicely. The movie was written and directed by Victor Salva, the man who did "Powder". He has a nice eye and give us some nice shots and fun angles with the camera. He really sets the setting and makes it eerie and intriguing. The film is pretty much straight terror, but there are some comical moments spread out here and there. While it's a film that can't be taken seriously, it appears to be a fillm that was taken seriously from Salva and his cast and crew. They wanted to put together an incredibly fun, thrill ride and they have done just that. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is what it is and it does it very competently. It delivers in the 'fun' category. The monster itself is very creepy, and very nightmarish. The make-up design of the creature was very good. The acting is all pretty solid. Gina Phillips, not only being beautiful in the classic sense, was a strong heroine. She was tough and ballsy. Justin Long did a decent job as her terrified brother. Veteran actress Eileen Brennan pops up as The Cat Lady, in a set piece that's one of the better ones. Jonathan Breck plays the monster. He does a good job in bringing out the creeps in the role. The film differs from horror films of the last few years. While it was praised as being away from the "Scream" era, it really isn't. There are some lines in the film that would of been right at home in any of the "Scream" films. Plus, these are two different types of films, and shouldn't be compared. "Jeepers Creepers" was a lot better than I thought it would be. If I had listened to bad reviews and the low average rating, I would have missed out on a pretty fun and entertaining film. I was pleasantly surprised. I think any fan of films like this would be too.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films.  I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre.  It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work.  So to those who would call this film bad, I say:  turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.<p>Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you.  Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film?  ... <p>Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge.  Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....?  Of course not!  The characters even acknowledge this fact.  However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do.  (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).<br />At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .<br />Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).<br />The film features fine actors performing honestly and well.  Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable.  The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.<br />When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world.  You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster.  If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.<br />Jeepers Creepers does far more than that.  This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.<br />Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this scary.  Most of the &quot;horror&quot; movies of the last 20 years or so have been the teen slasher films, which turned into the jokes of the scream series.  John Carpenter had the masterpiece in Halloween, but I would classify what he's done since as more science fiction.  And then there are the psycological thrillers, like &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, which have their moments but hold back on the gore.<p>&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; has it all.  There is no holding back on the gore.  When the creature starts eating a victim's tongue, while still attached to the head, it doesn't get any better than that.  We get close-ups of victim's stiched-up bodies.  And the final scene would make Buffalo Bill proud.  <p>Where it excels, though, is atmosphere and tension.  I remember that the plot of &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was not that great, but the setting of the house in that movie was as creepy as it got.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes beyond this.  We see that something awful is probably at the monster's hangout.  We spend time debating whether to enter it's confines.  When we finally get to see it, the buildup pays off big-time.  It would be hard to design a scarier environment than what Justin Long falls into.<p>The only reason that I don't give it five stars is explained in the movie itself.  Most people, after seeing the setup, would high-tail it out as fast as possible, and let the authorities take over.  But our hero has to not only go back to the scene, but literally stick his nose into it.  His more logical sister tells him that this is the typical stupid thing that people do in horror movies, and she's right.  <p>But then, we wouldn't be treated with what follows.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>This movie is pretty good. Two teens are on their way home on an isolated country road when almost run off the road by an old beat up, yet cool, truck. Thinking they have seen the last of this truck and the crazy person driving it, they continue on their journey only to pass in front of an old church where they see the same beat up truck and someone who seems to be throwing a body down a large sewer pipe. They decide to investigate and when one of them falls down the sewer pipe, he discovers a den of horror. Now being seen by the killer, they must run for their lives. This movie delivers in both horror and gore. Not a boring movie and well acted. I recommend any horror movie fan at least rent this movie if you have not seen it yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers is one of the most effective, fresh, creepy horror films to come along in the past few years, and I enjoyed it immensely.  You may find some of the elements from this film elsewhere, but Jeepers Creepers really does have its own unique story to tell.  The plot breaks down a little bit in the final half hour, but everything up to that point is simply superb.<p>I love the opening scenes; this really doesn't even seem like a movie for the first half hour.  You have a very typical brother and sister cruising down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the day.  I entered this film with dark aspirations in mind, so the bright, peaceful setting of the opening really grabbed my attention.  It may be a lonely stretch of road, but the setting is one of safety and serenity - until, that is, a character in a super-charged old van tries to wreck the car holding our protagonists.  For Patricia and Darius Jenner (Gina Philips and Justin Long, respectively), this frightening bit of road rage proves to be only the start of a horrible night.  On down the road, the pair catch sight of the evil van parked beside an old, crumbling building; looking closer, they see the driver of the truck tossing a couple of items that certainly look like bodies wrapped in blood-soaked sheets down a big pipe.  The bad guy sees the kids pass by and immediately starts out in pursuit, doing all he can to wreck them.  Darius eventually has the brilliant idea of going back to the pipe to see if anyone is still alive down there, and his much smarter sister cannot talk him out of this notion.  Here marks the upping of the creepiness factor.  There are many significant things to be found in the chamber below; finding a way out, though proves to be a challenge as Darius soon discovers.  Eventually a shell-shocked Darius and Trish make it to a roadside restaurant and call the police.  Things get weirder, though, when an anonymous stranger calls Darius and Trish and explains the things she has been seeing in her visions, warning them that the &quot;thing&quot; will not stop coming after them.  This proves to be quite the understatement.  The Creeper, whoever or whatever he is, is relentless in his pursuit of the scared youngsters, leading to one exciting confrontation after another in a variety of venues.  Things progress quite nicely to an ending that is both good and bad; good in the sense that it does not pull a fairy tale ending out of the hat, but bad in that the final five minutes prove anticlimactic, forced, and generally unsatisfying.<p>Personally, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with the costume and special effects of the Creeper; from a distance, or coiled in shadows, he's pretty intimidating, but his visual effect on the viewer decreases as we see more of him.  Writer/director Victor Salva envisioned this film as his own &quot;monster movie,&quot; but I think that a more human boogeyman would have served this story more effectively.  Justin Long has some kind of David Schwimmer thing going on at times, but he is otherwise quite convincing in the role of Darius; he is the one who sees firsthand the handiwork of the Creeper, and the effects of what he has seen are reflected dramatically on his face and spirit.  Gina Philips is fantastic; she may well be the sexiest female on the planet, as well.  More than just a pretty face, the depth of her commitment and talent are demonstrated quite convincingly in the six featurettes on the making of the movie.  These featurettes, by the way, are quite good.  The deleted and extended scenes housed on the DVD, though, aren't that impressive; for the life of me, I could hardly find the difference between the alternate and final versions of a few scenes in the movie.<p>Jeepers Creepers is just a terrific, vastly underrated horror film.  Relying more on suspense than blood and gore (although there is a certain amount of gore to be found here), this would make an especially good introduction to the genre for those yet to dip their feet into the deep, dark side of the entertainment pool.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The trailers for this movie made it seem so scary, but trailers are usually misleading.

Their trip home begins to turn dangerous when they see a man in a trench coat and a hat that covers his face dumping something down a pipe.

You won't be able to get it off your mind, unless your an idiot like me and you go to a midnight showing right before you go home and go to bed. Lol. I had that song in my head the entire night. I am normally not like that with horror movies, but for some reasons, certain scenes from this movie just would not leave me--the scene inside the Creeper's cave for example, and esp. the abrupt, freaky ending. Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>This movie started out scary enough that when my phone rang 10 minutes into it, I jumped.  It successfully captured the spookiness one feels while driving down a deserted highway.  It also successfully spooked me out when the siblings are chased down by a car, when they see a hooded man dump human-size wrapped sacks down a pipe and also by what Justin Long sees when he goes down that pipe.  I thought Long did a credible job acting terrified.<br /><br />However, this is also one of those movies where the victims make really stupid decisions.  For example, after getting chased down by the vehicle, the brother yells out the window to insult the guy.  But who would be foolish enough to provoke a psychopath?<br /><br />Even more foolish than that was him going down the pipe at all.  Who would be foolish enough to go down a pipe after just witnessing dead bodies getting dumped into it?  He gives a reason, but most sane people would go straight to the police instead.  I think the writer must've suspected viewers would have this reaction because the sister tells her brother not to act like one of those stupid people in horror films...and yet, they still act like them anyway.<br /><br />Shorlty after that scene, after seeing the monster attack someone in their car, the sister walks up to the car to investigate.  And when they see the creature, they don't immediately run, but instead just stand there as he eats someone.  Again, what?<br /><br />These foolish decisions pulled me out of my initial scared reaction, but so, too, did the scenes with the psychic as well as having the song "Jeepers Creepers" accompany a kill.  I understand the intent of the cheerful music was to make a kill seem more disturbing, but the intent was so obvious it didn't work for me.  The ending didn't work for me either because it was more silly than scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Two young adults ( Gina Philips and Justin Long) are driving their way through a sunny day on springbreak week until they witness a house that has a strange person dumping a body down a pipe. They get suspicious as they investigate that hole on what that odd person dumped down there, it appears to be a body but also a collection of stitch taxidermies made of human bodies. They head out to a local town to contact the cops, but soon the odd man from the house who has the bodies begins to stalk the two and cannot be stopped until the two are dead as he is really a monster.<br /><br />Entertaining and quite different horror thriller that harkons back to the 70's horror movies of it's era, there is some decent acting, fine gore and scares to go with it. The opening sequence is quite terrifying and it's twist ending is definitely disturbing as well, i think it's the one of the better horror offerings in recent memory.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD is very cool! an informative audio commentary by the director, crisp picture & Sound, Deleted & extended scenes especially an alternate ending, featurettes, Photo gallery, and Trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: House of 1000 Corpses, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 and 2003), Re-Animator, Final Destination 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Demons, Friday The 13th series, Nightmare on Elm Street series, Stephen King's IT, The Shining, Cannibal Holocaust, City of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

They discover hundreds of perfectly preserved bodies all stitched up and artistically spread out throughout the dusty, dark cellar. Their nosiness fuels the wrath of the killer who isn't a man at all but some sort of monstrous, murderous demon who has risen from the depths of the earth to feed on human flesh.<br /><br />I must frankly state that it was very difficult for me to feel sorry for the two main charaters. Although they were both youthful, attractive and very likable, it was their foolishness that got them in trouble in the first place. I am no expert in profiling but the film still begs me to ask the question: What part of the man's appearance had they not mistaken for a vicious killer? He was only about 10 feet tall, was wearing a freakish, dusty, moth worn hat, a Jack The Ripper-ish over coat and was clearly dumping bodies (most likely dead bodies) into a drainage pipe. And let's not forget his mode of transportation and really bad driving skills.<br /><br />"Jeepers Creepers" is still one of the most innovative horror film in a long time. It has some good performances and a very mysterious killer.  Although the film follows the typical slasher movie formula, it rises above them due to it's enigmatic and supernatural storyline. Also, the origins of the killer is never really explained and the killer's face is not clearly shown until the final frames all adding a sense of mystery, intrigue and fear. Add in some scenes of explicit gore, slaughter, and a  surprise ending and you have an enjoyable, eerie tale of human idiocy, bloodshed and tears. Oh and who can forget that song?<br /><br />"Jeepers Creepers...Where did you get those eyes?"<br /><br />There are worst ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.

Then along comes this movie with a very corny title and I think to myself &quot;Why am I putting this into my DVD player?&quot;  Twenty minutes into the film I was smiling with relief and jumping with tension.  The first half of this movie has inspired direction influenced by the likes of Stephen Spielberg(Duel) and the cult director Sam Raimi's &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films.  There are genuine scares and some fun camerawork for about 45 minutes....then the movie becomes a bloody X-files episode.  I was seriously expecting Mulder and Scully to show up at any moment, Scully's intro into the scene: &quot;Excuse me, sir.  We're Federal agents investigating the strange stories reported recently.&quot;  While the second half of the movie isn't bad it seemed like the director just wanted to wrap things up and hope for a call saying United Artists wanted to back a sequel.  Part 2 is on video as I write this.  Still, this movie has more pinache than most horror films and is certainly worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I had to watch the second one to fully understand the whole concept of this creature.

A poor excuse for a horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"Jeepers Creepers" is a movie I remember hearing a lot of mixed buzz about. Some people\critics hailed it as one of the scariest movies ever! While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see "Jeepers Creepers" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.<p> "Jeepers Creepers" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.<p> "Jeepers Creepers" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.<p> First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?<p> After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song "Jeepers Creepers" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song "Jeepers Creepers" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the "crepper" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?<p> Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe "Jeepers Creepers 2" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and "The Glass House".<p> Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been. Decent acting, so-so scrpit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Its a normal beautiful day and Trish and Dari go through some of the most horrible things one can imagine.  I don't want to give anything away because I went into the theater not knowing what this was about and thus, not having any expectations.  I hope no sequels are made because the movie, the mystery and the pure horror of it cannot be repeated.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I was wandering around the mall a few days ago with nothing to do, so I figured I'd treat myself to a movie.  I was actually looking to see Final Fantasy, but it turns out it was no longer playing.  Simply on a whim, as a replacement, I decided to go see 'Jeepers Creepers.'  Man what a disappointment.<br />My first groan came when I learned it was a Victor Salva film.  Salva, you may remember, is the convicted child-molester who had made the movie 'Powder.' I swore I'd never pay to see one of his movies and I was kicking myself when I realized my mistake.<p>My second error came relative to the plot.  Granted this is my own fault, I was told by a friend, the plot of the movie was similar to the Shirley Jackson story of 'The Lottery' where a town is sacrificing people to this demon that lived in a hole under a church.<br />That half-heard assessment turned out to also only be about half-right.  I won&#65533;t rehash the plot completely, but in this movie, the townspeople are unaware of the demon (in the beginning that is).<p>The plot, to me anyway, never really seemed to come together.  It seemed as if there were several points that it tried to make, and then just gave up on.  For example, why after the demon took whatever body part he needed, did he stitch all the corpses back up and together?  What was the idea behind making a point of the dead interracial couple? I thought it was going to be a murder mystery for a few moments after that.  Why did he even have a hole to the old church when he could have just walked down into the basement?  What the hell was with the woman with all the cats?  What was with all the crows everywhere?  Did they work for the Creeper or something?  Things like this just seemed to keep piling up to the point that I wasn't really enjoying the movie anymore.  It just seemed to be all over the place.<p>I don't know, I was admittedly really never into gore/horror movies very much.  This just didn't do anything to change my mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>JEEPERS CREEPERS had so much potential. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie were enthralling. The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great.  However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.<p>The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.<p>The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't. That's a shame because it would have made the showdown in the police station all that more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>I'm writing a review of Jeepers Creepers for the same reason I've written 90% of my Amazon movie reviews, because it just came on cable tv. What's frustrating about Jeepers is how decent of a movie it could have been had it been handled by a director with far more skill than Victor Salva.<br /><br />I like Justin Long, I think he's one of a handful of Gen Y actors who has genuine talent. I thought he did an admirable job of conveying real fear in this movie. I think he's only continued to grow as an actor and I really enjoyed him most recently in Drag Me To Hell, a film which I absolutely loved. He has a likeable quality about him in anything I've seen him in. No problem with Gina Philips either, she's easy on the eyes and did a great job playing the "smart" sister. It wasn't the acting that doomed this movie for me, it was rather the absolutely assine character decisions and huge plot holes that doomed it for me. You ask for examples, here goes in no particular order:<br /><br />1. When Darry gets hauled off by the Creeper at the end, why didn't the sister have the entire police force follow her back to the old church, since she knew damn well that's where he was heading?<br /><br />2. Why did Darry (Justin's character) go into the well? I know in the movie he talks about all of a sudden his conscience getting the better of him, but there is NO ONE in their right mind who would have done that over calling 911 to send police to handle the situation themselves.<br /><br />3. Why did the brother and sister get back in their car and leave the safety of the restaurant? Or at the least, why didn't they drive with the police if they knew the Creeper had just been in their car and was seriously after them at that point?<br /><br />4. What was wrong with the patrons of the restaurant, not a one of them showed an ounce of emotion to the plight of these kids. That was probably more action than they had seen in decades and they all acted as though they were comatose.<br /><br />5. Could the old psychic have been any more cliche and unbelievable?<br /><br />6. Who is the Creeper and where did he come from? Supposedly in the third film the Creeper's origin will be revealed, but guess what, that's then, and this is now, and having a creature with absolutely no back story is the laziest kind of film making. They pulled the same stunt with Cloverfield, a movie which was even worse than this one.<br /><br />7. How is it that only one, little old crazy psychic lady knows about this thing, when supposedly every 23 years it comes out to feed for 23 days straight? You mean to tell me, NO ONE would have found out about this Creeper thing or its lair in all the time it's been kidnapping and killing townsfolk? At the very least, if the psychic was having these visions and knew the Creeper was taking people to the old church to torture and eat them, don't you think it would have been decent of her to alert authorities about it?<br /><br />I could go on, but it's a 10 year old movie and I don't want to spend any more time on it. Plot holes and stupid character decisions withstanding, the biggest sin this movie made was, it wasn't very scary. The scene where Darry enters the well and discovers the old church basement mutilations and instruments of torture was about the only time I felt a slight increase in my pulse. I also jumped immediately after from the cheap scare tactic anyone who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I skipped the 2nd, but am midly interested in the 3rd due to the revelation made by Victor Salva that the origin of the Creeper will finally be relevealed, and that he aims to make it "very scary." I'll believe it when I see it, and since its due date is sometime in 2013 I won't hold my breath.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Writer/director Victor Salva's did intend to launch a monster franchise, but that's how things worked out, as his scary thriller Jeepers Creepers (2001), was successful enough to spawn the high action sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and the third entry in the series Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral, is reportedly in production at this time.<br /><br />The strange being known as "The Creeper" (Jonathan Breck), is tremendously powerful, and has the ability to fly.  He surfaces every twenty three years, and for a period of twenty three days, driven his sense of smell, he consumes humans for their body parts.  Siblings Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long) are travelling in Florida, when they cross the path of the Creeper's vehicle.  Later, passing an abandoned church, they again spot the Creepermobile, and observe a huge figure, grabbing body shaped bundles from the back, and tossing them down a corrugated pipe in the ground.  The Creepermobile suddenly appears behind them, and runs them off the road.  Going back to the church to investigate, Darry makes a horrific discovery in an underground cavern.<br /><br />Daylight turns to darkness, while the pair awaits for police assistance.  Darry gets a phone call from a mysterious woman who warns him that something bad will happen, when he hears the song Jeepers Creepers.  The action ramps up when the Creeper gets Darry's scent, and will stop at nothing to satisfy his needs.<br /><br />With lots of intimate dialog, Salva does a wonderful job of making the relationship between Trish and Darry, seem very real and natural.  It is the central thread that holds the film together, and both Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard) and Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) turn in strong performances.  Long goes overboard at times, but that is kind of what he does.  Philips was 31 at the time, but easily passes for much younger.<br /><br />The suspense is sustained, by keeping the Creeper obscured for most of the film.  Psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.  The ending is a bit unexpected, but remains true to Salva's vision.  Jeepers Creepers has its faults, but is still a well-crafted, and very effective monster movie.<br /><br />The double sided DVD release, is a comprehensive package, including both widescreen and full screen versions of the film, and lots of cool bonus materials.  Victor Salva, a longtime horror aficionado, provides a fun and informative commentary track, and there are also an excellent series of featurettes covering the making of the film.  Unfortunately, nothing is heard from executive producer Francis Ford Coppola.  If you like creepy monsters, check out this series, as Jeepers Creepers 2, picks up where the first film left off, delivering big time action.  Gina Philips will reprise her role as Trish, in the upcoming third entry in the series, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie when it came out I saw it in the Theater and it scared me so I liked it, it's different and creepy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Jeepers Creepers starring Justin Long definitely scared the pants off of me.

If I hadn't recognized Justin's face from Dodgeball (ugh, another train wreck), I wouldn't have stopped clicking through the channels. When I saw him, I was interested in how he acted. Dodgeball was all I had seen him in, and I thought he was one of the better aspects of the movie. I hadn't been following his career, so seeing him in this film was new to me.<br /><br />What intrigued me was the polarity of characters that Justin portrayed. One was a terrified teenager, running from your typical Freddy, Jason, Michael, etc. Seriously - there was absolutely nothing unique or interesting in the "bad guy" in this film. Who was he/she, and why did the delightful song "Jeepers Creepers" mean anything to him/her? Are you hard pressed to come up with a logical answer? Me too. This would have been better if the killer had popped out of a lake, or a meteor. Better yet, a cactus. That would have taken some intellect and creativity to resolve.<br /><br />In Dodgeball, Justin was simply running scared because he was absolutely unathletic and didn't have a prayer in that silly game they played. (My opinion of the movie itself, for what it's worth, is, well, it was abysmall. Dogeball was rank. That said, the "gaffer" on that film probably made more in one month than I make in a year. Jerk.) Still, Justin made his character believable in Dodgeball, and honestly saved the film for me (although in such a tiny, minute fashion).<br /><br />In Jeepers Creepers here he did the same, but to a greater extent. I never thought I'd tie two characters of such wildly divergent (B) movies together and say they did an excellent job, but I have to break rank here.<br /><br />The female lead in "Jeepers Creepers", Gina Phillips was an extreme bore. This is unusual in boy/girl horror films. It's usually a given that the girl is favored. Not so here, and that says quite a bit about Justin's abilities. He's only 28, so he has quite a while to catch on to something huge. I hope he does. At the time of the filming of "Jeepers Creepers" he was about 22. Success awaits. (And, lucky guy, he looks far younger than his years account for.)<br /><br />Regarding the film - my lord, this was awful. How did it spawn (or spam) a sequel?? This movie was so lame I can't imagine it making any money on a sequel. Yet the sequel did better with Video Rentals than the original, so all in all it made more money. I've yet to see the sequel, but now am very interested in seeing it.<br /><br />Coming back to the movie at hand...<br /><br />I've read reviews where the reviewer has said that the "villain" was fully realized. I just have to add to this to that..."What?" Were they high? Seriously, the villain in this film was one of the absolute worst I've seen in any horror film. He had no genesis, no modus operandi - in short, he was simply some devilish form that really liked to kill teenagers. Let's all say it togather... "DUH"<br /><br />There isn't much more to say. The movie was no good, but somehow made enough to spawn a sequel. (Blech.) I have a sinking feeling that the original lead actress contracted walking pneumonia and that her understudy played her role. Well, I *had* that "sinking feeling" until I just now when I looked her up on imdb.pro. I was happy to see that Justin has fared better than she has, which makes my semi-prediciton correct. Or, at best, it makes me that much more of a snot. Take your pick.<br /><br />Being a snot is a bad thing. &lt;grin></p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>This is a fun time at the movies... especially the first part of the film.<br /><br />But after a wonderful beginning, it does fizzle. The plot gets nonsensical and they show WAY too much of the monster. Should have taken a page from the first 'Alien' or from 'Jaws'.<br /><br />It's no slasher flick, so pass if that's you're style. This is a nod to those simple but suspenseful horror films of the 70's (Duel comes to mind, as does Race With the Devil). And this movie includes a big amount of Alfred Hitchcock suspense, with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in.<br /><br />There are plot holes, yes... but there's no perfect scary film, really. And there are a couple of those cheap "jump" moments (you know, when there's a loud sting of music as a character pops into view out of nowhere; it's been done to absolute death in so many horror films, it's the biggest dead horse in Hollywood, and I wish directors and writers would stop that once and for all).<br /><br />And yet I've got to give this movie credit for a few terrific things, including but not limited to: the realistic presentation of the siblings on a road trip in Florida, the discovery of something very creepy, and what the brother finds underground. These things alone were really done nicely.

If not the best nor my favorite horror-movie I find it amongst the better ones (it is original as a big plus) -this being said; hm, let's be honest here, most horror-movies (I repeat; Most!) contain some lack of intelligence and fantasy to make the "utilmate complete story", and scores instead on style and special-effects, it seldom depends too much on the acting, what matters are the fit locations and the sound-effects play a big part too.<br /><br />There are exeptions of course; We have masterpieces like the classic "The Excorsist" and "The Omen" (and many more), and also the more recent "The Sixth Sence" and "The Others". Fantastic!<br /><br />"The Ring" and "The Grudge" are perhaps even creepier than them all, but let's face it; Not much story behind the effective camera-work and sound-effects that make the viewers sit tightened to their seats biting their fingernails off. Some stories have more to tell than others.<br /><br />The best part of "Jeepers Creepers" is the car, that alone looks scary ("Who drives something looking as mean as that!"). Bravo!<br /><br />I thought the first half like many others is the best part, but the second part is anything but boring. Predictable perhaps, not livivng up to its' premise, but indeed entertaining.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending this movie, very good!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Any movie that has once Oscar nominated Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin) offering a five minute cameo as a crazy old lady with zillions of cats can't be all bad.

The kids (Gina Phillips &amp; Justin Long) try hard to be brother/sister, but they do some incredibly stupid things and their looks of shock early on are definitely high school thespian at best.  However, towards the end, especially in the scenes at the police station, Phillips and Long show signs of being really capable performers.  The ending in which Gina offers herself in place of Long is a very unusual anti-formula one, and its resolution quite shocking.<br />I have to say, too, the early sequence in which the truck is harrassing the younguns is pretty effective, too.<br />Not a cinematic gem, but it is a scary one.</p></br></body></html>

From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.<br /><br />The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.<br /><br />Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.<br /><br />In the jail, Matron "Mama" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.<br /><br />The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.<br /><br />The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with "All That Jazz" and "Cell Block Tango". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, "When You're Good To Mama" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.<br /><br />The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, "Mister Cellophane", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his "Razzle Dazzle" number and his tap dancing.<br /><br />I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for "Best Picture". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This Broadway-to-screen musical is one I could have lived without. Its winning the academy awards makes one wonder. Obviously, it is not my kind of music. <p>Roxie would have been a smash at the Roxy Theater. From the ads, I had expected her to be a copy of Marilyn Monroe; instead, she was Shirley MacLaine as Sweet Charity. <p>In my opinion, the best part of this strange combined crime story/musical was the bittersweet piece by Amos (John C. Reilly). There were actually only three big numbers all of which expended a great deal of energy and talent. <p>The actor who played the judge was perfect for that part --liked the portrait of the blindfolded Miss Justice behind the judge in courtroom. <p>Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?  This trial (reminiscent of the Scopes fiasco of times gone by) proved that all criminal attorneys must be showmen at times. <p>That was a sleazy time in America's musical history; it was a decandent era as shown so well in THE CAT'S MEOW, about the Hearst coverup of the mysterious death on his yacht, which has similar music but no big performances. <p>The premise of a crime story turned into a musical may not be new, but it was strange going.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>I am speechless i must say the whole film is pure fun & it will knock your socks off,not to mention anything on your body that is'nt nailed down . i thought i'd be great but it was better than i expected, bravo to cast you blew me out of water thank you for making a fun romp of a show 10 stars to ya . it will engross your senses you'll wonder where the time went, i'd gladly pay the money again to see it .<p>Highly recommend . it's a movie that plays like a play because it is one . oh by the way for you richard gere fans out there richard does sing in this picture , it's musical but no embarrassing moments like many other pictures i've seen, just plain fun & great music . but the show stealers are queenie, zeta jones, renee. queenie ought to do more R&B than rap . dang renee & zeta you guys work good together hope to see in alot more pictures as duo.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chicago is a brilliant big screen adaptation of choreographer-director Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical. The story's ingenious jabs at tabloid fame and the fleeting tastes of the popular mindset, omnipresent in the 1920's (the movie's setting) and the 1970's (the date of its writing) is just as relevant today in an age where O.J. Simpson, the Menedez Brothers, and Scott Peterson dominate the pop culture airwaves. Set in Capone's backyard in the midst of the Roaring 20's, Chicago turns in an all-star Hollywood cast and breathes much needed life (i.e. box office success) back into the big screen musical. Viewers won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Chicago stars Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Roxie, wife of sweet, boring Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), has an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely (Dominic West) who she thinks knows the right people to get her a gig as a singer at a swanky nightclub. But when Roxie finds out that Fred is just using her, she shoots him dead right there in her bedroom. When Amos arrives, he sticks up for Roxie, telling the police that he shot the intruder. At least, until he finds out that the dead man is Fred Casley, the man who recently sold them their furniture. Retracting his story, the police arrest Roxie for Fred Casely's murder.<br /><br />Meanwhile, sexy songstress and half of a famous Chicago nightclub sister act, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), sits in jail herself awaiting the day of her trial for the murder of her husband and sister (who she caught performing their number "the spread eagle"). Roxie asks Velma for help, but gets the cold shoulder. But at least one person in the prison is willing to help Roxie. Matron "Mama" Morton (Queen Latifah), overseer of the woman's prison, will do anything for anyone for the right price. For fifty bucks, she places a phone call to the greatest defense lawyer in modern-day times, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). But a phone call only gets her in the door. Roxie's husband Amos must come up with the money to pay Billy, which he does prior to being quickly forgotten.<br /><br />Manipulating the media to the best of his ability, Billy turns Roxie into an overnight celebrity - the hottest sensation to sweep Chicago since, well - since the next one that will come along... Velma Kelly fades from the headlines, and the two rivals compete with each other for the public's and Billy Flynn's attention.<br /><br />Chicago is a refreshing escape the drudgery of modern day box office blockbusters with its insightful peering into the mob mentality of the public psyche and its colorful characters. Queen Latifah steals the show with her portrayal of Mama Morton in a film packed with knockout performances by Hollywood mainstays. All of the stars sing their own numbers, and the soundtrack is simply spectacular. Broadway purists may be critical of the final product, but no one can doubt that Chicago is as big a hit on screen as it is on stage. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this one...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>What can I say... This is an over-the-top piece of cinema that is so much fun to watch!<p>Very well cast and directed.  The sets, lighting, camera work, and editing are all top notch and keep the story moving at a breakneck pace, in a very entertaining fashion.<p>What a great way to bring the musical back to the forefront!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>There aren't enough words that I can come up with to say how amazing that "Chicago" really is. This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie. There haven't been many musicals in recent years due to the lack of popularity during recent times and naturally, I'm not a big fan of musicals but I think that Chicago brings new life into this genre of movies and has paved the way to bringing musicals back into the front spotlight again for the new generations of movie-goers. DANGER: Possible spoilers ahead, hopefully not. <p>Set in the Jazz Age of the early 1920s, Al Capone was rising to become the notorious Prohibition Era gangster leader, and new fashion trends were causing an uproar. Outside the shadow of Capone's looming shadow, this movie is a tale of two well known dancers who are suspected of killing their husbands after an affair. Roxie Art, who faces possible execution for murdering her abusive boyfriend who constantly rejected her and her estranged husband Amos refused to take blame for it, seeks a money hungry, never-lost-a-case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos. <p>The songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters. Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing. All of the characters in "Chicago" are amazing but for me, it's a toss up between Queen Latifah as Matron "Mama" Morton, Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelley, and Richard Gere as William Flynn. Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness. All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance. The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters. I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances. <p>Queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron "Mama" Morton. Morton offers Roxie Art a deal to get $3K to a lawyer by the name of William `Billy' Flynn who has `never lost a trial' to testify in her favor. Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes. Latifah's vocals are astounding. There's a funny yet good message in her song too. The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones. Velma Kelley play by Jones is also jailed for murdering two people, though it took place before "Chicago" started. Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery. I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great. Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film. As Roxie gains the fame that she has longed for though, Velma is forgotten by many and a bitter rivalry ensues between them. Yes, Roxie is a great dancer but isn't anywhere close to Velma's dancing skills in my opinion. Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi-sleazy lawyer Flynn who seems to get the women characters nuts over him. I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING. I would even say that Richard Gere can sing even better than a lot of commercial pop singers in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called "Mr. Cellophane".  <p>This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. "Chicago" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before "Moulin Rouge" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century. Maybe "Chicago" might have been somewhat overhyped but, it's rare that I say this but, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it and is destined to become a classic in the near future.  For some extra trivia, I myself am native to Chicago and I guess for this reason this movie means so much more to me than it would've otherwise had I not been a Native Chicagoan. Go and see this movie before it's too late as it won't have anywhere near the punch on the small screen like it did the on the movie theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Chicago quite simply is jaw-dropping. An insatiable, clever, sexy, stylish, and incredibly bizarre masterpiece of film-making that gets the blood pumping and will leave you in awe. A sinful delight that temptingly calls to you and you can't take your eyes off the screen at really any point. Pure eye candy and pure deliciousness that no other musical can match. On top of having endless style, it also packs on quite a story.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It's the 1920's in the most corrupt city in America; Chicago. When a woman named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) murders a man she was sleeping with (And cheating on her husband) after she discovered he lied to her about getting her into show business, she of course ends up going to jail with the possibility of being hanged along with her idol Velma Kelly played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Who killed her husband and sister after she caught them together). They both hire a lawyer named Billy Flynn (Richard Gere); a man who is all about women and money and has never lost a case defending a female client. Roxie and Velma hate each other and are trying to grab all of the media attention by making themselves out to be innocent in some rather strange ways. Now these girls are out to get each other and prove their innocence simultaneously, all while Billy sits back and revels in the glory. Prepare yourself for a film you won't soon forget.<br />MUSIC: Every musical scene is vibrant and filled with life. No musical scene rested on its laurels and they all delivered slam-bang showcases of wonder and amazement. There is not a single bad musical scene, they were all simply amazing and brilliant the whole way through.<br />ACTING: Fantastic and superbly accomplished in every way. There was not a single dull character and they all felt alive and interesting, even the actors I've never been a fan of (Queen Latifah for example). I have absolutely no gripes against any of the performances in this film at all.<br />ACTION: This film was never boring and there was always something happening. Whether it be one of the many amazing musical scenes or even the funny bits of humor, everything came to life. The cinematography, set pieces, and visual look are simply to die for. Though this film is PG-13, this is definitely not a film for kids and at times it is borderline R-rating with the copious sexual content and some scenes of violence. An adult musical all the way.<br />OVERALL: If you have taste in film, then Chicago is a must-have that will blow you away and you will relish every moment of it. A treat for the mind and the soul that burns into your memory and won't let go. The best damn musical to ever hit cinema, period. Go watch it now.<br />THE GOOD: Everything.<br />THE BAD: Nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>You can credit `Chicago' with bringing the beloved musical back into our lives, even if it doesn't really deserve the full credit.  Just the year before the marvelous (and superior) `Moulin Rouge!' managed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and surely paved the way for `Chicago' to win the Oscar.  The year before that `art house' master Lars von Trier gave us the brilliant `Dancer in the Dark', and while it didn't manage a Best Picture nomination, it caused a major stir with the critics and definitely got a lot of people talking.  So, what I guess I'm trying to say is that, while `Chicago' is regarded as the musical of this generation, it didn't capture that title on its own merits.<br /><br />It is a great film, truly absorbing and thoroughly entertaining; but it is far from the best musical of this generation.<br /><br />Taking a saucy stage play and giving it its due on the big screen is a big undertaking.  I have seen the stage play a few times and devour it every time; it's that stunningly entertaining.  For me, and this should really go for nearly everyone, a musical lives and dies with the VOICES carrying the songs.  If someone cannot sing, they should NOT be in a musical.<br /><br />I wanted to get that out of the way.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Roxie Hart, the aspiring singer who gets a little carried away during a lovers spat and takes a man's life.  Claiming self defense, Roxie gets help from attorney Billy Flynn, who capitalizes off her story to get publicity.  Roxie's doting husband Amos waits in the shadows as his wife's popularity grows, but when Roxie finds herself being `forgotten' by the public she has to go to even greater extremes to keep their attention.<br /><br />I really liked the way that director Gary Marshall constructed the film.  It has this out of body quality to the musical numbers, which makes sense in the setting.  It gives it a very `showy' feel that gives the illusion of watching a cabaret variety show.  This approach is needed to give the film some style; style that suits the premise and atmosphere.<br /><br />The film is very `razzle dazzle'.<br /><br />As far as the performances are concerned, there is a lot of love here.  Thank GOD Catherine Zeta-Jones won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of the washed up Velma Kelly.  She ravishes on screen and just completely engulfs every scene she is in.  Her `song and dance' pleading with Roxie is sensational to put it lightly.  She clearly outshines the rest of the cast, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the cast falters.  A lot has been said about Renee Zellweger and her lack of singing talent.  Like I said, a musical must be judged on the VOICES carrying the songs, but in this case, it is that lack of talent that works in her favor.  She is an aspiring singer, and one gets the impression that she is aspiring because she lacks the talent to really survive.  She is arrogant and pretty confident, but the fact remains that she hasn't made it.  She needs this trial to become a star, and that speaks volumes for her natural talent.  I adore Zellweger here.<br /><br />As far as voices go, one doesn't get much better than Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.  They are the best vocals in the bunch, yet sadly they give the most mediocre performances.  I love Reilly, and in 2002 he had a stellar year (appearing in THREE Best Picture nominees; `Chicago', `Gangs of New York' and `The Hours', as well as the independent film `The Good Girl').  His Supporting Actor nomination at the Oscars was clearly a nod to his success as an actor, but he was nominated for the wrong film.  His subdued and emotional work in `The Good Girl' should have nabbed him the nomination.  Latifah has a showier role, and her `vavavavoom' performances really add some color to the film; but she's sadly lacking in screen time.<br /><br />Reading that they once considered Kevin Spacey for the role of Flynn makes me a little sad, since he is not only a stunning actor but a brilliant singer and he would have chewed this up (and may have even walked away with an Oscar) but the lackluster Richard Gere took on the role and just does NOTHING for me here.  His voice is very mediocre, his performances are awkward and while I actually found his quick witted delivery in his spoken scenes to be entertaining he just never really comes together as a complete character to me.<br /><br />I was put off.<br /><br />The film can at times be all over the place, but it makes up for it with ample amounts of style that get poured all over every scene like syrup.  It works.  Yes, it is overrated, but that doesn't mean it doesn't prove itself a visual feast and a memorable experience.  When you look at the year that was 2002 you instantly think of `Chicago', and rightfully so.  Sure, `The Pianist' was a much better film, but `Chicago', without a doubt, is the one you are going to want to watch again and again and again.<br /><br />And BTW, those set pieces and costumes are all sorts of spectacular!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>That's right, Zuper! Zuper! Richard Gere was great as the manipulative, money-hungry, publicity-grabbing laywer Billy Flynn working to get Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) off of a murder charge. John C. Reilly's "Cellophane Man" was surprisingly entertaining. Along with of course, Richard Gere's great "puppet man" scene.<br /><br />But Zellweger really steals the show. Well, along with Zeta-Jones' super performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones with a real "triple-threat" performance (like that of Zellweger) really helped put this movie over the top. What a pair of bombshells. The Duo's closing number is awesome. Super choreography throughout the entire movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>The dancers were great.  Choreography was good. Good musical overall.  Richard Gere still needs more dancing grace and skill.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Absolutely hands down the best musical to date put to screen.  Zellweger should have won the Oscar for this performance.  It was so bold and unlike anything she has ever done and she pulled off successfully.  Not to worry she would eventually get her Oscar the following year.  Ms. Zeta-Jones defintely earned her acclaim as well as Queen Latifiah.  I think John C. Reilly was definitely overlooked in his performance.  High octane and guarantee to make you tap your feet and snap your fingers this film pure entertainment.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Chicago is the film adoption of the Broadway musical, and Catherine Zeta Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (looking more like a sheep than ever with a wooly-bah-lamb hairstyle) truly shine. Some musical numbers are really quite awesome such as "We Both Reached for the Gun" and "Mr. Cellophane." But as I watched the film, it became clear that the producer was a man. Some of the costumes were quite bondage-looking, and the dance numbers were quite sexual and provocative. The director misses no opportunities to flash a bit of skin and I'm reminded a bit of the 'women in prison' sexploitation films from the seventies. =-/ Bleh.<br /><br />Still, this is a light-hearted glossy film with some great dance numbers and a few catchy tunes. Well worth the time and expense, even if I found the style a trifle exploitive and the plot glossing over such serious subjects as prison, murder, and spousal abuse a trifle disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>I must toast director Rob Marshall with a tall glass of champagne (I don't even drink, so this should speak volumes to you why I would break my rule!).  He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the "big screen" with smooth grace.  Though, this process was anything but easy, according to the TV show I distinctively recall on Broadway that divulged all kinds of juicy tidbits about production (particularly the great "blood, sweat and tears" efforts Richard Gere took in fine tuning his tap dance routine--Gere was previously not known for his dance, partly because he hadn't really formally had to put into practice in a film before.  He went on to showcase his flair for movement in the American remake of SHALL WE DANCE, with Jennifer Lopez.)  Catherine Zeta-Jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!).  Renee Zellwegger had minimal "formal" training in dancing, but made improvements in leaps and bounds (no pun intended), which is made evident in the numbers where she appears as a soloist, as well as her duets with Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br /><br />I know I haven't spent much time discussing the plot, but, in all honesty, it is pretty convoluted and I would only ruin the experience of watching the film for you!  I will say that is set during the age of the "Roaring Twenties," and oh boy, did they (rightfully) have something to howl about, back then.  The intrigues associated with fleeting celebrity are examined closely and at their most visceral.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) is the "up and coming" singer/dancer who just can't get that big break, and is never really what anyone is looking for. While Velma Hart (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the sultry star with the fashionable bob that no one can get enough of.  It isn't until a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.  No more plot details required, believe me.  What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb & Kander.  Songs like "All That Jazz" are featured here.  You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).  There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.  You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>When I started watching this movie I was not sure if I was going to like it or not...some of it seemed a bit choppy. It took me a while to get the jist of the whole thing, but once I got into the swing of the film, I enjoyed it. I thought that the songs were great for the most part, and I was impressed with the talent that each actor/actress showed in this film. If you are into musicals, then this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Do you enjoy musicals? This is the only question you need to ask yourself before deciding to see Chicago. If the answer is yes---then you must make sure you view this movie first on a large screen. A dvd or video version should be your second choice. Director Rob Marshall has put together a fast paced comedic musical that is utterly fantastic. The songs are of top notch quality. There's rarely a momentary pause in the action. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and others normally thought of as serious thespians perform splendidly in atypical singing and dancing roles. One, though, gets the distinct impression that these actors were thrilled to accept the challenge to get back to their early roots. Most of their characters are scoundrels, liars, and back stabbing slime balls. They are also very funny and endearing.<p>Two pre-World War II ambitious women entertainers, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger) have murdered their lovers. Gere portrays the sleezeball attorney Billy Flynn who is committed to the proposition that anyone willing to pay his $5,000 fee should not pay for their crimes. Moreover, he hopes to exploit their notoriety to help them professionally. Flynn believes it's only appropriate to turn a murder charge into a wise career move. To put it mildly, he does nothing to uphold the honor and moral uprightness of the legal profession. Could William Shakespeare have been thinking of a Billy Flynn when urging that all attorneys in Henry VI be put to death? The only nice guy is the cuckolded Amos Hart (John C. Reilly) who is too dumb and naive to realize that everybody is playing him for a fool. Queen Latifah is wonderful as the manipulative jailer. Christine Baranski, Lucy Liu, and Taye Diggs also deserve honorable mention. Chicago most definitely earns five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Not since ALL THAT JAZZ (1979) have I seen a film musical with as much raw energy as CHICAGO. This is fitting since the former is about the life of the brilliant director-choreographer-composer Bob Fosse, and the latter is an adaptation from his stage musical of the same name. As a matter of fact, the opening number in CHICAGO is "All That Jazz". <p>CHICAGO has, of course, enough of a rudimentary plot to cement together the dance numbers, which are the film's raison d'?tre. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a wannabe dancer in 1930s Chicago, who idolizes Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). However, both are arrested for murder, Roxie having gunned down a duplicitous lover after he reneges on a promise to introduce her to a friend who can get her into the Biz, and Velma for having whacked her husband and her sister when she caught the two in bed together. Thrown into Cook County Jail, both fall under the control of the jolly and corrupt Matron "Mama" Morton (Queen Latifah), and both retain the services of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a flamboyant lawyer who specializes in defending women accused of homicide, and who's never lost a case.<p>There aren't enough superlatives to describe CHICAGO, and I fear my review won't do it justice.  Jones, a former dancer before she turned actress, struts her magnificent stuff beginning with the opening number ("All That Jazz"). Zellweger and Gere, neither hoofers by training, are seemingly miscast - but it works magnificently. All three sing and dance their way through the film in visually stunning choreographed numbers that had the audience clapping after each.<p>As Roxie and Velma worked their way through the criminal and judicial systems, the creators of CHICAGO were astoundingly clever in superimposing a musical version of each step in the process on the "real" one, for examples, the on-site police investigation of Roxie's crime ("Funny Honey"), Matron Morton's introductory speech to her new charges ("When You're Good to Mama"),  Flynn's entrance ("All I Care About"), and Roxie's defense ("We Both Reached for the Gun"). My favorite comes during Roxie's trial when Flynn, more showman than counselor, displays his philosophy on defense strategy with the glitzy "Razzle Dazzle". <p>CHICAGO is loud, colorful, in-your-face, exuberant entertainment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you don't take the opportunity to see it while it's on the Big Screen at the beginning of 2003, then you're doing yourself a huge injustice. I beg you to see this film! I intend to see it at least once more, and will purchase the CD soundtrack and DVD when they're released.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Here's a movie that is sure to really take your breath away, whether you like musicals or not.  Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast &amp; crew.  This is one such example of this!<p>The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two women awaiting trial for murder during the Roaring 20s.  Zelwegger plays Roxie, a somewhat neurotic young woman who dreams of being the &quot;center of attention&quot; on a broadway stage.  Jones plays Velma, a woman who has already experienced such fame.<p>Roxie looks upon everything that happens in her life thru the lens of Vaudeville.  [It's because of this that the film turns out to be a musical].  By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the &quot;celebrity prisoner&quot; who gets all the publicity.<p>Richard Gere plays a fast-talking, suave lawyer who is hoping to get both of the girls off the hook (for a price).  His goal is to manipulate the media, public opinion and the jury in the girl's cases.<p>In the process, Roxie ends up supplanting Velma as the #1 prisoner celebrity.  Ironically, Roxie gets all the attention that she craved all her life, only it's from being a murderess instead of being a star.<p>Lucy Liu has a cameo as a heiress who threatens to usurp the celebrity status from both of them and grab the spotlight for herself.  All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!<p>One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.  There were no body doubles, stand-ins or lip-sinking.  Zelwegger said afterward that this was the most physically demanding movie she'd ever done, and it shows.<p>As a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.  The play was written by a journalist of the time and was a satire on women getting off of murder raps.  The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.<p>While the duet between Jones &amp; Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.  This one is a can't-miss film.  It is feel-good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near-impossible project.....and they nailed it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Spotlight hungry Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) dreams of a life on the stage and spends her nights jazzing it up in the bright lights of Chicago, continually hoping that she'll find her lucky break.  In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his  way with her, he reveals that he has no connections in showbusiness.  She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him.  Upon discovering that he had an affair, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail.  In jail she finally meets Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale.  The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Billy is more a showbiz P.R agent than a legal lawyer and manipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. The tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block and Roxie finally becomes a star.<br />The storyline in this movie was ok but the singing and dancing was amazing!  Catherine Zeta Jones' opening number was the best I've seen.  The choreography in this movie will blow you away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much from Richard Gere or Renee Zellweger going into this movie, but they really all did such fantastic jobs. It's no wonder that it has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards. This was truly the most classy and fun movie of the year. I didn't see a more unique one at all from 2002. I have never seen a movie done like Chicago before. Musical sequences are intertwined with reality sequences that truly make Chicago a very memorable movie. It is very risque for a PG-13 movie though, and there are a few cuss words, so you might want to think before taking the kids. Other than that though, Chicago was phenominal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Chicago is a well- made musical production that tells the story of several vaudeville ladies in 1920's Chicago who compete for fame and fortune and are willing to sacrifice their reputations, sleep with different men, kill a few people, etc., to advance their careers. This movie was award with the Best Picture Oscar for 2002 and after watching it a couple of times, it is easy to see why it was considered for this prestigious award. The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all- star cast that includes performers like Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifa. With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success. And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.<br /><br />What makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself; in particular, the catchiness of the tunes, the presentation of the songs, and the integration of the songs within the context of the film. Among the many songs in this musical (about 18 of them), some of them are certainly better than others with the standouts being "I Move On", "All I Care About", and "All that Jazz". Many of the others are only average and I have already forgotten most of them- even after watching the movie two times. The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves. The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta- Jones and Renee Zellweger leading the way. Dozens of hot female bodies twist and turn to the music, making you quickly forget about quality of the songs themselves.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good. What I like best about it is the character development and the progression of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started. It is interesting to watch as Renee Zellweger's character goes from a sexually dissatisfied woman married to a very homely looking man to a murderess. She is concerned at first that she will spend her life behind bars for killing the man she was having an affair with. Then, realizing her media star power as a woman who shot and killed a man, she forgets about the murder and lavishes in the attention, only to see the spotlight ultimately shift to another person who has an even greater story to tell.<br /><br />All of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves. There is no lip- syncing or dubbed music here. The star performers prove they have earned their celebrity status by performing their own parts. Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain- looking, plain- spoken husband.<br /><br />Overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around. The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable. But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Bob Fosse's "Chicago" is a spectacular and naughty musical.  Two Showgirls (Rene'e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are put in the slammer for each murdering their lovers.  Their crimes of passion are presented as petty, but predictable in the Windy City during the Jazz Age.  The only regrets they have are the gallows, and their only deliverance is a greedy and conceited lawyer (played by Richard Gere).  Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.<br /><br />The drama moves from the prison to the stage where the singers unbear their souls for each key scene.  The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.  The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.  Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.  The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.  There is some cynicism in the story, but the playful antics overshadow the darker elements of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Rob Marshall brought this popular Broadway musical to the big screen in 2002 and saw it win an impressive six Oscars. The film didn't appeal to me on its release and it's only through Mrs B that I have finally seen it. I try to approach any new film with an open mind so grabbed my dancing shoes, dusted down my underused vocal cords and headed for 1920s Chicago to see if I could figure out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) dreams of a career in showbiz and believes she has found her lucky break in Fred Cassely who draws Roxie into an affair with the assurance of the stardom she has long craved. When Cassely turns out to be a liar, Roxie kills him on the spot and finds herself imprisoned and all set to be hanged. She shares the prison with a group of women who have taken brutal revenge against the men that have wronged them, the most prominent being club singer and media sensation, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is in prison for murdering her husband and sister following their affair. What follows is a struggle between Roxie and Velma to be the tabloid favourites while putting their faith in legendary lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), to help them win freedom and avoid the hangman's noose.<br /><br />Chicago boasts some terrific songs with my personal favourites being "Cell Block Tango" where Roxie's fellow prisoners each tell their stories and justify the killing of their partners, and "Mr Cellophane" where Roxie's husband, Amos (John C. Reilly) reflects on his insignificance despite being married to a murderess who is on the front page of the newspapers. Throw in some dazzling choreography and you have the hallmarks of a great musical.<br /><br />Though Zellweger is undoubtedly the lead she is outshone by her co-stars. Though never on the A-list John C. Reilly seldom disappoints in a film and he is once again on fine form here. However, the biggest surprise for me was the performance of Catherine Zeta-ones as Velma Kelly. In both acting and dancing she stands out against the rest of the cast and that Oscar nod she was given doesn't quite seem as outrageous as I had previously thought.<br /><br />One of my big concerns with Chicago was the character of Roxie Hart. Though she is a wronged woman I didn't find her sympathetic particularly in the harsh treatment of her husband. Her self-absorption at the height of her fame with the media did slightly annoy and even when Billy Flynn does take on her case I found myself unconcerned whether she would escape the death penalty or not. The other characters in the film deserved more focus but in their supporting roles they each sustain Chicago and ensure it remains enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />Though not my favourite musical Chicago left my initial reservations completely unjustified. Its portrayal of the glamour of 1920s showbiz and the still unforgiving nature of the media were well conveyed. With some memorable music and performances it's easy to see why this musical has endured as long as it has.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>The music, the costumes, the dancing and singing, are all top rate. Who cares if the plot is downright stupid? I'd give it five stars if it was just a little more clearly understood to be humor, but murder is such an un-funny thing.<br /><br />Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a girl in the chorus who had an affair with a furniture dealer because he claimed he could get her a job in a swank nightclub. When she discovered he was lying and he laughed at her, she shot him, then tried to get her auto mechanic husband to take the blame.<br /><br />They met in prison where the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) is doing quite a business in selling favors of various kinds, and apparently collecting them, too. She recommends Roxie see defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has never lost a case. Turns out he's Velma's attorney, too.<br /><br />That's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene. But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere. Might make you think of Jailhouse Rock or Cry Baby. Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly. All in all, it's a lot of fun, and makes me think again about the fashion dolls Robert Tonner made from the main characters. If I had the money . . . but of course I do not.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>CZ-J, RZ and RG are excellent, what a talented collection of performers.<br />Production values are top notch - art direction, staging, choreography, cinematography and most especially the editing.<br />Artistically summarizes life in Chicago at that time in history, uniquely using the prespective of the women.<br /><br />Excellent 'adult' entertainment.<br />RECOMMEND</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>What a great musical made even greater on Blu Ray disc!!!

A good surprise.  I am not a fan of Catherine Zetta-Jones, but I will admit she is okay in this movie.  I however think Zellweger steals the show along with Gere and Latifah.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is that two ladies are on murderess row and Gere is trying to make them stars from there.  Yet, there is only one room for a legend.  In the end there will be a star, who will it be?  It is a great remake of a musical and I enjoyed the music.  I think the music shinned right along with the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;Chicago&quot; is the Academy Award winning musical from 2002 that brought back the genre in elegant style.  Set during the rum running twenties, the plot loosely follows to murderesses (Catherine Zeta Jones-Douglas and Rene Zellweger) who are awaiting their fate on death row.  Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.  Electrifying musical numbers rock this rather flat story and bump up the action a well deserved notch - but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!<br />Mirimax's DVD won't be winning any awards.  Colors are well balanced but flesh tones are overly pinkish and flat.  Fine details are lost in the darker scenes, even when viewing the movie in a completely blackened room.  Edge enhancement and aliasing crop up now and then, though nothing that will terribly distract.  Film grain is a real problem - certain scenes are smooth as silk while others look as though they are at least twenty years old. (Herein I am not making references to the stylistic aged look employed during certain segments of the movie but various shots within a particular scene that veer wildly between generally smooth to excessively grainy.  Check out Zeta Jone's &quot;All That Jazz&quot; number that opens the film. When Rene Zellweger intrudes with her own bar and chorus, the background information in the shot is suddenly riddled with grit, grain and a digital harshness.)  Not a terrible mastering effort - just not an exemplary one and for a BEST PICTURE WINNER of one year vintage, entirely unacceptable.  The audio is 5.1 and DTS but neither are particularly distinguished though both offer an aggressive bass and some kick during the musical numbers.<br />EXTRAS:A deleted song, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.<br />BOTTOM LINE: I would have at least expected a &quot;making of&quot; for this movie but I suppose Miramax is holding that back for a special &quot;deluxe&quot; edition sure to be out before Christmas.  This is a very disappointing over all marketing of a BEST PICTURE - especially one that garnered tons of critical attention and a host of awards!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>Usually, I never watch musicals, but "Chicago" is amazing!  The music, especially, is great.  It's been a long time since a musical this wonderful has been released.  Nobody knew that any of the actors could sing so well, though they had to attend intensive voice lessons before filming.  I loved how they switch periodically from their life(speaking mostly) to their fantasy(singing on stage).  The costumes and stage setting was amazing to look at.  "Chicago" was well deserving for its six Oscar wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress(Catherine Zeta-Jones).  I expected more wins, but that's okay.  This will be a classic years from now!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Film is a harsh mistress. Every imperfection is magnified a million times and, the worst part, permanently recorded for all the world to see. That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise. Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.<p>Based on the Kander &amp; Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film. That's a rarity since the &quot;death&quot; of the film musical. Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium; the musical numbers are mobile, well edited and choregraphed and he manages to integrate the mobility of film with the necessary static elements of the original stage play.<p>Although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own. What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.  Marshall keeps the original story intact. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones play, respectively, wanna-be caberet performer and the real deal who end up in prison after committing murder. Zellweger murders her lover who had promised to help her breakthrough into performing after he reveals he had no connections and was just using her for sex. <p>Zeta-Jones murders her husband and sister (her partner in their musical act)when they are caught in the act --quite literally--of commiting adultry. Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones circle like wary predators unclear on the concept of trust. They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals. The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.<p>Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (playing Roxie Hart) and Catherine Zeta-Jones both sparkle in their film debt as dancers and singers. While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material. In fact, their strong backgrounds as actors add an element that might be missing from technically more gifted singers. Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.<p>Richard Gere is especially noteworthy. I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances. What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career. His gold digging lawyer is every bit a manipulator as Roxie Hart(Zellweger). John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise. While he's a terrific actor, I never pictured him as a singer. He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number. O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold. He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause. <p>The Kanter &amp; Ebb songs are great. Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written. Kanter's music is also a highlight. It's clear that Chicago is every bit the equal (although smaller in scope)of their classic Cabaret. If Chicago isn't quite as powerful as Fosse's film version of Cabaret or even All That Jazz, it's due to the smaller scope of the story. It's equally entertaining though. <p>The transfer is terrific with the crisp picture and colors captured vividly in this DVD transfer. The sound transfer is rich although there is some noticable compression in a couple of scenes. The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another. The widescreen version preserves the original aspect ratio. Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well. Since this film is about the onscreen dancing and singing, there's some picture loss but it won't be noticable to most folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>Bob Fosse was such a larger-than-life talent, and this exuberant adaptation of his Seventies stage production shows it. The story of two murdering femme fatales (Renne Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both belting out songs and dancing their hearts out) in Prohibition-era Chicago is cynical, jaded, beyond belief--and just right as a vehicle to showcase the stars' considerable talents in an area where we did not expect to see them.<p>Picture Richard Gere, a hotshot lawyer who represents both ladies, singing and dancing while keeping his cynical persona intact, and you have an idea of just what a romp this movie really is. Catherine Zeta-Jones, showstopping gorgeous as a Theda Bera-style vamp, is nothing less than wonderful. So is Queen Latifah, who steals the show as the bribe-taking, seen-it-all matron of the women's prison. I'd see the movie all over again just to see the Queen give it all she's got in full twenties regalia--including a feather boa.<p>It's Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, who ultimately makes the movie, even though the entire ensemble cast is fabulous, right down to the bit players. She does a bravura job as Roxie, the sweet little murderess who, after plugging her no-good lover with a chest full of bullets shot at point-blank range, manages to convey a frightened innocence that makes one want to hug her. Slimmed down entirely from her zaftig "Bridget Jones" days, Renee gives it all she's got, and shows that she coulda been a contender--a torch singer par excellence.<p>Wild, big, bold, with 20s-style sets and 21st-century over-the-top editing, "Chicago" is a wonderful treat, well worth seeing more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Average video bit rate: 21.43 Mbps<br />Running time: 1:53:26<br />Disc size: 28,03 GB<br />Disc size: 41,90 GB<br />LPCM 5.1 6912Kbps 24-bit/48Khz English<br />Dolby Digital 5.1 640 Kbps English / French / Spanish<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br /><br />#Feature commentary with director and screenwriter<br />#Movie Showcase<br />#Class<br />#Behind The Scenes Special<br />#From Stage To Screen: The History of Chicago<br />#Musical Performances<br />#An Intimate Look at Director Rob Marshall<br />#When Liza Minnelli Became Roxie Hart<br />#Academy Award-Winning Production Designer John Myhre<br />#Academy Award-Winning Costume Designer Colleen Atwood</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I love "Chicago". How do I know that? I've seen it twice in the theater, the friend of mine downloaded it for me from the Internet, and gave me CDs for my b-day, and I bought a DVD when it finally became available.<br /><br />Well, it may not be nearly as perfect as the Broadway revival - the plot, the cinematography, and the chronologically incorrect details - but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.<br /><br />First of all, Chicago did not take itself too seriously - there are a lot of details that were reused from Bob Fosse's himself (the All That Jazz number was done like an opening scene in Cabaret, Velma's playing with the chair in I Can't Co It Alone - also). Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's "Makin' Whoopee" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys. Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing; it was a very good acting. And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms - and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: "Objection!" - ADA Harrison:"But Your Honor, I have not even asked any question"!).<br /><br />Second, "Chicago" surprised me. I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it. With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of "All That Jazz" , Katherine Zeta-Jones just blew me away - the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it. She was born to play Velma. When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing - I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them - which is important, right? The following scenes were as delightful as the opening - Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango - people, look me in the eye and tell me that Cell Block Tango was not fun to watch and listen to? My personal favorite was: "He was crazy, and he kept on screaming, "You've been screwing the milkman." And then he ran into my knife... he ran into my knife ten times."<br /><br />The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number - it actually showed in those three-four minutes the sadness and loneliness of a small man, maybe not very bright but decent and devoted one. The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who do not like Renee Zellweger. I am not her fan, either, but I have to say that she did almost impossible in "Chicago" - she made people look at her when she and Zeta-Jones were on the screen together. She acted great, her character was changing constantly - from the sweet little housewife dreaming of fame to the frustrated and humiliated woman who killed her lover to the common heartless criminal who'll stop at nothing to receive money, power and fame. It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.<br /><br />With all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>For fans of the movie musical, and everyone else for that matter, this movie is a gift!  Featuring most of the sensational Kander-Ebb numbers from the Fosse Broadway show, but presented with the fresh imagination of director Ronb Marshall, this movie is non-stop, gleefully sinful fun.  And the performers really shine, most of all Renee Zellwegger, who is a brilliant choice to play Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta-Jones literally slithers across the screen, and who knew Richard Gere was such a terrific tap dancer?  Concerned much more with fame and the spotlight than with the means it takes to gets there, this movie's heroines have more than a small chip on their shoulder; they are basically a collection of killers.  You will find it hard not to applaud each and every number; the music is infectious, non-stop and expertly arranged and performed.  Chica-GO!</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I deliberately waited this long to watch this movie.  Many of my friends went to watch this movie in the cinemas and they told me it's good.  Then, "Chicago" won six Oscars.  Still, I relented.  To me, a good movie would be that it's still watchable and enjoyable years after it's released.  The decision was a good one.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.  Her background in musical showed through.  Her experience and her confidence oozed through & thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.  Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.  However, her presence was so relevant to the twenties.  Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.  What made their performances even more admirable was that all of them sang and danced through "Chicago" and they were all amateurs before this.  The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.  Whilst the razzle dazzle was impressive, the movie had a serious undertone, the analysis of the change of America's society.  We were brought to the attention of women's enpowerment, the power and people's vanity towards media's exploitation, greed, indiscretion.  "Chicago" was every bit a show-stopper and it's a DVD collection worth having at home.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>When Chicago came out everyone was making a huge deal about it. I rolled my eyes and chose to not see it.

"Chicago" is an exception to that pointless wave of musicals and the story is a great one on stage or on the screen.<br /><br />What makes the movie very special is that it highlights all the characters and doesn't take the light away from the leads: Roxan, Velma, and the attorney.<br /><br />Certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta-Jones.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it.  It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.  Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor).  But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing.<br /><br />I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.  Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that.  She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister.  Through Matron `Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too.  Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit na?ve husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone.<br /><br />The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star.  She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain.  The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.  Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.  One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's `I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful.<br /><br />`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.  Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.  His direction here couldn't have been better.  `Chicago' is a film that will never grow old, never grow tired and never leave my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Chicago is my second favorite musical right behind Grease. Renee Zellweger should have gotten the oscar for best actress for Chicago. Her acting is so vulnerable and fascinating, she is not like any other actress nowadays. Her singing is great, boy i was pleasantly surprised, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere are great as well. Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall. The audio commentary is also very good. I love the numbers, All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and Roxie. It is fast paced, has a solid storyline, and excellent tap dance number by Gere. Get this movie today, it will have you dancing like a nutcase, but a stylish nutcase.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I have never been a big fan of musicals, and there is only a couple that I consider great movies, like "All That Jazz" and "Cabaret". I have to say that even though "Chicago" is not at the exact same level as these two movies, it is good enough to leave a lasting impression. The music is very good and entertaining, the performances of Catherine Zetta-Jones and Renee Zellweger are inspiring, and the story is interesting.<br /><br />The film starts by jumping right into the action, with amazing music - what a great song is "All that Jazz" - and with Velma Kelly (Zetta-Jones) walking into her dressing room, hiding a gun and washing the blood from her hands. That same night, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is among the audience watching Velma and dreaming of being like her. She even witnesses when the police comes to take Velma away for the murder of her cheating husband and her sister, who was the object of his affection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Roxie is acting on her dreams, and to get there she is sleeping with a man she believes has connections in the show business world and can help her become a star. When she finds out that he was lying, and his "connections" were just a scam to get into her pants, she kills him by shooting him point blank. The husband tries to save her, but is not successful in his attempt, and does not try hard after he figures out what was going on between the deceased and his wife; thus, Roxie ends up in the same prison as Velma.<br /><br />Enters Billy Flynn (Gere), the slick lawyer that has a reputation for being able to get anyone off the hook, no matter how gruesome the crime or how abundant the evidence. He is Roxie's last chance, so she has to engage in a competition with Velma to see which case he handles first. The corrupt environment also includes Mama (Queen Latifah), the prison guard who really believes in tit for tat and is always on the prowl for fresh meat.<br /><br />I was surprised when I learned that both Zellweger and Zetta-Jones actually sing themselves in all the music pieces, since the quality of their singing is superb and it appears to be done by professional singers. Both of them do an outstanding job in their acting, and are supported in their roles by the quality performances of Richard Gere and Queen Latifah. Congratulations to Rob Marshall and his team for a remarkable final product.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>I am so happy that musicals have made it back to the Hollywood spotlight.  Chicago is a new musical classic from the 21st Century.  The movie seems old even as if it was made in the golden years of MGM or Warner Brothers.  The acting was superb, the music was great, and the songs were addictive.  It is a very fast paced, sexy, vibrant outburst of crime and jazz in the 20s.  Renee Zellweger played the sweet innocent Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere plays another millionare, but this time he is a singing one.  My favorite acting from the film came from Queen Latifa, who played Mamma Morton, and Catherine Zeta- Jones who played the gruff and bold Velma Kelly.  All around the movie was awesomely put together.  It all blended into a fantastic film.  One of the best musicals ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>Chicago, a film adaptation of the Broadway Musical by Fosse, is brilliantly brought to life in this production starring Rene Zellweger, Katherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere.  With a supporting cast featuring other Hollywood A-List actors like John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, and the fabulous Queen Latifah, its no wonder that this movie went on to achieve the pinnacle of fame as it swept its way through the Academy Awards this past year.<p>The story, set in the roaring 20's Chicago of gangster fame, is the tale of Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an ambitious unknown singer whose hunger for fame and fortune leads her into the arms of a man who promises to get her the connections she needs.  Later, when she learns that he is has been leading her to sleep with her, she shoots him in a moment of anger.  Her husband, unaware of his wife's extra-marial affairs, takes responsibility for the crime until he learns the other man is actually the same man who recently sold them furniture.  Roxy is incarserated, where she meets famed singer and dancer, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), who is also in prison for the murder of her husband and her sister.<p>The musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter-point of real life incident and elaborately staged jazz song-and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the "slammer."<p>Desperate to escape public execution, Roxy implores the assistance of Matron "Mama" Morton (Latifah), the prison headmaster whose corruptability is equal to her authority.  She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.<p>The music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.  One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.  She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.  Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.  One of the surprise performances in this production was that of John C. Riley, who plays Amos Hart, Roxy's estranged and dumb-witted husband.  He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film. <p>Running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.  It is no wonder why this film has had the acclaim that it has.  It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz....<p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Hurray for Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Jochn C.

PLEASE get this film and explore the real and fantasy lives of Roxie Hart as portrayed by Zellweger. It won best picture and it deserved it. The special effects are not the most sophisticated you'll ever see; but no film is ever 110% flawless. It's a winner!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>&quot;Chicago&quot; is spectacular. What impressed me the most was how theatrical the film really was. It stuck exactly to the script of the original Broadway show and captured the essence of Fosse's original choreography. I was blown away. I already knew that Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing, and of course she impressed me (as always), but I was stunned by Renee Zellweger's outstanding performance, as well as Richard Gere's. They were all fabulous: even Queen Latifah was good (now there's something I thought I'd never say!). <p>It was an amazing film that really captured the &quot;razzle dazzle&quot; of the stage show, very brassy and daring and energetic. I loved it. Everyone needs to see it. I'm glad that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; started a trend and that the movie musical is making a major comeback.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>The 2002 Oscar winner for Best Picture,"Chicago" is a musical which has the late Bob Fosse's choreography stamped all over it, although it's really anybody's guess as to whether or not he would have been pleased with this film version of his 1975 stage hit. Happily, the acting was great and the leads did their own singing and dancing.<br /> The story is based on the real-life cases of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner, renamed respectively as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly (There was a real Roxie Hart as well, who committed murder in Indiana in the 1910s), who were exhonerated of murder charges by a flashy lawyer in the 1920s.<br />  The story begins on a snowy night at the Onyx Club in the Chicago of Al Capone, where the booze flows heavily despite Prohibition laws, and a brassy Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives at work late, stopping to hide the gun she has just used to kill her husband and sister after catching them in bed together. She performs the rousing number, "All That Jazz" shortly thereafter as if nothing has happened.<br /> Watching her is ex-chorine Roxie, played by a slender, shiny-complexioned and pixie-faced Renee Zellweger, whose unquenchable desire for fame has led her to cheat on her mechanic husband  with a slickster furniture salesman (Dominic West)who falsely claims he has connections that can revamp Roxie's career.<br /> Soon, Roxie and Fred Casley scurry over to the Hart's apartment to continue their affair. When Roxie asks Fred, as she has before, when he will introduce her to the club manager, and help her return to showbusiness, Fred admits that he lied. The following confrontation becomes violent and Roxie fatally shoots Fred as he tries to leave.<br /> Amos Hart, Roxie's dim-witted but devoted husband(John C. Reilly) tries to cover for her at first as Taye Diggs' Bandleader/Announcer leads us further into the action by introducing Roxie's first number, "That Funny Honey", which changes tones as the investigator mentions the victim's name and Amos becomes aware of his wife's infidelity.<br /> Roxie is arrested and taken to the Cook County Jail, where Chita Rivera, who originated the role of Velma Kelly on Broadway,has a cameo appearance as inmate Nickie.<br /> We are then introduced to Matron Mama Morton(a pretty, regal, and matronly Queen Latifah), and the vaudville numbers continue as she sings the racy and more-than-highly suggestive "When You're Good to Mama".<br /> As she begins her time in prison, we get to know Roxie's inmates during "The Cell Block Tango". Judging from the visuals, where most of the inmates' handkerchiefs came out red  as they finished giving details of their crimes and the Hungarian immigrant's was white, we are to believe that Katalin Helinszki (Ekaterina Chtchelkanova), who was accused of the most heinous of the murders, is innocent.<br /> Soon after, Mama Morton pulls a few strings, Defense Attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere, whose early training in stage musicals, like that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' serves him well here) arrives to represent Roxie, who also has push-over journalist/sob-sister, Mary Sunshine(Christine Baranski)in her corner.<br /> The song "We Both Reached for the Gun" is based on headlines from the actual case, and has the feel of a hymn sung at a revival meeting. It is reflective of Roxie's false repentance for her misdeeds.<br /> As the publicity  surrounding Roxie grows, and the opportunistic Flynn begins to devote more time to her than to his previous client, Velma, another potentially lucrative case appears for Billy  when Lucy Liu's pineapple heiress, Kitty Baxter committs a triple homicide(Note that his discussion of this case with dinner guests would not have taken place today), forcing Roxie and Velma to use a few tricks to win back Billy's attention, including a fake pregnancy.<br />  Onstage, as the murder-as-entertainment scenario continues, we are treated to the long-suffering but loyal Amos' "Mr. Cellophane", and his devotion to his unfaithful and ungrateful wife is heart-rending. But at least he gets more attention than the offscreen family of Fred Casley, who might have given the story an interesting perspective if included.<br /> Roxie's falling-out with Billy over his selected courtroom attire for her ends abruptly upon her observation of the tragic results of a poor woman's inability to get proper representation. Noteworthy is the strong anti-immigrant sentiment of the time.<br /> Ultimately, Flynn, Velma, and Roxie, razzle-dazzle 'em in court. Lies win out over truth, and style, in the form of Flynn, Velma and Roxie,  wins over substance in the form of Colm Feore's prosecutor, Martin Harrison, Katalin Helinszki, and Amos, and the Hart's neighbor, Mrs. Borusewiz (Jayne Eastwood), who also took the witness stand, as often happens in life.<br /> Although acquitted, things didn't end so happily for the real Beulah Annan, whose life ended in a sanitarium in 1928.Belva Gaertner lived to see her story told onstage the year before.<br /> But the man-manipulating Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly live to dazzle the world again, and our rollicking tale of cynical truth ends on a positive note for our main players.<br /> All one could do in the end is heave a sigh, enjoy the show, and "All That Jazz"!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Adapted from the successfully revived hit musical that has been doing the rounds on Broadway and London's West End, Chicago is the cinematic directorial debut of stage director and choreographer Rob Marshall. Chicago is on the whole a dark affair, akin somewhat to both Cabaret and Bugsy Malone. It stars Renee Zellwegger as the `heroine' Roxie Hart, who shoots her no good lover dead when he decides to dump her. Arrested and sent to jail she meets up with fellow killer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones), a former nightclub chanteusse that gunned down both her husband and sister after catching them in a romantic clinch. Velma, initially has no interest in poor old naive Roxie because due to her celebrity lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the prison warder (Queen Latifah) she's a bigger celebrity in prison than she ever was out of prison. That is until Roxie starts to steal her thunder.<p>Hollywood has a long established tradition of making musical movies, indeed the first Oscars best picture winner of the sound era, in 1929, was The Broadway Melody. Until the 1970's when musicals became strangely unfashionable musicals continued to pick up those famous golden statuettes regularly, with the likes of Gigi, West Side Story, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music picking up Best Picture Oscars between 1959 and 1965. It wasn't until 2001's Moulin Rouge that the musical was resurrected and readopted as a viable and popular movie genre. Chicago has been nominated for a whopping 13 Oscars with at least one nomination in every major category, with the exception of Best Actor. It also won three major Golden Globe Awards, Best Picture and Best Actor and Actress in a musical or comedy for its stars, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger. <p> With all the Golden Globes and Oscar hype you might expect that the movie adaptation of Chicago would be something special. However, enjoyable as Chicago undoubtedly is, it is certainly not in the league of any of the previously mentioned screen musicals. Don't get me wrong, Chicago is a good movie, an enjoyable movie and an entertaining movie. It boasts some decent performances too, particularly from the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones and the formidable presence that is Queen Latifah. Richard Gere has some nice moments too and is appropriately slick as lawyer Billy Flynn, manipulating the media and tap dancing his way out of many a tight spot. He has one of the best numbers in the whole show (Razzle Dazzle) and with his background of stage musicals, earlier in his career, was perfectly cast. John C. Reilly nominated in this years Oscars for best supporting actor is both appropriately sad and gullible in equal measures, as Roxie's poor sap of a husband, Amos. ReneeZellweger's performance is also good but not a patch on her turns in Nurse Betty, Bridget Jones's Diary, or Jerry Maguire. Undoubtedly she gives a good performance and is a likeable heroine but next to the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones her lack of a musical background is evident. <p>Chicago is a very difficult show to open out cinematically, with much of the action being set in a prison.  Nearly all of the scenes in Chicago betray its stage origins with little expansion of the action out-with a traditional theatrical format. Even with the device of cutting between the reality and the musical fantasies in Roxie's head, Chicago looks like it was all filmed on a sound stage, which of course it was. It therefore seems strangely unbelievable that Rob Marshall has been nominated as Best Director in this years Academy awards when Baz Luhrmann was excluded from last years nominations. Love it or loathe it Moulin Rouge was surely a far more original, innovative and technically more impressive film than the rather formulaic staginess of Chicago. However, what the movie lacks in innovation it makes up for with its classic musical numbers, such as `All That Jazz', `Mr Cellophane' and the previously mentioned `Razzle Dazzle'. <p>In summary, if you are a fan of stage musicals and cant afford to get to Broadway or London's West End then this is certainly worth the price of a movie ticket and far cheaper too. It boasts a great cast that you'll certainly never see on stage together but you'll miss out on that unique live experience. The choice is yours and in the words of Amos Hart `thanks for listening'.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>With the success of "Moulin Rouge", and now "Chicago", the public seems to be hungry for a genre in Hollywood that has been absent for far too long----the movie musical.  In recent years, it seems only animated films with musical numbers such as those from Disney, for example, succeeded.  Now "Chicago", following in the foot steps of "Moulin Rouge" is eager to buck the trend.  Stylish, well acted and well sung, this movie succeeds in all areas.  The choices of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly could not have been better.  The Golden Globes awarded Zellweger and Gere, the actress and actor trophies in comedy/musical and gave the film the nod for best comedy/musical.  It is well deserved.  The story moves along smoothy and the musical numbers melt into the plot perfectly. The choreography is flawless and the actors can actually belt out a tune!!  Hopefully, Hollywood and the public will take notice and make this movie the blockbuster it deserves to be.  This will definitely be a dvd I will add to my collection.  Check it out!!!!! You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is a musical in the tradition of musicals that are entertaining and easy to digest, and yet some hours later leave one with some apprehension.  Is it really the intent of the story to celebrate getting away with murder?  Or is this movie a statement about how murder by women in emotionally trying circumstances can be justified?  Or perhaps is this an indictment of the criminal justice system?  Or is this just a spicy entertainment?<br /><br />I'll opt for the latter; however I can tell you that women will find this more agreeable than their spouses.  There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed.  I seriously doubt that this production, in which murder from jealousy is seemingly justified, would have been produced as a musical comedy before the modern era.<br /><br />But never mind.  What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.<br /><br />In particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance.  When she comes on singing "When You're Good to Momma" she just about brings the house down.  I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row.  Zeta-Jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.<br /><br />Zellweger, looking almost anorectic compared to the last time I saw her in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)--released only the year before--gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing.  Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta-Jones were at the old song and dance, not having been previous known for being twinkle-toed.<br /><br />You might want to see this to compare how it stands up to a long line of filmland musicals, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc.  Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Rob Marshall's jazzy adaption of Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical CHICAGO is a successful attempt at combining court-room drama and classy musical numbers. And while it may not win big at the Oscars (My bet is on GANGS OF NEW YORK), it still displays enough kinetic, energising spirit to make it a worthy contender for the awards. Marshall's knowing direction makes the whole film enjoyable and the musical numbers are as kitchy as they are catchy. Richard Gere's performance as greasy, smooth-talking laywer Billy Flynn is a nice departure from his usual New York city man shtick. The leading pair of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones have never been better. An exhilarating film that keeps up its flashy sense of fun until the closing credits, CHICAGO does razzle and indeed, dazzle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>CHICAGO is a fantastic and energetic adaptation of a great Broadway musical to come to the silver screen in a long, long time. It has magic and electricity and is filled with extremely brilliant musical performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic, American Sweethearts), Richard Gere (Pretty Women, An Officer And A Gentleman) and Rene Zellweger (Jerry MaGuire, Me Myself & Irene). They all have extremely well refined voices and the performances of Zeta-Jones's singing with her incredible dancing was memorizing. And, who knew Richard Gere could sing and dance?<p>The movie stayed true to the original Broadway production originally co-written, directed and produced by Bob Fosse (Cabaret, Sweet Charity, Lenny & All That Jazz). It is faced paced and quickly edited and with some clever usage of stage scrims/screens and neon you will ever see on the big screen. It is amazing!

They both have incredible voices and screen presences.<p>Directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall (Annie) who also choreographed Annie, Mrs. Santa Claus and Cinderella for Disney ABC TV productions. It has a very big "showman" type feel and look to it.<p>The story is sharp and witty and revolves around the women in prison who kill their boyfriends, lovers or husbands..

While in the slammer, she hears about and eventually gets a lawyer (Richard Gere)to help her get out.  The lawyer is famous for freeing guilty women who have walked in her shoes before.<p>As musicals go, it's just ok.  I can't believe it got all the hype it received including best picture.  The characters are all interesting, especially Queen Latifah, who makes the most of a small role.  Gere and Zellweger are their usual passable selves, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, as another convicted killer looking for a way out also does things pretty well.<p>The problem is, that when musicals insist on making everything musical, it gets in the way.  I swear, not one important point is spoken in this film, it's all sung.  That gets on my nerves.  Since the performances are good, not great and the story is average at best, this film would appeal to only real musical fans, or fans of the performers.  Since I fall into neither category, it was average for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>If you enjoy musicals then you will enjoy the film.  Some people might find the constant breaking out into song annoying, I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the 20's in Chicago.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wants to be a nightclub performer, and she thinks if she beds down a so called manager named Fred Casley she will finally get her big break.  When the man she was having an affair with admits he can't help her, and was only using her for a good time, Roxie gets angry and kills him for betraying her.<br /><br />Roxie's husband is still very much in love with Roxie despite her betrayal, and will do what he has to in order to get her out of jail and cover her legal fees which are not cheap.  Roxie could care less that her husband loves her.  Roxie only has eyes for the limelight and fame.<br /><br />In prison Roxie meets Velma Kelly who she admires. Velma Kelly is in jail for killing her husband and sister who were sleeping together behind her back.<br /><br />Roxie hires Billy Flynn to defend her, and Billy is quite the lawyer.  Roxie and Velma both want to be in the limelight, and in the news.  They will go to any lengths to keep that attention.  Roxie hopes it will help get her career started and Velma wants people to remember her while she is in jail.  For example when Roxie realized she was not getting the attention she wanted because of Lucy Liu's character and she fainted all I could do was shake my head.  She totally forgot she could end up in jail or executed for her crime, and she used her time in jail to seek media attention.  I found it to be rather pathetic.  R&B singer Mya also has a role in the movie.<br /><br />I was quite surprised at Richard's performance.  I did not see him as the singing and dancing type, but he was actually quite good.  Granted he is not the best singer, but he does okay.  Queen Latifah as "Momma" was simply marvelous.  She runs a tight ship, but she actually cares for the inmates in her jail.  If Queen selects the right roles, she has the making of a huge movie star.  My favorite routine out of the whole movie was the Cell Block Tango.  I watched that one routine 6 times.  I enjoyed it that much.  To me this was an okay movie to watch.  It's one I would consider seeing again, especially for the Cell Block Tango routine.  You might find yourself humming some of the songs long after you've watched the movie.  I still find myself singing All that Jazz or Cell Block Tango.  The songs can be toe tapping and somewhat addictive.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Every once in a while an unknown director comes along who serves notice of extraordinary talent, such as Orson Welles with "Citizen Kane" or Francis Ford Coppola with "The Godfather." It's hard to say how Rob Marshall's career will turn out, but he serves notice with "Chicago" that his name can be mentioned without embarrassment in the same sentence as Welles' and Coppola's. In a time when movie musicals are a nearly moribund art form, "Chicago" is one of the very few ever made that approaches the excitement and immediacy of a musical live on stage. Movie musicals notoriously offer myriad pitfalls for bathos, usually involving stars who can't sing or dance or directors who don't know how to stage a musical number. Marshall, a choreographer by training, wrings every inherent drop of excitement and pizzazz from every number, and he takes care to hire stars who CAN sing and dance--most notably Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both perfect for a musical set in the Jazz Age. They look like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks reborn, they sing wonderfully, they dance with elegance and panache, and they have more than enough sexiness and charisma to be proclaimed the "It Girls" for this generation. And what characters they get to play: Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses sharing the same unctuous lawyer (Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere) and the same uncanny instincts for survival and publicity. Coming less than a decade after the O.J. Simpson trial and in the midst of the "Reality TV" craze, this smart, funny, scaldingly cynical film has much of importance to say about the vicious triviality of American celebrity culture. If you can take your eyes off Zellweger and Zeta-Jones--and that is, admittedly, very hard--you will note the abundant excellence of Queen Latifah, as venal jailhouse matron "Mama" Morton, and John C. Reilly--perhaps this generation's finest character actor, and with an unexpectedly lovely singing voice--as Zellweger's sad-sack hubby, Amos. As for Richard Gere, much has been made in the press of his being snubbed by Oscar. No one besides Gere could have made the brazen dishonesty of Billy Flynn so engaging, and he acquits himself well in his song-and-dance numbers. But whereas Gere is very good and memorable, the others--Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly--are mesmerizing and unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GN9I0UYV08LC.html">A3GN9I0UYV08LC</a><br/><p>Winner of Six Academy Award (2002) including Best Picture and Starring Sexy Rene Zellweger (1969-) , Catherine Zeta-Jones (1969- ), Queen Latifah (1970- ) .

This is pretty neat.It just starts with the excellent musical and it goes on with the excellent movie. Need I say more?</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In the movie CHICAGO, there is a scene where Richard Gere's character illustrates to his client how much a court room is like a circus; all you have to do is razzle dazzle them and you'll win your case. That's what CHICAGO has done with many of the critics and the Hollywood establishment; put on a great show to hide a movie that's really only so-so. ...<p>Seeing that this is a musical, the acting is top-notch because it also involves a ton of singing and dancing as well. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting a lot of press, but the real stars of the show are the two major male performers: Richard Gere and John C. Reilly. Gere has a solo tap dance number that is most impressive. Reilly plays the only character who is likeable and normal and his solo song "Cellophane Man" is a performance of classic showmanship.<p>The film's story cuts back and forth from reality to fantasy, making the movie difficult to follow at first. Overall the only parts of the film that I was impressed by were the first ten minutes and the last thirty minutes The hour and twenty minutes in between is rather forgettable. The film has a PG-13 rating, but actually borders on R territory; there are a lot of scenes of violence and almost all the women are so scantily clothed it looks like they are wearing thin strips of toilet paper over their most private areas.<p>I admit that the film had me wanting Roxie Hart to be proven innocent. However, in doing so, I lost respect for the movie. I've routed for the criminal before (e.g. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), but the criminals were always likeable people who made a change of character. In CHICAGO, all of the characters (John C. Reilly's Mr. Hart withstanding) are despicable crooks. They are sleazy liars who wallow in a hedonistic lifestyle at the expense of the joy and peace of others. I left the movie somewhat depressed, feeling I had just witnessed and partaken in a movement of propaganda. I was taken in by the old razzle dazzle. My advice to others, wait until the video and DVD comes out and the buzz has died down;...CHICAGO is only so-so.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>As one who is a big fan of the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s, I appreciate the slam-bang musical that is CHICAGO. Director Rob Marshall has chosen Al Capone's Chicago as the backdrop for a musical based on a series of court trials of otherwise good women who kill their cheating or otherwise abusive spouses. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly, a brash-talking brunette who kills her sister and husband for having an affair and, without missing a beat, goes back to work singing and dancing up a storm.  Watching her perform is Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart, who has just plugged her own lover for lying about a promise to introduce her to a talent agent.  While all this shooting is going on, the details of this dancing duo's past is recounted in the oddest of ways.  Director Marshall slips the viewer in and out of reality by superimposing song and dance routines that highlight the details of their respective cases.  These routines are magnificent and quite carry the viewer along with their sheer kinetic energy. Queen Latifah is the dyke prison guard known as Momma, who has her own show stopping tunes.  Richard Gere is the sleazy lawyer Billy Byrne who not only defends Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, but also brags about his never having lost a case.  By the time the closing credits roll, the viewer learns how he has managed that little trick.  The entire film is an opulent non-stop ensemble of song and dance that masks a core of blatant nihilism.  It is no coincidence that Capone's Chicago is the setting.  Few cities in American history had been as criminally wide open as Chicago.  Capone was but the tip of moral vacuum iceberg through which nearly every character in the movie is more flawed than one cares to see initially.  Zeta-Jones kills two people, and her superimposed song routine brags that they had it coming.  In prison, she establishes that she is at the top of the inmate pecking order with a barrage of insults to the newly arrived Zellweger, who proves, in turn, that she can give as good as she gets by learning the ropes of the court hustle spectacle from her sleazebag lawyer Gere.  In fact, the difference between Zeta-Jones and Zellweger shrinks as the movie progresses, until by the end, except for their divergent hair styles, they are joined at the hip.  Gere warns both that fame in Chicago is the most fleeting of ephemera.  His warnings come so often that they form a subtext that suggests that even in the raucus world of show business, the end justifies the means.  I wonder that after having seen and heard the smashing tunes that form the bulk of CHICAGO, did the viewer ever think of peeking under those tunes to see whether any basic human values got trampled on.  I know that I did, and the cumulative glitz and hoopla that mesmerized me for two hours suddenly seemed crudely tarnished.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Speaking of Rene Zellweger, that just reminded me that I also recently watched this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>Hard to believe, but this hard-edged musical fantasy not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2002, it is also arguably the best piece of filmaking to come out of a Hollywood studio this decade.  Back in the bad old 1970s, when Broadway musical director and sometimes filmaker Bob Fosse first produced the stage version of &quot;Chicago,&quot; stories thiss brutally honest (some would say cynical) dominated the movie industry.  Only because most Hollywood films have become so dumbed down and mediocre in recent years does &quot;Chicago&quot; seem like a bracing breath of fresh air.<p>The movie's highlights includes tremendous performances from ts three stars (who would have thought Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well?).  The songs are memorable, as is the witty between song dialog.  As a bonus, the DVD contains plenty of extras, including a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and interviews with the Director and stars.<p>Overall, a very worthy film presented in a very worthwhile DVD package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>Women behind bars wear kinky outfits and dance with each other.

Thanks 2 big-budget-muliti-length musical overkill 1968-73 with non-singing actors in leading roles  - the musical genre KILLED itself by the mid 70s...<p>This is 2003 and recently we have experienced Evita, Little Voice, Moulin Rouge and NOW - Chicago.<p>The film has borrowed a lot in style from Bob Fosse`s CABARET 1972. There are killer moments such as Cell-Block Tango and Roxy`s Press Conferance. <p>BUT; to put Catherine and Renee in high profiled musical roles has its short comings. Cathy may have played the West End a decade ago, but her high kicks simply isn`t enough. She can be played down by any number of talented musical stars in Europe and the US. Renee? She is NOT a sexpot! Period! She tries valiantly and has her moments; but it really should have been a Marilyn Monroe-type.<p>Critics hail this as the biggest thing! Have they gone mad? Have dare they compare this with the MGM greats 1939-1958, Busby Berkeley, Judy Garland, The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Bob Fosse, Barbra Streisand and the Minnellis? These products, artists and creators are of legendary fame and DESERVEDLY so...<p>Cbicago IS IMPORTANT, and of good work. But a masterpiece? The only reason THE PIANIST(about horrors during World War II) lost at the Academy Awards was the times... The Iraque-"crisis". Naturally a musical was rewarded and not the horrors of a war...This is how it has always been! People don`t want 2 sorrows of war when their in the midst of it. By do u think musicals flourished in the 30s(th Depression), the 40s(The World War 2) and 60s?(Vietnam)????<p>Chicago is a satiricial product and has important statements; but PLEASE let us have REAL musical stars in these films. PLEASE!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>That's NOT Entertainment, folks. The plot's thin even for a movie musical, with murderess Velma going to jail for murdering her lover interspersed with musical numbers meant to show her dream of being a jazz star. It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot. Don't waste your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>CHICAGO won the best picture oscar a couple of years ago, and at the time, I had not seen it, but being a fan of movie musicals over the years, I was happy for its success.  Also, one can't fault a movie with a cast like this one.  However, after finally seeing it, I am disappointed.  Several reasons:  the show has no real showstopping, hummable songs---even ALL THAT JAZZ doesn't carry the movie like DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, OH WHAT  BEAUTIFUL MORNING and HELLO DOLLY.  The deleted "Class" is an awful, foul-mouthed attempt at humor, but it certainly showcased the vocal abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah.  Also, the leading ladies were murderesses:  how could one want either of them to be successful?  Latifah, though Oscar nominated, is playing the same shtick she does in any of her movies, and in my opinion, didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.  The revelations, of course, were Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly's vocal deliveries.  Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.  Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number; he has a richly nuanced voice and it's one of the best numbers in the film.  Zeta-Jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.  I've read where the transfer to film brought Roxie's character to the front, and minimized Velma's.  Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta-Jones had more screen time.  I do think Catherine deserved her Oscar, though.  This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.  Zellwegger always seems to be playing the same Nurse Betty and Cold Mountain characters in all of her films.<br /><br />CHICAGO is big, blustery and well conceived, but it's just not fun nor moving, and if a movie musical is neither of those, then why add music at all?</p></br></body></html>

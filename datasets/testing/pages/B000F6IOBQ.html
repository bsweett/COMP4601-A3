Plus there always seems to be the need for lengthy exposition and explanation. Actually there shouldn't be, but this is a sequel and there may be those who didn't see the original. I don't know how that's possible, but what the heck! The convoluted expositional material, though some attempt was made to wave it into the action, and the way in which the background really, really could have been less twisted and long-winded, is the reason why I didn't this any more points--despite Kate Beckinsale in latex (and out of it: very daring!), just about the best vampire killer since Jessica Biehl in Blade 3.<br /><br />So what, it's all about violence and sex? You bet. That's the essence of the genre and its antecedents.<br /><br />U:E delivers all of that. It wasn't 'tense' as such, because you saw the action a mile coming, but I, for one, didn't mind. I enjoyed it more than the Blade movies, possibly because of Kate Latex, but I'd like to claim it was because of the helicopter in it. And nobody would believe me. Tut, tut.<br /><br />Just sit back an enjoy it. It all ends of a positive note, though I'm kind of wondering just exactly WHAT these people eat and how much. They're not vegetarians, and hearty Russian peasant-food doesn't seem to cut it either. I wonder if the writer had a bad experience in Russia--with food that is. I got the impression there was an in-joke somewhere.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and Kate rocks and kicks serious b. To think that she played Hero and Emma in some distant past... Oh, well, this is probably better for her anyway. Exercise is good for you. Never mind 'character' roles, which are over-rated anyway.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>"Underworld: evolution" is the sequel to "Underworld", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of "Underworld: evolution", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, "Underworld: evolution" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I found this sequel a little more satisfying than the original movie, although it's hard to keep up with all the plot mechanisms.  Suffice to say, the movie is nonstop action, violence, CGI monsters and lots of fight scenes.  Kate Beckinsale brings an earthy feminism to her role as Selene, while Scott Speedman underplays his role as the hybrid lycan/vampire.  Tony Curran is a despicable villain and Sir Derek Jacobi brings an Ian McKellenish finesse to his role as the perpetrator of the lycan/vampire bloodline.  The effects are quite good and although the hyperkinetic cinematography and the frequent blue tint can be distracting, the movie is well done.  A third film is probably inevitable but if it's as good as this one, well done!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>This was a great horror flick. The action was good, Kate<br />Beckinsale was absolutely sizzling on screen, the story<br />is essentially the same and the special effects are great.<br /><br />With movies like "Underworld 2" you don't disect the<br />details about the splot you just watch the action, and blood<br />and enjoy it. Speedman still comes out as stiff but Kate<br />luckily is the main reason the film was made and most<br />fans will not be disappointed. The movie definitely has<br />more gore than the first film put together.<br /><br />It never gets too boring and the action does payoff at<br />the end. I would agree with the others and say to ignore<br />the critics who bashed the movie because quite<br />frankly what were they expecting? Munich? I never<br />understand those movies fans who fork over a money<br />for a movie that they clearly where it's aimed<br />at and still complain later that are dissatisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Oops hubby and I went from the first Underworld to the third Underworld. And this whole time I thought we had the first two movies. Well I think Underworld: Evolution is an awesome movie. Just like the first Underworld. I really enjoy this movie. I hope to order the second and fourth Underworld soon from Amazon so hubby and I can enjoy it just as much as we enjoy the first and third movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>Underworld Evolution was a good horror movie but... I agree with some of the reviewers the story line was strange to say the least.  I enjoy the beginning of the movie, then slow up in middle, but I actually enjoy the ending personally.  So for this movie I have to say if your just looking for some mindless entertainment to have during a free evening then pick this movie up and enjoy some good amount of blood and gore, decent story line that sets up the 4th movie in the set Awakening.  But to me this is still a good movie worth 4 stars but falls into what I call love it or hate movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is an awesome movie. underworld evolution is the sequel to the smash hit underworld. this movie leaves right of the first film which i think is great. you get to see how it all began in this awesome sequel. this is a great film and kate beckinsale is more beautiful than ever. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>"Underworld: Evolution" is a very apt name for the second installment of "Underworld." Gone are many of the characters of the last film, or their dispatched very quickly in the beginning 15 minutes, with bloody relish by Marcus, who has awakened from blood pouring out of the Lycan scientist's head from the first movie.<br /><br />This is a immediate continuation of the first, & it has claws & fangs to spare! As Kraven & entourage are still trying to take over the Vampire coven, by dispatching Marcus, the last head Vampire, & the first true Vampire. Little do they know what grisly fate awaits them!<br /><br />Tony Curran as "Marcus," plays his role with demonic glee as he slashes, bites, stabs, his way through this film in search for the key & hiding place of his Werewolf twin brother William, who has been imprisoned forever is a standing metal coffin like prison. Marcus, deceived by Viktor in a very well done prologue to the movie's beginning, where Viktor is hunting down William, promising not to hurt him, captures William in a brutal all out attack. Marcus protests Viktor treatment of his brother, "you're killing him! William!" Viktor replies, "say his name one more time & you've chosen his fate." Marcus then succumbs to Viktor, & says, "What is thy wish, my Lord." The story has begun!<br /><br />Selene (Kate Bekinsale) & Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run from the Vampires for killing Viktor in the first film, & a very persistent Marcus that wants information Selene has of his brothers whereabouts. In just a awe striking scene, Marcus in the form of full fledge flying Demon like Vampire, chases a truck driven by Selene, & fight ensues with Michael in the back of the truck. Nary do fighting/chase scenes in horror movies get better. Marcus's make up & CGI are just done to perfection, like a flying nightmare. Not since "Bram Stokers Dracula," have I seen such a convincing non-human form Vampire. I do have to say though, that Marcus's true Vampire self reminds me of "the Creeper," from "Jeepers Creepers," but just like "the Creeper," he is unstoppable!<br /><br />Also showing up in this story filled with many plot twist & turns is the first immortal himself, Alexander Corvinus, father of Marcus & William in a role you would not expect, but this is a film of unexpected turns, one as god as the last!<br /><br />"Underworld: Evolution" is superior to it predecessor in just about everyway! Fast moving, plot twisting, effects laden spectacular with fine uniform acting. If you love the Vampire & Werewolf sub-genres at all, you won't want to miss this film!<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Having only just seen the original film I was keen to see this sequel, as based on the cast, and the little trailer I saw it stood a good chance of matching or bettering the earlier film which I rated at 3.5 stars. This gets the same score from me.<br /><br />The good:<br />As I say its a good cast - the addition of Derek Jacobi adds some depth to the movie. The special effects are very well done, with Marcus being a marvellous winged creation whose endearing habit of spearing people remains a highlight. The opening prequel sequence set hundreds of years before is well done and sets up the story well.<br /><br />The bad:<br />As with the first film this is a little lacking in sympathetic characters. Now fair enough they are all vampires or werewolfs but even so I think the makers could have made a bit more effort. Rather inconsistenly throughout the film Selene (Kate Beckinsale) remains the beautiful bewitching vampire. Even when provoked she never turns into a winged beast like the men do. Perhaps female vampires are different? Towards the end I began to get a little tired of Selene picking up yet another gun or machine gun and pointlessly shooting it into her opponents with little effect. At best its a distraction, so why continue to show it throughout the film....<br /><br />Having said all that, it is a rollercoaster ride, and if you like the subject matter (which I do) there is no doubt you will enjoy this a lot.<br />Its worth seeing the first movie first as this does continue directly on from that film.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The action is quick, and vicious. It's more like an action than a horror film. And it's a good action movie. There's not much suspense and no scary moment as in Blade II. Kate Beckinsale looks sexy in her black leather suite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>First, let me say that I, unlike pretty much all the previous reviewers, have not watch the first film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80I">Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>]. Although I like these types of films I was unimpressed with the trailers for it when it first was released back in 2003 so just never got around to viewing the movie. After watching this sequel you can bet I will watch it the first chance I get. This is an outstanding film that brings not only non-stop action but provides a strong story coupled with great acting.<br /><br />The Amazon review states that the script is "...more confusing than it needs to be, with too many characters and not enough storytelling detail to flesh them all out." Not true. From both the prologue and the narration of the main character Selene I got up to speed quickly and was able to understand what led to the feud between Vampires & Lycans (Werewolves). The main characters were wonderfully developed, making it easy to understand the motivation of each. And the story was very linear, taking us from past to present to future. This sequel actually is unique in that it could stand alone, you really don't need to watch the first film to enjoy this one. Not many sequels can say that.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. As I mentioned earlier, the charater development is great. The acting of all is wonderful, with possibly Kate Beckinsale over acting just a bit at the beginning. But as the film hits it's stride so does her performance. The special effects are above average. And the music score hits the nail right on the head as each piece matches the mood or action of the scene perfectly. It's really nice to view a film where the soundtrack blends with the movie, not overpowers it.<br /><br />While there are many scenes that one could point at that shows the quality of the film, to me one stand above all others. The "love scene" between the Selene & Michael characters easily could have been exploitive and gratuitous but instead we are treated to a very sensual, slow-paced scene without ANY full-frontal nudity. It was a great scene that contrasted well with the fast-pace action of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone into action and/or horror flicks. High quality, great action, enough gore to satisfy most, and most importantly, a great plot. They also left a small window open for a third film, which I would love to see. Until then, I'll go back and watch the first film and see what I missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I wasn't too bowled over with the original Underworld, which is mainly why I had lowered expectations going in with Underworld: Evolution, and probably why I came out liking it better than it's predecessor, albeit not by much.  The sequel picks up where the first film left off, with death-dealing vamp-babe Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run and out of time, as uber-vamp Marcus (Tony Curran) has risen from his sleep, and seeks revenge against everyone who has wronged him, and seeks to free his imprisoned werewolf brother William (Brian Steele) as well.  While writer Danny McBride and writer/director Len Wiseman attempt to give the Underworld universe a more believable spin this time around, a majority if the film just comes off as lame and predictable.  Where Underworld: Evolution works is in it's dynamic action scenes, in which the blood and gore has been upped considerably compared to the last time around.  The CGI effects are pretty well done as well, particularly the werewolf-transformation effects and frequent dismemberments.  All in all, if you enjoyed the original Underworld, you'll no doubt enjoy Underworld: Evolution, but if you're like me and didn't really dig the first film, Underworld: Evolution won't win you over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the first movie in this series and thought it was very entertaining. This movie is also quite good.<br /><br />The story of Evolutions picks up right where the first film left off. There is great action early on, which eventually slows a bit for the purposes of the laying out of the storyline, but there is very solid action throughout.<br /><br />We get to see Marcus and William awoken from their hybernations. These are the two sons of Alexander Corvinus. Marcus was the first vampire and William was the first Lycan... This gets interesting...<br /><br />The hybrid use of stuntwork and CGI comes together nicely for some bad@ss effects.<br /><br />Good action. Good storyline. Good effects. I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Part 1 never did much for me. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it has Kate Beckinsale in leather. Here she's in leather and I think she gives a better performance. She looks incredibly hot and I like the story more and there's also more action. Her relationship between her Scott Speedman's character develops more as well. I don't know why so many people give this one a low rating and talk about part 1 like it's all that. I had a lot more fun watching this one than I did with the first movie. I like the main villian that has bat wings although it's never really explained how he got like that. We just know that he's a half-breed that's trying to free his very strong werewolf brother from his hidden prison cell.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>The start of the new year is usually pretty slow when it comes to big films. Most of the time its when films not deemed summer blockbuster or holiday season worthy get scheduled for release. Len Wiseman's Underworld: Evolution is a step up from most of the garbage and fillers that end up being shown in January. This sequel to the Kate Beckinsale's 2003 gothic-actioner continues where the first film left off but with the increase in budget and less of an introductory feel to the characters. The film ends up looking quite good with action sequences that tops the first film and actually provides a story that adds to the mythology created in the first one.<br /><br />Right from the beginning with its vampire knights and rabid, peasant werewolves, Underworld: Evolution shows that the film will be more rollercoaster ride than a study in character and themes. This is a good thing and Wiseman doesn't try to deviate from this formula. He knows just exactly what his films trying to do and doesn't try to overanalyze the situations. The production design still has the European look to it from the sets and location (coincidentally set in Eastern Europe) to the costume and prop designs. The film also makes heavy use of blue-filters to give the film that industrial look. Sometimes the sequences even takes on the look of a crisp, black and white film when the action is set at night with minimal light.<br /><br />The story continues the struggle between the vampire clans and the lycan rebels from the first film. This time around Selene and the lycan hybrid, Michael are hunted by both sides as they struggle to search for the answers to their questions about Viktor's (Selene's vampire primogenitor and one of the clan elders) betrayal of her trust and the shared past of both vampire and lycan clans. Wiseman and McBride (the film's co-writer with Wiseman) do a good job in summarizing the basic plot points from the first film through dream-like sequences whenever blood is drank by the last surviving elder (Marcus as played by genre veteran Tony Curran). One doesn't need to see the first film to get the gist of what's going on in this sequel, but it'll still help if one had some knowledge going in. What i found particularly intriguing was the past history of Marcus and how his past tied in with Viktor's, Selene and in the end that of Michael's. An even older character than Marcus makes an appearance that helps tie the two films together.<br /><br />The cast itself did an adequate to admirable job in doing their parts. Thankfully, Wiseman limited Scott Speedman's scene time with dialogue to a minimum. Speedman pretty much spends most of the film in his hybrid form and performing fight scenes. I consider this decision a major plus for the film. Sir Derek Jacobi adds abit of gravitas to the film as an elder, behind-the-scenes manipulator or the two clans. But in the end the film is all about Kate Beckinsale and she's never looked better. She delviers her lines with enough conviction to make them believable, but at the same time shows just how much she's having. It didn't hurt the film that she again gets to parade around in black, tight leather and latex and in one sequence pretty much nothing. She also does a pretty convincing job of being a kick-ass action heroine. I wouldn't mind it if she took on an action-film here and there to supplement her more serious works.<br /><br />The action scenes were better than the first film, but not so over-the-top that they go from cool to cartoonish like most action-film sequels. The effects work was more polished and this could be due to a higher budget and a better FX crew. The shapechanging from human to lycan was done much better and had less of the computer-generated look to them. The climactic showdown in the end with Selene was action-packed and well-done for a film that was pretty much dumped by Sony Pictures in the graveyard of the film season. This climactic showdown had the audience cheering the most and deservingly so.<br /><br />In the end, Underworld: Evolution was a very entertaining sequel that didn't try to go beyond its gothic-action film pedigree. I could see this series continue to become a trilogy if Wiseman and McBride have more stories to tell about the vampire clans, the lycans, and Selene. The two films are similar to Snipes Blade trilogy, but this time sexier and with abit more an engaging story than the Daywalker series. The film wasn't anything to write to the Academy voters but it did its job in entertaining the audience. 7.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>The start of the new year is usually pretty slow when it comes to big films.

And like the first instalment of this series, this movie does not skimp on action or leather clad heroines. Underworld Evolution is as good as it gets. Highly recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>This film unfortunately, was the least liked of the trilogy. Personally I think it's almost as good as the first film. Like the first film, you should watch this and ignore everything to do with Twilight (If anything, that will rot your brain and degrade your intelligence). This is a 'real' vampire film, and not an incompetent and poorly made teen drama with no substance and a pansy emo as the main character.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: We are reintroduced to Selene and Michael (Who is now part Lycan and part vampire), who are now on the run from the remaining vampires including a vampire named Marcus (Who takes over after Viktor's death in the previous film) who is angry and is out to find his Lycan (werewolf) brother and free him. Now Selene and Michael must find Corvinus (The father of both vampires and Lycans) and find a way to end this never-ending conflict between the Lycans and vampires and defeat Marcus and his brother. Like the first film, the story wasn't taken as far as it could have gone.<br />MUSIC: I have never seen a film in which Marco Beltrami's music disappointed me, and this film is no exception. This music always sets the mood and flows quite nicely throughout.<br />ACTION: This film is even bloodier than the first film and there's even more shootout scenes, a treat for any action fan. This film gets the adrenaline pumping and never lets up until the end. Another area that this film succeeds in, while Twilight fails spectacularly in comparison.<br />ACTING: Unfortunately, the acting in this film isn't as good as its predecessor. The main actors are great like Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, but there are points in which the other actors aren't quite as believable or there's some cheesy dialogue. For the most part, the acting is good, but there are some actors who aren't as good as the others. However, even the not-so-great actors look Academy Award-winning in comparison to Twilight's actors.<br />OVERALL: This film serves as an excellent sequel to an already excellent predecessor. There's more action and more blood this time around, and it shouldn't disappoint action fans looking for a good time. Again, ignore Twilight at all costs because it's an insult to all vampire films and will make you dumber. It pales in comparison to this great film.<br />THE GOOD: More bloody action, great music, good actors, and a solid storyline.<br />THE BAD: Storyline didn't go as far as it could have, and there moment of cheesy dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>What can I say? This is pretty much the perfect movie. There are a couple of scenes towards the middle that I found pretty useless (a "nearly nude" sex scene, and then a couple glimpses of a not so discreet one) but these are brief and can be skipped. The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect and the action is downright incredible. I found this movie satisfying and entertaining in every way.<br /><br />(Oh, and kudos to Marco Beltrami on creating a far superior score to Haslinger's original.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Underworld Evolution continues where the last movie ended, with Marcus awakening.  It turns out he wishes to release his brother, William, the first of the lycans.  The movie traces the start of the war between the vampires and werewolves.  But, outside of the wild Williams, we don't have any lycan characters.  Also, the fact that Selene was betrayed by her own kind should not be a shock - we became aware of that in the last film.  And how is killing the immortal bothers part of her revenge?  As you can guess I am somewhat disappointed with the second movie and while I love Kate Beckinsale as an actor and as a vampire, that wasn't enough to save this film.  Lots of star power and a good mixture of special effects but the story was just too badly made to hold up.  In other words, no story, lots of action.  Get the popcorn and turn off the mind.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Take one part Horror movie, one part action movie and mix in just a bit of political intrigue as well as a bit of classical Shakespearian family values (which usually involved stabbing a family member in the back) and you have Underworld: Evolution.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale once again paints on the fighting black leather and assumes the attitude and killer instinct that go with the character of Selene, a Vampire death dealer.  She continues in the movie to search for more answers to questions that were brought about in the first Underworld.  Quite frankly, I thought this was a better movie than the first.  The story was more clear and easier to follow, but surprisingly complex and full of characters who weren't falling into a sterotype.  As Selene and the Werewolf/Vampire Hybrid, Michael (Scott Speedman) rush to make sure that Marcus (one of the oldest and most powerful of warriors, and a hybrid himself) doesn't free his brother William (the first of the Lycans).  If he does, destruction will reign...we can assume.  These two brothers are tough as we find out in the opening and the truck battle scene of the movie.<br /><br />Michael is not to be toyed with.  After Kraven releases him, he searches for the key to unlock his brothers prison.  A lot of things from the first movie start to play a part in this movie as we find out more about Selene's mortal family and the role they play in this.  We find out more about the oldest immortal, William and Marcus' father, who refuses to kill his own sons.  The story becomes more dangerous and more insidious as it moves to the climax.  Blood and gore abound in this movie, giving it the well deserved R rating, but it's actually confined to the fight scenes and does not seem out of place for the type of fighting that's going on.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was better than expected.  It had a brisk pace, a good story and dialogue as well as great action sequences and impressive special affects.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Underworld: evolution" is the sequel to "Underworld", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of "Underworld: evolution", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, "Underworld: evolution" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: To Len Wiseman,please hurry up and make another sequel, I want to know what happens next to Selene and Michael :)<br />PS2: To parents, this movie has quite a lot of violence and a nude scene, so it is not adequate for children.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I'm not in much of a mood for writing a full, good review, so here's a few random bullet points that ought to sum it up.<br /><br />-'Underworld: Evolution' looks cool, but not as cool as the original.  Still pretty damn good, though.  It is very blue and black.<br /><br />-'Underworld' had a stupid plot; 'Underworld: Evolution' has an even stupider plot.  Also, like the original, they make it very tough to know just what the hell is going on in this movie until very late despite the fact that there really isn't all that much to the plot.<br /><br />-The dialogue is either pure cheese or utterly perfunctory, but, you know, who cares.  At one point Selene says, `So the old legends are true...' I dunno about you, but I find that very funny.<br /><br />-This film has more action than the original, but it's a bit more uneven in quality.  The big fight at the beginning in medieval times is pretty damn cool, definitely the best one, but it's somewhat inconsistent after that.  Still, seeing a pack of werewolves fighting a bunch of armored vampires in hand to hand combat is something you don't see too often, and this alone practically makes the film worth a look.<br /><br />-The werewolves look much better this time around.  Course, they looked pretty crappy the first time, but now they look fairly good.<br /><br />-It's got some neat gore.  Not a ton, but it's there, anyway.  I particularly like one part where a werewolf gets his head pretty much ripped in half.  That was cool.<br /><br />-Apparently, if a vampire bites you, it steals your memories.  Huh.<br /><br />-Scott Speedman once again failed to make any sort of impression on me as that vampire/werewolf hybrid guy, despite the fact that he's supposed to be our co-hero.<br /><br />-Kate Beckinsale gets naked, albeit somewhat discretely, but it turns out she looks better in her leather suit.  ( In which, I must admit, she looks pretty damn good.)  As far as her ability as a action hero and protagonist.... ehh, she's serviceable.<br /><br />-The major sex scene in this film is fairly comical, as they so often are.<br /><br />-The vampires in this movie still don't act very, uhh, vampirey very much.  I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, mind you, but if you're gonna have a vampire movie you might as well have them act like `em, rather than just like really tough humans with peculiar fashion sense and funny accents.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I'm done.  This movie is passably entertaining, but not much more than that.  It's also over long despite the fact that it's only like 105 minutes long.  Still, if you liked the first one you'll probably find this to be worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>So, these Lycans and werewolves, and their old dad, are immortal, except they can be killed by blowing them up? Or tearing their heads off? Makes no sense to me. Wouldn't they just regenerate? The first 30 mins of this silly dark and dreary mess are a complete muddle for non-experts. Having not seen any of this series before, I was lost. Not good. If you are making these, anyone should be able to drop in and make sense of it from the start. This needed better editing and/or a better script. But in the makers' zeal to make everything here move incredibly fast, they lost track of storyline. To be fair, the plot and the characters manage to sort of come together after awhile. The color of this is almost all blue and black and white. Very dark. I also don't get why something called UV bullets can slow down these immortals. Aren't they supposedly indestructible? Haven't they been around for centuries? Yet, here they can suddenly be destroyed. HHmmmm.....</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>While not reaching the pinnacle of the first "Underworld", this sequel is a very worthy follow-up that attains its own kind of greatness.  Visually stunning, sexy, action-packed, and imaginative in the looks for its slowly growing line-up of creatures, it's a horror thrill ride that makes it worthwhile to overlook a few missteps.<br /><br />  Beginning about 800 years ago to reveal the full origin of both the vampire and Lycan (werewolf) clans, it then flashes forward to the present day, picking up very shortly after the ending of the first movie.  With the vampire hierachy shaken to its foundations and the clans in disarray, Selene and Michael are on the run from a slew of potential enemies, quickly hopping from safehouse to safehouse.  Marcus, the third of the elder vampires (and apparantly most dangerous, capable of shifting into an awesome monsterous form with massive, taloned wingtips that can impale his adversaries) is awakened and fills the role of main villain in the movie.  He pursues Selene because her position as the 'adopted daughter' of Viktor has, in a fashion that's explained later in the film, some kind of connection to an ancient plot that Marcus has been waiting centuries to put into play.  In the chaos following the first movie's finale, Marcus seizes on the opportunity to finally track down and free the original werewolf from its prison.<br /><br />  One thing wrong is that "Underworld: Evolution" feels too rushed; there's too much packed into its 106-minute running time.  What I really would like to see (and actually wouln't be surpised to see happen close to the release of a third Underworld movie, if one comes out) is a release of an Extended Edition - 25 or 30 minutes longer, ideally - of Underworld Evolution come out.  Close to half an hour is about what I figure it would take to balance the pacing and give it a chance to develop some points that felt shortened.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was originally longer anyway, and got cut down because studios are still shy about releasing very many theatrical movies that go much over two hours.<br /><br />  Another problem - and I hate to admit this one because I really loved "Underworld: Evolution" - is that there are a few parts that just plain don't make sense.  For example, after a major blow-out at a restaurant against Marcus, (where there's even a large police prescence) Selene and Michael flee the scene in a truck and end up taking refuge in an old warehouse that appears to be only a few miles from the site of the altercation.  Now, I realize dawn was breaking and they had to take any refuge available because Selene burns in sunlight.  But once there, they seem completely unconcerned that it might be easy for the police or anyone else to find where they'd holed up (or maybe not so easy, since no one does).  Instead the movie goes forward into more romantic territory very quickly at this point.  Now, that part was welcome, but if the film had been longer, there could have been a more realistic, 'cornered/on-guard' atmosphere where the two are trying to devise a way to get a better distance away in the daylight hours; and then had the exact same romantic scenes from the warehouse take place somewhere else, safer.  There are a couple other instances where things like this just don't seem consistent.<br /><br />  The acting, while good, isn't quite on par with the first one either, although there a number of truly impressive performances, including by Kate Beckinsale as Selene and by Derek Jacobi as a previously unseen Immortal from before the time of the first vampires and Lycans.  It's hard to compare Scott Speedman (Michael)'s performance with his great turn in the first one because he doesn't get as much screen time here; maybe they'll beef up his role in either the third film or an extended version of this one.  The action sequences are superb, and the special effects excellent.<br /><br />  If there is a third movie, I'll repeat what I said when I did a writeup for the first one: we've got new spins on vampires and werewolves here; I really think the filmmakers would do well to consider adding a third breed of monster (goblins, zombies, whatever) and trying to do something really fresh and original with them too.<br /><br />  Overall "Underworld: Evolution" is a great action horror movie, ones that fans of the first one can't afford to miss, even though it requires some suspension of disbelief.  Definately good enough to buy and not just rent.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>What a great sequel to a great original.  Underworld - Evolution picks up, literally, right where Underworld left off.  Wonder what happened to the rest of the Coven?  How about Michael?  Still a little fuzzy on how the whole thing began?  Can't get enough Kate Beckinsale?<br /><br />Well that is all right here my friend.  Every thing you want to know and see.  Beckinsale is wonderful yet again and Scott Speedman continues his strong performance.<br /><br />You definately need both movies as they truly compliment (and feed - no pun intended) off of each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The first Underworld movie was a modest box office hit but enough, apparently, to spawn a sequel that continues the war that rages between vampires and werewolves. Director Len Wiseman pillaged visuals from both The Matrix and The Crow movies in the first one and this time around borrows a bit from The Lord of the Rings films in Evolution's prologue. However, from that point on, he strikes out on his own with decent results as he manages to improve on the characters and story he created in the first film.<br /><br />You have to give Wiseman credit - stylistically Evolution is consistent with its predecessor. It helps that he had a hand in crafting the story (and the film's mythos) and directed both movies while also advancing the mythology that grounds everything. He also changes settings, taking us away from the gothic European cities and into the countryside with ancient castles.<br /><br />As with the first film, Wiseman doesn't skimp on the R rated violence and gore, refusing to pander to the more lucrative PG-13 crowd (who would've just rented/bought the R version on DVD). He has improved upon his first film with Evolution which has a slightly more urgent tone because more is at stake. His direction is more confident and he wisely doesn't try to drag things out, keeping the running time well under two hours. Wiseman also manages to top most of the action set pieces in the first Underworld film without overreaching himself, including a climatic fight scene that is truly satisfying. Although, I have no idea how he'll top this one if the powers that be ask him to make it a trilogy... perhaps a prequel?<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, production designer Patrick Tatopoulos, second unit director Brad Martin and editor Nicolas De Toth. This track is production anecdote-heavy as they talk about what it was like working on a given day and the challenges of shooting on a limited budget. This is actually quite an informative track with nary a lull anywhere.<br /><br />"Bloodlines: From Script to Screen" examines the origins of this movie. Wiseman had a lot of story content left over from the first film and its success allowed a sequel to further the mythos as he had envisioned it.<br /><br />"The Hybrid Theory" examines the film's visual effects which are 3-4 times more than the first film. The result is a seamless blend of CG and practical effects.<br /><br />"Making Monsters Roar" takes a look at the creature effects. The filmmakers consciously wanted to improve on the creature suits and make them more flexible so that they move more realistically and fluidly.<br /><br />"The War Rages On" examines the stunts performed on the movie. Much more ambitious ones were planned that were faster and more aggressive than what we saw in the first Underworld movie.<br /><br />"Building a Saga" takes a look at the production design. The scale of this film was much bigger with old castles that involved a lot of building of interior sets. Wiseman consciously wanted to move away from an urban setting to more of a period piece vibe.<br /><br />"Music and Mayhem" examines the sound design, the film's score and how it enhanced the drama of the movie, manipulating how the audience felt about a given scene.<br /><br />Finally, there is a music video for "Her Portrait in Black" by metal band Atreyu done in the style of the film with lots of clips from it. Basically, the lead singer comes from what has been called the Cookie Monster school of vocals.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I have seen worst sequels and i think this was a good one, the action was not lacking i must say and i thought thats part of what makes it a good sequel..If anyone thought it boring they must not understand the story line or didn't get it or maybe need to see it a second time to get it...<br /><br />I thought it was good bringing back both original actors to me thats a bonus in making a sequel..as i said before good action pack through out the movie, up tempo and its not B.O.R.I.N.G...</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I haven't seen a sequel this good since Terminator 2!

I was so intrigued by this movie I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first 20 minutes. The director did a great job of bringing you into his underworld. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part ot this story anymore.

The special effects and acting have much improved (Kraven is given no dialogue!), but the story is a little hard to follow at times. I need to catch this one again just to get everything straight. If you liked the first film, I almost guarantee you will enjoy this one as well. Even if you don't enjoy anything about the movie, you can gawk at Kate Beckinsale for two hours. Yummy!</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Underworld was received with blistering critical backlash.  If you were to look at a reviewing site, such as Rottentomatoes.com, you would find that approximately 30% of the critics liked it while 70% hated it.  Yet it was a hit in the theatres, and grew a fan base.  For every fan, there seems to be someone who hated it.  I really enjoyed it.  For us fans, there comes Underworld: Evolution.<br /><br />Evolution does everything a good sequel should.  It makes the action better, it continues the story, but most importantly it changes the way we see things.  A good sequel will twist what we know of the original, will introduce new things and will make us revaluate alliances etc.  And Underworld does just that.  It adds to the story and twists some things so that it becomes a different story than the previous one.<br /><br />One of the problems I had with the first was its ending.  I really enjoyed it, and the way it left room for a sequel; but it was also a bit anti-climatic.  Evolution makes up for it by creating an ending that raises the stakes and creates enough tension so that, even if you know how one of the baddies will be killed, its exciting.<br /><br />One of my complaints is the pacing in the middle.  There are times that the pacing wasn't as "moving" as in the first film.  While never boring, there were moments that were slow.<br /><br />People who hated the first film will probably not be steered to the fan side.  But, people who hated the first film shouldn't be seeing this film anyway.  And so I'm glad that Lens Wiseman didn't sell out.  He didn't make a PG-13 sequel that was luke warm in reception.  It ended up being a great sequel made by a fan for the fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be highly entertaining as well as interesting. Following up the original movie, this sequel fitted perfectly and followed the original movie very well. I found Kate Beckinsale both believable and quite alluring in her role. While she doesn't fit the "action female" persona, Beckinsale does a creditable job. This movie goes into the history of the struggles between the vampires and the werewolves. Its tell a good story and within the frame of the this tale, the movie work pretty well.<br /><br />The movie got slammed dunk by many critics who may take themselves too seriously. Many movies of this genre suffered from professional critics who often write like snobs instead of looking into the such movie and taking it for what it is. Of course, it probably don't help that many critics really don't like this genre despite of their public statements.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed the original movie, you will definitely enjoy Evolution. Its well acted, well supported and script reads very well to support the frame work of the story. Like many other reviewers, I would say forgo the critics on this one and listen to those who enjoyed this sort of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>While I really enjoyed the first film, the second was just good for me.  Lots of action and blood, and certainly more skin, this is a decent action picture with horror elements.  The story takes place within moments of the first film's finish.  If you forgot the first film, this one fills in you with flashbacks that give you enough to remember.  The story itself was just okay for me.  It didn't carry as big as it should have.  I kept thinking of Blade Trinity which had the original Dracula, so it should have been a huge story and it just fell flat.  This movie doesn't fall flat, it just never really takes off completely.  If you enjoyed the first film, you will surely enjoy the second.  I just don't think this will blow away any non-fan and convert them to the Underworld movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>It just keeps getting better. Any fan of "Underworld" should be very happy with this sequel. Those that missed the first one can watch this as a standalone but it will make more since if you go back and see Underworld first. I know I went back and re-watched Underworld before seeing Evolution. If you have never seen Underworld, but you are a fan of any vampire or werewolf movies you will probably enjoy these. Imagine a world where there are three races. Humans, Vampires, and Werewolves. Now imagine The Vampires and Werewolves are at war over an ancient dispute. The first Underworld clarifies why. The second Underworld is the evolution of lycans and vampires, reflection on past events, the the continuation of the relationship between a human that became part werewolf and part vampire and a vampiress, and a big Lycan vs Vampire showdown. Fans of the "Blade" trilogy should definitely not be disappointed. I recommend it for at least a rental to anyone that hasn't seen the first one and a go ahead and buy for those that enjoyed Underworld.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>I take it upon myself to ignore the critics when it comes to Horror/Fantasy films with vampires and werewolves, for they seem simply unable to enjoy these types of films as anything more than just entertainment.  This second film is more of a continuation from the first, and not so much a sequel, much like "Kill Bill 2" picked up where the first film left off.  The difference here is that the filmmakers now have more money to throw around (thanks to the first film being a success), and it can be seen in the sleeker visual effects and huge sets.  But all that would be boring without interesting characters to watch, most notably Kate Beckinsale who is stunning to look at even when she isn't kicking bad guys in the teeth with her platform boots and wearing that now signature wet-leather cat suit shining in the glare of a full moon.  All in all, this is an action-packed Horror/Fantasy film which by the time the credits were rolling had me second guessing every film critic on the planet with a negative opinion.  If you liked "Underworld" I guarantee you will like "Underworld: Evolution."  This is, in essence, the second chapter to the story.  Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>The war between the vampire covens and their former servants the Lycans (werewolves) continues! Underworld: Evolution immediately follows the events of the first film. After dicing head bloodsucker Viktor's head in uneven halves, the sexy and undead Death Dealer Selene is on the run from her fellow vampires, her only ally the werewolf-vampire hybrid Michael Corvin. With the most sadistic vampire of all, Marcus Corvinus, having just awakened from his long dormant state, the hunt for the two fugitives figures to be all the more savage and unyielding. Marcus also has the added agenda of desiring to liberate his centuries-long captive twin brother, William, who is revealed to be the first ever werewolf and the most depraved. Selene and Michael settle even more firmly in between Marcus's crosshairs when they attempt to prevent William's release. But, with the help of the oldest immortal alive, the beautiful ex-Death Dealer and the human-turned-beastie just might have the slimmest of chances to succeed.<br /><br />Selene's persona this time isn't as mechanical, giving Kate Beckinsale more opportunities to emote. Fueled perhaps by her kind's betrayal and a bit by her blossoming relationship with Michael, Selene seems more invested emotionally with the goings-on around her. Kate has never looked better or deadlier in her black leathers, thanks in large part to director Len Wiseman, who also doubles as her husband. And yes, for all the red-blooded guys and multitudes of perverts out there, Kate is shown in one tasteful love scene about 37 minutes into the movie. But it's one of those scenes where you think you see more of Kate's tangibles than was really shown. I still don't think much of Speedman's earnest acting style, considering it merely substantial fluff. I gotta admit, though, that his werewolf guise can kick beaucoup butt. Meanwhile, British supporting actors Bill Nighy, Tony Curran and Steven Mackintosh lend substance to the proceedings. Call me shallow but an English accent always seems to give instant verisimilitude to a cinematic effort. The signing of upper echelon British thespian Derek Jacobi is a coup of sorts for the horror genre. As the father of Marcus and William, his character, Alexander Corvinus, is suitably grave, commanding and manipulating. Is it a coincidence that, with the influx of British actors, the plotline suddenly takes a decidedly Shakespearean turn?<br /><br />Where the first Underworld had dead spots and stale action sequences, Underworld: Evolution is as gothically gorgeous to look at, but is leaner, more absorbing and just plain better. The sequel delves more deeply into the Underworld history and mythology and defines Selene's place in it. For action and f/x fans, the truck chase scene is a must-see, as are most of the battle sequences, to be honest. A familiarity with the first movie is recommended as the dense backstory and the several flashbacks to the original film might bewilder those fresh to the franchise. One thing that bugs me about the film, though, is where are all the other vampires that are supposedly after Selene? Marcus seems to be the only one chasing her.<br /><br />Special features include: a filmmakers' commentary, "The Hybrid Theory" (visual effects featurette), "The War Rages On" (stunts featurette), "Bloodlines: From Script to Screen" (a decent making-of featurette), "Making Monsters Roar" (creature featurette), "Building a Saga" (production design featurette), "Music & Mayhem" (music and sound design featurette), "Her Portrait In Black" (a headbangin' music video by Atreyu).<br /><br />This is a really gory, vastly entertaining action-horror flick. The "Evolution" in the title, by the way, refers more to Selene than to Michael. You'll see.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>This was a great movie.

The movie fills in part of the story so those unfamiliar with the first film won't be left behind.  As much as UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a sequel, it's also a story of origins.  In this movie, the audience is told where the first vampires and lycans came from. Apparently, there was one immortal who had two sons.  One son became the father of the vampires (Markus) and the other the father of the lycans.  However, the lycan (William) was unstable and his father and brother were forced to hunt the creature down, capture it, and kill those who had turned. Thus the long war between the vampires and the lycans began almost from the beginning.<br /><br />With this lesson of origins told, the movie races back to the present day where we find Michael and Selene on the run.  Markus is awakened from his sleep and doesn't like what Selene has done. He's been planning all along that once he was awaken that he would find his brother and forge a new vampire/lycan alliance.<br /><br />UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a decent sequel. There is an unnecessary sex scene and most of the fighting is on a one-on-one basis instead of army versus army. Nevertheless, the film is pretty much action packed from the beginning and except for the moments to fill in some "history" the movie doesn't slow down. I'm not sure if the studio is planning on making UNDERWORLD into a trilogy. If so, since the 2nd part of a trilogy usually deals with origins, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a worthy sophomoric episode.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>If you like vampire and/or werewolf films, and aren't concerned about them making sense, you'll love this one. I say that because this, like its predecessor, took a cool concept and instead of fully exploring it made a Monster Movie meets The Wild West.<br /><br />My main complaint (I have many more) is that there are two races, two races that are as interwoven into Western mythical culture as any - vampires and werewolves - and these two races evoke enormous emotion in any who follow them, fan and critic alike. They have boundless strengths and powers. They're even *mated* in this film, a sum that is greater than its parts (granted they're not very well defined). Am I to understand that the very best these guys could do in a Vampire vs. Werewolf film where they've *mated* is to include extremely (over)long shots of action that are staccatoed by automatic handguns and rifles? That when advanced weaponry is introduced (UV bullets, and bullets that contain silver oxide?!), that the best we get are regular bullets? If I'm Selene (Beckinsale), I'm loading up on BOTH of these bullets, not just the useless lead ones.<br /><br />We're introduced to a much deeper mythology than we were introduced to in the first film. That's a wonderful thing - except they don't go anywhere with it other than to its inevitable conclusion. And in the end, it fails. After a very long battle between the good guys and the bad guys, with more bullets than magic or fists and claws and fangs, there is a resolution. It's a resolution that, when you examine the sum of its parts, doesn't add up. The mythology that I referred to earlier doesn't add up, or hold up, either.<br /><br />I can say this: everything that went into making the film LOOK good paid off. It was gorgeous. Unfortunately, this was only skin deep - and when the sun rose at the end of the film, one had to wonder how deeply it would itch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film picks up from where the original left off and continues to shed light on the story of the centuries old blood feud between vampires and werewolves (Lycans).  Things get a bit more complicated when an old "new" hybrid threatens to tip the balance between the combatants.<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Scott Speedman, Tony Curran, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are OUTSTANDING to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />It's got EVERYTHING one looks for in a movie: action, sex, and a great story!  The plot, the setting, the special effects, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld: Evolution is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a third movie, which I would definitely line up to watch!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>The movies is well written, well produced and well acted...<br />it is just black and a very lot of blood ( eaten and spilled)<br />and filmed darkly.<br />We have a clan of vampires and a clan of werewolves at war, with a<br />dark satanic vampire lord trying to free his werewolf brother.<br />The heroes are out to slay him and his brother<br />and save the world from inhuman immortal monster rule.<br />Since it takes place mostly in Eastern Europe,<br />it has a sort of Russian brooding darkness as well.<br />I really just don't like vampire pictures!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Picking up where "Underworld" left off, Selena (Beckinsale) and Michael (Speedman) are on the run.  They have just killed Viktor (Nighy), and now Marcus (Curran) is after them.  He is even older than Viktor, and a twin brother who is the original werewolf.  And, while all this is going on, someone else (Jacobi) is plotting something mysterious.<br /><br />Fans of the original will not be disappointed with the sequel.  In addition to the continuing story, some backstory is also given, setting up the action that takes place in the present.  Beckinsale and Speedman seem comfortable returning to their roles, and the new cast members do good jobs as well.  The special effects are on par with the original, and the action is intense.  Fans of the first definately want to check this out, and newcomers will find this movie accessable as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This was a great sequal to the 2003 underworld.  I like how this movie managed to slide in and fill some gaps in the history of the werewolve/vampire saga, the Corvinus family legend is explained, and the father of this all is revealed. I enjoyed the camera work/computer generations melded together into some good fighting seqences.  This movie seemed to drag on and was slower to develop than the other one.  And the Sex scene was just forced in, not really nessessary.  Otherwise, check this movie out.  A must have if you liked the first one.  I just hope they don't release this as a Extended unrated version like they did with the first one...they wait about a year then boom, suprise, here it is. Hollywood did the same thing with Sin City...money hungry as they are.  anyway, check this movie out.  I honestly hope their is no sequel, the storyline may get to thin and wreck what these first two movies have for reputation.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I haven't seen the first Underworld but I thought the storyline was easy to adapt to especially when you go to watch this film with an Underworld enthusiast. My major concern was the lack of a concrete storyline, haphazard direction, predictability and lack of surprise the film offers. Relax, I'm not the first person who ever watched a film without watching the prequel. I don't know if I should complain on the acting front cause it was decent. I quite liked the villain's character but there was not much this film offered with a thin plot.<br /><br />I'll name two better films, Poseidon and King Arthur<br /><br />Underworld : Evolution was definitely better than Van Helsing though.<br /><br />Almost nothing about this film is extraordinary or remotely unique</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>High Action, Interesting plot, a few questions.  Yes, Yes, for the men out there, Kate Beckinsale looks great in her skin tight, black outfit.  The hybrid Michael learns to be a better fighter and we even get to see some flesh on flesh action.  My first question was of Michael's comment of Marcus being a hybrid as well.  Did I miss something?  I thought that he was the original vampire.  What is he a hybrid of?  Second question--why now?  Why was Marcus so determined to go after his brother now?  If I remember from the last movie, the elders take turns sleeping.  Given how long William has been in captivity--surely Marcus was in charge when Victor was sleeping--why didn't he try to free his brother then?<br /><br />And what was their father?  He's not a vampire nor a werewolf, but he lives all this time.  Am I to believe that he was the first Highlander or something?  I understand from the first movie that he was the first to survive the plague back in the day but it didn't explain why the man was still alive.  Plus, (just to nick pick) what are the chances of twin boys strolling around and one gets bitten by a bat and the other getting bitten by a werewolf?<br /><br />Again, this was a great Saturday flick.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I know many people really enjoyed the film. Critics say the film's story is badly written, but I tried not to listen. No, while watching `Underworld Evolution,' I was just thinking about who is good and who is bad, which is the best way for me to enjoy the action sequences. But sorry, I couldn't finally bring myself to love this one.<br /><br />I don't summarize the film. Other reviewers have done it better. I only say you must see the original `Underworld' before watching this sequel. In the chapter below I repeat what I have seen in the first 20 minutes only, and you know what I mean.<br /><br />As `Underworld Evolution' opens, you must read a sketchy prologue that tells us about the history of Lycans and Vampires. Then in its opening flashback sequences, the film goes back to the year 1202, when the troops led by Viktor are hunting William, a twin brother of Marcus. And then, finally, we are to meet Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run from the Vampire clan, somewhere in the Eastern Europe though the film does not explain how and why they managed to travel there.<br /><br />All these things happen in the earlier chapters, which is too much for me to understand. Some footage from the first film tries to explain the background of the new story, but it doesn't work. I have seen the first `Underworld' when it was released, and remember the key elements of the film, but even so the additional information only helped confuse me. Director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride seem to stick to the principle -- the more, the better. My idea is, `Why not make it simple?'<br /><br />I admit that actions are better than the first ones. They are packed with gore and violence, and Len Wiseman clearly wants them that way. I do not disagree with his decision, and I find the fight sequences are largely enjoyable. However, the cheesy sex scenes are another thing. They are rather pointless and emotionless, cheapening the entire film. The special effects also need improvement, and Michael's transformation into werewolf is far from seamless.<br /><br />When all is said and done, `Underworld Evolution' is a reasonable sequel, better than the first one. It also knows its target audiences, and provides what they want (it fared better than the original on the US box-office chart). But I still don't know why the story should be so convoluted.<br /><br />By the way, it is Lily Mo Sheen (Kate Beckinsale's daughter) who plays the young Selene. Why not use her more, and forget about Derek Jabobi's character?</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I generally like this type of horror story and I very much enjoyed the first one. So I was very disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />The story I thought was fairly weak, the acting, I thought was quite poor. Kate Beckinsale does not do nearly as good a job as she did in the previous one.<br /><br />The special effects are okay. Nothing really brilliant.<br /><br />If I had not liked the first one so much, I probably would not have bothered to see the end of this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Underworld: Evolution" is great!

Or right.<br /><br />Or out of control---I mean, really, who's to judge, when you're a bloodthirsty immortal critter, way long in the tooth, with big old fleshy batwings who's been consigned to the vamp-version of Solitaire for 600 years or so?<br /><br />Whatever. At the very least, "Underworld 2" manages to answer the question: "where does a Thousand-pound p*ssed-off Werewolf sit?"<br /><br />Answer: any-damned-where he wants.<br /><br />I was a big fan of the first installment, which was all somber-gothic moonscapes and undead power politics and some gory bloodshed and high style and---umm, did I mention Kate Beckinsdale in a leather catsuit yet? No?<br /><br />Anyhoo, I wish I could say nicer things about director Len Wiseman's latest paean to things that flap, howl, and bump in the night, but what it boils down to is really three things:<br /><br />1)Len Wiseman doesn't really *like* vampires. Or werewolves (cough, cough, *Lycans*). Or more to the point, monsters.Why? Because he really takes great pains---in the last flick, and finally, totally, in this one---to burn both classic monsters out of the running.<br /><br />Forever: hence "Evolution". In other words, he wants to make his movie monsters normal, full-blooded, all-American, apple-pie eating, suburb-living, SUV-driving ordinary gals and dolls.<br /><br />So: death-dealer Selene gets a little hybrid-juice in her veins, hangs around in broad daylight, and gets some missionary position good love from hybrid hubby Michael Corvin (the horrible, godawful, still annoying-as-ever Scott Speedman), maybe buying a ranch-home in Colorado and having a couple kids and a family dog.<br /><br />Sure. If you want to see daylight and get a tan, sweetheart, try a tanning bed.<br /><br />2) Nobody seems to be having any damned fun in the world of "Underworld: Underworlder"---and that's really a shame. What's the point of living forever if you're not going to loosen up and enjoy yourself? All we have is War, War, War.<br /><br />Look: if I'm a vampire, I'm not gonna hunker down in some stinky, squalid, dim-lit bunker arsenal, fidgeting and twitching about getting it on with the hairy gang down the block. And---anyone?---why are we all hanging around freezing our undead butts off in the Czech Republic, anyway?<br /><br />Nobody seems to be having any fun in "Underworld": certainly not vampires Selene or her black-eyed buddy Corvin, nor poor vamp pater-familias Alex(Derek Jacobi, who prisses around in what looks like the castoff duds from "Shakespeare in Love" before dying like an ineffective, whimpering little b*tch), and certainly not uber-vamp-flappy-thingy Marcus (Tony Curran).<br /><br />Indeed, the only guy living it up with chicks and booze and rock n' roll is Andreas Tanis, and he's a hated exile living in prison, who is quickly and nastily put down like a sick dog. I rest my case.<br /><br />3) Look, if you're a batwinged-flappy thing (Marcus) or his 10-foot-high lupine brother ummm, William, don't flap or stalk out in front of a high-velocity machine-gun and just hover/stand there. Not a good career move. Very damaging to the pelt.<br /><br />Now, don't misunderstand me: Underworld: Deader" isn't without some hair of the dog that bit me---the opening carnage in a snowbound medieval village between a troop of vampires and their hairy buddies is gorgeous, slickly shot, and caked with blood and gore.<br /><br />And the backstory---a ravenous, blood-hungry werewolf entombed in a fortress-prison designed for him---is delicious. And the trappings here are ultra-glossy and very slick, whether it's some long-deserted oubliette or high-tech battle gear.<br /><br />And hell, at some point---and I confess, I was pretty liquored up by the end of "Underworld: Catsuit", so this might not actually have happened---someone brought a helicopter to the gunfight. Seriously. Oh, and a decent amount of the red sauce is spilled.<br /><br />But in the end, Wiseman has traded the politics of betrayal that infused the first flick with a little dignity for the wham-bam action wild rumpus of a chase flick: monster breaks out of prison, monster chases heroes, heroes chase monster, big-a**ed battle, close credits.<br /><br />And frankly, it's just not all that interesting to watch. With that in mind: does anyone think the DVD cover art makes it look like Selene is holding twin scalpels? And does anyone think that might have made for a better movie?<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>Okay, I'm not an Underworld expert.  But this movie, which I expected to be a dumb but fun actioner with very welcome vampire and werewolf action, is worse than dumb-it's boring.  There's nothing wrong with dumb action-comic book movies, but to make it so yawn-inducing...<br /><br />Do they make stuff like this on auto-pilot?  It takes genuine skill and talent to take all of these amazing effects-'lycans' running around ripping people apart, getting their heads ripped off, vampire guys flying around with spiky wings, crazy eye effects, shooting, more shooting, explosions, random creatures being torn apart, etc, etc-and make a totally boring mess of a film.<br /><br />This reminded of The Matrix Reloaded-take a decent movie with some semblance of originality, overproduce the sequel, ensure it gets bogged down in some humorless mumbo-jumbo, make every shot look the same, make everything look like MTV School, have ridiculous violence you can't even see because there are 100 cuts per minute, and voila--instant crap.<br /><br />No wonder America is getting dumber.  Apparently, we are unable to watch films that aren't cut like music videos or commercials, now basically the same thing.  The trailer outdoes the movie here by a wide margin.  You can't even see what's happening in half the battle scenes, with the abundance of blue lighting, long, wet hair flinging around, slow-mo sweat and blood, and cuts, cuts, cuts.  To say nothing of the story.<br /><br />In this one, apparently some lycans, or vampire-lycans, or hybrids, are running around, something or other, I forget.  It's more trouble than it's worth to discern the plot, except to note that Derek Jacobi, a respectable actor, appears in this, presumably because his grandkids need college tuition or his portfolio requires diversification.  Kate Beckinsale isn't asked to do much acting except wear that awesome black leather outfit, fire two guns at once, and resemble Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil, or Keira Knightley in Domino, or any other leather-clad female with great eyes and better guns, including the preview for another crap movie I saw that prefaced this thing.<br /><br />I want to note the remarkable effect of every single shot looking the same-same murky blue light.  The gore, if you can see it, runs thick, but it's comic bookish and it all looks blue.  The film takes place in some alternate universe, in some alternate time and on a planet...where?  We have some place that looks like Russia, I couldn't tell, a lot of commandos who use MP-5s, and then you have vampires and lycans running around.  Honestly, I really thought it would be more fun, but there isn't a shred of humor, not one once of self-reflexivity to let you know that maybe, just maybe, the people involved in this film had fun making it.<br /><br />One gigantic yawn.  If you have the attention span of a small pup, by all means go watch.  For the dedicated, go check out the DVD, sure to be released in two weeks, and definitely including at least one full extra disc of `extras', including revelations on how the 75,000 effects and stunt people collaborated to make this masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>All right, I never was a huge fan of Underworld in the first place, I felt the movie was just really all flash but it had an interesting enough plot and went at a pretty exciting pace.<br /><br />This sequel though was boring! I mean that is the one word that came to my mind when the credits finally came on. By the time the ending came, I could have cared less about any of the characters because honestly they all annoyed me. The characters were basically doing what they were doing in the first movie- trying to act all cool and thus coming off seriously wooden, and for some reason this attitude continuing in the sequel just makes the acting seem even worse. The fighting scenes seemed no different than the first movie's ones, definitely nothing that'll make you go 'wow' or anything. This movie seriously starts to drag, or anyway I got this feeling towards the end of the film that I really, really wanted the movie to finish soon. My interest for the movie left even before an hour into the film honestly.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the first Underworld over the sequel. The sequel is nothing worth watching. It drags, the acting is pretty weak, and the plot itself, though sounds interesting, turns to out to be nothing amazing. I don't plan on watching it again.<br /><br />2/5 stars only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Sequel to the 2003 Underworld starts off where it left off as that leather clad lethal vampire Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbor, The Aviator) and her vampire/lycan hybrid Michael, played by Scott Speedman (Dark Blue, My Life Without Me) are on the run.

Even though three years have passed in our time, Evolution takes up right where the first movie ended, but thanks to the magic of flashbacks we get some more background info on the blood feud and how it all began.<br /><br />Way, way back, Alexander Corvinus had two sons, Marcus (Tony Curran) and William. The first was bitten by a bat and became a Death Dealer with the fangs to prove it, and the second was bitten by a wolf to become the forefather and prototype for the Lycans who get all furry and howl at the sight of a full moon.  William however, was unable to control his blood lust, and made quite a nuisance of himself, until he was hunted down and locked away forever, much to Marcus's dismay and anger. Having been double crossed by Viktor (Bill Nighy), Marcus is out for revenge, and of course for blood.<br /><br />Back to present day, the war between Vampire and Lycan continues, and Marcus is awakened with some new tricks up his wings and a burning desire to set William free. Standing in his way is Selene, the hottest vampire action heroine in recent movie history (Beckinsale naturally) and her trusty sidekick Michael the hybrid (Scott Speedman).  Between them they unknowingly hold the key and the map to William's prison, and soon find themselves in Marcus's sights.<br /><br />In between the fighting and hiding from the sun and such activities, the two leading characters manage to squeeze in a little nookie time, which of course provides some eye-candy for us the viewers with its strategic placement between all the carnage.  The story line is a bit confusing if you haven't been making notes, and don't ever ask Selene her age, but as far as action, CGI and drama goes, this one is a non-stop thrill.  Recommended for vampire lovers and blood suckers everywhere.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 5, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves "at each others throats" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones and teaming up to feed on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed series thrillers called Underworld and Underworld Evolution. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the original right through Evolution...which is a bit of a prequel/sequel.<br /><br />All of the key characters are back in Evolution played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel. The main addition is the Vampire Marcus that we saw coming to life briefly at the end of the original.<br /><br />The effects in the original and in Evolution are great. Marcus' flying in Evolution looks a bit more magical than he is actually using his wings, but otherwise the movie is visually spectacular.<br /><br />The series documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a Death Dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman was a mortal in the original that supposedly held the key to end the war, but he unfortunately took some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key. Now in Evolution let's just say that he's more like X-Men's Wolverine than mild mannered Michael Corvin. A rift between the Lycans and Death Dealing Vampires is borne in Evolution involving Viktor's brothers, Marcus and Willliam. Hence the saga continues with a sequel that thoroughly entertains.<br /><br />Both the original and Evolution come in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Evolution stands alone. But this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to the original. So if you haven't already, you'll want to purchase both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase getting both movies into your collection. They are keepers for those into the genre. This release is for Blu-Ray DVD players.

It's a continuation of the original "Underworld," and picks up almost immediately where the original took off.  In it, Selene (Beckinsale) takes on her vampiric ex-allies as she seeks out more of the truth behind her betrayal.  Of course, hybrid beau Scott Speedman tags along on her quest.  This time around, her arch enemy isn't ol' Viktor from the original flick, but Marcus, son of the original necksucker, Alexander Corvinus.  Marcus is on the hunt for his brother, William, who just happens to be the baddest wolfman in the pack.  He's become such a powerful werewolf that he cannot revert to his human form.  He's also completely unable to control his aggression which means that no one's safe when Willy's on the prowl.  In order to protect his vampire family, Viktor locks William away in a seemingly impenetrable prison many centuries before this film takes place.  When Marcus is awakened by Kraven, he immediately begins his hunt to find the key that will open his brother's prison.  This leads him to both Viktor's dead body and Selene.<br /><br />Confusing enough for ya?  It really helps if you've seen the first flick in case you want to follow the plot.  Of course, plot is of little necessity in a film like this.  Action is the driving force that makes this flick watchable.  Fans of the original will recognize Lucian, Kraven, and Amelia from the original flick in brief flashback sequences and Marcus' awakening scene.  Fans of the original will also recall Selene's famous swandive manuever which is done repeatedly in this sequel.<br /><br />I have to admit that I prefer this flick to the original.  It has more action, a swifter pace, and for once, the werewolves and vampires actually use their supernatural strengths to do battle.  Gunplay fans be not afraid, there are just as many bullets flying in "Evolution" as there were in the original flick.<br /><br />The cast is anchored by the wonderful Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus.  Unfortunately he isn't given much to work with here.  Tony Curran portrays sinister son, Marcus.  Thankfully, he has more than a few words to work with here.  He plays his character to perfection.  The rest of the cast does a fairly solid job.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good here, though the werewolf transformations get tiring to watch after awhile.  The CGI is very obvious through most of this flick.  Think "Van Helsing" with a little more blood and a lot more atmosphere.  Marcus' wings, which have been mentioned by other reviewers, are pretty cool to watch in action, but watching people get impaled by a wing can also get old after awhile.<br /><br />If you enjoy action, "Evolution" is worthy of four stars.  If you're more into plot-driven drama, this film is only deserving of three stars.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is, an action-thriller with plenty of explosions and gore, a brief bit of nudity, and whigged-out werewolves and vampires.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Some movies are created for special effects carnivals: a subservient storyline serves merely as the glue to hold together 106 minutes of action. Films such as UNDERWORLD - EVOLUTION is one of this genre and if the viewers take it for that they won't be disappointed.  Writer (with Danny McBride) and Director Len Wiseman pulled out all the unused parts of the original UNDERWORLD and have recycled them and magnified them into a sequel starring Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsale and he knows how to make it work.<br /><br />The script for the film is probably only a few pages long so the bulk of the piece is action. And here the real stars appear: Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos, Art Direction by Chris August, Set Decoration by Lin MacDonald and Costume Design by<br /><br />Wendy Partridge are only a few of the names that deserve the credit for the success.  Everything is shot in a shade of blue (Simon Duggan is the cinematographer) but of course that is appropriate because it all takes place at night when vampires can function.  The story is rather easy to condense: lycans vs vampires with a cross section of a hybrid to spice things up come into a centuries old conflict struggle for power.  More than that is unnecessary to know.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is ever beautiful and is such a fine actress that she brings some warmth to this comic book heroine.  But the rest of the cast is paralyzed by silly dialogue and that holds down the likes of Derek Jacobi, Scott Speedman, unintentionally hilarious bad guy Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, etc.  But keep your eyes focused on the locks, the wonderful wings of Viktor  with all that they can do, and the entertainingly gruesome and ultimately tiring 'turning' of men into distortions of werewolves.  As for Beckinsale and Speedman, they make a nice couple, but it is more a 'blood in, blood out' romance.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish or those who look for story, but for what it is UNDERWORLD part II and obviously to be continued is a special effects delight.  Grady Harp, June 06</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I say this is an excellent sequel that compliments the first film quite well.  I believe the films are equal in storyline, but the second film seems to have cooler sets and special effects.<br /><br />My one complaint about this film is that it verbally tells you what is happening just a little too much.  Although I enjoy Beckinsale's voice and accent as she tells us about her journey, I was waiting for her to even tell me how many bullets she had left in her gun.<br /><br />However, that minor flaw does not take away that this is a great action film.<br /><br />Some people have commented that this movie fails to deliver what the first movie did, but I don't think that's a fair statement, as we had the element of surprise in the first one.  This film was more of a bad guy chasing after the good guys adventure.  And when one looks at it from that perspective, the movie is really quite good.<br /><br />Give this movie a viewing.  I think you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />It delivers action, drama, romance, suspense, and a little bit of gore.  What more do you want from a film called Underworld?<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The title alone says exactly what the film accomplishes, as the story 'evolves' seemingly by the minute and it never becomes stale or overtly contrived. This movie surpasses the original as far as story development. We learn a good bit about each character's past, which helps justify all the extreme violence they engage themselves in. We're also introduced to some new characters and plot lines that add interest and new twists, rather than just rehashing all the familiar faces from Underworld.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale delivers a performance that shows she is a very versatile actress who just so happens to be strikingly beautiful, and Scott Speed man was more than just a little eye-candy for the ladies, delivering a performance that made me believe he was the perfect Michael Corvin far more than the first film. And the supporting casts around the two main stars were all equally up to the task, with many turning in performances that are likely to be career defining.<br /><br />Hats off to Len Wiseman for living up to a last name that couldn't be more fitting. He never compromises his vision, and more importantly the story by trying to woo the crowd with over-the-top (Matrix-y) action scenes or gratuitous sexual imagery, as many directors do to try to win over their audiences, and yet the movie has some of the best action scenes the genre has seen in years, and a sexual chemistry between Selene and Michael that is very believable, and yet not over-done. Even in one very intimate scene between them, it is never excessive or tasteless.<br /><br />Let's face it. If you're going to purchase this movie, you probably enjoyed the original and are looking for more. You want high doses of fight scenes, vampire and lycan lore, blood, violence, and Kate Beckinsale wearing leather or less. In short, this movie delivers all of the above in great excess, so if you liked Underworld, you're going to like Underworld: Evolution as much or more.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you don't like blood, violence, action, mythology, or using a sword in a world full of guns, this movie is not for you, and it's NOT MEANT to be for you. Highly recommended to be placed into your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>The Underworld franchise is an intriguing one.  The movies are visually beautiful, the concept is interesting, a prequel is about to be made, and most of the actors are exceptional.  The first Underworld movie suffered from a few plot holes, but Underworld Evolution simply doesn't have enough plot to have that many holes.  It does manage a few of them, though.<br /><br />In Underworld, it is established that there are three master vampires, each of whom have their turn to rule: Victor, Marcus, and Amelia.  Marcus and Victor have a rivalry, but if the vampires knew that Marcus would kill anyone who respected Victor when he was risen, why would they even consider raising him? And Marcus's motives are convoluted but never made clear, because he wants to kill Selene even after she says that she killed Victor (in the first movie, thus not a spoiler).  This is nonsensical, but it doesn't take away much from the movie.  The visual cinematography and Beckinsale's acting make sure of that.<br /><br />This movie is a lot shorter, sexier, and abrupt than the first one, and there aren't that many things happening.  In the least, it's easy to follow.<br /><br />7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>When I popped Underworld Evolution in the DVD player I expected it to be the same as the first, only chopped into pieces and reassembled. I was wrong.<br /><br />Underworld Evolution is its own film. Yes, it still had Lycans and Vampires, but it has so much more. Firstly, the scene is not urban. Most of the movie is set in a wintry hinterland, which was fine by me. I loved the new setting. It made the sequel feel the same, but refreshingly different.<br /><br />There were also new monsters and bad guys. The winged vampire was one of the best cinema bad monsters to date. Awesome job! I would love to see a third movie with more creative monster madness.<br /><br />Lastly, the story holds its own and doesn't resemble the first. This is good.<br /><br />Overall, Underworld Evolution is a great addition to the Underworld family. I highly recommend the film. I do have a couple nit-picky items I would like to mention. First, Lycans don't really play much of a prominent role in this film except for Michael Corvin. It is much more of a vampire flick with some Lycan scenes thrown in to hold continuity from the first Underworld.<br /><br />Secondly, Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin in underused in the movie. Near the end, before his return, I almost forgot about him. While he was on screen quite a bit, there wasn't much about him that really mattered. I thought his character would play a prominent role in the sequel, but he was more of a minor player. His "hybrid" was of little importance. Kate Beckinsale's transformation was much more interesting and captivating.<br /><br />Lastly, the scene with Kate and Scott where Kate broke down in tears was a bit over dramatic and not really believable. This isn't a rip on Kate's acting - she did a wonderful job - but more a commentary on how little chemistry was developed between Michael Corvin and Selene in the sequel. I didn't buy there love affair, if you will.<br /><br />Great flick! See it! Buy it! Overall I enjoyed it slightly more than the first.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 84<br /><br />44 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

Action and dark tales merge as legendary supernatural beings in the form of vampires and werewolves battle it out. Not bad, though some parts are just slightly predictable.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>OK... I didn't see the previous ones. I was talked into seeing this one and I wasn't sorry.<br /><br />This movie delivers!<br /><br />Along the way, the characters do bring you up to speed as to the story line. So, I did understand what was happening after a while.<br /><br />What I liked most was that this movie moved! It gained speed and didn't stop until it came screeching in to the end. It is special effects laden, but this story could not have been told without all of the special effects.... and they are done well.<br /><br />It is comic book to be sure... so my expectations weren't too high. However, I was pleasantly suprised. They really did a good job with this movie.<br /><br />Not to be taken too seriously in regards to the folklore of vampires and werewolves, it is quite a romp through reaching for the heights.<br /><br />If you have some time to spend and want to be entertained and enjoy a thrill ride, I would definitely recommend this one. Worth every penny of rental. Take it for what it is meant to be and you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of the first Underworld film. But, I bought the sequel because many said it was awesome...and they were right. Kate Beckinsale returns as the vampire Selene and Scott Speedman returns as the half-vampire, half-werewolf Michael.<br /><br />Selene and Michael team up to stop the first vampire Marcus (Curran) from freeing his werewolf brother William (Steele). Bill Nighy makes appearance as Victor in a past scene.<br /><br />Len Wiseman does another great job with the dark visuals in this film, and the setting is awesome. To me, the story in this one was better than the original one, but everyone has their own opinion.<br /><br />I said if I like this film, I would give the first one a second chance, and I will. Once I see it again, I'll give in my review. Forget BloodRayne, Selene is way better than her (at least the film version of BloodRayne). If you're a fan or not a fan of the first Underworld, go checkout this cool sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>Well, if you want to see a movie with compelling characters, intricate plotlines that make sense, and big issues that make you think and uphold your political beliefs about the senseless of violence or world politics, chances are that you are avoiding this movie and seeing Munich or The Squid and the Whale (however, I'll take a B-movie over a preachy A-movie any day). If you want special effects, camera work and Kate Beckinsale in a leather-vinyl cat suit, read on.<br /><br />This movie is a confused mess, made barely comprehensible by the beginning refresher course from the first movie. I barely kept up due to a rerun of the original movie on TNT the week before and even that wasn't completely helpful. Basically a vampire (Kate Beckinsale) and a werewolf-vampire hybrid (Scott Speedman) run around Russia or Eastern Europe getting chased by Marcus, the old vampire waking up at the end of the last movie, in some convoluted attempt to either avenge the coven or find his REALLY BAD werewolf brother. Apparently the 13th century werewolves were just nasty beasts and not the club going ravers of the first movie (and may I just add that the elimination of the Goth Vampires sipping absinthe and the Raver Werewolves hanging out in sewers flexing their hard abs is a definite plus.)<br /><br />Derek Jacobi centers the movie as the head of a secret society that seems to like blowing things up and stealing bodies. He's got an agenda but it's silly (and the source of a big gaping plothole).<br /><br />Still, what distinguishes this movie from your average Michael Bay shoot-em-up? Well there's some attempt at plotting (confused and jumbled yes, but more than guy must run away from evil conspiracy) and the camera work is amazing. The special effects are great and Kate Beckinsale can sell the lines. Not everyone likes her because she's been in some crap movies (Pearl Harbor's only contribution to cinema is a song in Team America) but she's also been in some good ones (Cold COmfort Farm is great) but she is more than a woman with a great body in a leather vinyl cat suit.<br /><br />Although the leather vinyl catsuit doesn't hurt her case.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>The rare sequel that surpasses the original. Selene and hybrid Michael are now hunted after the vampire and werewolf battle that saw the demise of Lucien and Viktor. What Selene does not know, is that she has important information that the last remaining elder, Marcus must get to free his Lycan brother William. What takes place is thrilling hunt that takes us deeper into the vampire and werewolf lore, to it's very origin.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The best looking of the series. This one jumps out at you and is gorgeous. Demo potential. All special features are ported over. FINAL VERDICT: ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>For those of you who are gamers like me, you'll immediately notice the similarities between the Underworld series and White Wolf's World of Darkness. In essence, vampires and werewolves co-exist but don't get along.  Vampires are civilized folk; werewolves are bestial superhero types who "Hulk out" when they get mad.  This war rages around normal humanity, who is unaware of their presence. In fact, Underworld and the World of Darkness are so similar that there was a lawsuit about it. Google "Sony White Wolf lawsuit" for more info.<br /><br />Where last we left our anti-heroes, the Death-Dealer vampire known as Selene (the delectable Kate Beckinsale) and her half-werewolf/half-vampire boy-toy Michael Corvin (the shirtless Scott Speedman), had essentially destroyed an entire clan of vampires under Viktor (Bill Nighy, in flashbacks). The plot gets complicated from there, but it centers around Viktor's clan attempting to wipe out a werewolf clan, when in reality the two were in league with each other.  Selene and Michael are ultimately Viktor's downfall.<br /><br />At the end of the first Underworld movie, another ancient vampire had just awakened.  His name is Marcus (Tony Curran), and he makes Viktor look like a fluffy bunny.  If you've seen the first movie, it revealed a dark secret about vampires and werewolves.  That secret is integral to Marcus' plan, and he sets it into motion immediately by taking to the air.  Marcus, ya see, is more bat than vampire.  He has big scary wings that can morph into talons (like a chicken!).<br /><br />Marcus is out to rescue William (Brian Steele), a werewolf who is meaner, nastier and more contagious than Marcus is vampire-y. We never quite find out what their plans are together, but it surely involves global domination. A special ops group led by Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi) gets involved as a result.  Mostly, the SWAT-team like guys serve the same purpose as those poor saps in Terminator 2...to prove how dangerous the bad guy is by getting their butts handed to them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Selene and Michael explore interspecies relations and Michael learns just what it means to be a vampire.  All of this is shot through a blue lens; so much so that the movie might be appropriately named "Underwater" instead.<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution ups the struggle between vampires and werewolves to over-the-top, superhero levels.  Marcus is a one-vampire killing machine; he can lift heavy stone walls with his bare hands, blast through wooden structures, and take shotgun blasts to the face.  Fortunately, Selene has Michael on her side; as a hybrid, he's pretty powerful himself.  And he looks a lot like Nightcrawler for some reason.<br /><br />Evolution isn't just violent; it's hyper-violent.  Whereas Underworld had to beat the record for most shots fired in a film, Evolution claims the new title of most heads removed in the most disgusting manner possible.  This is a rated R film for a reason.  Why so many kids were in the movie theater, I'll never understand.<br /><br />The good news is that Evolution makes no bones about what it is: another installment in an ongoing series.  Underworld could easily be a cable-TV mini-series with a very large budget.  The bad news is that I didn't remember the plot details from the first film very well and that made the film confusing in parts.<br /><br />The action is amazing when it gets going, the acting is appropriate (bless Sir Derek Jacobi, he lends it some gravitas), and the special effects are well integrated into the film.  With all that blue lens camerawork, you can't go wrong. The soundtrack is actually an improvement over the first.  It's less painfully angsty and more relevant to the action.  And of course, there's the fact that Selene takes her clothes off.<br /><br />Oh wait, is that just me?<br /><br />Ahem. There are two movie tropes I really hate.  One is slow-motion scenes, which are blessedly rare in Evolution.  The other is flashbacks.  Evolution is 30 percent flashbacks.  The movie flashes back to memories of Selene, scenes from the original movie, and scenes that bridge the gap between the two films.  These flashbacks take place through a yellow lens.  Sometimes, we get flashbacks when we need them. Most of the time, we get flashbacks hammering home a point far too many times (WE GET IT, SELENE DREW A SUN ON A WALL).<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Dog Soldiers, the ultimate werewolf movie, and Underworld borrowed the same special effects for its werewolves.  Basically, instead of using computer graphics for werewolves (which aren't nearly as convincing due to all the hair), you put a guy in stilts and a fur suit.  The effect is startling if filmed correctly.<br /><br />William, the only werewolf that uses this style of special effect, instead looks like a stubby-armed wuss.  Mostly, he roars and wails as he gets his butt whipped good.  For an ultimate werewolf, he's a real letdown. Sorry, but I like my werewolves mean and nasty.  The werewolf pack from Dog Soldiers would be ashamed to be associated with such a whiny pup.<br /><br />Those flaws aside, Evolution is really a sequel for people who like vampires, skin-tight leather, and Kate Beckinsale.  If you fall into any of those categories, you'll be clapping along with the rest of the audience at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Underworld: Evolution continues the story almost directly where the first movie ended.  Selene, the vampire death-dealer, and Michael, the vampire-lycan hybrid, are on the run after killing Victor, the head of the vampires who betrayed them.  The plot of Evolution involves the "fathers" of vampires and lycans, twin brothers from the 13th century, one of whom was the first vampire, while the other was the first Lycan.  Markus, the first vampire gets awakened and sets off on a quest to free his brother, William, who has been secretly imprisoned for eight centuries.  Along the way, there is, of course, many action sequences, a lot of gore, and the necessary sex scene.<br /><br />While Underworld: Evolution is a pretty by-the-book vampire movie, it makes itself better by inventing an interesting storyline for the audience to follow.  I mean, at this point in the history of cinema, you are a genius if you can make an "original" vampire movie.  And Underworld is about as close as I've seen in my life to a truly original vampire storyline.  The effects are fairly impressive.  Some moments they look cheesy, while at other moments they are thoroughly impressive on every level: realism and how cool they look.  The movie looks very cool, as did the first one.  Len Wiseman, the director, creates a very dark, brooding atmosphere (of course, everything takes place at night), and the sets that are used are very cool.<br /><br />The acting is solid.  Kate Beckinsale is an OK actress, but she is the main character in this movie for one reason: so we can see her in a tight, leather jumpsuit the whole time, and see her get naked once.  I think that Scott Speedman is a very good actor.  Unfortunately, he hasn't exactly been choosing the best movies to further his career (XXX: State of the Union, anyone?).<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution is a movie worth seeing.  It is faster-paced than the first one, and the action is even a little better.  Don't expect too much, though.  This movie knows what it is, and it doesn't try to do anything more with itself than what is necessary.</p></br></body></html>

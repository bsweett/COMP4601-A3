I wasted my money crappy movies often, just because of a star that I liked, or a premise that seemed interesting. As much as I hate to admit it, I did not like Westerns for the life of me. I saw Appaloosa when it came out in theatres, and ironically liked it, albeit only a little. I then saw 3:10 To Yuma, and what do you know, I loved it. Still do. Finally, there came a point where I had to ask myself what my problem was, why I refused to give other Westerns a chance. I eventually blind bought the DVD and decided to watch, not only one of the classic films collecting dust on my shelf, but one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Unforgiven is very well done. Certainly deserving of the recognition it has received over the years. I'm actually glad that this movie won Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is obviously well known for his portrayal of cowboys back when Westerns owned the air waves. I love how he came back in the early 90's to show them he hadn't lost his touch with a six shooter, or Schofield rifle, or shotgun, etc. He was perfect, and played the role exactly as I would expect. But his character went through a change that I was not expecting.<br /><br />The movie progresses along at a slow pace, and calmly inches its way toward the thrilling conclusion. Throughout the film we hear repeatedly how much of a badass Bill Munny was back in his heyday. There wasn't much to show for it. When we first meet him he's falling all over his pigs. Later on down the line he gets a fever from a small beating and is asleep for three days. I started to think to myself that this guy needed to take his old behind back home before he got too deep into trouble. He was not in any shape to try to kill anyone. Slowly, but surely we meet the man. I'll leave it at that because it's nearly impossible to say more without spoiling anything. I'll just say that Clint's performance is enough to sit through this one, even without the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well. He played Bill's longtime friend and partner in crime, Ned. When a young man suddenly shows up on Bill's ranch asking him to help kill a couple of bad men for a bounty, Ned's place is the first stop Bill makes. Together Bill and Ned accompany the young man on this hit. I might as well call it a hit, instead of sugar coating it. Bill and Ned are assassins, hitmen. So they aren't very good men themselves. The young man, called "The Schofield Kid", is played by Jaimz Woolvett (a relatively unknown...to me anyway). He does great too.<br /><br />The whole cast is really good. Gene Hackamn plays a real jerk of a town sheriff, named Little Bill, and Richard Harris has a short, but meaningful role as English Bob. I should also mention that the whores were well played as well. I feel bad calling them that, but that's what everyone else in the movie called them. I really liked this cast. Clint Eastwood is a hell of a director. The shots are really nice to look at. This isn't his most beautifully shot film, but this cinematography will impress nonetheless. If Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy is even a fraction as good as Unforgiven, I cannot wait. I can rest assured that that was a worthwhile purchase, even for a non-Western fan like myself. I really look forward to seeing many more films in this genre hence forth. If you're like I was, and doubt you'll be interested in movies like this one, stop it. Just give Unforgiven a chance and see for yourself. I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>This is a western for the ages set in late nineteen century Montana.<br /><br />A saloon girl is beaten and knife-cut. Her coworkers are angry but the sheriff (Gene Hackman) does not want to do much about it. Her coworkers put up a thousand dollar reward to obtain justice, but the reward only draws undesirables and brings trouble to Big Whiskey, Montana.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris join forces in an effort to obtain the reward money. After the setting, the story is mainly about the confrontation within the trio and the sheriff and the values that emerge considering that the gun is mainly law.<br /><br />Disc two is about 'the making of' and a considerable data base of Clint Eastwood movies. Included is an episode from "Maverick" starring James Garner and a very young Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />"Unforgiven" belongs next to "High Noon". It is that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I like westerns and I like this film but I admit this is a bit hard-edged. It took me a couple of viewings to appreciate it. It's a tough movie with a good cast and no nonsense. The characters in here aren't the talk-now-shoot-later variety. There are a few memorable and very tense scenes in this film, and a good share of profanity, too.<br /><br />Watching the likes of Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the three main stars, however, is pretty entertaining. How often are those charismatic actors NOT entertaining?<br /><br />Overall, a rough film but a pretty solid western which would have been probably better and accepted by the public better had the language been toned down.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>UNFORGIVEN<br /><br />**** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- August 7th, 1992<br /><br />Running Time- 131-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- David Webb Peoples<br /><br />Director- Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Starring- Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Frances Fisher, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Anna Levine and Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett<br /><br />Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's big return to the Western genre and is by considered by many as one of the all time greats of the genre and won four Academy Awards, which included best editing for Joel Cox, Gene Hackman for best supporting actor, best director for Eastwood and best picture and while Unforgiven is deserving of it's praise the movie isn't without it's flaws and quite honestly as much as I liked the movie it wouldn't make my top 5 Eastwood movies.<br /><br />The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is quite solid with some really great characters. Unforgiven does feature plenty of action, but the movie is driven more by the characters rather than the action. The characters are all mostly well written for, but some aren't as interesting as others. None of the characters are boring or anything, but some work better than others. The script is well thought out and works on pretty much every level<br /><br />Clint Eastwood won his first Oscar for Unforgiven and he delivers a very well made movie. As I stated even with the action, Unforgiven is much more driven by the characters and Eastwood does a great job at brining the script to life. His scenes are generally well paced and he delivers some great action, suspense and real life human emotions. The only problem I really had was the running time. I personally felt the 134-minute running time was a little overly long. While none of the scenes are filler scenes and they all add to the plot and to the characters I did feel a few minutes here and there could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie at all.<br /><br />But regardless Eastwood delivers an excellent movie and the final act was nothing short of brilliant. The suspense level is excellent and while the shoot outs don't drag out, but they aren't too brief either and while the whole movie was well done I think the final act is where Eastwood really shines as director.<br /><br />Besides directing and producing Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny and this might be the best character Eastwood has ever played or at least the most complex. The thing about Eastwood is he is a great actor in the sense that he's best known for that tough guy role and even in his lighter movies he still has that tough guy persona and you'll be hard pressed to find someone better at that role than Eastwood, but he doesn't have a lot of range as an actor. That isn't a knock against him since he's great at what he does, but in Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood shows more range than anything before or after this movie.<br /><br />William Munny was a cold blooded killer who once married changed his ways and is seeking a sort of redemption. He knows what he's done in the past and he knows it was wrong, but what's done is done and in many ways William Munny is a broken man since the death of his wife. William Munny may not be as cool and entertaining as say Dirty Harry, but like I said he is the most complex of all Eastwood's characters. There was a lot of depth to William Munny and Eastwood really delivers a performance of a lifetime. We've seen characters like this before, but Eastwood as director and actor manages to make it seem fresh and different. Clint was nominated for best actor, but lost out to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman, but I personally feel of all the nominated actors that year Eastwood was by far the best with a very complex character.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, who like Munny has done bad things in the past and is trying to put it behind him. Gene Hackman like always is great and was very deserving of his Oscar win, but I don't understand how Freeman wasn't nominated. Jaimz Woolvett as The Schofield Kid nearly steals the show as a wannabe gunslinger.<br /><br />Like I said Unforgiven is a great picture and it's one of those movies as I think back to I like it even more, but still wouldn't place it in my top 5 Eastwood flicks. Unforgiven though is a really complex movie with excellent characters and like I said Eastwood is great at what he does, but doesn't have a lot of range, but here he shows all that range and more. William Munny is truly a great character and despite any problems I had with Unforgiven it comes highly recommended to Eastwood and Western fans.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has excellent quality and makes the movie look like it was done recently and not in 1992. The extra features are great with some good behind the scenes, plus the documentary Eastwood on Eastwood, which is a must see for fans of the Iconic actor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"Unforgiven" is one of the many entries into THE American film genre. According to Clint Eastwood, the film's star and director, it "summarizes everything I feel about the western." And it is a fine western film, filled with fascinating characters, exciting gunfights, and beautiful choreography. The story itself is fascinating, though it is a bit slow and uneven in some places.<br />Clint Eastwood gives what is arguably his best performance as Bill Munny, a former gunslinger and cold-blooded killer, who's changed his ways, but agrees to collect one more bounty in order to support his two children. We see how violence can corrupt a human being, and how past demons can truly eat at him, and Eastwood plays this perfectly. Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorites, gives another terrific performance as Ned Logan, Munny's old partner. Gene Hackman is brutal, but also scarily likable, as the villainous Little Bill Daggett, the corrupt sheriff of the town. It isn't hard to see why he won an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances as well, and help to keep the story both interesting and involving.<br />Overall, "Unforgiven" is a fine, if slow and uneven, entry into the genre with great performances and well-done gunfights. Fans of western and drama alike will find much to enjoy in this modern-day western.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>The dark message comes through in this Eastwood creation of classic western genre.  It is a foreboding and frightening tale of a bad man turned good then returning to his past - or is it that his past is coming back to drag him down again?  The cynicism is thick in the theme that there is no one good.  And even the bad are in for more than what they bargained for in this hard-hitting gun-slinging action drama.  If you enjoy the do-good classics, you may not like this film which is a little heavy-handed in its realism concerning the use of violence to settle scores.  Like most cynical statements, it is difficult to swallow and leaves you uneasy whether you enjoy the realism or dislike the taste it leaves behind.  The story is moving and you cannot help but uneasily relate to the main character in all his violent flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Never a truer word has ever been said.  Undoubtadly the best modern day western, Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny (Clint Eastwood who also directed), a once ruthless gunslinger who, along with his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the nephew of one of his old partners (Jaimz Woolvett), are out to collect a bounty on the men who brutalized a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey which is run by the sly, deceitful, and brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).  At first glance that seems to be the story of Unforgiven, but if you look closer there is something else there.  For years, Will Munny tried to deny what he was; a cold blooded theif and murderer and killer of women and children.  For years he tried to believe he was a changed man, but for all those long years there was something growing in this man, something that he couldn't outgun, his true nature.  The scene where he is laying there sickly after being beaten by Little Bill, when he tells Ned about his vision of the Angel of Death, he was seeing himself; and now he will be unleashed in Big Whiskey when he is pushed to his limit.  This is the incredible storytelling that most screen writers only wish they could come up with, and thanks to Eastwood's fantastic direction and incredible performances from him, Hackman, Freeman, and the late Richard Harris in one of his most colorful roles, make Unforgiven a true modern day classic.  It would win the Best Picture Oscar along with Best Editing, and Eastwood would earn an Oscar for Best Director while Hackman would deservingly win for Best Supporting Actor.  While this Special Edition DVD re-release may have some questionable extras (how about a commentary from Eastwood, Hackman, or even screenwriter David Peoples?), this is absolutely worth owning, even if you don't like westerns.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>You can tell right away that this is not going to be typical Hollywood fare from the beginning.  Please take that as a compliment.  The story is about a group of prostitutes in a small Western town in the 19th century.  A customer with not a lot under the hood overreacts to his rent-a-mate's comment on this and slices up her face with a knife.  After the sheriff shows up and gives less than a slap on the hand for this offense, the ladies get together, pool their money, and get the word out that they'll pay a reward to the party that brings a more "eye for and eye" to the cutter and his companion.  <p>Now it's not this original scene of violence that makes it special.  It's the portrayal of old Western life that does.  While the otherwise masterful "Lonesome Dove" has one of the most beautiful faces in movies in Diane Lane as it's prostitute, the ladies here are, for the most part, very ordinary looking.  More than that, they portray a weariness that shows that their life is not that easy.  In the hands of other Hollywood powers, the ladies would have been Charlie's Angels.<p>Cut to the existence of the movie's main character, played by Clint Eastwood.  He's a former outlaw and killer, reformed by his now dead wife, and faced with the responsibility of raising two children.  The only thing good that can be said of his home is that it's slightly better than the pen where he keeps the hogs he raises, and that's not saying much.  The Ponderosa it ain't.  <p>What Clint Eastwood seemed to want to do in his directorial masterpiece is to turn everything he represented in his previous years of acting and turn in on it's head.  In scene after scene you anticipate the old Clint rearing back and wiping out half a town just to get an appetite up for breakfast.  But time after time we are surprised to see a man who can't even mount his horse properly, and can't hit a target with a pistol from ten feet away.  We see that all his lifestyle has led to is wretched poverty.  <p>The movie grows on you the more you watch it, and the memorable characters have stood the test of time.  Morgan Freeman, as always, brings a knowing weariness in his role as Eastwood's partner.  Richard Harris has a terrific role as an English gunfighter who hires a writer to build his own legend, but has it totally taken apart by the sheriff of the movie's central town.  And Gene Hackman deserves his Oscar as the sheriff who is somehow portrayed as the bad guy when most of the other lead male characters are in the plot for the sole purpose of committing murder.  It is this challenge to our sense of what is right and what is wrong, and if there is sometimes even a difference between the two that makes this a Hall of Fame movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is much more than a breathtaking Western, it's an amazing film altogether. With elements of drama and film noir, this is a picture that shows us that there are some demons you can never put to rest, no matter how hard you try.<br /><br /> Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny, a once notorious and violent killer and thief. If Munny didn't like you, chances were that you wouldn't live long enough for him to tell you so. However, that was in the old days. Now, he's just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still in mourning of his dead wife. He's been straight for years and is trying to put all of his demons to rest, but you still get the feeling that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be haunted. An opportunity comes to him in the name of `The Schofield Kid.' He gives him a chance to be his partner and have him help on a bounty. Knowing that the money could help his family out, Munny finally decides to take the Kid up on the offer. He also brings with him Ned Logan; an old friend and partner. Little Bill Daggett is the Sheriff in town, and the thing he hates most are assassins. He will do anything in his power to take care of them and make sure they do not succeed on their killing. The last remaining part of the film stands out the most and is so well executed that it catches you off guard.<br /><br /> This really is a great film and it surprised me like I would've never expected. I don't like Westerns all that much, but this isn't your typical Western. That is probably why I enjoyed it so much. There is so much story and character development. You really are able to sympathize with Munny, despite his dark and violent past. You want him to be able to get on with his life and forget the past, although you know deep down that things will never be put to rest, and agreeing to go on this bounty only increases the chance of Munny returning back to his old ways. This isn't a Western where the line between good guys and bad guys are clear and the storyline is simple; good guy kills bad guys and gets the girl in the end. No, you won't find any of this here. In this story there are no clear good guys or bad guys, just regular people. This is a real story with real characters that you can feel for. There is a huge issue of morality that takes place, which is something you don't see much in Westerns.<br /><br /> Not only does Eastwood do a terrific job in acting, he also does an amazing job as director. He's a man with vision, and who more qualified to direct a film of this magnitude. I don't think the film would had been as successful had it been done by someone else. The cast is also outstanding. Morgan Freeman really does his role justice. Gene Hackman spreads fear inside of you as the mean and tough Sheriff. Richard Harris also deserves mention for his part as well. (He is sorely missed. He was a very gifted actor.) Everyone really did great in their roles and really knew how to bring the film together.<br /><br /> This new DVD edition really does the movie justice. Though it may not have the most special features, the one feature that stands out the most is the new digital transfer that really makes the picture look crystal clear. The sound is also very impressive as well. Special features included are as follows: Audio commentary by Film Critic and Eastwood Biographer Richard Schickel, Eastwood film highlights, awards list, trailer, and 4 documentaries.<br /><br /> &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is really a spectacular film that deserved the Academy Awards for &quot;Best Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Director.&quot; And it is a true masterpiece in my eyes. I think anyone who is a lover of films should give this one a try. Remember, you do not have to be a Western fan to enjoy this, because I am certainly not one. Some people may be disappointed in the lack of action or shoot-outs, but the film is about so much more. It's about morals and trying to put the past to rest. It's also about accepting who you are and that there are some things you will never be able to change, no matter how hard you try. This will end up being one of my favorites in no time. I was very surprised, indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Unforgiven is clearly among the top westerns ever made.  This movie is simple, dark and yet highly complex in its superb script and the outstanding performances by all concerned.  Few westerns will draw you into the lead characters as this one does.  Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the sorely missed Richard Harris all deserved awards for their collective performances.  What is a western without Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman!<p>The premise:<p>Welcome to Big Whiskey Wyoming, where in a small "billiards" saloon, a cowboy gets angry at a whore and, with the help of his buddy, cuts her face up.  The other "women" of the establishment, pool their money and start telling everybody that they're offering a reward to whoever kills these two young cowboys.  This is precipitated by Gene Hackmans character Little Bill, who essentially doesn't punish them for their crime.  <p>Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, who in his earlier days was every bit one of the worst, meanest gunslingers in the west.  Some ten years prior to the events at the beginning of this fine film, William Munny met his wife Claudia, who turned this serious gunslinger into a family man, unfortunately for him and his little children, his wife died three years prior.  He is now a poor pig farmer, with two little children.<p>The son of one of his old riding buddies has heard about this reward and seeks out William Munnys assistance in tracking down these unpunished criminals.  After some hesitation, he seeks out his friend Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, one of the finest actors of our day.  The three of them head north to seek out the reward.<p>What follows is clearly a movie that while, for the better part is melodramatic; it is that melodrama that is gripping.  All those who received accolades for this fine film, richly deserved those accolades.<p>This exceptional film that graced the silver screen so beautifully and then the home theater, deserves a hallowed place on ones DVD rack and is perfectly well suited to repeated viewings.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all, even those who may not find themselves interested in westerns will find this film highly compelling.  {ssintrepid}</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Redemption can only succeed if the past doesn't haunt the redeemed. Clint Eastwood stars as former outlaw Will Munny. Munny has changed his ways after meeting a woman who literally helped him turn his life around. Now she's gone and he's a struggling farmer with two small children desperate for money to fuel his last chance at staying honest and straight. <p>Munny decides along with his former partner (a marvelously understated Morgan Freeman)and a young kid to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute for a $1000.00 bounty. The only thing standing between him and the money is Little Bill (Gene Hackman who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting actor)a brutal Sheriff. Munny doesn't know it but he's caught an express train to hell as the cold blooded killer he was comes to the fore again.<p>Unforgiven is as much about the inability to escape our past as it is about the violence and bloodshed that was later glossed over in the westerns of the 30's and 40's. Munny realizes that killing is a nasty business for both the killer and his victim. Despite his years of hard work and the saving grace of his wife, Munny could easily tip over into the abyss of alcholism and cruelty that dominated his youth. It's a marvelous portrayal and Eastwood, arguably, deserved the Best Acting Oscar as much as the directing and Best Picture Oscars.<p>This new 10th Anniversary edition has been digitally remastered and looks beautiful. The opening sequence is a good example of the care taken in the transfer. The smoke from Munny's house during sunset snakes gently against the bright orange sky. Eastwood and his collaborators (writer David Webb Peoples who also wrote Blade Runner and the underrated film science fiction adventure Solider with Kurt Russell)have fashioned a morality play as much about the present as it is about the past. <p>The cast is filled with Eastwood regulars but two particular performances shine aside from Eastwood and Freeman--Gene Hackman as the sadistic and brutal Little Bill and the late Richard Harris in a glorified cameo as gunfighting legend English Bob. Harris plays Bob as a dandy with a pistol until Bob encounters Little Bill. We then discover how much of his legend is myth designed to gloss over a nasty reputation and dishonorable actions.<p>The extras included are very good as well. There's a documentary called Eastwood on Eastwood which ran on one of the cable channels.  As a performer we get glimpses of Eastwood in early supporting roles (from his first movie the horrible horror film Revenge of the Creature with John Agar)to the television role that gave him enough fame to jump to Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in Rawhide. The clips provide a good summation of Eastwood's performing style over the years. It's also a canny if slightly self serving assessment on Eastwood's themes as a director and smart observations about the true quality of his uneven body of work as a director. <p>There's also an episode of Maverick featuring James Garner where Eastwood plays a character that could have been Munny when he was younger. He plays a cocky young gunfighter with an attitude (although Munny was much nastier based on comments from the characters in the film. Consider his portrayal a G rated version of Munny). It's a beautiful transfer of a classic black and white episode from television's Golden Age. When will Maverick and some of these classic westerns finally make the jump to DVD?<p>There's also a feature commentary by Time film critic Richard Schickel (although I would have much preferred Eastwood). A new featurette about the making of the film as well as the original featurette on the making of the film. <p>If you're not interested in the extras and the nearly pristine transfer doesn't appeal to you, the single disc earlier edition of Unforgiven looks very good as well athough nowhere near as sharp as this one. It's about half the cost and might be a good place to start if you haven't seen the film and are unsure about purchasing it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood held onto the David People's script for Unforgiven for over 10 years.  Knowing it was something special, he wanted to be mature enough, as both an actor and a director, to do it justice.  It was a wise decision.<p>Eastwood aged into the character of William Munny, chiseled, worn-looking, and I was quite surprised at how well he did with the role.  Munny is a haunted man, burdened with the memories of a violent past and the ghosts of many murders.  His denials &quot;I was drunk&quot; or &quot;I don't remember&quot; are belied by the guilty flicks of his eyes or the thousand yard stare when memory does come back &quot;remember that drover I shot...whose teeth came out the back of this neck?  He didn't do anything....&quot;.  It is all there in Eastwood's face and eyes when later in the film in his fever delirium William Munny sees the Hell he fears is waiting for him for his sins.<p>Reformed by a beloved wife, now dead, and raising 2 children on a failing pig farm, Munny and his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) are lured out of retirement for one more killing for money.  But these old outlaws are different men now, older &amp; tired and domesticated, and it seems unlikely they can do the job.  We, like their young gunsel partner, the Scofield Kid, can't see the legendary hell-raiser and killer Munny in this haggard old man.<p>I note that some were put-off by Unforgiven, expecting a Clint Eastwood type western.  Unforgiven really isn't a typical Western...it is more a character study wrapped in a meditation on violence.<p>The violence in Unforgiven is not stylized or glamorized.  When the gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) gets the living tar kicked out of him by the sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman), he doesn't pop-up all fine an hour later.  Instead he is layed-up in a jail cell, bloody, swollen, and in pain.  When Little Bill dishes out the same to Eastwood later, William Munny is out for days and is scabbed and scarred afterward.  When Eastwood ambushes a cowboy, he dies slowly, in thirst and in pain. When Little Bill starts in on Ned, we and he know that it will be a long night of torture and pain.  When the Scofield Kid shoots a man in the privy, he is sickened by it and so should we be.<p>Violence begets more violence.  From the initial cutting of the prostitute that sets it all in motion, to the beatings and shootings, the violence here only causes more violence and most of it out of proportion to the crime and most of it, even the sanctioned violence of the Law, has little or nothing to do with justice.<p>Gene Hackman's Little Bill Dagget is a sadistic bully with a badge, his amiable facade masks a ruthless and mean killer.  The bemused twinkle in his eye can turn to a savage taunt in an instant. He enjoys beating people just a little too much, and he has the town cowed under his benevolent tyranny.  Hackman is great and deserved his Oscar.<p>The only nod to the conventions of the Western is in the last act, but we are ready for it.  As  William Munny swigs the first whiskey he's had since his wife reformed him we watch him become distant, stronger, icier and resolved, the legendary stone-cold killer we've been hearing about throughout the movie is now before us and out for revenge.<p>The rainy ride into town and the total surprise of the laughing and confident posse-in-the-making, the cool malevolence... &quot;he better arm himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend&quot;... and the chaotic, awkward, chance and luck shootout that kills the guilty and the innocent indiscriminately, caps the theme of the film... &quot;deserve's got nothin to do with it&quot;.  Violence is just violence, it is haphazard and unfair.  It isn't pretty and it isn't justice.<p>And killers leave death in their wake and go on to &quot;prosper in Dry Goods&quot;.<p>This is a beautifully realized film with a great cast. Eastwood's direction is fine.  His pacing here is deliberate, but may be off-putting to those expecting a more action-oriented film.  This is a mature work, it improves on repeat viewings. Each scene fits to lay the foundation for the climactic confrontation,which is one of the best ever.  The dialogue is nuanced and revealing of character and motivation.  This is first-rate filmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>This is great filmmaking. The acting of Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Clint Eastwood is as good as these four greats can get and they are supported by a highly dedicated cast. The screenplay is perfectly written with as much memorable dialogue as some of the greatest films ever made. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest films ever made.<p>The entire film draws a clear definition of William Munney as perhaps the evilest man to ever live and what we the audience sees is a person we can relate to on many levels. In Eastwood's character we see our own darkest sides, our own mistakes and the unintended consequences that unknowingly follow our decisions.<p>At the beginning we see a struggling man looking to avoid the ways of his past, something which he may have seen as the easy road at the time but now is or has been in his self administered rehabilitation with his farm and his children. Here the struggle may be too much to handle and he justifies his decision in returning to his old ways to make it through the impoverished times that have followed his wife's death. The psychology is not obvious in this film but runs far deeper than most films by a mile. We set the stage to see an efficient assassin that has turned around return to the world he did everything to avoid, and return he does.<p>The most incredible dynamic here is that Munney is the clear villain in perspective, but that Hollywood cliche is more blurred here than any other movie I have ever seen (even the Godfather). The man we essentially find ourselves rooting against (Hackman) is a man of the law but ironically we find ourselves caring for the killer played by Eastwood. He is an anti-hero in which we must question our justification in liking him. The idea of revenge seems as natural as breathing in this setting, so we cheer as this killer steps onto his stage one last time to show his would be contenders who is the baddest cowboy of them all. It is what Westerns are all about.<p>In addition, the film appreciates the beautiful North American landscapes like very few films do and does so with brilliant artistic photography and the soundtrack's emotional one string notes add to the raw style of the film. Eastwood's direction suggests a man who truly loves the Western and he is the king of that genre...sorry Duke.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>There is no doubt in my mind that this is Clint Eastwood's best ever film effort and it is a testament to this movie's greatness that it has aged so well over the years and I'd wager will continue to do so for years to come.  The themes involved are timeless such as coming to grips with your true self, making sacrifices and hard choices for the good of your dependents, regret for life's past indiscretions, retribution/revenge and like in any true western justice meted out in dramatic fashion at the end as "good" triumphs over abject evil as personified in the form of sadistic sheriff Hackman.<br /><br />This film is so great as well because it blurs the lines between what is good and evil and does man really have the right to mete justice when as Eastwood's character so aptly puts it: "deserves got nuthin' to do with it."  Did both cowboys deserve to die or was it just the unrepentent slasher for example?  How about Ned?  Many issues such as these are addressed in this movie and because it is not just the usual cut and dried western where the lines are clear this brilliant movie that engages the viewer on a more cerebral level makes this not only an excellent western but also a brilliant film regardless of genre to be enjoyed over and over again like a true classic should.<br /><br />I've watched this film a few times and I never tire of doing so in contrast with say "Silence of the Lambs" which I watched recently and realised that it doesn't reward repeated viewing as much although I have to say I enjoyed it a lot when I first saw it for example.  This is why "Unforgiven" ranks among the top 5 films that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing though is the poor quality of the dvd.  The sound quality was okay at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround but the picture quality was very poor and certainly not commensurate with the sound quality.  The widescreen version side of the disc is the way to view it as the fullscreen side was pathetic as too much of the picture is excluded and for some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.<br /><br />I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.<br /><br />Updated 23 Aug 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of "Maverick" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>I wrestle with my mind wondering whether this is the second greatest westerb ever made or just where it sits or whether one should divide quality ratings by time period.<br />I'll just go the simple route and say that in my opinion Clints movie, The Unforgiven, sits only behind Fords, The Searchers, as the greatest western ever brought to film.<br />I screwed up and bought the DVD after seeing the movie "in house". I should have forseen the development of Blu Ray and waited. Now I am fighting with myself over whether to spring for the bucks to buy the Blu Ray version as well. Might not. Might just wait until Dish brings it to Hi def television and trap in on Tivo.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This is the greatest western I've ever seen, and on my list of the greatest movies ever made.  I am so impressed with it.  I've been watching the movies that made Time Magazine's list of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and very few of them can compare to this one, which happens to be on their list.  Their list should be honored to include Unforgiven, and not the other way around, because the Time Magazine list also includes a lot of inferior films to this one, like Citizen Kane, which can't hold a candle to Unforgiven.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a retired gunslinger raising two small children alone because his beloved wife died.  He accepts a job to kill two vicious men who mutilated a whore.  The bounty, raised by the whore's co-workers, is $1,000.  He has two other gunslingers to help with the job - Morgan Freeman and some young punk with bad vision.<br /><br />Gene Hackman plays the brutal sheriff who refuses to punish the evildoers.  He lets them go free, with a fine.  This infuriates the other whores, resulting in their offering a bounty.<br /><br />Character development and realism are two of the strongest traits of this great film.  It has a satisfying ending as well, which is important to me.  I'm not going to ruin it for you.  You've found one of the greatest films ever made.  Go get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>This isn't just a movie, it's a premium study of human nature. "Unforgiven" is a tale straight from the borderlands between good and evil.  The plot is interesting but in no way explains the film's allure.  The acting is superb and this is particularly true in regards to Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. English Bob is not on the screen long but Harris puts in a tremendous, and very memorable, performance.  Hackman's Little Bill is haunting and you'd honestly have to say that Eastwood is nearly as good as his depiction of William Munney is subtle and flawless.  The ending blazes and Clint gets in a few top notch oneliners like, "Anyone who doesn't want to die can go out the back."  Ah, this film has been great every time I've seen it.<br /><br />Was this one the last of the great westerns?  Yes "Unforgiven" certainly is wonderful, but hopefully it won't be one of the last of its kind.  There's still energy in this genre and I'm hoping that more movies like it are made in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>Clint fulfills the promise of his film-making expertise thus far.

So that's not the point of my review, this is not one of the more vivid looking Blu-rays i've ever seen, i'd argue that an upscaled dvd would look just as good if not better. The colors are muted, bordering on blurry, but not quite. Some scenes look ok, but compared to things like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, yes is typed that.... that movie Blu-ray looks amazingly vivid compared to this and it's an older film. So, i can't see why this looks so average?</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>"Unforgiven" is a deconstruction of the classical Western.  There are no 'good guys', only different degrees of wrong.  The killings aren't idealized.  They are the filthy business that murder always is.  Eastwood's character, Muny, is a man with a troubled past.  He was a border raider in Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War although we never learn which side he was on.  All we know is that he was brutalized and committed atrocities.  His wife, however, tried to set him straight and he makes his life as a poor and simple farmer.<br /><br />Temptation comes to him in the form of bounty money offerred for the killing of men who cut and scarred a prostitue in Little Whiskey, Wyoming.  The prostitutes couldn't get the law to arrest the culprits so they have raised money and, in so doing, they have taken the law into their own hands.  Muny, at the urging of a very young, very inexperienced wannabe gunfighter, complies.  The result is a series of brutal killings with one culprit shot to death while sitting in an outhouse.<br /><br />The local sheriff, Little Bill, is, himself, a sadistic man and exacts retribution on Muny's little gang.  Muny, all veneer of civilization now completely stripped away, exacts bloody vengeance.  It's all so very satisfying which, I'm afraid, speaks volumes about our basic human nature.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Clintwood, as director, shows that his attitudes about who we are may very well parallel those of Sam Peckinpah, as in 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' and 'The Wild Bunch.'<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The last western that can ever come to life on the silver screen. After it there will only be placebo westerns. The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquify into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation  of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne,  University Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwoods last ever western is one of the best ever made. Its not a typical Eastwood western as its take on violence and the results of violence is markedly different from the many previous westerns that Eastwood has been involved in.<br /><br />Early in the film you quickly realise that this is something completly different. Eastwood's character William Munny can't even get on a horse. This scene is the first of many with a running black comedy element. Even without that element the film has other differences, such as the fact that a lot of the characters are very simple folk and as a result use simple language.<br /><br />In 1992 this film was nominated for 9 oscars and won 4 of them. Gene Hackman who plays Little Bill Daggett (the town Sheriff) deservedly won the best supporting actor role for his performance. Like most films he appeared in in the late 1980's (Mississipi Burning being perhaps his best of the late 80's) Hackman's performance is memerisingly good and as I mentioned earlier in places there are some lovely black comedy moments.<br /><br />With Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, as well as Eastwood himself, all giving excellent performances this is a film thats worth seeing over and over. Without doubt a western masterpiece and currently ranked 117 in the IMDB top 250 films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Unforgiven is so good that its impression just might stay with you forever...that's the backbone of a real 5-star movie. Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it. It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.<br /><br />In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven. Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):<br /><br />Someone said, "Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt." And I responded,  "Those weren't movies." And someone else said, "Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'" And I said, "Okay. That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre." And the next guy said, "Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?" And I said, "Excellent point. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."<br /><br />I could ramble on and debate this all day.<br /><br />You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as "the best"; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.<br /><br />Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars. That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven. He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating. But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system. So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.<br /><br />So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.<br /><br />Unforgiven is definitely one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>This western directed by Clint Eastwood is truly one of the greats.  The story develops slowly,  the viewer learning in small bits about the main character William Munny.  The subtlety of the movie is its greatest strength.

Eastwood also won a much deserved Academy Award for best director. <p>  If you like westerns this one is for you.

Gene Hackman isn't too bad of a guy, and he does a great job of being vengeful yet calm. Morgan Freeman does a great job of backing Clint up, but Clint Eastwood is still the star. Also, English Bob was a great character, but he was mostly there to show you what Gene Hackman(Dagget) is really like.<p>As for the movie itself?

I've stated before that westerns were never really my thing, and it's not like Eastwood has a huge draw on me either.  He's serviceable at best in my opinion, only on rare occasions having his overly gruff mannerisms pay off with brilliance.  After the amazing year westerns in general had last year (`3:10 to Yuma', `No Country for Old Men' and `...Jesse James...' all making my top ten of the year) I figured that maybe I should research this Oscar winning classic to see if the films iconic status was justified.<br /><br />Watching `Unforgiven' has really made me realize that you should never judge a film before you see it, because you never truly know what's in store for you.<br /><br />`Unforgiven' opens with a sharp pain of brutality as two men victimize a woman.  When the sheriff doesn't do anything more than slap the men's wrists the women of the community put out a reward for the men's head.  William Munny, a former murderer turned caring father and widower, hears of the reward and, hesitantly, decides to pursue it in order to better take care of his two children.  Along with his former sidekick Ned Logan and an overly confident young gunslinger going by the name of The Schofield Kid, Munny makes his way into town with his horse and his gun and the smell of blood.<br /><br />Eastwood really went all out with this production.  The overall feel of the film is very gritty and dark and adds weight to the moral that is brought to the full as the curtains close so-to-speak.  The film is violent, but in a repressed sort of way, allowing the majority of the film to ride on the anticipation of bloodshed and only truly rearing its head in short explosions of brutality.  This allows `Unforgiven' to become more than just an action film or a bloodbath but creates a film that is as deep and poignant as it is entertaining.<br /><br />The acting is also golden here.  Morgan Freeman seems to just coast through his scenes, but his companionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.  He just has such a natural talent that even when he isn't doing anything exceptional he is still amazing.  Clint has never really sold it for me.  I was impressed with him in `Million Dollar Baby' because I felt as though he made his harshness work to his advantage.  He does that here as well.  Next to `Million Dollar Baby' this has got to be his finest performance.  Gene Hackman steals the whole show though as Bill Daggett, the ruthless sheriff.  His savagery is embellished by his sick sense of justification and that makes Hackman's character development nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />In the end I'm pleased to say that `Unforgiven' stands up as worthy of the praise and attention it has received.  I can't say if it was the best film of the year (92 was such a fantastic year for film) but it most definitely ranks in my top ten and surely will stand the tests of time as one of the most effective westerns of all time, defining everything that makes the genre what it is.  I may not be an avid supporter of the genre as a whole, but when a western is done right it can be nothing short of amazing.  `Unforgiven' is done very, very right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie has the whole package. If you love westerns, then this one goes to the top of the list. This is a MUST OWN, and a TRUE CLASSIC. The acting, directing, story, scenery is all A+. You can't help but like Eastwood's character and are eager to see him and Morgan Freeman ride off together to collect their last bounty. Gene Hackman's lawman is both calculating and chilling. Eastwood leaves a true legacy with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>Any movie starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris has got to be good.  But I must admit upon first viewing of this movie I was initially a bit let down.  As I watched I had trouble coming to terms with my childhood western hero Clint Eastwood being an old broken down, retired killer that couldn't even mount his own horse.  The plot is the normal revenge plot in two different ways. <p>First, the aging killers (Eastwood & Freeman) team up with a young kid who is all talk to collect a bounty on two cowboys that cut up a local woman of the night.  But when Ned (Freeman) loses the stomach for the killing he rides away.  And his caught by the Sheriff Little Bill (Hackman) and beat to death.  Upon hearing this news William Money (Eastwood) decides that it is time to get drunk and revert to the his old ways.  <p>It is here where we see the Clint Eastwood of old and the revenge style, lone wolf, western movie that made his career as he takes his revent on Little Bill and the town.  <p>The movie picked up pace about mid way and my initial let down faded fast as I realized where the movie was heading and the fact that the beginning was needed to set up the great ending.  Once again Clint has turned in a classic western. <p>The characters portrayed in this movie feel very real.  You can connect with them and sympathize with them, even when they are killing folks or being killed.  <p>A great movie and classic western!</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; contains a gritty realism and psychological insight that is distinct in any film, not just in Westerns. In this sense, the film is a tremendous accomplishment for Clint Eastwood as an actor and a director. Eastwood plays a gun fighter whose career has largely subsided as the civilizing process has begun to displace the frontier mentality in the American West. Eastwood is hired by some prostitutes to settle a score with an abusive client. He and his party gun down the person but in the process they run afoul of the town's sheriff (masterfully played by Gene Hackman) who has legally sanctioned gun fighting of any sort. When Eastwood's partner is killed by the sheriff's posse, Eastwood returns to the town and single-handedly confronts them. The battle that ensues is somewhat unrealistic (Eastwood kills several men including the sheriff) but makes sense on a symbolic level. The untrammeled spirit of the frontier confronts its civilizing nemesis and wins even as it becomes an extinct phenomenon. The intense realism and Eastwood's subtle, understated performance are what make the film work. So much of the film is presented in a plain understated fashion, that by the time we get to the symbolic conclusion we still believe it is real.<p>After the gun battle, Eastwood pours himself a whiskey with his back to the door and his unloaded shotgun under his arm as the terrified survivors of the posse hide between buildings outside. When he is ready to leave, Eastwood shouts a warning that he will kill anyone he sees and if he is opposed, he will kill the individual and his wife. He leaves the bar, mounts his horse and rides off into the darkness in full view of the terrified posse. <p>Eastwood's departure is more than just a finale for the film. As he rides into the darkness he takes with him the individual will to settle disputes with violence. The defeated and humiliated posse survives with its mandate to expropriate the individual's recourse to violence. Eastwood may have won the last gunfight, but even he cannot prevent the elimination of private justice and the state's consolidation and ownership of violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>It can be a little disconcerting, the sight of The Man With No Name tripping over pig s**t and falling clumsily off his horse.  But Eastwood is after more here than the heroic anonymity that that character afforded him.  No, his "last" Western (and I dare say this film proves that the genre is too flexible to be dead) deals with the nihilism of the old West, and the grey area between good and evil that the "new" kind of outlaw must deal with.  And how that outlaw is no longer a perfect, indestructible beast, but a man with tough choices to make.  Eastwood did a wonderful job putting all these issues up on screen.<p>Eastwood is a very interesting actor.  He really isn't technically proficient, and if he's given too much dialogue, he's liable to trample all over the reality of the moment.  But give him a chance to stare at you with those steely eyes, or answer a threat from an enemy with a simple "Yeah", and he'll knock you out of your boots.  He gives himself ample opportunities to work to those strengths here.<p>Gene Hackman, on the other hand, can put the fear of God in you with a twinkle of his eye.  I don't think this man has it in him to deliver a bad performance.  And here he gets to play the Gene Hackman role that defines all Gene Hackman roles.  His Little Bill is authoritative, fearless, feared, and especially charismatic.  Also good here are Morgan Freeman, although a tad underused in what amounts to a sidekick role, and Richard Harris as an English gunfighter whose legend may be purely mythical.  Unimpressive in the face of these acting giants is Jaimz Woolvett as the Schofield Kid.  I suppose his youthful bluster is expected, he being the new generation and all.  But his delivery felt a little too over-the-top, especially in a movie striving for realism. <p>I hesitate in praising this movie too much, for it didn't stick to its guns, so to speak.  I'm speaking of the ending, and I promise here not to reveal any spoilers.  Let's just say that if the object was to turn the Western on its head, then I don't believe that they chose the appropriate way to tie up the narrative.  That being said, what we have here is a highly suspenseful and rousing Western, albeit one where the good guys and the bad guys aren't so clearly delineated.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood directs and stars in Unforgiven.  The 1992 movie is complex, it examines what is good and evil, the viewpoints of age and youth, finding courage, doing what is important while feeling guilt and yet finding redemption through change.<br /><br />This is a Western set in Kansas and Big Whisky, Wyoming.  The opening scene is in Kansas and shows William Munny, a retired gunslinger, chasing pigs with his two young children, a girl and a boy.  Munny is also a widower and has to make do on his small farm.  He has sworn off gun-slinging and wild women to honor the love of his life, his wife who  died at age 29.  She turned his life around and though poor, he felt good about making up for his past life of violence, drinking and wild women.<br /><br />A young man on a horse comes up to Munny.  He is the Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  He has a proposal to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute in Wyoming.  There is reward money of $1,000 and they can split two ways.  Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, but realizes that it would help his children have a better future if he could afford to do something else.<br /><br />After a few days he sets off with his best friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) also a retired gunfighter.  Ned reluctantly leaves his Native American Wife, "Two Feathers" to go along on the hit.  Two Feathers is near Munny's farm and agrees to check in on his children and help when they need her.<br /><br />The trio get to the town of Big Whisky and find the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), enforcing gun control and using his power as he sees fit.  He had denied justice to the prostitutes who now want revenge and have secretly gathered the $1,000 reward money.<br /><br />Thereafter the story keeps developing with twists and turns.  The mighty win over the weak.  It is a haunting story of life's and moralities ambiguity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>I don't consider myself a particularly big fan of Clint Eastwood, at least as an actor. To me, he always seems to play the same kind of character in nearly every movie he's in. Occasionally, he'll find some fresh notes to play within his narrow range, but, despite his legendary status in Hollywood, I would hardly classify him as one of the finest actors of our time (although that probably won't stop Hollywood award shows from honoring him for Lifetime Achievement awards and such). That said, with the films that he's directed that I've seen, I'd dare to say that he might be a better director than actor. I have yet to see his most recent (and much-hyped) film MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but I was deeply sobered by his near-great MYSTIC RIVER (despite its total washout of a mystery plot), and, seeing this Academy Award-winning 1992 film recently, I was no less impressed by this film.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is as de-glamorized a Western movie as you are likely to see. There is no real nobility to be found in any of these characters the way there was with, say, Gary Cooper's Will Kane in HIGH NOON. Eastwood's William Munny, for example, is not a hero, but a broken-down, desperate man who is trying to escape his troubled past. Visually, there are some beautifully pictorial shots of the wide open spaces of the plains bathed in (rather mild) sunlight, but most of the time Eastwood and cinematographer Jack N. Green light the proceedings in a doom-filled atmosphere that might come off as heavy-handed to some, but is totally befitting its theme: how physical violence can be violent to the human soul. On the level of action, there is no exciting buildup to the final showdown, and even as it occurs, there is no glamor to be found, no catharsis. Instead of exhilaration, there is a profound note of tragedy as this film ends. A lot of action movies make you believe that taking violent revenge on someone is a satisfying way of closure. In UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood makes clear that there is no real satisfaction to be found in any kind of violence, provoked or not. This is perhaps an important film to see simply as a startling corrective to all the soulless spectacles of violence that seem to be the trademark of action films these days, movies that make you cheer violence and gets you in a sadistic mood, whereas Eastwood stresses its ugliness, both physically and mentally.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is helped immensely---for once---by Eastwood's own performance. Technically, he approaches his role in basically the same way he did with his Man With No Name performances in those Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns---tough, gruff, distanced. This William Munny is not much of a stretch for him. And yet there is an extra weariness to his performance here; you get the sense that he is trying to resist his more violent impulses, that he is always trying to tell himself, "I'm just here to get money, I'm just here to get money." Eastwood also has one scene which seems to cut through his steely persona: as he is in the midst of a delirious fever, there is a real, poignant touch of desperate emotion in his voice as he exclaims that he sees his own late wife, among other delirium-induced visions. That one scene is perhaps the closest I've seen Eastwood as an actor approach some emotion other than just anger. The other performances are good, but Eastwood's, in its own way, is rather special.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is admittedly a little plodding, but then Eastwood has never been one of those showboating directors who indulge in style for its own sake. He is more concerned with characters than with mere action here, and his deliberate approach to the material gives his themes room to breathe and grow in the mind of the receptive viewer. This is a powerful examination of the ugliness of violence, and it will certainly stay with you after it's over.

His talents behind the camera were first evident, and impressive, in Play Misty for Me (1971). Unforgiven received an Academy Award for best film, as did Eastwood for directing it. So many memorable characters which include Bill Munny (Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), Sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). What I find most interesting is Eastwood's willingness and ability to portray an old widow, far past his prime, who reluctantly agrees to accept an assignment to earn some much-needed money for himself and his family. Munny (obviously, no pun intended)  enlists the aid of his friend Logan. They are joined by the self-described "Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) and proceed to a town under the absolute control of Daggett who, unlike Brian Dennehy's character Cobb in Silverado, can be personally quite appealing but is nonetheless every bit as formidable. (I shall never forget Daggett's dying words, "But I'm building a house!") In my opinion, the plot really is not especially important. The film's greatest strengths are found within the meticulous development of various characters, a process under Eastwood's sure direction which is gradual and both subtle and substantial. Perhaps the character of journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is necessary to expedite the exposition but he seems to add little else. However, all others among the supporting cast are essential.<p>Unforgiven can be categorized as a "western" but, in my opinion, it transcends that genre as it examines how the reality of an old man's vengeance is far more significant than the myth associated with his earlier adventures. Near the end of the film, "Little Bill" must deal with a Munny who is, not with someone who once was. The fact that Munny prevails reveals much about him...and perhaps about Eastwood and others who in later life, like Tennyson's Ulysses, "strive to seek, to find...and not to yield."</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>Let me begin by saying that I enjoy Clint Eastwood movies.  It has been my observation that he doesn't make a bad movie.  I also appreciate his talent as a director; "Mystic River" is a masterpiece example of his skills in my opinion.  However, I have been puzzled by all of the accolades for "The Unforgiven".  For me it was actually a disappointment to watch after all of the advance praise I had heard.  It IS a good movie but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had seen the movie before any of it's reviews.<br /><br />The basic story is that of some prostitutes that want revenge on a man who disfigured one of their co-workers.  The town's tough sheriff (played excellently by Gene Hackman) isn't going to do anything about it so the girls offer a reward for someone who will.  A young wannabe gunfighter convinces Clint Eastwood's character to come along and cash in on the bounty.  Along the way they pick up Eastwood's old pal played by Morgan Freeman.  The movie basicly ambles on from there to the ending.<br /><br /> There is a lot of good acting and the movie does its' best to dispel the myths of the Old West by the many characters and incidents involved.  I guess that was the purpose of the movie but in the process of doing so, it seemed to want to displace excitement with boredom.  As a result, it slowed down the movie quite a bit without offering much in drama to replace the action.  Some might say I'm missing the point but I think of "Bridge on the River Kwai" as an example of an outstanding anti-war movie that still appealed to many for all the military action and drama that it offered.  Eastwood's character goes through the movie looking like he's overdosed on Valium.  His climatic finish seems only to have been accomplished by a change of depressants.<br /><br />I said that this is a good movie and I did find a lot to enjoy.  For me the best scenes were those involving Gene Hackman.  His was the strong presence that good Westerns are noted for.  Although he came across as the bad guy, his role made this movie as good as it got.<br /><br />I watched the Oscar ceremonies for 1992 and I cheered for Clint Eastwood to win the Best Actor award.  I was sorry that he didn't because it seemed like this might have been his last chance for the prize.  However, I knew that I was cheering for the actor and not for the role.  I think that the praise for "The Unforgiven" was largely for the man and not the movie.  Watch it and see for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>UNFORGIVEN is marvelous moviemaking.  Clint Eastwood's direction and performance are haunting, evocative and original.  Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in "Million Dollar Baby") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one "last" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.  Although I found the film to drag in places, it's finale is riveting and Clint is reminiscent of Dirty Harry Callahan in his showdown with Hackman.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN resurrected a pretty dead genre with this 1992 film, and its four Oscars helped plant Eastwood in the hall of great film makers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's 1992 somewhat apologetic western on crime and justice in the Old West.  Although well acted with good direction, the film lags in its rather predictable plot and suffers from uninspiring action scenes.<br /><br />The film starts with the senseless mutilation of a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey.  Anxious to keep the peace, Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman) asks the perpetrator to compensate the victim with several horses.  Humiliated and permanently disfigured, the prostitute isn't happy with the offer and raises a bounty for the death of her attacker.  With news of the bounty, widowed Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) leaves his family behind to get some badly needed money. A retired gunslinger left with a delapidated farm and a bleak future for his two children, Bill Munny returns to his life of sin one last time.  He soon joins up with his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) who's also leaving his reformed life for one final reward.  On their way to Big Whiskey, Munny and Logan are joined by The Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), a young hothead who also needs the reward. When the characters arrive in Big Whiskey, they run into gunslingers such as English Bob (Richard Harris)and the impatience of Sheriff Little Bill.  Wanting to keep the peace at all costs, the sheriff will do whatever it takes to keep hired guns out of Big Whiskey.  An unexpected incident leads to a final confrontation between the main characters.<br /><br />Eastwood attempts several things in this film with mixed success.  First, he attempts to break away from the reverse trends in westerns he himself helped form over 30 years before in Sergio Leone's action-packed films.  In those films, the West was depicted as a wasteland of shady characters who could be either villains or heroes depending on the reward: the theme was presented through symbolic action sequences as opposed to extended and unrealistic dialogues using action as only the filler scenes.  In this film, Eastwood sacrifices action for more character study found in some of the older westerns preceding Leone's: the main difference being that characters' motivations are treated with much more realism than those presented in such earlier films. In this film, Eastwood shows that all of the characters are flawed in various ways.  The bounty hunters don't really care if their cause is just as long as the reward is payed; they simply justify their motivations post factum.  The sheriff is a man with honest intentions and his actions, although perhaps varying between inadequate and extreme, are solely in the interests of the community.  All of the characters are victims of their environment who must cope with the realities they are presented with.  Even the actual victim in the film, the prostitute, is depicted as a person who suffered from the consequences of her own immoral profession as opposed to the actions of a deranged criminal.<br /><br />Although this is a good film, I found it to be overrated and  actually less creative than Clint Eastwood's other great western, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  I felt that the latter actually had more character insight and thematic depth than this film even though it didn't have as many stars.  In his attempt to be more sober in portraying the real West, Clint Eastwood seemed to fall in the same trap as earlier westerns by drowning the plot in over-the-top character/psychological studies of people who, realistically, weren't the types to intellectualize things too much. Although I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, this is one which I haven't bothered to buy for the reasons cited: I think it tends to make a better rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Like a lot of Clint Eastwood flicks, this one doesn't seem nearly as good almost 20 years after its release. Times were simpler back in 1992 when this won four Academy Awards, I guess. Today, it seems just okay, not the 'masterpiece' it was hailed as. I thought they said the same thing for "Flag of Our Fathers," or was that "Pretty Baby"? No, wait, the Dirty Harry series? Please. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the brutal sheriff trying to keep his town gun-free. Morgan Freeman plays his gentle and wise buddy role, yet again. The kid who recruits those two is awful, and has never been heard from again, as far as I know. Richard Harris is kind of wasted as Bob, a killer who gets whomped along the way. The script was supposed to be some mumbo-jumbo about the futility of violence. Whatever. The writing isn't bad, but I would not call it classic. Eastwood delivers his trademark sneers and squints, but although he is portrayed as a retired killer turned gentle hog farmer, no one will be surprised when he returns to action during the final third of the film. Still entertaining, this one. Just don't get too worshipful.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Unforgiven' is a good story which is bogged down by too much manly talk.  Gene Hackman, of course, gives the best performance as a paranoid, dictatorial sheriff of the town of Old Whiskey.  After kicking English Bob unconscious, Hackman is at his absolute scariest.  But the scenes with Clint Eastwood are boorish and embarrasing.  The worst is when Morgan Freeman asks  Eastwood if he misses sex.  It is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and bad.  The film tries to make Eastwood, who was once an assasin,  look like some born-again saint.  Although it is plausable, I found it hard to believe because Eastwood was both the director and main actor.<br />The plot is about three assasins who are supposed to to kill one man.  This man has slashed a woman's face, but wasn't punished for it.  The film has some tense moments, espicially the final shootout between one man and an entire bar full of people (even though it was very unrealistic).  'Unforgiven' has a lot of talk about past shootouts and how once Eastwood was the best dualer of them all.  Then there is more talk about some other shootouts.  Some may find that interesting, but to me it was just boorish.  See it for Hackman's performance though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Unforgiven is a strong, bleak movie. It's also a credit to Clint Eastwood's self confidence as a producer/director and ability as an actor that he cast Gene Hackman in such a showy role and then was able to stand up to Hackman's performance. For me, it was those two heavy-weight performances, balancing each other, that gave the movie its energy.<br /><br />However, like so many movies today, it is lo-o-ong. I think it could have lost 20 minutes and been an even better movie, just by trimming a minute or two, or more, from almost every scene.<br /><br />I'm not sure how vital the Morgan Freeman role is to the movie, other than providing a kind of weary humanity. He provides the excuse for Eastwood to throw off the skin of good citizen that his wife made him wear and become the killer he always was, but I think almost anything could have been used to do that. Without Freeman, I could see Little Bill bringing the madam and the scar-faced prostitute to the bar to once and for all find out where Eastwood and the kid are. They are secretly followed by one of the other prostitutes. Little Bill hits them a few times while his pals watch, then the madam loses her temper and refuses to be intimidated anymore by Little Bill's bullying. She attacks him verbally and accuses him in front of the others of being impotent whenever he has sneaked into the whorehouse. This enrages Little Bill. He grabs his whip and beats them to death in a pscho-sexual rage. The more he beats them the more he sweats and gets red in the face. It obvious he's having a sexual release while he's hitting them. Even his pals are uneasy and finally pull him away. The prostitute who had been secretly watching is horrified and scared to death. She knows where Eastwood is and goes to find him. Eastwood had sympathy for the madam and the other prostitute; he saw them as life's losers just as he was. And he decides to hell with trying to play by the rules. He mounts up and heads for the show down.<br /><br />I'm only half joking. Some sort of sexual inadequacy would help explain Little Bill's character and his need to be the alpha male. I can't remember if there was any explanation for Little Bill's behavior other than that he was just a bad guy.<br /><br />I think Unforgiven deserved the acclaim it received, and certainly Eastwood did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>This is nothing but another Western. Anyone expecting some brilliance or originality to be in sync with its Oscar win as Best Pic of 1992 will be sorely disappointed. Starts out with a gratuitously violent slashing of a prostitute and goes downhill in unpleasantness from there. I think I can guess why the Hollywood left-libs loved this enough to make it best pic: it portrays the West (read "America") as unheroic and simply violent and evil. That's the sort of garbage that the creeps in Hollywood lap up like cats to a saucer of milk. Hey, celebrities!! If America sucks, kindly return all of that money you get from us for working a few weeks a year, will ya? My feelings won't be hurt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film, I have to admit I thought it was good, but not great.  Further viewings (including a recent one) have made me changed my mind and hang my head in shame.  This is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and one of Eastwood's crowning achievements as a filmmaker and as an actor.<br /><br />The film is uncommonly dark, even for an Eastwood film.  It starts off with a brutal rape scene, and ends with a shootout.  The cinematography is masterful, arguably the best in any Eastwood film.  Eastwood's character, Billy, is really trying to go straight after spending a lifetime of killing, whoring, and maiming.  His wife is dead, his farm is failing, and he's worried about his children.  He gets a chance to get some money, but he has to find and kill the people who raped and beat up(and got away with it) a prostitute at the beginning of the film.  Over the course of the film, Eastwood's quest becomes more brutal and darker, concluding in what has to be the best, most brooding scene in all of Eastwood's work.  The final scene takes place in the bar/brothel where the rape/assault took place.  The scene starts in a wide shot, then you see Eastwood's rifle make an entrance, but it's only his rifle.  It's a brilliant entrance, one of the greatest in Western movie history, and the concluding shootout is as menancing and as cruel as the West could be.<br /><br />This film won Eastwood his first Oscar, and it's a film that deserved all its accolades.  Most Best Picture Oscar winners are rather safe and tame films, but this is one of the exceptions where an uncommonly dark film swept the awards.  It also rejuvinated Eastwood's career a bit.  He had just directed and starred in The Rookie, a film that is considered his worst film by mostly everyone, including fans (for the record, it's not that bad of a film.  Pink Cadillac is Clint's worst movie).  The Rookie was a box office and critical bomb.  So when this film appeared, it really brought Eastwood back, and he's been there ever since.  Unforgiven is considered one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and deservedly so.<br /><br />For the record, buy the 2 disc special edition DVD, not the single disc edition.  The single disc edition (which is thankfully out of print) is a very poor edition, with an unremarkable, grainy transfer, no special features, and a bizarre scene selection menu that is impossible to navigate.  The 2 disc edition has an excellent transfer of the film, several excellent documentaries, including one where we see Clint making his vastly underrated 1997 film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and an episode of Maverick with Clint in a supporting role.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>The west is revisited in this beautifully transferred HD DVD version of the Academy Award winning "Unforgiven".<br /><br />Extras include a 1959 episode of "Maverick" featuring a young Clint Eastwood - most certainly a lot sharper than seen before - this is one of the high points that add great value to this HD DVD in my opinion. Hours of other extras about "Unforgiven" and about Clint Eastwood and his career also accompany this HD DVD.<br /><br />"Unforgiven" isn't the "best" western I've ever seen, nor does it quite capture an authentic west so much as it captures a more "studio-and-costumer" west, but that's just me. It is a gritty western painted with vigilante justice of severe consequences, along with life-lessons, old-west style.<br /><br />The performances were very nice - Gene Hackman played his character well, but I didn't quite "get" him...maybe a second viewing will do the trick. The story moves along a bit slowly, but plays out effectively. I didn't get "lost" in it, but I did like it.<br /><br />The lightning is clearly a studio lamp, but the low, rolling thunder sets a nice dark mood.<br /><br />I would guess that you've got to like westerns to like this film, as it may not make you a fan of the genre on its own, as the classics might. But as far as value goes, there are plenty of extras and the movie is well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>The combination of Eastwood, Hackman , Freeman and Harris make this one of the greatest westerns ever filmed.

I despised Mystic River and I didn't get why there was so much love for Million Dollar Baby. However, most people will just end up saying "well then watch Unforgiven" so not being one to dismiss something outright, I thought sure, why not? Well I don't regret it one bit. While it's certainly a different western than others I've seen, that's kind of what makes it unique as well: a character-based study set in the West as opposed to outlaws tearing up the Wild West.<br /><br />After being ridiculed by the size of his manhood, Quick Mike cuts up a prostitute named Delilah, leaving her face scarred. Quick Mike and his partner however get punished by the town sheriff, Little Bob, by giving up some of their ponies. Outraged at the lack of severity in the punishment, the mother figure Alice gets the other women to pool their savings and offer a bounty on the 2.<br /><br />Reluctantly answering the call is William Munny, a pig farmer living with his 2 children. It's a different life for him and one he desperately needs since not only did his wife pass but he used to be a very ruthless killer once. Since the money's too good to pass up, he goes for it and along the way, he brings his buddy Ned, who's quite the sharpshooter. Only things don't go exactly as planned since not only is a no firearm policy heavily enforced but the 2 men are actually protected. For both this is not just a simple bounty and the whole thing plays out like a morality play with no clear winners.<br /><br />One thing that first hits you about the film is how untypical of a western it is. Unlike, let's say, Tombstone, this town almost seems eerily quiet and without life. There's a stillness that's new to me and I liked seeing it. Reminded me of visiting my grandparent's cabin where it was just you and nothing else. It's also perfectly shot with very lush camera shots of valleys and the skies. Also, the film doesn't really have that huge gun shootout you often see. For some, it might be disappointing since gun battles are brief and not as dynamic as say, Open Range's is or other ones. It does set the film from most other ones since there's not really a melancholy but a certain relaxed feeling or a subdued feeling rather than big dynamic Wild West gunplay.<br /><br />Acting of course is spot-on from Eastwood to Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. While Richard Harris does do a great job in his scenes, the actual character can probably be taken out and it wouldn't do a huge blow to the film. It mainly shows what happens to people who try to go for the bounty or break the no firearm policy but it's not ultimately that important. Also, there's a young sidekick William and Ned take along with them that was so irritating I wish one of them would shoot him and say "shut up already". The pacing also might get people, since as I said, it's more subdued than the more energetic Tombstone was. Besides the might-be troublesome pacing and that annoying brat, the film's quite great regardless.<br /><br />The film in a way isn't like most Best Picture winners where they're larger-than-life and big and epic but it's also well-made with surprising direction by Eastwood and a good message concerning guns. So far it's the best Eastwood film I've seen although I haven't seen Flags or Iwo Jima yet.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>If there's redemption in this movie, it is for the viewer!<p>Each and every character in this film has his or her motive for doing the things that lead up to the brilliant finale.

This west is a bleak moral vacuum, a place of anxious sized-obsessed men and violently determined women, where the creed of the cowboy gives way to the creed of the gangster. Villains aren't challenged to duels of skill, but slaughtered as they try to surrender. Virtually every man dies unarmed. The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi. It's a world in which nobody wins, "we've all got it coming", and no one is forgiven.</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p>Eastwood has turned in a good Western here, even though the theme is anti-Western, and he plays an anti-hero.<p><p>The plot is well covered by other reviewers.

He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and a wanna-be gunslinger named &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett). The three set out to Big Whiskey, Wyoming where a group of prostitutes are seeking revenge for one of their own that gets raped, and cut up extremely bad. &quot;Little&quot; Bill Dagget ( Gene Hackman)is the sadistic and corrupt sheriff of Big Whiskey, and is desperate to keep bounty hunters from collecting on the money that the prostitutes are offering. English Bob(Richard Harris), is a legendary gunfighter who rides into town, and is also looking to collect on the reward. English Bob just happens to be an old rival of &quot;Little&quot; Bill's, and Bill is looking to make an example out of him. But the real focus of the film is on Will Munny, and the conflict that he must face within himself. As the story unfolds, Munny tries to convince himself that his return to the life is just temporary. But the consequences of his actions, could last him a lifetime... <p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood succeeded on both sides of the camera with his role of William Munny, and his direction of the film. However, Eastwood is not the only reason for the film's success. The rest of the cast could not have done a better job. Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, and Richard Harris all give amazing performances. However the standout performance of the film goes to Gene Hackman as the sadistic sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot;. It is one of the best performances of his career. The musical score is haunting as well as beautiful, and it really drives the film. The cinematography is amazing as well. Everything about the film is perfect. The film was winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Clint Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor- Gene Hackman. <p>I was overjoyed when the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD was released. The extras are worth the price alone. Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, as well as commentary from Eastwood and his biographer Richard Schickel. Disc 2 brings 4 outstanding documentaries which includes interviews with the entire cast, the making of the film, and a lot more. There is also an episode of the TV show &quot;Maverick&quot; co-starring Clint Eastwood. The movie was already a must have on its own. But now with the 10th Anniversary Special Edition, there is no way that you can afford to pass it up!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>If I was forced to give one word reviews of everything else I everything else I read, see, hear or play from here on in, that is the one word I would use for Clint Eastwood's incredibly compelling western &quot;Unforgiven.&quot;  To date, it is the most story driven, theme driven and character driven film I have ever seen, western or otherwise.  Beginning with an intense knife attack in a whorehouse and ending with a final, soul-wrenching showdown between Eastwood and Gene Hackman (who won an oscar for his trouble), the film never lets up on its sheer dramatic force or its provoking moral play on violence and its inevitable consequences.<p>Clint Eastwood plays a hog farmer named William Munny, now leading a relatively normal life after decades of being a feared and remorseless bounty hunter, with his loyal partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  But Munny now is down on his luck, with the farm struggling.  When a chance comes about for a $1000 bounty put up by angry prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Munny and Logan take up the offer, along with a green but eager fellow hunter (Jaimz Woolvett).  Meanwhile, in Big Whiskey, the town sherriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) has put a ruthless lid on the bounty, and beats up an old rival who comes looking for it, English Bob (Richard Harris) who by the way shoots chinese men working on the railroad for kicks and giggles.<p>When I first learned &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was garnered with best picture and best director oscars, I thought it had something to do with Eastwood being the old vanguard that he is and not so much talent oriented.  I could not have been more wrong.  Eastwoods' direction is outstanding, building scenes of dynamic character development with the hand of a skilled craftsman.  Every extra, every flat and otherwise unimportant chracter shows real, human emotion on their face, which is something I have never quite seen on screen before. Eastwoods' direction is aided by excellent, oscar-winning film editing.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a prime example of direction and editing working off each to mold scenes of true power, and give the viewer a real sense and feel for the surroundings.  And the film is beautifully shot in the stunning scenery near Alberta, Canada.  Filmmaking doesn't get much better than &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and Eastwood is far more than just Hollywoods' old vanguard.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>That's how I would describe &quot;Unforgiven&quot; -- as hard as the title implies. It's a classic, no doubt, every bit as good as Eastwood's other great film, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&quot; maybe a little better.<p>It's taken me years to fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of this movie. Eastwood himself refused to make it until after he'd reached a certain age, and it takes a certain level of maturity to accept that this movie HAS NO HEROES, that it is about death and dying, that it is about a way of life that has long vanished ... a way that, in the hardboiled view of this movie, wasn't all that great to begin with.<p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the few successful films that has no sympathetic characters. Eastwood's William Munny is a criminal, a thug whose late-in-life recognition of his own dastardly deeds does not necessarily clear him of them (hence the title). His buddy, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is no saint either, simply too old and guilt-ridden to live the outlaw life any longer. Likewise, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett, and whatever happened to him?) is the cowboy equivalent of a punk, a gangsta wannabe with more mouth than guts (he's the only character in the movie to experience a moral revelation).<p>Which brings us to the &quot;bad guy,&quot; Little Bill Daggett, played with clear-eyed hate by Gene Hackman. What a complex character. The guy just wants to build a house and watch the sunset over his coffee. He can't hammer two nails into a board. He wants law and order in his frontier town, and he'll get it if he has to beat a man to death. He's cowardly -- once he's disarmed a man and surrounded him with trigger-happy &quot;deputies,&quot; then he lets fly with his fists -- but maybe he's just playing a dangerous game the smart way. And he is smart. Smarter than Will Munny, only not quite as lucky.<p>Let us not forget the prostitutes who set the plot in motion. Strawberry Alice seems to desire bloody revenge far more than Delilah, the girl whose face is slashed by the cowboys. All of the women in the film are hard, brutal, deceptive, obsessed with avenging themselves of the very livelihood that pays the bounty. Not a likeable or sympathetic character in the bunch.<p>Finally, there's English Bob (Richard Harris). Eastwood establishes that he's come to Big Whiskey for the bounty so subtly that, believe it or not, I missed it the first time I saw the movie. (Maybe it's a little too subtle -- no dialogue refers to his motivation.) English Bob gits the tar whupped out of him, but he's not a good guy, just a &quot;living legend&quot; whose legend has finally caught up with him.<p>There is a journey in the movie, but it's an anti-heroic journey with only one outcome: that Will Munny will actually lose his battle with his demons and commit murder in exchange for filthy lucre. (The character's name is not a coincidence.) Not exactly a healthy outlook on the human condition.<p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is what certain critics mean when they describe a movie as &quot;dark,&quot; only here the description actually applies. It is dark, and it does not contain a glimmer of hope for anything or anyone. &quot;Deserve's got nothing to do with it,&quot; Munny tells Little Bill. And yet everybody in the movie gets exactly what they deserve ... including Will Munny, who's left alone with the demons of his past.<p>The movie is great precisely because of its pessimism; I don't know another way to put it. It is the death of the Western; it is also sad and moving, physically beautiful and vividly acted. Ten years ago, I sorta kinda felt &quot;Unforgiven&quot; didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar. Now I sorta kinda feel that it's too good for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Recently I bought the blu-ray of this film.  I had forgotten what a really excellent movie it is -- dramatically as well as visually.  I can see now how it deserved to win the academy award for best picture.  I  noticed that it was photographed using Panavision equipment.  I certainly hope the Panavision corporation is able to resolve its current financial difficulties.  I would hate to see the loss of a corporation that contributed so much to the technical excellence of motion pictures.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Unforgiven earned a #98 spot on the initial AFI top 100 listing and moved up to #68 in their 10 year anniversary revote. It well deserves this ranking, if not a higher one. The movie features stellar acting, amazing dialogue, gorgeous landscapes, and a compelling story of a gunfighter who is trying to "do right" and leave behind his previous life of violence.<br /><br />Eastwood is only lured back into strapping on his guns because his children are near starving, and the cause is just - a prostitute was cruelly sliced up by a cowboy. He enlists friend Freeman to help him with his task. Hackman and Harris are superb as other gun-wearing characters in this investigation of motives and characters.<br /><br />Every person here feels authentic and real. The Sheriff wants to keep the peace, but can be a bully in his task. He has a quiet home he's trying to build, and he enjoys sharing his experiences. Freeman's relationship with his wife, the gentle way he deals with Woolvett, how he handles the shooting scene, are all amazing to watch. In each case the watcher gets drawn into what is happening through the subtle dialogue and the character's actions, rather than with bland statements found in many other westerns.<br /><br />It's interesting that I watched this back-to-back with Shane. I am still surprised that Unforgiven ranks "worse" than Shane on the AFI lists. They handle extremely similar topics - how an ex-gunfighter copes with a world that has moved on around him. But Unforgiven is full of rounded characters, of powerful dialogue, and of a world we can immerse in. When Eastwood returns home at the end, it's an extremely powerful moment, and there was a real sense of the transformation which had occurred over the course of the film.<br /><br />Unforgiven also gets great credit for how well it involves women in the storyline. Many westerns seem to feel that women were non-existent in the West, only there to be stolen by "wild Indians" or to scream in horror as their menfolk went off to do some fighting. In Unforgiven, we get a range of very powerful female characters. The main group are the prostitutes, who take a stand against being treated like property and who end up having an impact with their actions. Even Freeman's wife gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the reluctant one left behind.<br /><br />Well deserving of winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Supporting Actor for Hackman's Sheriff character. To me this is what a western should be all about. The challenges of living in a rough land, the challenges of dealing with the tumultuous societal changes that were going on, the clashes between different groups of people, and the rough, wild, fantastically beautiful scenery that it was all set in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 5/03, 6/06, 8/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />6/06: Unforgiven is possibly the last true Western in cinema history and is a perfect film for Clint Eastwood. An ode to a dying genre, Unforgiven is a poetic justice to dispel many of the misconceptions that numerous Western movies have established. I can see the blind-as-a-bat boy who fills in the place for the audience members while the old-timer veterans of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman show literally what the life in the West is truly like. This is a clear-cut difference between men and boys. I love the acting, the mood, the somber setting, and the unique story of Unforgiven. What makes Unforgiven so great is how realistic the movie feels while depending on the mystique of the legend out of William Munny, played adeptly by no one other than Clint Eastwood, while it becomes a monster in the final climax. There is a great sense of humor throughout the film. Moreover, Morgan Freeman once again proves that he makes a perfect supporting actor with Clint Eastwood. I am impressed with everything about Unforgiven, and it will stand out as one of the most enduring Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood deservingly gets recognition for this picture and also for Million Dollar Baby. I've always knew that Clint Eastwood was a true filmmaker, and this one, he proved his mark. While nobody had paid attention to this man, Jaimz Woolvett gave a standout performance as the Schofield Kid. What he did deserves accolades. All in all, Unforgiven is a genuine Western film noir.<br /><br />8/11: Nearly the last true Western made, Unforgiven rights the wrongs that many Westerns in the past have committed, further mythologizing the Old West for something that it's really not. Unforgiven boasts of an all around cast including Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman. These three are the reason why you watch the film. It is as good as it gets. More important, Clint brings a resume with him when it comes to Western films, many of them quite bad, so it is obviously he set his heart on making the best Western as possible and leave his mark in the now dead genre. One underrated performance, never lauded by anyone, is by Jaimz Woolvett as the blind-as-a-bat Scholfield Kid. It's too bad he went empty that year. All in all, Unforgiven is a masterpiece and one of Clint's usual unforgettable trademarks.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>Great movie!

I totally agree with the rave reviews of this film and it marked Eastwood as an important director to watch (witness his 2 great war films, and another Oscar winner-"Million Dollar Baby"). If you have either of the Hi-Def formats, I would seriously recommend you purchase this classic asap. By the way, when I first saw this classic in a suburban theatre, many people in the theatre clapped after it was over which goes to show you how strong a reaction this film has made on the general public!!  There are no winners when it comes to the violence within mankind!!</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>'Unforgiven' is a magnificent piece of film-making, yet a dark and troubling study in violence and machismo... It revels in memorable statements of crudeness and cruelty... Munny sums it up best: "Hell of a thing killing a man. You take away all he's got. All he's ever gonna have."<br /><br />Aided by Jack N. Green's cinematography and Lennie Niehaus's music, Eastwood gives the film an ensemble portrait of sorrowful beauty...<br /><br />Clint Eastwood shows another face of the Old West... He is perfect as the unforgiven, the stone killer, whose eyes are full of brutally painful memories...<br /><br />Will Munny (Eastwood) is a retired bad man desperate for the 'whore's gold' to save his shabby farm, two kids, and sick animals in the vast emptiness of the Colorado range... Munny had a monogamous devotion to the wife he'd lost, and is forced to confront his own past no matters how he tries to avoid it...<br /><br />Eastwood is supported by some quite outstanding character actors whose performances are impeccable:<br /><br />Gene Hackman plays Little Bill Daggett, the town sadistic sheriff who rules with an iron fist, forbidding anyone to carry guns across the town limits... He is a lawman cold as ice, who hates "assassins and men of low character." He also despises reward-chasers and tries to humiliate them, revealing their cowardice and indecision... In his judgment, he declines to punish a crime in a way that the hookers consider appropriate...<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's longtime honest partner, who ensures the compassionate balance that keeps his friend from sinking in a self-pitying haze of recklessness and bitterness, but he also launches Will into one of the bloodiest shootout in that untamed place...<br /><br />Richard Harris is English Bob, the egotistical gunfighter who desires to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him... He now lives off his publicity, and is followed everywhere by W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), a writer of books, glamorizing the cover scene for purposes involving the market place...<br /><br />Frances Fisher is Strawberry Alice, the outraged brothel's madam, who has raised, with a group of oppressed women she works with, a thousand dollars to anyone who punishes the two attackers who slash her working girl's face...<br /><br />Jaimz Woolvett is Schofield Kid, the ignorant young rider who tries to make a name for himself... He shows up at Munny's place offering to split the reward, just for killing a couple of 'no good cowboys.'<br /><br />Anthony James is Skinny Dubois, the owner of the bar and brothel, who pays good money for Delilah, and wants compensation...<br /><br />Anna Thomson is the 'damaged property,' Delilah, the pretty prostitute whose disfiguration serves as the starting point for the story...<br /><br />Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winning four major ones, "Unforgiven" becomes only the third Western ever to win the Best Picture Academy Award after "Cimarron" (1930/31) and "Dances with Wolves" (1990).<br /><br />On screen, Eastwood dedicated the film to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, his master directors and professional mentors...</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Unforgiven" took home 4 Acadmemy Awards back in 1992, is number 98 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, and is a milestone in western cinema. It's also directed by two-time Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood<br /><br />(Best Director, "Unforgiven" & "Million Dollar Baby"), who also stars.<br /><br />It also features two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman (Best Actor, "The French Connection" and Best Supporting Actor, "Unforgiven") and<br /><br />Oscar winner Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, "Million Dollar Baby"). I've never been a big fan of westerns and never really had a desire to see this movie, until I got into the HBO show "Deadwood" which made me want to look back at some western films. Well, "Unforgiven" is a masterpiece on many levels...Not just as a western. As scripted by David Webb Peoples, "Unforgiven" opens as two men viciously cut a prostitute's face with a knife in the town of Big Whiskey. When the sheriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) shows up he hands down their punishment. Give the owner of the house a few horses. Outraged, the prostitutes begin to offer men $1000 dollars to kill the men who did it. Jump over to Kansas and we meet Bill Munney (Eastwood, in one of his best performances), a former outlaw, who has changed his ways since getting married. But, now, his wife is dead and he's left with his two young children. One day, a kid (about 20) shows up at his house identifying himself as The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The Kid tells Bill about the prostitute's offer and asks Bill to be his partner; Bill quickly turns him down, but eventually changes his mind and rides out into the country to catch up with the Kid. Along the way, Bill stops at his old friend Ned's (Freeman) place and Ned joins him. The late Richard Harris co-stars as a killer-for-hire named English Bob, who's character pretty much could've been erased. Anyway, this movie is probably my third favorite film directed by Eastwood; It's right below Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie is entertaining, dramatic, and features Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman giving some of the best performances of their careers. The chances of someone being disappointed with a film like this are very slim; this is just really one of the great movies of the last 20 years.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is the best western made in the last 30 years.  Grim and gritty, it is perfect for an older Clint Eastwood.  I own the dvd, and yet I still stop and watch it every time I flip through the television and find it on somewhere.  This is how all films should be made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>Clint Esatwood's masterpiece of film making give's us a look into the world of the charactor that he brought to life in the 60's,70's, and 80's. Basically the lead, William Munny,is no different than the Man With No Name that Eastwood gave us in his hayday. We get to see life after gunfighting.<br />  Eastwood's Munny is an ex outlaw who goes out for one last run when a bounty is put on the head's of two cowboy's who one attacked a prostitute and cut her face. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan one of<br />Munny's partners who knew him befor Munny met his wife and changed his ways (In the beggining of the film we find out that Munny's wife has passed away).<br />  The bounty is placed by the working girls of Big Whiskey a small town run by a ruthless and very nasty sheriff named Little Bill played by Gene Hackman (Hackman would win an Oscar for the role). We see just how nasty Little Bill can be when English Bob (Richard Harris) wounders into town looking to collect the bounty.<br />  Eastwood showed real courage by not being afraid to show his charactor as both older and flawed.<br />  One of the best thing's about this film is that you get to see the human side of all the people involved. Littler bill building a house and Munny raising pigs show just how diverse the charactors are.<br />  This film won four Oscars including Best Film Editing, Supporting actor, Best Director (Eastwood) and Best Picture. Eastwood himself was also nomminated for best Actor. If you have never seen this film don't just rent it or see it on tv go out and buy it, you'll be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>The craggy, mellowing Eastwood directs himself admirably in this first-class oater. It's scenic, true to the period and includes excellent support from Freeman, Hackman and the late Richard Harris in a particularly showy role. With the dark and atmospheric "Unforgiven," Eastwood carries on the western film tradition in winning style.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>In the twilight of Clint Eastwood's career an epiphany came to him.  The western types that he played in most of his films were essentially bad people.  This film is something of an atonement for those films.  His character, William Munney, after a life as a killer, is amidst his new life following the death of his sainted wife as an unsuccessful farmer.  Word comes to him that in a nearby town that a prostitute was mutilated by a some cowhands and a reward is being offered by her co-workers for the murder of the cowpokes.  Munney rationalizes taking up this offer by thinking that these boys are vicious and deserve to die and that doing so would not make him a bad man.  Before Munney can collect his reward, though, he has to get through the peace-loving sheriff, Little Bill, who will make sure nobody collects on the reward no matter how many beatings he has to administer.  The cynic could say that Eastwood made his bread and butter off violent western types and this is an attempt to cater to politically correct types.  I give Eastwood the benefit of the doubt here because this may be the best performance of his career and this film is so well crafted.  Gene Hackman is more than his equal as the sadistic sheriff.  The beauty of the western is that it is always being re-evaluated and this film stands at the top of the list of great westerns.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Hard to put Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman together in a movie with a moral issue at stake and not come up with a sure winner. And that?s what The Unforgiven is: a winner. Hackman plays the sleazy and sadistic local sheriff of Big Whiskey, a town somewhere in the outback of Wyoming where the local prostitutes are determined to seek revenge on the guys who maimed one of them - and they've pooled their savings and have offered a bounty. Eastwood and Freeman, old partners, have retired but, down on their luck, they are persuaded by circumstances to take aim on the bad guys one last time. Then, when they meet Hackman's style of resistance, it becomes bigger than just a bounty hunt; it turns into the usual Eastwood confrontation: Good vs. Evil.<br />A winner, not to be missed. All the Academy Awards it won were not a mistake.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Unforgiven (1992) won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor, and Editing).  Directed by Clint Eastwood, this western stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher, and Anna Levine.<br /><br />Gene Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett.<br /><br />There have been so many great reviews written, so I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />The story itself is intriguing.  It's basically about two retired outlaws who come out of retirement to collect a bounty.  A group of prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming offer $1,000.00 to anyone who can kill two cowboys that had disfigured one of the prostitutes.  The local sheriff does not like what's going on, as he does not allow firearms or assassins in his town.<br /><br />In Kansas, William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is visited by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who tries to recruit Munny to kill the cowboys.  Munny recruits his old riding partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  Together they head west to Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Do they get the job done?  Watch to find out.<br /><br />The atmosphere and feel of the Old West town was captured very thoroughly, as was the scenery of the western U.S., particularly the mountains of Wyoming.  This DVD's clarity is outstanding.<br /><br />The best acting comes from Gene Hackman, in my opinion.  He plays a mean and heartless sheriff very well.<br /><br />All in all, a great western movie that's a little different than typical westerns.  This one is more realistic, darker, and the characters have a lot of depth to them.  They definitely aren't shallow characters.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>I'm not certain how much I would like "Unforgiven" if I had never seen a Western before.  I suspect I would still consider it a masterpiece.  But approaching it from the perspective of decades of watching "Cowboys and Indians", I view Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner as one of the most important achievements in film history.<br /><br />Eastwood created the Man With No Name personna in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, masterpieces that changed the genre.  But Unforgiven elevates "The Western" to a level I think will never be approached again.  "Unforgiven" is to The Western as "The Godfather" is to the gangster movie.<br /><br />In old Lone Ranger era Westerns the hero wore a white hat and dispatched bad guys in morally unambiguous gunfights.  By the end of John Wayne's career in cowboy pictures heroes weren't as clearly defined. In pictures like "The Searchers" and "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" the heroes had skeletons in their closets. Then Leone's films made the West seem an even grittier, sweatier place, and there was more than a little anti-hero in the leading characters.  Still, gunfights happened quickly and the winner was always a dead-eye who could shoot the wings off a gnat at a hundred paces.  The losers of gunfights fell quickly and silently to their death.<br /><br />In Unforgiven Eastwood gives us a vision we can imagine as closer to the truth.  His character William Munny was once "a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition," as we're told in the opening title card.  We learn Bill Munny was once the most dangerous of a group of outlaws in hints that are given leading up to the climax.  But Munny has been changed by marriage.  His comely wife has died of smallpox, leaving him a poor pig farmer with two children.  He hasn't shot at a man in eleven years.  We can feel his struggle for redemption.  In addition to giving up his previous life as a criminal, he has stopped drinking and, when given the opportunity at a woman younger and prettier than him, he declines out of respect for his dead wife.<br /><br />But Bill Munny's demons are old and powerful.  A group of prostitutes pool their money and spread the word that they'll pay a bounty for the death of a bad-tempered cowboy who cuts one of them. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, who has heard of William Munny and how he was the meanest cold-blooded killer alive.  Munny initially declines the Kid's offer, but the Munny family is poor, and the prostitutes' bounty is tempting.<br /><br />Bill rounds up old partner Ned Logan, played by the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.  You get the feeling that Ned wasn't as bad as Munny in the old days, but you also get the idea that Ned isn't as "reformed" as Munny.<br /><br />Gene Hackman gives a superlative performance as Little Bill Daggett, the Sheriff of the town with the prostitutes.  In an early scene Daggett beats bounty hunter "English Bob" (played by the late, great Richard Harris) half to death, and vows to do worse to any other bounty hunter's seeking the "whores' gold".<br /><br />Unforgiven re-writes the legend of the west.  Shifting shades of grey replace black and white.  The Man With No Name could shoot a gnat mid-flight, but William Munny takes shooting practice at a tin can with a pistol, misses several shots, then finally dispatches the can with a shotgun blast. The gunfight losers in old school westerns did their dying quickly and quietly, while a victim in this film dies slowly, in agony and begging for a drink of water.<br /><br />In an expository scene halfway through Hackman explains to a hack writer (acting as a one-man Greek chorus and wonderfully played by Saul Rubinek) that the stories of famous gunfights that circulated among taverns and dime novels of the day were wild exaggerations made up by the survivors to make themselves look faster and deadlier and more noble than they really were.<br /><br />Eastwood gives a master's class in film story-telling.  He tells us - then he shows us.  Every other Western appears a lamb-in-wolf's-clothing poser in comparison.  This film is the whole Wolf, and makes no apologies about it. If a greater Western than "Unforgiven" is ever made - I can't wait to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Wow.  Does this epic, award-winning Western look and feel like the real deal.  It's gritty, rugged, brutal, dirty, inhumane--yet tender and poignant when it needs to be.  You can't beat Clint Eastwood as both actor and director; fellow cinematic heavyweights Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris give UNFORGIVEN plenty of star power.  And the story--a former bounty hunter coming out of retirement to avenge the disfigurement of a working girl--is as compelling as the day is long.  So what is it about UNFORGIVEN that so disappointed me, and continues to disappoint each time I pull up a chair to watch this very well-made film?<br /><br />Dichotomy.  It's a trait we all possess, to some degree.  It's certainly present with Hackman's character as Sheriff Little Bill Daggett--a dedicated public servant on the one hand and brutal thug and bully on the other.  That's a character contrast that's believable; we can see, and understand, both sides of the coin Little Bill represents.  But Eastwood's character presents a whole new set of problems (for me, anyway).  Bill Munny is a quiet, soft-spoken, gentle widower with two young children.  From his mannerisms it becomes evident he wouldn't harm a fly; he reluctantly agrees to accept the bounty because he's so desperately poor, but approaches the job with dread and despair.  As this film moves to its violent climax the viewer is treated to such a transformation of Bill Munny that I was unable to suspend disbelief.  The wild-eyed, almost evil incarnate killer Munny became was simply too much--even after he was so savagely provoked.  Thus I was aptly disappointed in UNFORGIVEN, a great visual epic with too much to digest.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br></body></html>

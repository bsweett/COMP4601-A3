His 'honest' straight-to-camera commentary depicted a man at odds with himself and what he called the human world; however, the irony that Treadwell died at the paws of those he was trying to 'protect' was not lost on the local National Park inhabitants, who felt that Treadwell was only dicing with death in getting so close to the grizzlies. Treadwell was obviously in love with himself more than his hairy friends; at times he worries more about his receding hair line than the bears themselves, and he feels no embarrassment in boasting that "I am a kind warrior" Director Herzog edits footage of Treadwell's documentaries with his own interviews to piece together a character of a man who tried all his life to be someone else.  Treadwell travelled around schools showing his footage to school children while never once soliciting a fee - and his skills as a documentary maker, as Treadwell's footage boasts coverage that studio directors with union crews wouldn't have got. Grizzly Man is a captivating and intriguing documentary, and a thought-provoking insight to one man's struggle - the shame is that the real struggle is with reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This documentary really stays with you, it is quite disturbing.  Timothy Treadwell seems to be manic, it's really the only was to explain his actions, that and he at first seems to have a death wish, then it like morphs into a serious mesiah complex, it's hard to watch him deteriorate, you want to look away.  Director Herzog, interjects himself into the film and he becomes a character as well, and I was not sure about it at first, but when he listens to the audio of Treadwells death, you could tell that he was truly shaken and deeply moved by what he heard and his decision not to air it, reinforces this.  The interview with Treadwell's parents was heartbreaking, watching his mom clutch his childhood bear that he had with him up until the end, shakes you to the core.  This is a unique documentary, since the subject is actually a sort of co-documentarian...this is really well done, he must have been shocked that one of his beloved Grizzlies would turn on him, that must have felt like the ultimate betrayal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>I would take issue with reviewers who characterize Herzog as being generally sympathetic with Timothy Treadwell.  I believe that Herzog regards Treadwell in much the same way he regards Klaus Kinski --- remarkable in one sense, but ultimately an impossible human being.  Herzog's veiled references to Kinski (during Treadwell's extended, profanity-filled rant about the Park Service) are hard to miss if one knows the background.  Herzog admires Treadwell as a film-maker, one craftsman to another, and there is no denying that much of Treadwell's footage is quite remarkable.  However, it takes a rather skewed perspective to believe that Herzog has taken up Treadwell's banner in any sense.<br /><br />Herzog makes clear that his view of nature differs sharply from the fantasy-land notion of nature that Treadwell constructed in his mind.  It is one of the few occasions that Herzog goes on record as specifically disagreeing with Treadwell, but Herzog's choice of footage allows Treadwell, through word & deed, largely to damn himself.  It should obvious to almost everyone that anthropomorphizing bears & foxes really isn't a very good idea at all, on multiple levels.  Treadwell's almost-disbelieving response when he finds animals killed, not by the poachers he was convinced were hidden in every copse, but by other animals, makes it pretty evident that his view of Benign Nature was largely divorced from reality.<br /><br />Herzog also observes that while Treadwell may have been dwelling in some type of Make-Believe Nature World, he was nonetheless quite canny and aware of the image he had carefully constructed and contained.  The conspicuous absence of the assorted girlfriends who accompanied him, as well as the multiple well-rehearsed takes and framing of shots, shows a man who had a very clear idea of what he was doing...at least on one level.<br /><br />Ultimately, what this film left me with was Herzog's examination of ego run amok, leading ultimately to a self-ordained destruction.  To me, Treadwell never seemed to approach fulfillment or anything approaching happiness, and don't think Herzog sees this in Treadwell either.  One is left then with an ego-driven belief in one's own importance and imperviousness, and where can that lead but hubris?  Even without knowing the background of Treadwell's story, one is certain from the first frame that Treadwell is screwed big time.  It isn't a question of things ending up badly; we've seen this before from Herzog.  It is the journey to the ultimate disaster which interests him.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog takes a long, unflinching look at Timothy Treadwell, the aggressive conservationist who pitched a tent in the wilderness with grizzly bears for the better part of his life. Treadwell is a fascinating character, almost inhumanly naive and childish but also extremely knowledgable in the actions of wild animals and the demands of life in the wild. Ultimately he allows his passion to get in the way of good judgment, as he madly rails against new park regulations installing a hundred-yard cushion between man and bear just weeks before becoming grizzly food himself, but there are both positives and negatives to take away from the story. His interactions with wild foxes make for some charming, amazing asides, and the unique perspectives afforded by his lifestyle share an intimate peek into the tendencies and temperament of grizzlies at their least guarded. As a naturalist he's without many peers, but unfortunately he's equally unrivaled as a cautionary tale regarding the volatile, unpredictable disposition of the untamed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>"Grizzly Man" is a powerful movie by Werner Herzog, a movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell, who hardly needs a closer introduction. Treadwell lived around brown bears in Katmai (a national park in Alaska) for thirteen seasons in a row, somehow getting the wild bears to tolerate his presence. He became a national celebrity in the United States, claiming to defend the bears from poachers and other threats. In 2003, tragedy struck: Treadwell and his companion Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by brown bears as they were camping in an area Treadwell called the Grizzly Maze.<br /><br />Herzog's movie paints Treadwell as a loner who gradually looses grip on reality and rejects Western civilization as he becomes more and more obsessed with the bears. Treadwell wants to bond with Mother Nature, unable to realize that nature is chaos and brutality rather than love and harmony. Eventually, he looses it completely, and develops a veritable death wish. "Grizzly Man" implies that the death of Treadwell at the hands of a bear might actually have been a form of suicide. To Herzog, Treadwell is an idealist who crosses the line between beast and man, and gets punished for it. His destruction is seen as inevitable. In a sense, Timothy Treadwell becomes the New Age version of Aguirre.<br /><br />I don't deny that the movie is captivating and the message powerfully delivered. But is it true? Probably not. Here and there, another possible explanation for Treadwell's behaviour emerges: he had a celebrity complex and wanted to shoot a sensational film, with himself as the lead actor. Judging by Mike Lapinski's book "Death in the Grizzly Maze", this comes closer to the truth. Frankly, I suspect Treadwell was something of a con artist. Where Herzog saw a man slowly descending into madness, I see an actor playing out a part. The man may have been "nuts" in the everyday sense of that term, not to mention reckless and irresponsible, but I can't find any evidence of a death wish in Lapinski's book. Still, even Lapinski is willing to concede that Treadwell might have suffered from a clinical condition, bipolar disorder.<br /><br />Ultimately, of course, everyone must make up his or her own mind about Timothy Treadwell. "Grizzly Man" is a good place to start. Then, read Mike Lapinski's "Death in the Grizzly Maze", Nick Jans' "The Grizzly Maze" and Treadwell's own book "Among Grizzlies".</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Herzog has a certain vision of life.  It is nakedly brutal, raw in its rapacity and ambition, and ruthlessly egotistical.  These themes occur in all of his fictional films, perhaps most successfully in Aguirre.  Well, here he had found a remarkable subject, the Grizzly man, who left a record of his unusual life and even of the moment of his death.<br /><br />He started out as a misanthropic alcoholic, failing at everything he tried, but with the ego to push forward.  Believing that he found something in nature and the most unpredictable predator of all, the grizzly bear, he carved a unique niche for himself as an educator and conservationist.  In this, he was a pioneer, in his attempt to breach the barrier between man and bear that had stood for 7000 years, bringing back a film record of his adventures and stories to enchant children and adults alike.  Though a failed actor, he developed a persona and ideals that he claimed saved him from drinking himself to death.<br /><br />But something far darker lurked beneath the surface, which perhaps Herzog was the best person to plumb.  Herzog gained access to his film archive of hundreds of hours of revelatory solitary conversations, statements, and images.  He went over them carefully and pieced together a record of wonderfully human complexity, showing a conflicted man who was deluding himself as to the nature of the world (at least as Herzog sees it) and creating an act for his career as well.  Herzog also interviews many friends, family members, and critics, to gain a full perspective on a life at the limits.<br /><br />While critical, Herzog was also deeply respectful of the talents and drive of this man, which is one reason why he did not include the footage of his death for consumption by a bear.  I thought that he chose to respect the proper distance and discretion in his approach, which he did not overtly use to titillate the macabre minded.  It is a difficult balance brought off perfectly.<br /><br />If you are a Herzog fan or seeker of starkly unromantic realism, this film will fascinate you.  Many will disagree with his conclusions, but no one can ignore this masterpiece.  Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Timothy Treadwell spent 13 years among grizzly bears in Alaska with his video camera before he was killed by one of them.  A recovering alcoholic who never fit in human society, he found meaning living with the bears, whom he loved for the romantic characteristics that he projected upon them.  He saw the bears as beautiful and authentic and believed that he had a genuine connection with them.<br /><br />How ironic and interesting that the filmmaker who presents and shapes his footage is Werner Herzog.  Treadwell captures Herzog's sympathy because his crazy obsession to confront nature is so similar to that of many Herzog protagonists in other films.  Yet, where Treadwell saw beauty, Herzog sees only cruelty and chaos.  Nevertheless, he seems to respect Treadwell's compulsion and presents his story with great sympathy.  He also admires Treadwell as a filmmaker, and we are treated to many extraordinary images.  After listening to the tape that recorded the deaths of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard, he tells the woman who owns the tape, a close friend of Treadwell's, that she must destroy it and never listen to it.  This is far more affecting and dramatic than any voyeuristic thrill the viewer might get from actually hearing the horrible sounds.  This is an extraordinary and unusual nature documentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Grizzly Man is Werner Herzog's 2005 documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a man who spent 13 summers in a National Preserve in Alaska living amongst grizzly bears. At the end of his 13th summer in 2003, Timothy and his girlfriend were killed by a bear. Whether you like Treadwell or not, Herzog has crafted a fascinating documentary about the man who filmed his exploits over the course of his thirteen summers at the preserve. Herzog blends over 100 hours of Treadwell's footage in with interviews of people who knew him or knew of him. This is a Herzog film, so some of these people (notably the coroner) stand out as being a little quirky but you might not notice then when seeing footage of Treadwell.<br /><br />Clearly Treadwell's passion and disregard for the dangers involved are what attracted Herzog to this project, as Herzog is known to be a very passionate man who disregards things that stand in his way. Through this footage and interviews with his close friends, we can deduce that Treadwell was a troubled man-child, slightly delusional but very passionate about the bears that he lived amongst. Deep down he was a good person, but a flawed one. When not at the preserve, Treadwell would tour schools and (free of charge) share his interaction with grizzly bears with schoolchildren. My own personal opinion of Treadwell is one of mixed feelings. It's hard to defend the sanity of someone who gets excited over bear excrement, but I admire his dedication (no matter how flawed it was) and in a way I find him an inspiring figure. Treadwell, in his footage, speaks frequently of death and how living amongst grizzly bears could lead to him dying but he seems okay with that. Although not on the DVD edition, but in the film at one point, Treadwell was interviewed by David Letterman who asked him if we would go on to read an article about how he'd been eaten by bears, a question he took with denial and good-humor. Love him or hate him, Treadwell died doing something he loved and was passionate about. How many people can you say that about? Unfortunately, Treadwell's girlfriend also perished in this mishap and, while this film does little to enlighten us about her story, she seemed more passionate about Timothy's passion than she did about bears making her seem even more tragic.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Herzog is his wonderful German-accented dialect and emotionless delivery. Herzog has never been a conventional filmmaker and while his narration serves to inform us of the background of several scenes, he also uses it to give us his own perception of Treadwell. What no one can deny no matter what their thoughts are on Treadwell and his cause is that the man obtained some beautiful, ethereal footage. As Herzog puts it (and I'm paraphrasing) `No studio director could hope to capture images as beautiful as Timothy did.' Scenes such as a fox trotting up to Timothy unannounced in the middle of his monologue and a scene of two bears fighting achieve a very rough, real beauty that you can't find in even the most stylized, high-budgeted nature documentary.<br /><br />Herzog's Grizzly Man is a great achievement in documentary filmmaking and one of the most accessible documentaries I've seen. Herzog takes Treadwell's footage and makes something exquisite out of it that I doubt Treadwell ever envisioned possible. While Treadwell reached a tragic and (no pun intended) grisly end, Grizzly Man is a very humorous documentary that treats its subject with both skepticism and respect. It's ultimately a haunting film and many images will likely remain with you. In the last bit of footage shot mere hours before his death, Herzog helpfully points out that Treadwell "seems hesitant to leave the frame of his own film" and watching the scene, I saw no reason to argue with him. Anyone expecting to see a video of Treadwell's death will be disappointed, as only audio exists and Herzog declines to use it in the film. While people are naturally fascinated by the morbid, we are told what happens on the tape so many times that Herzog's reaction to listening to it on-screen is effective enough to get the point across. While people may question the authenticity of the interview segments due to the strange, eccentricities of the people interviewed, my simple response would be: That's a Herzog film for you. Overall, it's a documentary that's not to be missed as it's a poignant, haunting, funny, and depressing film about a delightfully weird man who did what he loved to do and whether or not he was wrong or right to do so, he's a fascinating person that deserved this great documentary about him.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I think this whole movie had a sick feel to it, and it's fitting it did. It also was marketed in an exploitive way, with the cover art to the DVD reflecting that. There's no easy way to sum up the doomed Tim Treadwell and his brave, foolish, desperate, crazed, idealistic visits to the fatally-attractive "Grizzly Maze" in the Alaskan wilds, so I'll leave further analysis to others. What I will simply say here is that this documentary, assembled as I'm sure everyone knows, from the footage Treadwell left behind after his 2003 mauling death, makes for the sort of film you watch closely despite somehow not wanting to. The scenes captured are stunning and unlike anything one would expect to see, as Tim Treadwell lived among grizzly bears in their native habitat. We observe Tim sitting calmly within a few yards of bears as they eat, fight, rest, and at times investigate Tim right back.  I was struck at Treadwell's demented courage, even as I shook my head at his naivet&eacute;, for he somehow seemed to believe the love he felt for these beasts would shield him against them. He spoke openly of the possible consequences of what he was doing but then again he so anthropomorphized the bears with sweet pet names that it was as if he never truly thought a violent end would ever come. Finally two concluding observations. One is I think more time should have been allotted to Amie Huguenard, who also died in the bear attack on that awful day, and secondly, German filmmaker Werner Herzog was probably the best possible individual to have combed through Treadwell's confessional-like footage in order to create this morbidly voyeur-esque tribute to a unique man who could rightly be described in many contradictory ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>So were some of the final words spoken by Timothy Treadwell and recorded by his own video camera in a documentary wherein most of the brilliant footage was shot by the deceased. Let me say at outset that this is an absolutely magnificent film. Its excellence is rarely encountered. Indeed, it is one of the few documentaries I ever longed to play a second time after it finished.<br /><br />Treadwell was an environmental activist, and also, as his narrative makes clear, a very emotionally disturbed person. He failed at making it in society so he turned to the wilderness and the world of the "misunderstood" bear as a means to find fulfillment. He went to Alaska every summer to "save them" from poachers, but, as an authority stated, the animals were not in need of saving. Their population was so robust they needed to be culled by hunters each year. That the bears somehow needed Treadwell is just one of the many lies this man embraced. One person phrased it aptly: "He has styled himself the Prince Valiant of the bears."<br /><br />The main character is quite pathetic, but the viewer has difficulty feeling sympathy for him due to his negligence in regards to his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. I have never encountered an individual in my entire life with a bigger death wish that Treadwell. On camera, he imagines his own death several times, yet this supposedly compassionate person stayed with his girlfriend long past the gorged days of summer, and remained amidst the bears while the desperate ones searched for any scrap of nutrients in the hopes of surviving the winter. That he had not ever remained in the grizzly maze past summer before is evidence of his scripting his own demise, and allowing Huguenard to die alongside him was despicable. I'm a very politically incorrect man, and I don't buy into female victimization as a rule-except in this case. Treadwell led the poor woman to her death. Her biggest mistake was trusting the bipolar delusionist in the first place. In the film, he makes repeated references to wishing he were a homosexual, which his words, more so than his obvious effeminacy, suggest that he was struggling with a great many aspects of life. If you ask me, had his girlfriend possessed Gaydar then her death, the only truly tragic aspect of this calamity, might not have occurred. At any rate, Grizzly Man is amazing tour de force.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>No matter how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, this documentary of his life is insightful. I had a better understanding of who he was and his passion for nature. However, in my opinion, Timothy might've accomplished more if he'd spent time with Native Americans and learned how they bond with nature without being intrusive.<br /><br />Though his heart was in the right place, Treadwell clearly made mistakes. He had a true love of animals, so I do feel deeply for his loss. I recall a kind man in Florida who loved gators and fed a young one daily. It soon grew huge and came into yards to eat family pets. It was just a matter of time before it ate a toddler, etc. and was hunted down. In many cases, we forget that wild animals are far safer if they remain afraid of humans. This movie weighs both sides of that issue without heavily blaming Treadwell for the tragedy that ended him and his girlfriend's life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>In the hands of another director (especially an American, "indie" director), this would have been a comedy.  There is a snideness that exists in "indie" films that mocks (rather severely) its characters.  They would have taken Timothy Treadwell and made him look like a fool with a snarky, snide attitude.  But Herzog isn't like that.  He treats Mr. Treadwell with a profound respect, and a genuine desire to understand him.  It's not a propaganda piece (Herzog shows that Timothy was a bit paranoid and had a dark streak), but Herzog shows respect for this man and his beliefs.  He also shows genuine sympathy towards him, like he was an outcast who could only fit in the Alaskan wilderness.  And kudos to Mr. Herzog for NOT playing the final recording of Timothy.  There would have been no reason for its inclusion, as it would add nothing except cheap shock value.  A lesser director would have made this recording (of Timothy being mauled to death by a bear) the centerpiece of his/her marketing campaign for the film.  This is a very reverential, respectful, and even spiritual film by Herzog, who is one of the greatest filmmakers ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>If I ever had any illusions about the inner nature of grizzly bears, Gary Larson's FAR SIDE cartoons ("Look! Sandwiches" on seeing men in sleeping bags) would have longsince disabused me of them.  But I don't think I ever really had any.  I mean, I sort of liked Smokey and Yogi as a kid.  And like young Timmy Dexter (aka Timothy Treadwell) I had a slew of teddy bears as a kid whom I lovee, well, ferociously.  But I still know in my heart of hearts that had I ever stumbled across a real bear in the woods in back of my house (which seemed like a possibility at the time) I would scarcely have known whether to s--t or go blind.<br /><br />Still the myth of the benign bear is a strong one in our culture.  Impressive as they are in terms of size and strength, however, their bulk and their lumbering gait suggest something half-comic, half-terrifying.  Good to focus on the later.  As this movie notes, the "native peoples" of Alaska have always respected the bear--and kept their distance.  Child man Timothy Treadwell, an interloper in them parts, has not learned that lesson.<br /><br />It is easy to see how Werner Herzog, a filmmaker already obsessed with obsessive madness, would be drawn to Treadwell as a subject.  Herzog never met Treadwell of course, and he only came to know the latter through the video footage the mad conservationist left behind.  And it is fascinating stuff.  Treadwell proves to be everything people said he was:  devoted, a little crazy, passionate, quite crazy really, child like, foulmouthed, naive and calculating--and a real loon when you get down to it.<br /><br />It's easy to see why Treadwell was such a hit at the schools he offered to speak in for free.  (But really, what were those school administrators thinking???) His childlike manner, his sense of wonder and downright zaniness might have made him the ideal kiddie show host in an era when there were actually kiddie shows.  There's something kind of Pee-wee-esque about Treadwell.  If he weren't chasing after bears every year for 13 years, you might expect to find him on a quest for his bicycle.<br /><br />But we all know that kiddie show hosts have a dark side.  And even though no one ever caught Treadwell relieving his tensions in an adult theater, his occasional sexually themed commentary shows him to be a tad on the puerile side.  At one point, he starts rambling on about how he wishes he were gay sometimes because they have it so easy (???).  Just head out to a park or beach or rest room.  A cinch.  And no pretense.  Right!  His is a remarkably adolescent view of homosexuality...and of sexuality in general, it seems.<br /><br />And like many an adolescent, Treadwell was subject to self-mythologizing.  Herzog shows how his supposedly spontaneous commentary was actually the result of several takes, 'til he got the angle and the lighting and the text just right.  Well, if you're going to be a spokeman for conservation, do it right, right?  Or at least, do it big.<br /><br />Does he really befriend these bears or is it all show.  Well, the critters he really seems to establish a rapport with are a mother fox and her offspring.  The human/canine bond is an ancient one, of course, and in the context of the film, it makes sense--even with red foxes instead of hounds.  But although Treadwell is able to approach bears astonishingly closely, they seem more bemused than intrigued by him.<br /><br />Still they put up with him--for 13 years.  And there seems to be some speculation that the bear that killed him in the early fall of 2002 was an outsider bear, his regulars having already headed off for their hibernation ritual.  If so, that would go some distance to prove that the bears he came to know did not turn on him.  At the very least, you have to admit that he pulled something off for 13 straight years.  What that says about the nature of man or beast is not clear.  But you cannot begrudge him at least some respect for going where no (sane) man has ever gone before.<br /><br />Herzog did a remarkable job, paring down the extensive home footage to make a sharp, succinct--an ultimately touching-- documentary on the life of this poor lost soul.  It's quite an achievement.  Perhaps it works because Treadwell comes across as a younger, sweeter natured Klaus Kinski in many ways.  But just as delusional and, yes, as obsessed as any played by Kinski in his Herzog films.<br /><br />Exactly a week after seeing this film, I went to a local folk concert featuring nationally known, but regionally based singer Priscilla Herdman.  At the end of the first set, she trotted out that old chestnut "Waltzing With Bears" to great effect.  Could it be that a Timothy Treadwell seriously bought into that kind of notion, so prevalent in our fairy stores and in Disney films.  I guess you do have to wonder about anyone who gives multi-ton grizzlies  monikers like "Rowdy" and "Mr. Chocolate."<br /><br />Still I was surprised to hear some audience members agree with the Alaskan local who awkwardly (more than maliciosly, really) asserts that "Timothy got what he deserved."  Yes, and smokers "deserve" lung cancer, right?  And speeders "deserve" to die in a car crash.  That scarcely seems to be the message that Herzog is putting forward here.  Nature is cruel, yes.  And the universe, indifferent.  But there is a beauty in nature that most of us only pay lip service to--or watch on PBS.  Treadwell knew that beauty better than most of us ever will.<br /><br />And no one "deserves" to die like that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>GRIZZLY MAN is an intriguing and deeply disturbing look at one young man's end of life experiences in the far reaches of the Alaskan wilderness, living, "working," and isolating himself with the most deadly creatures on Earth: the Grizzly Bear.<br /><br />Timothy Treadwell is this man, and although the documentary takes on the initial look and feel of a nature film, it is anything but. Tim, as we come to know him, is the focus of this strangely watchable documentary, inserting himself in almost every shot and speaking about how he's there to "protect" the bears (even though he spends much of his time in a National Park where they're protected anyway), to bond with them (a definite no-no as we learn through the film's machinations), and to rant about the outside world and how they (we) don't understand what he's trying to do out there.<br /><br />For those looking for a feel-good documentary about a man living with bears in a beautiful landscape, you'd best look elsewhere.<br /><br />To me, this film showed how a man with an obvious mental illness can become so obsessed with an idea ("loving" the bears) that it ends up killing him. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy nature films as much as the next person, but I think if you're looking for information about Grizzlies and how to interact with them, this just ain't the film to watch. Tim constantly puts himself in harms way and even goes so far as to take a dip (swim) with a Grizzly, and then proceeds to pet it! He turns his back on the bears and hides his tent in brambles, a risky way to camp in Grizzly country.<br /><br />The mental illness aspect of Tim's psyche was smackingly obvious to me. The man's preconceptions of right and wrong were very bizarre. Initially he praises the park service, but later rants about them and their "F-ing" policies. He becomes paranoid about everyone and everything, moving his camp into dangerous areas. He befriends every animal as if it had human qualities, even some pretty cute little foxes, and tells them how he "loves" them and won't let anything happen to them (I've never heard a man say "I love you" more often to animals than Tim). How about loving the race you belong to? You know, the human race?<br /><br />But even with all these issues, the film pulls you in in a very strange fashion, and this can be two-fold depending on your stance on certain nature issues; some (like me) wanted to scream at the screen and warn Tim about what he was doing and how it would all end if he didn't take precautions (he does get killed and eaten by a bear in the end, by the way); others might say, "go ahead, let him get killed. Who cares."</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog has made a movie that is fascinating in many ways.  While Timothy Treadwell captivates us with a natural charisma (flowing from his very deeply self-centered view of himself and the way he projects his needs into a fantasy of the world needing him), we also watch as we would watch a train wreck or a car accident occurring right in front of us.  There is the desire to not see the horror, but we can't seem to look away from something so unusual.<br /><br />Still, for me, the more interesting part of the movie was not Timothy's stated mission of protecting the bears or his death, but the way he pulled all these other people into his orbit.  Some came in because they fell to his charisma.  Others were drawn in because of services they provided him (flying, supplies, etc.), or because Timothy moved into areas of their purview (the rangers), still others had to deal with the aftermath (the coroner).  It was these professionals that seem to have the most realistic view of what Treadwell actually accomplished, which was nearly nothing beyond self-aggrandizement.  Some might claim that he made the world more aware of the Grizzly Sanctuary.  However, it is already a protected park.  The hunting and killing of the bears if carefully controlled, and despite Treadwell's claims, poaching is all but nonexistent.<br /><br />I found the scenes with Treadwell's rantings almost embarrassing to watch.  He is clearly a person with serious emotional difficulties.  His shots of the bears are often quite beautiful.  The bear fight is quite special to see, although Treadwell's post-fight play-by-play afterward is marred by his emotionalism and is almost unintelligible, but we get the gist of it.<br /><br />It is an interesting movie.  Herzog makes it a portrait of many people through their associations with Treadwell.  He even puts in his own assessment of the assessments Treadwell made of nature and the bears, but the filmmaker never judges Treadwell severely.<br /><br />It is a touching movie, and a cautionary tale of passion going over the edge.  The one thing that struck me as I watched Treadwell wishing he could be a bear was that he got his wish.  Bears sometimes eat other bears.  Timothy was killed and eaten as a bear by an old weak and starving and ill-tempered bear.  Too bad he took his girlfriend with him.<br /><br />The extras include a documentary on the making of the music for the movie.  It was basically a group improvisation over two days with Herzog himself also directing the broad outline of what he wanted while letting the musicians provide him with what he wanted.  It is a pretty interesting documentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Timothy Treadwell loved bears. He loved them so much that he taught elementary classrooms about them for free. He loved them so much that he went and lived with them in a protected wildlife preserve for 13 summers. In that 13th summer, he outstayed his welcome and ended up being killed by one of the grizzlies, along with his girlfriend.<br /><br />In the 13 summers that Treadwell lived with the bears in Alaska, he filmed 100 hours of footage. Director Werner Herzog has taken that footage, along with interviews with friends, family, bear experts, and others and pieced together the story of, as the DVD cover states "A Life Gone Wild".<br /><br />Treadwell is so eccentric that at times it feels like you're watching a fictional film where the lead character is played by Crispin Glover. The way Herzog pieces the film together makes for an exceptional viewing experience because he starts out with all the kind, childlike, sympathetic clips of Treadwell and his bears and slowly begins to insert the footage showing Treadwell's more violent, fanatical nature. As we start to see more of the other side of Treadwell, we feel the despair of having lost a kind-hearted soul to discover that he's actually an extremely off-kilter man.<br /><br />If nothing else, it can be said that Timothy Treadwell lived the way he wanted and lived where he wanted doing what he wanted. Whether he should have is another question. And it's definitely a tragedy that his girlfriend at the time, Amie Huguenard was killed with him following his mad lifestyle.<br /><br />Herzog makes the discreet decision not to play the last 14 minutes of audio clip in which Huguenard and Treadwell are heard screaming while being eaten by a bear. Herzog could have easily based his film around such shocking footage, but instead, he respectfully declined to use it, instead featuring a clip of himself listening to the footage with Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, breaking down into tears himself, and then telling her to destroy the tape and never listen to it.<br /><br />Overall, Grizzly Man is a stunning documentary that provides a brilliant study of a mentally unstable man and the effects of his life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I was fascinated by Werner Herzog's documentary "Grizzly Man" (2005) but its main character, Timothy Treadwell induced very controversial feelings. At first, I was very impressed by his love for the wild animals but further into the picture I began to understand that there was something unhealthy in his obsession, that he was deluded. He took it upon himself to "take care" of the grizzly bears, to "protect" them but I don't believe that they needed his protection. He needed them to make his life more useful and meaningful and nothing is wrong with that but in doing so he had crossed the line - he humanized them and he saw himself as the part of grizzly world. He kept repeating feverishly that he would gladly die for them and should he be killed by them he would not want any of them hurt. Well, it all ended tragically - he and his girlfriend (who joined him during the last summer) were attacked by a bear, killed and partially eaten. The bitter irony is that he had sacrificed not only himself but another human life. The bear that killed them, the very creature Treadwell was so in love with, was killed by the police the day after Treadwell's and Emmy's death. Many people say that he got what he deserved when he chose to cross the dangerous line and get too close to the ferocious animals. But he also got what none of us would get - he got Werner Herzog to make a documentary about him. Herzog used the footage (almost 100 hours) that Timothy Treadwell had shot during all these years. Herzog' was the only artist who could say so much and so well about man's obsession that borders with madness. He narrated the movie himself and he said that in his opinion the common denominators for the Universe are chaos, hostility, and murder - not harmony. Anyone who saw Herzog's films would agree with the statement. I just want to add that Universe in his movies radiates magnificent indifference (in the best case scenario), not warmth or love.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>Treadwell was a lost soul in search of a cause; at one point he wanted to be an actor but lost a starring role in a hit TV series (although later got his 15 minutes on the David Letterman Show which includes an offhand remark by Letterman about Treadwell being killed by a Grizzly...) and decided to become a hermit and a Saviour of Ursus Terribilis. He is an entertaining subject by virtue of his manic on-camera antics and his apparent fascination for the Big Bad Grizzly Bears. His penchant for giving them names and imbuing them with little personalities and cartoon-like foibles is a bit too saccharine and elicits some squirms.<br /><br />These are not Disney cartoon characters, nor were they happy to have this hyperactive human living among them. The bears were fine before Treadwell declared himself their rescuer and defender and are fine now...no bears were being poached nor were they in the dangers Treadwell intimates.<br /><br />He has one scene which is probably closest to his true persona where he has a meltdown on camera and just goes off on an enraged, over-dramatic speech and we see how truly disturbed this guy is.<br /><br />He did believe he was literally saving these beasts, and he did get some great footage of them, but his own self-indulgent drama overwhelmed any potential benefits of these efforts.<br /><br />The only sympathetic figure in this story is Amie who stayed with Treadwell despite her own well-founded fears, and interestingly, she had a far more pragmatic and accurate POV of these bears than he did.<br /><br />Treadwell never did well when interacting with people in general, and on their way home after their last summer in Grizzly Maze, he and Amie were at the airport when he had a run-in with "an obese" airline employee which was enough to send the uber-sensitive self-described naturalist scurrying back to the bears, much later in the season than was wise.<br /><br />At the end of the film we see Treadwell's parents, his mother holding his favorite childhood toy...a stuffed bear, the two of them sitting at their Florida home, looking bewildered at their son's final outcome and how it all came about. That moment is really sad.<br /><br />Herzog made in impressive film about all this self-indulgent drama and really cared about his reckless star, being moved to tears listening to the audio recording of their last few minutes. It is horrifying to realize just how terribly Treadwell and Amie suffered, physically and emotionally, and how utterly unnecessary it all was and how easily it could have been prevented. Amie, of course, had the worst role of watching her lover being literally devoured by this rogue bear and being helpless to stop it.<br /><br />The Greek Chorus of women who may or may not have been intimate with Treadwell are depressing, and their girlish, coy hints at a physical relationship are grotesque. One wonders; would they have been so devoted to Treadwell if he had been less attractive?<br /><br />But kittenish females aside, the documentary is gripping and holds you rapt throughout; it is Herzog who turns Treadwell's footage into gold and makes it unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This film is a brilliant and honest look at one man's obsession.  The story told here is not so much one about saving bears as it is about how far a person will go to escape reality.  Treadwell was not a scientist nor was he learned about the true nature of animals, however he had a passion and he stuck with that passion up until his final moments.  Was he crazy, insane or mentally ill...maybe, but that does not detract from the importance of his underlying message.  Sometimes it takes someone who is a little "off" to show the world how "off" everything else truly is.  Getting a glimpse of Treadwell's unedited moments were what truly brought this film home.  Without seeing that, the viewer would have had much less understanding about who the man really was.  Emotional, riveting, and wonderfully put together.  So much more than just a nature film.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Grizzly Man" is a fascinating documentary of Timothy Treadwell,a man who ventured into the "Last Frontier" to commune with the brown bears. Acclaimed director Werner Herzog ("Aguirre,Wrath of God","Fitzcarraldo") ventures not only into the wilderness of Alaska, but the troubling landscape of Treadwell's mind.<br /><br />Timothy Treadwell grew up in middle-class comfort in Florida. He went to California, attempting to get into Hollywood. He drowned himself in drugs and alcohol, only to find salvation through Nature (it's never fully explained) Treadwell is a deeply eccentric character. He filmed himself in his Alaskan refuge, wrestling with belief in God, wishing he were gay instead of straight (and priding himself on his bedroom abilities) Treadwell has pure,childlike joy in the presence of bears and foxes. He has religious reverence for the land. He's a flamboyant, flaming showman before the camera (a very gay-acting straight man--apparently several of his former girlfriends declined interviews). Treadwell's identification with animals- to the point he saw himself as a bear- brought him to a tragic end along with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard.<br /><br />Werner Herzog uses not only Treadwell's personal footage, but interviews his parents, his ex-lover Jewel (who founded Grizzly Friends with him),the coroner,the bush pilot who took him to the "Grizzly Maze." He speaks with an Aleut,as well as a friend from his California days. Herzog carefully crafts the documentary, making it a riveting piece of cinema. There's also some beautiful folk music from Richard Thompson (Fairport Convention) "Grizzly Man" shows that the wilderness isn't always in the great outdoors, but the human heart and mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>The amazing thing about Timothy Treadwell was that he survived 13 summers in the Alaska wilderness, living among gigantic, ferocious grizzly bears, until one of them finally ate him. Treadwell was a combination environmental activist, societal rebel, filmmaker, nutcase and holy fool. In other words, he was not unlike Werner Herzog, director of "Grizzly Man," the brilliant new documentary about Treadwell's life and horrible death. Herzog is much more self-aware than Treadwell ever was, and has much more of a sense of reality and irony. But as a filmmaker drawn to impossible projects ("Fitzcarraldo," "Aguirre, the Wrath of God"), he feels a definite kinship to Treadwell, even as he's appalled by Treadwell's egregious lapses of judgment. Treadwell shot more than 100 hours of film of himself and his beloved grizzlies, and Herzog culls the best of that film for "Grizzly Man." In his own film footage, Treadwell showed himself consistently to be an arrested adolescent, conflating the terrifying behemoths he lived among with his collection of teddy bears. (He speaks constantly of the mortal danger of living among grizzlies, but never quite seems to believe his own words.) Yet he also captured some of the most amazing nature scenes ever recorded, and Herzog respects him for that. (In his narration, Herzog also expresses great tenderness toward Amie Huguenard, the woman who loved Treadwell, followed him to the wilderness despite her fear of bears, and shared his horrible fate.) Whereas Treadwell sought order in nature, and believed the grizzlies loved him as much as he loved them, Herzog sees nothing in Treadwell's story except the workings of a chaotic universe sending one more dreamer to his doom. But because Treadwell's dreams were so outsized, Herzog sees him as a brother. So, thanks to Herzog, do we.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I liked this movie but I have to agree with all the reviews (who rate it both good and bad) that say Timothy Treadwell is emotionally and mentally ill.  It's true: the most amazing thing about his story was that he wasn't killed and eaten any sooner.<br /><br />I sympathize with the family and friends for their loss, but I can't gloss over what a crazy, grandstanding and ultimately suicidal "mission" this was.  He wasn't exactly Diane Fossey, who literally fought poachers off the mountain gorillas in Rwanda--these bears were in a state park.<br /><br />Absolutely NOTHING in science or life tells Treadway or anyone else that it's safe to live with bears.  He ventures into the wild and lives in a constant state of delusion, even as the bears kill and eat each other, his cute little foxes, the adorable little cubs.  As Herzog points out, there's nothing to support Treadway's fantasy world of harmony in the bloody Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />GRIZZLY MAN is a fascinating story but I have to agree with the reviews which compare the interviews with BEST IN SHOW or A MIGHTY WIND.<br /><br />(If you were fascinated by this story, check out the book INTO THE WILD, about another young man who disappeared and died in the Alaskan bush in an attempt to live off the land.  GORILLAS IN THE MIST is both a book and a movie about Diane Fossey, another controversial person who fought on behalf of endangered animals).</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"We took four garbage bags of human remains out of that bear."<br /><br />That horrific statement, made by one of the people who assisted with the recovery of the bodies of Timothy Treadwall and Ann Huguenard will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man", the new documentary from Werner Herzog, follows the life of Treadwell, giving us as complete a view as possible of a man who spent thirteen summers living with grizzly bears in the Alaskan wilderness. Painting a portrait of a strange, reclusive man, Herzog had a valuable resource in Treadwell himself. During the last five summers of his life, Treadwell took a video camera and recorded hundreds of hours of video of his interactions with the bears he called his friends.<br /><br />What drove Treadwell to spend thirteen summers alone with these wild animals? An interview with his parents relates his frustrated attempts to become an actor; at one point he was close to getting the role eventually given to Woody Harrelson on "Cheers". When he lost this part, he was devastated, contributing to his newfound passion.<br /><br />Treadwell gained a certain amount of notoriety. After starting a foundation, he began to visit classrooms and show his videotapes and talk to students about bears. This lead to an appearance on David Letterman's show. Letterman jokingly asks "I'm not going to open up the newspaper one day and find out you were killed by a bear am I?" eliciting laughter from his audience. It seems easy to make fun of Treadwell; slightly effeminate, with a Prince Valiant haircut, he is clearly uncomfortable around humans, taking everything they say very seriously. Treadwell seems much more comfortable interacting with the bears; the more time he spent alone with them, the more comfortable he became around them. Through interviews with his friends, it becomes clear that he favors the solitude and `friendship' of these beasts having difficulty relating to humans. He constantly and consistently professes his love for various bears and foxes and in the next breath warns viewers about the danger he faces on a daily basis. Many times, while taping various segments in the wilderness, he begins a tirade against some branch of the government or other. Basically, anyone he felt slighted by and he felt this way about a lot of people.<br /><br />Herzog intercuts interviews with friends who describe Treadwell's passions and with various experts who seem disturbed at what he was attempting. These experts seem astonished that he would try to become a friend of these wild creatures. They state that the bears will never ultimately accept him, which Treadwell also seems to realize. He was a hyperactive guy; often immediately after talking about the dangers, he would immediately declare his love for some particular bear or fox.<br /><br />Ultimately, everyone would be proven right. Treadwell, and his girlfriend, Amy, would be killed by a bear towards the end of his thirteenth summer with them. Their remains were found by the pilot, and friend, who ferried Treadwell back and forth to his summer home.<br /><br />At their campsite, they found the last videotapes Treadwell made. Herzog shows the last few recorded images of Treadwell, as he stands near a new bear and talks about the animal ultimately suspected of killing them. After the images on the tape end, Herzog found that the machine was still running, but with the lens cap on capturing the sounds of their death at the paws of a hungry bear. Herzog listens to this, with headphones on, and then promptly tells Treadwell's friend, who has the tape, that she should never listen to it. Thankfully, we don't hear it either.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is a fascinating portrait of a unique, obsessed, lonely man who clearly didn't fully understand the beasts he called his friends. Riveting filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>What a fascinating film this is about nature and man in it. German director Werner Herzog has made his share of great fiction movies about men embracing their id in the wilds of nature at the expense of their sanity, so the late Timothy Treadwell, the "Grizzly Man" that serves as the movie's title, is a perfect documentary subject. Treadwell got closer to these giant bears than anyone during the last 13 summers of his life until he and his girlfriend were killed by one.<br /><br />Herzog mostly uses Treadwell's own footage to reveal the story, and the results are unlikely and extraordinary. We see the bears in their element - on a plain and on an island of trees Treadwell dubs "The Grizzly Maze." Katmai National Park, scattered on the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, is a visual wonder, and the intimacy Treadwell achieves with the bears allows him to capture a bear fight as intense and vicious as any nature film I've ever seen. Uncut and filmed at close range, it is a titanic, beautiful struggle that involves primal strategy and raw strength. It is riveting as a later shot of bears sprinting on a beach is playful.<br /><br />But there is much more.<br /><br />Treadwell uses his camera as a confessional. A decent man with a reasonably laudible aims morphs into a profane, disturbed meglomaniac whose emotional issues likely drove him to Alaska to live with bears who tolerate him but, as the footage shows, don't consider him a family friend. We learn he is a failed actor, a mild con artist, a loner who pretends on film he is alone when he is not,  and, above all, a man who plays at being virtuous when he quite clearly thinks he is owed more acclaim and gratitude that he gets.<br /><br />Herzog first shows his temper in a hilarious scene where a fox steals Treadwell's hat. Later, Treadwell vents when tourists come to photograph the bears. Later still, he launches a vulgar rant against the National Park Service that makes "Grizzly Man" unsuitable for kids but essential to the man and the film. Treadwell thinks he's out there for the bears. He's really out there for himself. So anyone of us would be, for we do not go to the zoo so the animals can see us. We go to see the animals.<br /><br />Treadwell needs to declare himself, to say "I am." Bears don't. Bears act out of instinct and conditioning. Treadwell expresses, and does so out of thought. Without stating it,  "Grizzly Man" is a convincing argument against the evolutionary theory that suggests man arose from the clay of beasts. It's also a compelling case against Treadwell's mission, which seems to be little more than hanging around bears and filming them. Treadwell claims, quite often, to be "protecting" them. From what?<br /><br />His other mission is education. Stunning as the photography is, what I learned from "Grizzly Man" about bears is that they're bears. That in itself is divine but Treadwell wants to go further and impose human traits on them, which seem absurd the day he finds a baby grizzly's skull picked clean by other bears. Finally Treadwell gets dumb and stays in the "Maze" later in the summer than he should. The familiar bears are gone, replaced by one who eventually kills him. He probably captures the bear on tape, and we see a close-up of its beady brown eyes. Not a flicker of humanity. We shouldn't expect there to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>So much garbage passing for entertainment; when you come across something that rivets you it really stands out. Such is the case with this work. Treadwell is obviously mentally disturbed and he serves up much about himself to mock and deride. All the while, you cannot ignore his authenticity. Yes, he was self-absorbed, delusional, probably closeted, and insane. How on earth he was able to withstand the infamous Alaskan mosquito swarms boggles my mind. They're the size of small birds, it seems. His friends were odd folk. Aside from that, Herzog masterfully pieces Treadwell's footage with mesmerizing skill and his voiceover seems to convey a personal sadness for the story he is telling. Treadwell himself proved adept with the camera as many of his shots are composed with bears well-placed within the frame. His childish nature may have some rolling their eyes in embarrassment, but you can't deny that it's all real to him. This is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I cannot wait for the dvd. Also features terrific music by Richard Thompson.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>For the last thirteen years of his life, Timothy Treadwell's struggles with the modern world drew him to re-invent himself in the wilds of Alaska. He gained a sense of satisfaction living, loving and "protecting" the grizzly bears of the picturesque coastline of the Katmai National Park. That he met his end being sliced and torn by the teeth and claws of the animals he loved surprised none.  Grizzly Man is his story.<br /><br />The posters and trailers for the film provide the one word snippets "Spellbinding" and "Mesmerizing" from reviews of the Warner Herzog documentary. Two more apropos terms could not be selected, as the film fills viewers with equal parts awe and pity, intrigue and condescending judgment. Watching the footage Treadwell recorded while living among the bears produces the same feelings as listening to a captivating scholar and watching a child touch a hot stove at the same time. He's dazzling and informative, but his life is also frightening. His death seemed as inevitable as the eclectic Treadwell's onetime guest appearance with the bewitched David Letterman.<br /><br />Because of Treadwell's foolhardy endeavors, he recorded video that only an amateur could capture. For union issues and insurance risks alone, no production company would ever finance someone to make a film while living among bears (he actually touches them on occasion). His footage of bears at play, catching salmon and battling for territorial rights are the film's greatest feature.  But the pleasure gained from viewing them forever tethers itself to the knowledge that the project led to the death of the filmmaker. We literally view the world as a dead man saw it.  Is this exploitation?  Some would say "Yes".<br /><br />Whether the film exploits his death is as ambiguous as the message of his life.  I would guess that a dozen people would come away from Grizzly Man with 12 different opinions of Treadwell.  Some would say he is to be admired, a man so full of life that his love and dreams seemed to infect all who met him (the only detractors in the film are people who never met him).  Other people will find his life laughable, pointing to his lack of accomplishments and the possibility that he caused more harm to the bears by assimilating them to man.<br /><br />I found him to be sincere, but a bit lost. I saw a boy who played with teddy bears as a child and then tried to play with the real things as an adult...or maybe never really grew up at all.  He was not the grizzly's messiah, as he seemed to believe, but he did live with a zest for life and a determination for curing the wrongs he thought existed.  Should we really judge him so harshly because his vision of the world was a bit unrealistic?<br /><br />Many define him by his oddities, questionable judgment and grandiose behaviors.  But the film presents a deeper understanding of the man.  By ending with an old cowboy ballad, Grizzly Man marries Treadwell to the romantic ideal of the frontiersman, a man who casts off the comforts and stability of society to quench a thirst only satisfied in nature.  All we can really say about his motivations is that Timothy Treadwell found something living with the grizzly bears that gave him purpose in life.  We should all be so lucky.<br /><br />He'd tell you a tale of the old days<br />When the country was wild all around<br />Sit under the stars of the Milky Way<br />And listen while the coyotes howl.<br />(From "Coyotes" by Don Edwards, featured in Grizzly Man)</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>NOTE TO OTHER REVIEWERS: Please review the film itself, not the man of Timothy Treadwell.  Almost every negative review for the film I have read notes how crazy Treadwell was and thus how pointless this documentary is.  One reviewer even noted that he didn't learn anything new about bears, and thus the film was a failure.  These people are missing the point.  Regardless of your feelings towards Treadwell (I think he was a bit daffy myself), this is a fascinating and powerful character study of a tormented man.<br /><br />Such negative sentiments toward the film would be understandable if it were a hero-worship documentary, but I did not get that vibe from it at all.  Director/Narrator Herzog often voices when he disagrees with Treadwell, interviews people that had negative opinions of him (true, there are no right-wing nuts, but respected ecologists that disagreed with him are given their say), and at one point even says that Treadwell at times seemed overtaken with a madness (he says this during one of the movie's best scenes- Treadwell's rant against the actually effective park service).<br /><br />What makes "Grizzly Man" so good is that it is the study of a flawed human being that met an end so ironic that it almost seemed a higher power was at work.  Treadwell's attempts to communicate with the wild animals are both insane (touching bears on the noses, examining their feces) and touching (the friendships he seemingly develops with local foxes).  His constant ranting against the humans he sees as harming the bears make him unreasonable and unsympathetic, but he also has scenes where he is sympathetic and even likeable (when he laments his past alcoholism, explains his difficulties communicating with women, expresses his love for the wilderness around him).  We see both sides of Treadwell- the loving son and good friend, and the misguided wildman that dangerously habituated bears to the presence of humans.<br /><br />Ultimately, "Grizzly Man" is the compelling and sad story of a unique (or strange) person.  His inevitable end at the hands of the bears he so loved is both appropriate and sad (it is especially sad the woman who accompanied him was killed as well).  Herzog in making "Grizzly Man" put together a documentary that will remain the standard of great documentaries for years to come.  This was one of the best movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog does an outstanding job, as usual, of bringing this fascinating story to the screen. Herzog takes the beautiful footage that Timothy Treadwell took himself and mixes it with his own fantastic voice overs and narration and also interviews with friends and people close to the story. Treadwells footage in itself would be compelling enough for anybody to watch, nature lover or not. But Herzog delves deeper into the story and deeper into who Timothy Treadwell was and what made him tick.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and I encourage anybody to watch it. Even if you are not one to watch documentaries I think this story has the chops and is so wonderfully done and Treadwell and the Bears are so fascinating that you can't take your eyes off of it.

At times I wondered if it was all an act. Treadwell is (unintentionally?) funny, the coroner creepy, and both seemed like B-grade actors.<br /><br />Was Treadwell gay? I think so, and even though some will argue that it does not matter, to the extent that he was running away from society, from people with whom he could not or would not be honest, that led him to Alaska and ultimately into a bear's tummy for dinner.<br /><br />Was Treadwell mentally ill? He certainly seemed a quarter or two short of a dollar. It's one thing for a young child or even a daydreaming teenager to have grandiose dreams and to humanize animals (although I suppose Mr. Chocolate *was* hungry!). It's quite another thing when a failed actor and former drug addict in his mid-40s does it.<br /><br />Was Treadwell selfish? Unequivocally, yes. In the end he got his girlfriend killed, not to mention two grizzly bears.<br /><br />I am reminded of Into the Wild (the book, as I have not yet seen the film): Weirdo goes up to Alaska and gets himself dead...tonight at 11. Yet Krakauer's book succeeds where Herzog's film fails. That is, creating a personal connection between the protagonist and the storyteller. Krakauer uses his own harrowing experiences as a mountain climber to gain insight into Christopher McCandless' demons, while Herzog simply uses Treadwell's own videotapes and words against him, possibly making the bear lover out to be even crazier than he was.<br /><br />I tend to side with naturalist (and true bear expert) Charlie Russell. From whom did Treadwell think he was protecting the bears? Why did he so unnecessarily put himself in harm's way? To set himself up as a hero, probably. My guess is he intended to sell his own movie. To be fair, Treadwell took time to observe animals in their natural habitat, but he crossed the line. He loved the grizzlies as most of us would love a stuffed teddy bear. But, he abused this relationship. On an appearance with David Letterman in 2001, Treadwell called the bears "party animals." He was disconnected from reality, but his luck and the bears' own self-restraint kept him alive for more than a dozen years. As Deb Liggett, National Park Service Superintendent (Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks and Preserves), told the Anchorage Daily News two years prior to Treadwell's death, "At best, he's misguided. At worst, he's dangerous."<br /><br />One star for the bears and foxes and another for the cautionary tale this documentary tells. Anything higher risks idolizing this idiot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>For thirteen summers, Timothy Treadwell lived among the wild grizzly bears of Alaska.  An untrained but fervent bear-lover, he took his videos and message of bear preservation to schools during his off-season.  This documentary alternates Treadwell's footage with interviews of his friends, family, and co-workers.<br /><br />The result is a portrait of a man with a childlike enthusiasm and certainty that he could live with the bears as one of them.  He also comes across as a grandstanding showman determined to make himself immortal.  This documentary has done that much, although Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of his beloved bears.  There is no footage of bears showing anything but indifference to him, but Treadwell endlessly proclaims his love for the grizzlies and says he would willingly die for them.  One can only imagine the horror of it.<br /><br />The Alaskan footage is lovely and one is impressed with the power and size of the bears.  Unfortunately, the pristine beauty is usually interrupted with Treadwell's showboating antics.  I think he was delusional when it came to his safety and I feel sorry for those who mourn him.  Heartily recommended for nature lovers and those interested in a man recklessly pursuing a bizarre lifestyle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I gave this documentary 5 stars due to director Werner Herzog's outstanding efforts and the pure challenge of putting an accurate and complete perspective on who the grizzly man, Timothy Treadwell, really was. See Amazon.com's editorial review for complete plot synopsis as I don't want to repeat the entire plot line in detail here.<br /><br />Herzog had complete access to over 100 hours of amateur video taken by Timothy Treadwell during his times spent at the Katmai National Park in the Alaska wilderness. Herzog not only uses some of the video footage shot by Treadwell himself for "Grizzly Man", but also intermixes interviews taken of Treadwell's parents, Treadwell's friends and former girlfriend, the coroner who autopsied Treadwell, and the airplane pilot that would drop/pick up Treadwell each year, etc. to give the viewers of "Grizzly Man" a more complete picture of who Treadwell really was.<br /><br />Based on what I saw in this documentary, I think Treadwell is a Village Idiot! Yes, I think it is admirable that Treadwell loved nature and wanted to save the grizzly bears..... BUT Treadwell was an amateur, wildlife activist wannabe with no concrete knowledge about wildlife ecology let along any advanced degrees in biology, zoology, animal behavior etc. before heading off into the woods to live with wild grizzly bears. Let's face the facts here. Treadwell was a college drop, self admitted recovering alcoholic, unsuccessful actor in Hollywood, didn't have much luck with the ladies as he claims, and seemed very angry at society at large, and preferred living in the company of grizzly bears more than with people! Honestly, I don't know how Treadwell managed not to be eaten, mauled, or seriously injured by a grizzly bear sooner than he did. It is very sad that his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, had to die the same gruesome death Treadwell did. What a tragedy.<br /><br />I think the moral of the story here is to leave the interacting and observing of dangerous wildlife to the experts! I don't think it is wise for anyone to go around attempting to pet will animals (especially predators) roaming freely in nature, nor invading there space by approaching them to closely like Treadwell did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Timothy Treadwell spent 13 seasons with the grizzly bears in Alaska. He followed them, studied them, lived among them. For the first few years he would take pictures and in the later years he carried a video camera with him to document his experiences on film. He would present them at various speaking engagements for which he never charged a fee. He wanted to dispel the feeling that grizzly bears were inherently dangerous. He believed, rather, that they should be respected and loved by humans. His message, from the beginning, was that he was so passionate about this cause that he would die for these animals. Each year when he set off to Alaska he would tell friends that if he should not return, they should not worry because it was what he wanted. It was how he wanted to go, if he must.<br /><br />In the end, that is exactly what Timothy got. In 2003 he and his companion killed by a bear.<br /><br />Grizzly Man is a documentary about Timothy Treadwell. It tells about the man before he became obsessed with bears and it talks about the man as he lived among the bears. We see actual footage taken by Timothy and we see first person accounts from family and friends. One of the more interesting perspectives included in the film is that from people who think Timothy got exactly what he deserved. The contrast between a man and woman tragically killed by a bear and sentiment that he was doing more harm than good to the bears he was committed to protect was sharp.<br /><br />The movie was very interesting. Despite the interference with nature, and the breaking of a few federal laws, Timothy Treadwell had a unique perspective on life. The film would not have been worth seeing if it did not contain so much footage from his time in Alaska. So much of his philosophy was explained as narrative to his video. His transition away from human society was remarkably well captured over the years. He grew more and more comfortable among the bears and less and less cautious. It would be his downfall.<br /><br />I do not usually make a point to watch documentaries, but this one looked different. It was entertaining in documentary terms, but if you are deciding between this and something a bit more fictional, I am not sure you should pick Grizzly Man.<br /><br />I liked it well enough, though I do not anticipate the need to ever watch it a second time. Put Grizzly Man on your "to rent" list.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>The biggest surprise of Werner Herzog's `Grizzly Man,' is the focus on the titled subject matter.  The animals are important, but wisely kept as second focus in favor of Tim Treadwell.  Tim was a filmmaker himself who tried to bond with grizzly bears until his tragic death when he and his girlfriend, Amy, were mauled and eaten by a grizzly in Kodiak.  Now this fact is established in the first few minutes and elaborated throughout the film.  Mostly, I went in believing that the film would consist of Treadwell's films mixed with commentary.  However, slightly over half of the material investigates their deaths and mostly his life.  The angles make this documentary so special and complete.  To establish an understanding of Tim the person, there are testimonies by Tim's former lovers, family, and friends.  As an investigation of his death, Herzog interviews an ecologist couple, the Park Service, and the coroner.  In addition friend and Bush pilot, Willy Fulton, has a great deal to tell us about both his death and life.  Everyone has something to bring to the table--even the hunters.  We first have to learn about the man; then we have to see what went wrong when he dared the ghost too long and too often.<br /><br />One of the best perspectives offered is from Native Alutiiq museum curator, Sven Haakanson, PhD. who says it best:  "If you look at it from my culture, Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary that we have lived with for 7,000 years.  It's an unspoken boundary, an unknown boundary.  But when we know we've crossed it, we pay the price."  Which is certainly a refreshing departure from the usual sentiments:  "He died doing what he loved best." Or having to listen to some conservatives invoking the death penalty like it was poetic justice.  (Imagine taking sides with an animal instead of a human!)  Herzog himself seems to invoke nature as cold-blooded.  Tim also articulates the harm's way he's put himself in several times, but he balances that--or unbalances that!--with a child-like exuberance for creatures he's seemed to project himself upon.  It's not that much different with pets, except Tim has a protective nature for the grizzlies like it was an extension of himself.  The other revelations are meant to unearth yourselves.<br /><br />'Grizzly Man' is really about a man's passion, his vulnerability, his enthusiasm, but also his disintegration.  Like tracing bear paw prints, the movie does a marvelous and responsible job at reinacting a tragedy.  There was a second big surprise for me:  Herzog wisely leaves out the recordings that Treadwell unintentionally provided at the time of their deaths.  Having seen TV news magazines that have left nothing to the imagination, it's taken me this long to see this incredible documentary.  Herzog uses prudence.  And prudence is sorely needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog's documentary is excellent.  I thought it to be among the very best I've ever seen.  "Grizzly Man" deals with the crazed Timothy Treadwell who was doomed to eventually get himself killed.  The odds were against his ever reaching retirement age.  Treadwell so hated the civilized world that he deluded himself into believing that wild animals had more love to offer than other human beings. Amie Huguenard and the other women in his life were probably mere sex objects.  They were nowhere near as important as the grizzly bears.  It is obvious as you watch the film that Treadwell is increasingly becoming more unbalanced.  A group of men, for instance, visit his "private" island and are obviously non-threatening.  And yet, Treadwell imagines them to be the very opposite.  Some true believers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060505915">The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)</a>) seek their utopias in political systems such as Communism, Nazism or environmental radicalism.  Treadwell instead opted for anthropomorphic extremism.  This is a sure one-way ticket to madness and eventual suicide.  Sadly, Amie did not recognize the danger signals.  Experts believe that an older and perhaps desperately hungry bear saw them as an easy meal.  There is one consolation regarding the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard: they never murdered people on behalf of their utopian vision.  Only these two individuals paid the ultimate price.  For that, we can be thankful.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>My father was the person who first told me about this documentary.  Upon hearing about it, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I didn't recognize who "Timothy Treadwell" was and I don't think I had ever herd of Werner Herzog before (when I first saw the movie I almost fainted because I thought the former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals had made this film).  After seeing the movie, I remembered that I had seen Treadwell before when he had appeared on television and I was corrected about the mistaken identity of the director.  After viewing the movie, I was flabbergasted.  It honestly is one of the most well-done documentaries about a person that I have ever seen.<br /><br />GRIZZLY MAN is a movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell.  Treadwell had performed several odd jobs during his life, but worked largely as an actor.  At one point in his life he was one of two finalists for the role of "Woody" on "Cheers", but lost out to Woody Harrelson.  Afterwards, Treadwell's life went downhill for awhile until he discovered (or perhaps it was rediscovered) nature.  I don't remember if GRIZZLY MAN explains how Treadwell became infatuated with grizzly bears, but he did.  He began sneaking into a protected (and dangerous) area of Alaska to hang out with the grizzlies.  He filmed many of these moments and must have believed himself to be a Steve Irwin of the grizzly bears.  However, unlike Steve Irwin, Timothy Treadwell was not a trained naturalist, zoologist, and biologist.  He hung out with the bears and thought they liked him; he believed he was one of them and he thought they did, too.  The locals believed Treadwell was crazy and that the only reason the bears didn't harm him was because they could sense he was crazy.  Treadwell was tragically killed in 2003 with his girlfriend by a grizzly bear.  It was a bear he was not familiar with and one that had traveled far south in search of food.<br /><br />Considering the material that GRIZZLY MAN was based, the film could have turned out terribly.  In lesser hands the life of Treadwell might have been parodied and his life made to be a joke.  Herzog does not do that.  Instead, using interviews and footage that Treadwell shot himself, he presents a very revealing, compassionate, and moving film that captures the best and worst of Treadwell's life.<br /><br />Documentaries are not for everyone, but this is one documentary that I highly recommend that just about anyone can enjoy.  It is a fascinating picture about an eccentric and captivating man.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>What could've been sensational and exploitive given the subject matter (and highly ironic title), Werner Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN is instead a mesmerizing, perceptive and heart-rending account of Timothy Treadwell and girl friend Amie Huguenard's fateful attempt to live with and film Alaska's endangered, wild bears.<br /><br />Their remains were found at Katmai Reserve in October 2003. They had been eaten by the animals they loved.<br /><br />Culled from over a hundred hours of Treadwell's expert footage, Herzog fashioned a paradoxical portrait of a troubled, compassionate man seeking solace and understanding.<br /><br />Was Treadwell a na?ve naturalist who lost touch with reality and died as a result?

I don't know what that means, but the film I watched was riveting and always interesting. Mr. Herzog's narration keeps everything in perspective, telling the sad story of a man who was disillusioned with society at large, and his own disappointments at success (it's said he lost a role in "Cheers" to Woody Harrelson). I'm reminded a bit of "Into the Wild", but this is more a story about a guy who was a bit removed from reality, and thought he could empower Mother Nature herself. He thought of himself as primordial, when in fact he was clueless that nature has its own idea of survival. I guess it's no different than the crazy people who want exotic animals for pets, and end up being their lunch. Nature cannot be out-guessed, and poor Timothy Treadwell got crazier over the years. Too bad Amie went with him; she's an enigma in this film, never a clear shot of her.  Mr. Herzog's narration is intelligent enough to make this an interesting story about a delusional (albeit well-meaning) person. The stunning shots in Katmai Nat'l Park in Alaska are breath-taking. But it's all about the bears.  Bears will be bears, and Tim couldn't understand that. Tim was na?ve and a bit of a narcissist; his association to reality deteriorated, and he got the obsession, as most people crave to fulfill, but it was his demise. There's a fine DVD extra about Herzog's input into the music score, whch was very interesting. "Grizzly Man" won many awards as Best Documentary Film in 2005, but failed to get an Oscar nom. I guess that just goes to show that we're all entertained differently, and we can't all relate to certain things. Indeed, I heard how violent this film was (NOT!), but watched it because of its awards recognition. It's basically a film about obsession gone bad, and not as gruesome as I'd been led to believe. I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>About the nicest thing you can say about Timothy Treadwell is that he was a controversial person who along with his girl friend Amie Huguenard died a senseless, tragic death when they were mauled by grizzly bears in Alaska's Katmai National Park in October 2003. Even more gruesome, his camera recorded the audio but not the video of the mauling. You will be disappointed if you watch this documentary to learn something about grizzlies, but if you view it as a commentary about human nature, both your own and the film's subject, it's fascinating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>Timothy Treadwell did love animals and I think he was very idealistic. And sadly, I think with his idealism was some sort of mental illness. I think he was bi-polar. He admitted he liked his emotional ups and downs. At times his rants against the government and civilization was funny, touching and sad all at the same time. Perhaps I saw a little of myself in him since I have had (and will continue to have) similar rants. Just pure anger and frustration at the world. His "salvation" in the long run killed him. Died by one of the bears he loved. Watching this movie, it seems bound to happen, I just wish that his girlfriend wasn't with him and shared his fate.<br /><br />He couldn't accept animals being themselves, the killing and torture that they inflict on each other. He had this view of the universe being in nature and harmony. The Director Werner Herzog of this film sees it differently. He sees the universe as in constant chaos. To me, it's a paradox. There is chaos in the harmony, harmony in the chaos. We are all one, yet still separate at the same time. An Native American museum curator said his people (Inuit?) lived there in Alaska for 7,000 years and knows that the bears and humans have their own worlds and left each other alone.<br /><br />I think Timothy had a good heart but I think trying to become one with the bears was foolhardy and sadly what happened was his ultimate destiny. He's not a hero in my eyes but a tender soul who didn't respect nature's boundaries.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Most of us are very careful, when we put ourselves in a situation that places us at less than the top of the food chain.

"Grizzly Man" was not among this year's nominees for Best Documentary.<br /><br />Many of Herzog's narrative films, such as "Fitzcaraldo," deal with man's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature, so "Grizzly Man" is not a departure by any means. Herzog's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious, even bizarre, goal. Timothy Treadwell's fixation is on grizzly bears. "I am one of them," he is heard to say. He survived in the wild, accompanied by a video camera, and, on at least one occasion, by a girlfriend., living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting. "Animals rule," he said, fist defiantly pumping in the air. "Timothy conquered."<br /><br />Treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life, appearing once on David Letterman's CBS show, but he aspired to more. Before letting his love of animals consume him, he tried his luck in Hollywood. He got an agent, and auditioned for TV and movie roles. He was, he told his parents, second choice for the bartender role on "Cheers" which went to Woody Harrelson. Missing out on that opportunity left him "crushed."<br /><br />What really drove Treadwell?<br /><br />He reminds me of fey little Carson on "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," and as he openly mentions that it's easier to be gay than straight, I wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation, transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable: grizzly bears. "I like girls," he volunteers, but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops, men's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts.<br /><br />He was also an alcoholic. Were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue?<br /><br />Those who are seen offering their remembrances of Treadwell never allude to his sexuality. They describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive, hippy, New Age approach to nature and who died as a result. The bears, to whom he gave names like "Mr. Chocolate" and "Tabitha," need protection, he said, and he was their self-appointed caretaker. Others suggest that, despite his good intentions, he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined. After Treadwell was eaten by a bear, the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife. Shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at KFC for eating chicken. What is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf? Treadwell was an intruder. One mans saysTreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits. But Treadwll knew these were animals. Trouble is, his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from Disney cartoons.<br /><br />The universe, director Herzog says, is ruled by hostility, chaos, and murder. Treadwell had a different philosophy. "Isn't that sad?" he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing "his pollen thing."<br /><br />"I love that bee," he says.<br /><br />Partially financed by the Discovery Channel, "Grizzly Man" is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans. But it's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because, he admitted, he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows. He also needed to record his solitary life on video. We see him crying as he pets a wolf, laughing when his command that God make it rain seems to have been obeyed, and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals. What we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him. Mercifully, the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked. The camera was running, though, and Treadwell's screams, and the screams of his girlfriend, were recorded. Out of respect for his family, Herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings. Instead, we see him listening to the audio, and his reaction (telling one of Treadwell's friends that she must never listen to it, just as she must never see the coroner's photos of the aftermath of the attack), is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film.<br /><br />"I had no life," Treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts. "Now I have a life." That life is memorialized in Herzog's film.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>This is a very worthwhile documentary by Werner Herzog (director of the acclaimed films "Agguire, the Wrath of God" & "Fitzcarraldo") on "grizzly man" Timothy Treadwell, who actually LIVED with grizzlies for 13 summers in wilderness Alaska, often accompanied by his bear-phobic girlfriend. Treadwell comes off as a bit of a loon, yet at the same time unique, gifted, dynamic and brilliant. There are humorous and fabricated touches that cause some to wonder if this is a possible spoof or fake documentary, in the manner of "Curse of the Blair Witch," such as the hamming-it-up coronor (I'm NOT saying it is, but one occasionally wonders while viewing it).<br /><br />Treadwell documented his 13 summers with the grizzly bears on film and in journals. His journals have been made into a book by Ian Zonglobski. Each of the 13 chapters detail Treadwell's experiences with the bears, one chapter per each summer visit. The first 12 chapters reveal Treadwell's great love for the animals; to him the grizzlies are lovable cute & cuddly critters. The 13th chapter, however, horrifically details the tragic end of Timothy and his girlfriend as they end up half-eaten by a grizzly (apparently an older bear who was having a hard time finding enough to eat). This last chapter is fittingly titled "I Guess They Weren't So Cuddly After All."</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Herzog is amazing and when he decides to do something real by pulling off another documentary, like his award winning 'My Best Fiend', you just know it is going to be something worth seeing. Here Herzog edits from over 100 hours of video footage the story of Timothy Treadwell's risky, and ultimately deadly, self-sponsored grizzly bear research in the wilderness of the Alaska Peninsula. It must be seen to be believed, could be one of the best films of 2005/2006, and certainly raises a hair or two, including the final moments where the ecentric Treadmill probably filmed himself with his murderer. Just watch this and be amazed at the stunning one on one bear footage never seen in the wild this way before, coupled with the local coroner describing how Timothy recorded himself on camera, telling his girlfriend to run away while screaming as the bear tore his skull open. Shockingly profound and at times seriously touching, this is wholly original and confusingly stunning. You have never seen anything like it before, nor will you again.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>One of the most unique and disturbing qualities of both photography and film is the ability they have of allowing us to see into people's futures before they themselves have had the chance to experience them.  We look at images of people frozen in a happier time before a certain personal tragedy has befallen them, blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits them - and, for a brief moment at least, we sense what it must be like to be God and realize what a burden that must be.  This feeling of prophetic omniscience haunts the audience all throughout "Grizzly Man," a morbidly fascinating documentary about a man who is quite literally devoured by his own obsession.  This is a film that puts its audience into the position of modern day Cassandras - looking on in helpless horror as the subject moves inexorably towards his bitter fate - grimly aware that there is not a single thing we can do to stop the inevitable from happening.<br /><br />Timothy Treadwell earned notoriety and even celebrity status as a conservationist who, for thirteen summers, lived amongst a group of grizzly bears in Alaska.  While there, he made "friends" with much of the wildlife in the area, filming his experiences in an effort to draw attention to the plight of these creatures at the hands of poachers and hunters.  However, in September, 2003, the bizarre idyll came to a tragic end when Treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and eaten by a hungry bear.  The film, written, directed and narrated by famed moviemaker Werner Herzog, is made up of footage Treadwell himself shot of his adventures in the wilderness combined with interviews with people who knew him or were somehow involved in the post mortem activities.<br /><br />Herzog makes it clear from the outset that Treadwell was always a controversial figure, one who was beloved by fellow conservationists, but treated with, at best, skepticism and, at worst, hostility and scorn by others less favorable to his cause.  What we see of the man is alternately inspiring and disturbing.  We admire his strong convictions and fearlessness in the face of danger, yet can't help but detect traces of mental illness or at least childish naivete in many of his actions.  He is a man constantly testing limits, crossing boundaries and teasing fate.  He is often shown interacting with these wild animals with that same air of condescension and sentimentality most people reserve for their benign pets.  He names them, talks to them, scolds them, instructs them, cries over them - seemingly convinced that there is some sort of interspecies communication taking place between him and them.  We somehow expect someone this knowledgeable about the realities of wildlife to be less susceptible to the temptation - that seems to overcome even the most rational of us - of viewing animals in such intensely anthropomorphic terms.  Yet, Treadwell was, apparently, unable to separate himself, either emotionally or psychologically, from the animals he cohabitated with, and he wound up paying the ultimate price for that weakness.<br /><br />As we watch Treadwell's interactions with the animals and listen to the often self-aggrandizing commentary he provides on his own role in the situation, we get the sense that he saw himself, paradoxically, as both a messiah figure for the grizzlies and a sinner who needed to find his own salvation through them.  His experiences with the bears seem as much a way of achieving a meaning and purpose for his own life as it is a way of saving them from the threats of an ever-encroaching and hostile civilization.<br /><br />As a master director himself, Herzog is also fascinated by Treadwell's techniques as a filmmaker.  He shows how Treadwell, ever the perfectionist and showman, would often film seemingly spontaneous scenes a dozen or more times until he was happy that the final take was the one that would show him off to his best advantage. He would even consciously cover up the presence of the cameraman (or woman) in an effort to make it appear as if he were truly alone on these expeditions.<br /><br />Was Treadwell an environmentalist hero, a self-promoting opportunist or a victim of a bizarre mental illness that allowed him to believe that he was genuinely connecting with the bears on a psychic level - if not a bear himself?  "Grizzly Man" raises far more questions than it answers - but, then again, that is what a truly great documentary should be all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>It's a cliche of course but watching Grizzly Man is like watching a car crash in slow motion. You should turn away but on some low, shameful level it's fascinating so you don't.  Timothy Treadwell treated grizzly bears, one of the most dangerous animals in America, like they were Disney teddies come to life and was roundly despised by many professional naturalists. It is amazing that he survived as long as he did before getting eaten.<br /><br />That said, the documentary is really superb. It shows you who Treadwell was and it shows you in a crystal clear way why his death was inevitable. There are two scenes in the film that are unforgetable. The first is Treadwell having a cursing tantrum in front of the camera (anybody walking in on him at that moment would've slowly backed away and run for their car) and the second is when the doctor who autopsied what was left of Treadwell is interviewed.<br /><br />Grizzly Man is a gut wrencher and and outstanding piece of work. It pulls off a nearly impossible trick. It tells the story of an unlikable person and manages to make you care and feel sorrow for his fate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Sometimes you eat the Bar---& sometimes, well, the Bar eats You., July 3, 2007<br />By  James Stephen Garrett "Teep" (Arkham Asylum) - See all my reviews<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is the story of what happens when a Freak of Nature meets a Force of Nature.<br /><br />The results aren't pretty. Tim Treadwell (the Freak) goes toe-to-toe with a young, hungry male Grizzly Bear (the Force). Bottom line: the Freak gets 187'd by the Force, who ends up using Treadwell's guts for garters (according to eyewitnesses, quite literally).<br /><br />Long-haired Hippy tree-hugging dancing fools: Zero. Annoyed Alpha Male Bears: 1. The rest of us: 100!<br /><br />Why? Because crazed, visionary film-maker Werner Herzog has effectively captured Treadwell's quixotic quest in his documentary "Grizzly Man", loaded it up with tons of raw footage, and served the demented---yet disconcertingly touching---story up smoking hot with his trademark fruitbat strangeness.<br /><br />Herzog is a great choice to direct this one, considering the director's long-time obsession with crazy people. And Treadwell is a great subject: a naturalist! a teacher! a hiker! a conservationist! a King of the Sea!<br /><br />By serving as a kind of mytic crystal revelatory channel to Treadwell's own peculiar brand of wonkish, Granola country wild-bore lunacy, Herzog's film serves as a fitting last testament to the man, additionally hooking up a kind of ephemeral shortwave radio into the craziness that---let's face it---made America what she is today.<br /><br />The story is simple: Tim Treadwell---naturalist, conservationist, um, bear-itarian, crazy freaky monkey---loved the grizzly bears of Katmai National Park, in Alaska. Revered them. Adored them. Wanted to, uh, "protect them".<br /><br />Think about that for a minute.<br /><br />Treadwell probably tipped the scales at 150 pounds soaking wet, and a young male grizzly is looking svelte at around a ton, but Treadwell felt he needed to protect these brutes all the same. "Protect" them seems a little, well, insane, particularly when you get a shot or two of a couple of youjng male grizzlies unleashing a little jihad on each other around mating season, slapping each other in a playful ursine backhand that would leave a man's guts neatly delineated in a pile of bloody slop on the ground.<br /><br />And that's when they were just playing.<br /><br />Anyway, for 13 years, Treadwell spent the summer in Kamtai, ensconced in a pup-tent, fortified with some scant provisions, maybe a hand-camera & tripod-mount rig, a few camoflage do-rags, & a small army of stuffed animals. He had a stuffed bear, which gets quite a bit of air-time in "Grizzly Man", and serves as a fine example of what academics might call "foreshadowing".<br /><br />He filmed himself. "Grizzly Man" is not so much the portrait of the grizzly in the wild, or a documentary about the Big Brown One's challenges in the rapidly shrinking outdoors (hey, Evolution sucks): it's really about a wild man living very close to the Edge.<br /><br />Very close, until he slips over. And the joy of "Grizzly Man" is that through the film-footage and through Herzog's inspired interviews (was someone looting David Lynch's casting couch?), we get a very fine-hewn, very stark, gloriously intimate portrait of the man himself.<br /><br />Treadwell let forth his barbaric yawp. He tried to bond with Nature in all Her howling Majesty. He tried to match his strength pound for pound and tooth by jowl with the furry grand eminences of the forest primeval, whose comradeship Treadwell wanted so desperately.<br /><br />There is great tragedy here in watching this Holy Fool Treadwell stomp and fret and dance and rusticate amid the bears, and as the film winds down I can't help feeling Herzog's pessimistic conclusion is dead on: Nature is cold, callous, by-the-numbers. She doesn't do favors. Perhaps intelligence really *is* an evolutionary dead-end, in which we ponder how to save these beasts, this vast forest, this planet warmed, for now, by the furnace of a dying sun.<br /><br />We invite them into ourselves. And they invite themselves to dinner.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog (who directed such classics as Aguirre wrath of god, fitzcaraldo, and the brilliant adaptation of nosferatu) has been making some fabulous documentaries in recent years.. He seems to be obsessed primarily with the bizzare.. In particular with people who have big dreams - and usually very absurd dreams.. I think Herzog, more than anything else, identifies with such people (afterall he worked in the most impossible conditions himself to create his greatest films)..<br />The subject of this film is Timothy treadwell a man who for a number of years actually managed to coexist with a group of giant grizzly bears..<br />Treadwell was an interesting often humorous figure who really meant well -but was driven over the edge by his own philosophy.. The man, as herzog claims, had a view of nature similar to walt disney.. while i think this claim may be slightly exagerated given the fact that treadwill actually did live in nature and must have had some notion of reality and the cycle of life - there is deffinately some truth to the fact that this man was slightly, shall i say, off his rocker.. As the film progresses and we learn a little about his background - we tend to wonder how much of a role drugs played in his early years.. I admit i had many laughs at treadwell's expense throughout the film - but that did not take away from the devistating notion of how he was killed..<br />Herzog's point of view in this movie is thought-provoking and highly subjective.. But it is his insistance on digging deeper and learning more that make this one of the most interesting documentaries i have seen..</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is the fascinating story of Timothy Treadwell, a man who wanted to protect Bears from the threat he perceived came from us humans. Treadwell spent 13 summers in the wilds filming Grizzlys and shot over 100 hours of wildlife film.<br /><br />The wildlife film itself is stunning. Grizzly bears are awesome creatures. At one point a large one stands up on two legs in front of Treadwell as he is filming. Minutes later when the Bear has gone Treadwell films himself standing in the same position and as he says the Bear on its two hind legs must have been 10 feet tall. From a wildlfe point of view this is a stunning film, but I would have preferred a<br /><br />little more film of wildlife and little less of Treadwell.<br /><br />The other side of the film revolves around the death of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie by a Grizzly attack. There death was captured on audio (Treadwell had his camcorder running) and Werner Herzog wisely decided against putting the audio track into his film. We see him listening to it and this is disturbing enough.<br /><br />Herzog has made a film that leaves you to make up your own mind about Timothy Treadwell. Both critical and appreacitive words are spoken about him in the film but I suspect most people will view the film and be grateful for the footage he shot, and be sad that he and his girlfriend were killed. There probably isn't enough information in the film to pass judgement on the rights and wrongs or validity of what Treadwell was doing.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I turned off the movie with about 20 minutes left.  Herzog uses<br />private material from Mr. Treadwell to do a layman's psychological<br />profile of him.  This is an invasion of privacy and overall is deplorable.  It's also twisted how he focuses a lot of time on the gruesome death and details, including the audio tape.  If done with respect, this could have been an interesting, although more pedestrian documentary.  Herzog goes for shock value and thru hype and violations of privacy exploits this unique individual.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>An interesting look at the life of Timothy Treadwell.  Timothy is a self proclaimed grizzly bear protector.  He spent every summer of his last 13 years camping out in the Alaskan wilds observing and interacting with the animals until the final summer when he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by a bear.  The filmaker takes 100 hours of Timothy's footage and mixes in interviews with his friends and family to make a documentary on Timothy's life as it related to his love of the bears.  What drives this film is how eccentric Timothy is.  A failed actor, but still charismatic, he finds a way to make himself a celebrity.  He rages against the rules to camp away from the bears and not interact with them.  He constantly puts himself in danger and proclaims this is how he would want to go.  The film does not play the audio of the attack, but it is mentioned as existing and people do comment on it.  A bit long, the film could have been trimmed a tiny bit, but it is interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Grizzly Man is the story of Timothy Treadwell, a wildlife advocate and educator, author, and environmentalist who lived among the giant grizzly bears of Kodiak island for thirteen summers. Treadwell took myriad photographs as well as documented hours of footage of the bears, red foxes, and his musings on life and nature.<br /><br />In the fall of 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie were eaten alive by an old and starving grizzly who had come in from the inland while all the bears Tim knew had already begun their hibernation. Tim and Amie had already left for the year. He returned on a whim. In the last moments of the film, it is like watching a horror movie where you yell for the characters to run. Everything screams danger: the ominous gray skies, absence of wildlife, cold winds, and this lone bear who will not look Treadwell in the face.<br /><br />The film is really worth seeing. I highly recommend it. Completely mesmerizing from start to finish, it touches your heart because of Treadwell's childlike character. As far as those reviewers who see his actions as reckless and stupid, it is because of insensitive people like them that Treadwell was driven into the wilderness. Nature is cruel, but so-called civilization is worse.<br /><br />I am surprised that no comparisons were made in the film to the 1970's series Grizzly Adams, which was based on the true story of Adams. Adams lived happily among wildlife in the Sierra Nevada in the 1850's - then prime grizzly and cougar habitat. The call of the wild is very powerful. People who at their very essence love nature want to be a part of it to some degree. In cases like Treadwell, Henry David Thoreau, Farley Mowhat (Never Cry Wolf), and Diane Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist) this love is taken to an extreme.<br /><br />As the director of Grizzly Man says, the movie can teach us about our own nature.<br /><br />To explain Treadwell's heart, here is the theme from Grizzly Adams. Hauntingly apt.<br /><br />Deep inside the forest there's a door into another land.<br />Here is our life and home.<br />We are staying here forever in the beauty of this place all alone.<br />We keep on hoping.<br />Maybe there's a world where we don't have to run.<br />Maybe there's a time we'll call our own, living free in harmony and majesty.<br />Take me home.

The documentary isn't without its faults.<br /><br />To say that Tim Treadwell was a troubled man, is like saying its dark out at night. He was a very troubled man. Trying to make it in Hollywood, Treadwell was a struggling actor. His claim to fame was being the runner-up for the role that would eventually go to Woody Harelson on "Cheers".<br /><br />With the loss of a role that would have led him to stardom, Treadwell fell into a deep depression (that I truly believe he never got out of, even with his 13 seasons of bear watching) that led to drinking & drug bingeing, until the early nineties when on a trip to Alaska, Treadwell had a run in with one of the park's  grizzly bears. Treadwell held his ground & to his amazement the bear backed off. The following season Treadwell returned & began his first of thirteen seasons with the bears.<br /><br />During the last five seasons, Tim brought a video camera, chronicling what would be the last five seasons of his life. In the final season, 2003, Treadwell brought his girlfriend, Aimmee Huegenard along for the season.<br /><br />By early October, the relationship between the two would be severely strained. The couple had made their way to the Grizzly Maze, the land where the grizzlies hunker down for the winter & hibernate. The final day they set up camp on the outskirts of the maze with, would have been, the following day packing up their gear & leaving the area for the season by plane. Treadwell & Hugenhard would never see the dawn. Sometime during the early evening hours the two would be killed & eaten by an older, desperate, hungry, grizzly bear that ironically enough, Treadwell had been filming & trying to communicate with earlier in the day.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is one of those films that sticks with you after you watch it. The films highlight's include a grizzly fight between two bears over the right to mate with one of the female bears, all nature footage shot by Treadwell, Treadwell's fox friends, the footage of Treadwell actually touching one of the grizzlies on the nose while filming with the hand held camera & the haunting images of Ammie who Treadwell never got a decent camera shot of (all the shots are in shadow or back to the camera, or her hair is over her face). Also some disturbing images that make one believe that Treadwell's mask of sanity was slowly slipping (the scene where he prays to God for rain is a bit much, but, then when it actually rains is even a bit more weird). The ranting of Treadwell & everything that was wrong in his life was absolute bonkers.<br /><br />There are some problems with this film however (henceforth, the three star rating).<br /><br />Werner Herzog himself narrated the film in his German accent & sound strained. He should have gotten a professional voice over artist for this.<br /><br />First off, here is a man who is clearly not in the right frame of mind "teaching" kids about grizzly bears. Not so much as teaching the class about grizzly bears but introducing the class to the bears who are his "friends".<br /><br />It's never shown what Treadwell did in the off season.<br /><br />It's never shown where Treadwell got his money for his equipment & supplies (sure one of the cameras was a Xmas gift but where did he get the other one from?).<br /><br />For me, the saddest part of all, is a tragic missed chance to really study & possibly learn more about the grizzly bear & it's habitat. Timothy Treadwell had a special gift, but, in my opinion, he never used it to the fullest extent. As for Timothy Treadwell, I hope has become one with the spirit of the Grizzly.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is a film that is worth seeing, but, like so many other mainstream films, doesn't live up to its own hype.<br /><br />You be the judge.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a very, very disturbing documentary about a sick individual, a man who re-named himself, "Timothy Treadwell: Kind Warrior. " The most alarming aspect of this biography may not be his lunacy but the huge of numbers of people out there who support a wacko like Treadwell. That's frightening.<br /><br />This was a very interesting film, but not one I would recommend particularly to my friends, at least those who are offended by the f-word. There are 50 cases of that in here so be forewarned. There are also a few short scenes that will visually disgust you. In other words, this is not an easy film to watch and "Grizzly Man" may sound like a nice Disney adventure but it is anything but family fare.<br /><br />The movie gets points for keeping one's attention and making us think about it, but a film on horrible car crashes could have the same shocking effect, so I wouldn't go overboard in praising this film just because it held our attention. Nonetheless, an intriguing film and one that should encourage intelligent debate, and for that, it's very good.<br /><br />Veteran German filmmaker Werner Herzog narrated and put together this film, from many hours of footage all shot by Treadwell. Suffice to say the documentary paints a disturbing portrait of a Far Left radical who goes way over the edge. If Treadwell was a Christian, the filmmakers would be quick to point out here is another "religous nut," but Treadwell was the opposite, a non-believer, a man who admitted he was clueless when it came to whether there is a God or not or what He would be called. I only mention this because Treadwell's atheism points out one of the dangers of it: you make up your own set of rights and wrongs, based solely on what pleases you, what you can live comfortably with, and it's extremely selfish and usually very destructive in the long run.<br /><br />Treadwell worshiped himself....period. He loved his looks, his courage, his noble actions, as he puts it, on and on. Just listen to him. That constant "I love you" to all the animals and even insects was another mask for his inability to adjust to his own human species and sexuality. In his selfishness, he forces himself on a world that wants no part of him and where he has no business being......all in the name of being this great protector of animals.<br /><br />An extremist like Treadwell winds up hurting his well-meaning environmental cause for the more sensible people who might be on his side, but at least have respect for laws, know the difference between humans and animals and have tolerance for all viewpoints. Treadwell cared only for himself, despite his claims, and to filmmaker Herzog's credit, he shows this.<br /><br />The real tragedy in the whole story was that someone else also died a horrible, violent, unnecessary death along with Treadwell. And - despite Treadwell and his friends opinions - human beings are far more precious than animals.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>This film is completely different from what I thought it was going to be:  a sensitive nature outing about a man who researched grizzly bears and advocated for them, only to be tragically killed by them.  Alas!  After reviewing the case, I must conclude the bloke was duly consumed.<br /><br />Yes, folks, this is a movie about one of the stupidest mortals to ever walk the earth in recent years.  Regardless of how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, you'll be completely dumbstruck -- enthralled -- by this movie, masterfully wrought by Werner Herzog.<br /><br />Perhaps you'd like to know:  the audio file of Timothy and Amy being eaten appears nowhere in the film, after the credits, or anywhere on this DVD in the special features.  The woman who possesses this tape (and you'll see her in the movie) hasn't released it to the public.<br /><br />I mention this because many people, I think, might buy the DVD thinking it's going to be on there somewhere.  No, the special features are crud:  no director's commentary, and a 50-minute documentary on the recording of the film's music, which is pretty much snoresville.<br /><br />There are no other special features whatsoever.<br /><br />And I love how Amazon makes it look like Amie Huguenard is "starring" in  it.  Sheesh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Grizzly Man" explores the life and death of naturalist and filmmaker Timothy Treadwell, who was killed in 2003, along with girlfriend Amie Huguenard, by one of the Alaskan grizzly bears he had spent over a decade trying to protect and befriend. But "Grizzly Man" doesn't cast Treadwell in the heroic light of a wildlife activist or the tragic pall of someone who met a gruesome death. Director Werner Herzog challenges Timothy Treadwell's world view just as he tries to faithfully present it. Treadwell spent 13 summers in remote Alaskan wilderness closely observing, filming, and attempting to socialize with grizzly bears. He shot 100 hours of footage of the bears and himself in the last 5 years, some of which we see in this film. His ebullient personality made him a popular bear educator with schoolchildren. But Timothy Treadwell's sentimental view of grizzly bears and of himself as their friend and protector was undoubtedly delusional. Herzog, who narrates the film, admires Treadwell's commitment to filmmaking but criticizes his self-serving view of nature.<br /><br />It is unclear what to make of Timothy Treadwell's obsession with Alaska's grizzly bears, and that's what makes "Grizzly Man" so interesting. The film isn't about wildlife conservation, a subject upon which it barely touches. Perhaps it is about self-delusion. Timothy Treadwell's self-appellation "kind warrior", his belief that a strong face could repel an aggressive bear, the idea that those bears paid any attention to him at all would be strictly comical if Treadwell were not an essentially sincere and likable character. He treated the bears not as wild animals or even as equals, but, bizarrely, as pets. He was an alcoholic who transferred his emotional needs to a fanatic defense of grizzly bears. But Treadwell didn't choose to fight for bears in need of protection. He chose to call himself "protector" of  the stable bear population on Kodiak Island.<br /><br />Yet Treadwell did get a lot of enviable film footage of those bears (by breaking the law). He did educate people about them. He had an appealing sense of humor and revealed more of himself on film than most people would dare. A guy on an ego trip? Certainly. Did he get what he asked for? Maybe. In the end a bear probably killed Treadwell simply because it was hungry, not because it was annoyed, which goes to show how completely indifferent the grizzlies were to Treadwell's efforts to live among them. Perhaps we are supposed to see some of Timothy Treadwell's self-delusion in ourselves. It's there in everyone. Treadwell's case is far from being the most destructive I've seen. But Werner Herzog has done a fantastic job of distilling it. And "Grizzly Man" is pretty even-handed in its sensitivity to Treadwell's supporters, detractors, observers, and to Treadwell himself.<br /><br />The DVD (Lion's Gate 2005): "In the Edges: The Grizzly Man Session" (53 min) is a chronicle of the 2-day recording session of "collective improvisation" in December 2004 for the film's score. Included are interviews with some of the musicians, who had never played together before, as well as interviews with Herzog and film editor Joe Bini. There are some interesting moments, but this featurette is way too long. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 ? min). Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog has pieced together the home movie footage of Tim Treadwell, a self-styled mountain man who attempted to co-exist with bears in the Alaskan wilds and eventually got eaten.  He also got his girlfriend eaten.<br /><br />It's a chilling, darkly ironic tale with an edge that's almost Pythonesque.<br /><br />It's also a stark, cold parable about self-delusion; the uncaring randomness of nature and fate; knowing one's limitations; and the perils of being an unwanted outsider.<br /><br />But I think the main thing viewers should and will take from this documentary is: Don't go where the bears are.  And if you must go where the bears are, don't mess with the bears.  You may think they are digging your Thoreau act, but they don't speak our language.  And they will eat you.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog has always directed unique and truthful films, but "Grizzly Man" is a special achievement.  Knowing from the start that the very animal he loves will kill Timothy Treadwell takes nothing from the impact of this film.  Treadwell's affection for grizzlies is simple and direct and he takes enormous pride in `protecting' these enormous creatures.  It isn't just that the film shots are simply amazing, but Treadwell has interjected many of his personal thoughts on his life and the world throughout the film, which Herzog carefully edits.  He states many times that he would rather be killed by a grizzly than to have one killed - a prophetic statement.<br /><br />There are tender and heartbreaking interviews with family and friends.  One learns as much about Timothy Treadwell's life as we do the bears.  Certainly Treadwell was a na?ve idealist, but he was able to overcome drug and alcohol abuse as well as the disappointment of coming close to acting fame.  He finally realized his calling in life and lives it fully to the end.  The combination of Treadwell's child-like irresponsibility and Herzog's vision of life as chaotic reality makes for a mesmerizing documentary.  It is beautiful and gut wrenching.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Initially, I wanted to trash this documentary because Tim Treadwell was just reckless with his life and his girlfriend's with these dangerous encounters with the grizzly bears.  And what's with this "13 summers" with the bears.  As if his survival from these 13 summers is a validation for his reason for exploring on dangerous territories.<br /><br />But then I think, how is Treadwell different from the likes of Steve Irwins and other animal behaviorists, scientists, etc.?  Don't they all risk their lives when exploring animals, especially those who are exotic, territorial and/or menacing?<br /><br />The thing about *The Grizzly Man* was that I found it to be boring and redundant.  Initially, about the first half-hour, it was interesting as we  see Treadwell educating us about the lives of these bears.  After that, it went downhill.  How many times can you replay the death scenario as well as drag it on and on?<br /><br />This could have simply been made an half-hour special on PBS or the Animal Planet channel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This man who lives in Alaska who loves bears so much he says he will protect them from danger.

In one instance, he claims that the face of the bear represents the monumental indifference of nature, in another; he claims that male bears sometimes kill their offsprings in order to terminate the lactation period of their females for the sake of practicing fornication. What a bizarre and distorted contradiction! How would an indifferent animal reason with such purposeful intent? Then he throws that ridiculous advice: "you shouldn't love the bear, you should respect him!!" That is enlightening. The producer's claim that Timothy Treadwell wished to be a bear is also unjustified. The man was simply overcome by the feat of his addiction to drugs and deprived from any wisdom or patience. He sought proximity to the menace of grizzly bears as a jolt to his numb mind. You could easily feel his fear and awe when those animals slowly and calmly approached him. His reactions portray a man frightened to death and expecting sudden ambush at any minute. His lack of inhibition is what drove him to overreach to his death.<br /><br />The producer imposes his conforming rules of not allowing viewers to listen to the last words of a couple killed by bear without weighing the consequences of tampering with a true story. He claims to dignify the right of the dead. Along the same lines, the producer permits lengthy scenes of a deranged man cursing the department of wild life services for setting strict access rules to the protected refuge, then claims that he does not condone such behavior. As if the viewers have to be lectured by Werner Herzog on the etiquette of respecting authority or the right of the dead.<br /><br />The people that appear in the movie representing Tim's friends, parents, acquaintance, the forensic expert, and the producer are total misfits. Tim's friends, aside from being low-livers, did not shed any light on what drove him to run away from society other than his long addiction to drugs and alcohol. The forensic expert did a lousy job as an actor and stayed unduly long time after reading his script. As if the cameraman was not told to move on to the next shot. That expert claims that the remains of Tim and his girl friend were extracted from the dissected guts of the killed bear. Then he goes on to explain how the bear gouged Tim's scalp then turned to his hip. How did he arrive to that conclusion with such skimpy remains? The obnoxious woman who pretends to be the ex-girl friend was put on camera for no obvious reason other than filling long minutes with nonsense.<br /><br />One could easily find much better quality filming in Disney movies, National Geographic documentaries, or the Discovery Channel. I believe that the producer's narcissism led to his exaggeration of his skills and underestimating the intelligence of movie viewers.  Had the producer kept his nose out of the essence of a true story, the movie might have met some success.<br /><br />Mohamed F.

Werner Herzog is an amazing man and I in a small way now understand why he made this movie. After watching more of his works like 'Little Dieter needs to Fly', I've come to the reasons of why he does this types of movies. I'm giving this three stars now for knowing who the Director is and NOT because of that story of a Deluded man-boy who by his own actions killed a women for his pride.<br /><br />The man within this movie was real. That is the only truth within that is undeniable, but to place such praise on this one individual who "fought the man" to protect one single animal that was never endangered was ludicrous from the very start. Soulful music and "grand" over-reaching narration does not make ones' tale epic. So driven was this man that he ignored all those danger signs about a Wild Animal and while he himself was narrating his "sad" tale he was attacked and mauled by the very animal he believed he was protecting. How do I know this? Because his recorder was still on while the bear was Tearing him apart.<br /><br />(REDACTED)<br /><br />No. It as I wrote before, glosses over his end with a tragic soulful farewell speech about how "noble" this deranged person was and that what his activities where truly for...<br /><br />(REDACTED)<br /><br />Remember that if you decide to buy this video.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>One of the most troubling aspects of contemporary American culture is the way in which it seems to engender an enforced emotional estrangement from the natural world taken in its own context and substitutes solipsistic fantasies on its citizens. Thus we have nitwits so completely out of touch with the realities of the natural world beyond man's realm that they try to keep Bengal tigers as house pets, or release alligators into local ponds. Yet nowhere are the tragic consequences of such a debilitating divorce from natural reality more evident than in "Grizzly Man" an absolutely compelling, artful, and horrific cinematic look by renowned director Werner Herzog at Timothy Treadwell, a man who attempted to bridge the gap between the world of man-made artifice and the natural world of nature.<br /><br />Herzog focuses his lens and his fascinating documentary on the life and death of Treadwell, a man who leapt quite suddenly and unexpectedly from his boring and evidently stultifying suburban lifestyle to quickly and famously establish himself, literally in mid-life, as a singular personality, a self-fashioned and self-educated grizzly bear scholar, as indeed, the one man who manages successfuly to live among the bears. This is as in 'grizzly bears', the largest, most awesome, and most terrifyingly predatory mammal this since of 19th century hominads.<br /><br />For those of us raised on the over-sweet sacharrined sensibilities of Television-land's Grizzly Adams, a handsome and rugged cuss whose best buddy and constant companion is a congenial and photogenic grizzly bear named Gentle Ben, a more accurate look beyond this Hollywood confection into the terrifying reality of just how powerful a force of nature these bears represent is mind-boggling, and is done with both considerable dramatic flair and a dollap of deadly detail offering a heady if troubling glimpse into the edgy psyche of someone over-the top enough to attempt this wild-eyed venture into the habitat of the grizzly bear, a man who manages successfully to reinvent himself as a born-again naturalist-celebrity, one minute covorting on the David Letterman show and promoting his colorful monographs detailing the world of the Ursus Terribilis, and the next minute treading with abandon, panache and pluck into the lair of the bears.<br /><br />Werner Herzog directs and produces this film in a way that lays out in all its compelling complexity the remarkable irony of Treadwell's star-crossed life, someone who on one hand seems so relaxed, so knowledgable, and so lovingly concerned with the bears, and yet on the other hand appears to have been a man  whose own personal recklessness and interpretation and understanding of the natural world is somehow romanticized to an extent sufficient enough for him to suffer a fatal mauling by a bear after pitching his tent unknowingly in a grizzly feeding ground, a fact which the director obviously feels to be directly related to Treadwell's dreamy and sometimes arrogant indifference about his precariously presumptuous relationship with the bears. Substitute the term 'grizzly bear' with that of 'great white shark', and one can begin to recognize the preposterous nature of this continuing attempt to live among the bears. Without being too trite, think "Jaws" with claws, and you can understand the all-too predictable nature of his eventual mauling, murder and ingestion by a 1000 pound male grizzly bear.<br /><br />Finally, then, the author's final fate is dealt to him by the very impersonal and cruel indifference of nature that he so casually misunderstands, and one feels in viewing the film that this unoftunate end to Treadwell's life was a highly predictable event, although it seems to be an especially lurid and even sensational avenue that offers the film-goer a unique opportunity to investiage and explore the margins of Treadwell's admittedly brilliant albeit unconventional attempt to bridge the gap between the world of humans and those of the natural world. Unfortunately for the "Grizzly Man" of the title, Treadwell attempted once too often to interact on his own terms rather than those of the bears. So, while it is sometimes a bit too graphic and blood-thirsty (as when they are describing a re-creation of the six-minute plus mauling and eating of the author and his companion), it is a wonderful movie, one that serves to remind us in quite powerful terms that out in the natural world, beyond the man-made artificialities we all mistake for incontrovertible reality, there still live such terrifying creatures for whom we are nothing more substantial than the afternoon's groceries. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>After reading his book and now watching this documentary, I began to realized one major factor in this universe that cannot be denied, Alaskan grizzly bears must be one of the most tolerance creatures on earth.<br /><br />Okay, now that the joke is over, I am musing why this documentary was made and for what purpose? In one hand, you have the friends of Timothy Treadwell trying to rise him into a mythical status. Then you have Timothy Treadwell himself as the main attraction who basically behaved like some sort of man-child who seem to be suffering from borderline paranoid schizophrenic who anthropomorphized wild bears. I think this is where Treadwell totally missed the boat for all to see. He forgot that bears and man don't mixed, which means he and the bears shouldn't mixed. When a bear get too comfort with a man, that bear usually dies by the hand of man and his rifle. That is one of the basic rules living in Alaska. In one of the great ironies of Treadwell is how possessive he was becoming toward the bears as if he had ownership rights and park services "don't care" about them. In this, Treadwell become an unarmed proacher himself, by interfering with the bears' natural state. It was also weird to listened to Treadwell talked about how dangerous bears can be and all that - but yet ignoring his own warnings, relying on some sort of special karma he thinks he have with the bears. His arrogance and ignorance is appalling to say the least.<br /><br />This DVD reflects the man who was willing to break all the rules to protect a host of animals who in his extreme paranoia, believed to be hunted down without respite. Over 100 hours of video tapes have par down to show us what kind of man Timothy Treadwell was when he was in Alaska and to most outdoorsy type Alaskans like myself, it wasn't a very pretty sight. I supposed you got give this guy credit, he was very stupid but also very true to his nature and cause. His end was almost poetic justice although it was with deep regret that he took an innocent life with him.<br /><br />Overall, a well made documentary, well edited and although it does dragged somewhat thanks to some dry spots like that interview with Treadwell's former girlfriend which I agreed with one of the previous reviewers, it served no purpose at all in this documentary. That time should have been spend on the woman who died with Treadwell, whose only major mistake she made in her life was trusting him.<br /><br />The DVD that come with this film is basically your stripped down version. There is a 50 minutes extra feature on how they created the soundtrack for this movie. A very dry and somewhat uninteresting segment. Then there is only the trailer for this movie and trailers for several Lion Gates films. The DVD image proves to be quite good, since much of it is from Treadwell's own tapes, super movie like sharpness probably cannot be attained. The sound is your basic 2 speaker Dolby Surround Sound. I would recommend this DVD only if to educated people how not to behaved around bears.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog (Director) puts this documentary into a visible masterpiece of a man gone awry. Timothy Treadwell's one hundred plus hours of video footage is condensed into a two hour storyline that borderlines schizophrenic.<br /><br />Werner Herzog combines interviews of friends, lovers, DNR employees and parents to try to make sense of a man and his obsession with grizzly bears. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years in the Alaska Katmai National Park and reserve observing and naming all of the grizzlies that he encounters. Some think that Timothy was acting out as a grizzly. He was acting and thinking like a grizzly in his eyes. The video gives insight into Timothy's modus vivendi.<br /><br />  The last five seasons he brought along a video camera. The grizzly video is visually remarkable.  The video of Timothy talking into the camera trying to convince the viewers to understand his love for the bears is like watching a man with a death wish. Towards the end of his death the video clearly shows his lost sense of reality. He really thinks that the grizzlies are his friends and not food.<br /><br />Every viewer clearly understands that these are wild animals. The video takes me back to the first "Blair Witch Project" when everyone thought it was real. I felt lucky that was not me in that video. Same of this one, but this video is REAL. And it shows how a man can lose his sense of reality. As seen through the lens of a camera.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>This movie is PAINFUL to watch! At every moment you cringe and wince at the cheesiness that spoken by this insane lunatic...Your mouth gapes open with horror and disbelief as he pets GIANT HUNGRY PREDATORS and talks to them as if they are puppies. The bears don't look at him like they love him or are "bonding" with him. They just look at him like, "What is that THING doing in our home? Maybe if we ignore it, it'll go away!" and they are pretty much indifferent and just seem to be tolerating him rather than befriending him. This is obvious to everyone except for Timothy Treadwell.<br /><br />No joke folks. Timothy Treadwell actually caresses bear poop in this movie and goes on about how it's still warm and (ew!) just was in her. Then he goes on about how `perfect' the bears are. It's creepy, it's disturbing and I confess at times the movie is downright laughable. This movie is a train wreck but for a different reason than many other movies. It is the true and tragic story that proves how real life can sometimes be crazier than fiction. At this point in the movie I was like "Okay, this man is officially whacko!" and yet I couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />There is some beautiful wildlife and nature footage but this movie isn't about wildlife.  It is more of a statement about the nature of human mental illness. It is about one sick, delusional, self-centered and basically insane man who thinks he is some kind of "bear whisperer" and he spends 13 summers with them claiming he is 'protecting' them from poachers...Huge scary animals with big claws and teeth who live in a PROTECTED park...clearly what they needed was an effeminate buffoon there to protect them for a few months a year, right? Um, NOT! Also, how is a buffoon with no weapons supposed to protect huge, scary animals from scary guys with guns? One has to wonder...<br /><br />Tim Treadwell ended up doing far more harm to the bears than good. If he "loved" these animals as much as he claimed he would have realized the best thing for them is to stay WILD and thus, to stay away from humans. Instead, Treadwell spends much of the movie baby talking to these huge beasts as if they were teddy bears. All the while the bears seem to be merely tolerating him. The "bond" that he imagines between him and the animals seem more like a fantasy imagined in his own mind. It is clear that he wants to escape the human world and puts the world of bears up on a pedestal as if it were some high school clique he is trying to fit into.<br /><br />He sits curled up in his tent with stuffed teady bears (again no joke) making videos while real, dangerous bears lurk outside. He is supposedly this "rugged" mountain man yet we never see him in dirty clothing or shoes, his hair is always trimmed in the same bowl-haircut (with a matching colorful bandana) and his face is always clean shaven. If he was some tough mountain man, why wouldn't we see him with scraggly hair and a beard? Yet we don't. We see him go on long-winded, emotional, angry rants about the park rangers, the human world and society and even his own (questionable) sexuality.<br /><br />As it was said so well in the movie, Tim crossed the invisible line that exists between man and nature. We should fear wild animals and they should fear us. Both are safer this way. If we DO choose to observe wild animals in their natural habitat, we should respect their home and obey safety rules. Wild animals should stay wild and those of us who truly are `at one' with nature recognize this. We are HUMAN and this means we should use our large brain to make educated decisions like keeping ourselves and the wilderness we love safe from harm.<br /><br />Chances are, you already know how the movie ends but you have to see the movie to really understand the madness that is Timothy Treadwell. This isn't a movie about bears. This is a movie about a man losing touch with reality. Tim became so lost in nature that he forgot the natural order of things...The natural order that says bigger predators eat smaller ones! Tim forgot that humans are a predator too and we have HANDS so we can carry WEAPONS! "Kind warriors" were probably not the reason that humans survived. We survived because most of us have the common sense to either AVOID or KILL a huge predator like a bear! Most humans in our history probably had the common sense to NOT do the things that Timothy did...but we see early on that Tim isn't like most human beings!<br /><br />Bears are dangerous wild animals. People can try to `befriend' them in the wild, feed them, put them in circuses and make them jump through hoops but the fact remains they are and will always be WILD and DANGEROUS! If they don't eat us it is because they aren't hungry enough...Unfortunately for Tim, the bear that ate him just happened to be hungry that day. The bear also wasn't afraid of humans probably because Tim had `bonded' with them and didn't use bear spray...Didn't use a harmless pepper spray to scare off a HUGE animal that can tear a human to pieces...a weapon that could have saved the lives of two humans and the bear.<br /><br />As far as this being a "good" or "bad" movie, really it is hard to say. It is a REAL movie and reality can be harsh and nature can be cruel. Some people might say it is exploitive but I think it is educational. I think this is a story that is better off being told. I don't think I would buy this movie but I would probably watch it again. If you are the type who hates to know the ending, DON'T watch this because the ending is obvious to everyone but sadly for Timothy, he could not see the obvious until it was literally biting his head off.<br /><br />My hope is that this film serves as a warning for people. Someone out there might see this and say "Maybe it ISN'T a good idea to make friends with ___(insert dangerous wild animal) I could get eaten like Tim Treadwell!" For that and that I give it four stars, not because it was a great movie but because it has a great message. Herzog didn't lie or bend the truth. He used the footage that told a very sad and very true story and he lets us be the judge. If you love this movie or if you hate it, if you think Timothy deserved his fate or if you don't one thing is certain: After watching this you probably WON'T want to go on any camping trips in the Alaska wilderness!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>The love-it or hate-it responses of the Amazon viewership to Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man illustrate quite nicely the theory that art exists not wholly formed on the page, canvas or celluloid, but somewhere between the viewer and the "text". If you come to this film expecting a beautifully shot wild-life documentary and hoping  for a picturesque education about bears and the Alaskan wilderness, you'll be sorely disappointed. The wildlife footage - some quite remarkable, notwithstanding - was shot by a paranoid loner on a handycam. You'll also have no-one to blame but yourself, since nothing about the film, even down to its name, let alone its maker, is suggestive for a moment that that's what it's about.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you come armed with some background knowledge about German director Werner Herzog and what he's about - not ordinarily a documentary maker as such, although some of his feature films have an almost documentary quality to them as studies in human obsession  (not least his own) - your expectations will be quite different, and I dare say your reaction to Grizzly Man will be too.<br /><br />Over forty years Herzog has obsessionally directed obsessional actors (Bruno S, Klaus Kinski) depicting obsessional/delusional figures (Kinski as a psychopathic conquistador <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305972761">Aguirre</a> searching for El Dorado, a barmy opera nut <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ODHV">Fitzcarraldo</a> with a dream of bringing high art to the deepest recesses of the Amazon rainforest, and as the good Count in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YJMX">Nosferatu: The Vampyre</a>; Bruno S as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R248">Kaspar Hauser</a>, a man trapped from birth  for 20 years in a windowless dungeon in rural Germany, or in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059PPT">Stroszek</a> as a man resemblent of himself vainly trying to escape his condemning past by going to America), in obsessional ways (Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo both filmed on location; in Aguirre Herzog allegedly held Kinski at gunpoint to prevent him walking out; in Fitzcarraldo when the script called for a paddle steamer being pushed by hand over the crest from one valley to the next, Herzog required his cast to actually carry out the operation).<br /><br />Seen in this context, Timothy Treadwell represents almost found-object sculpture for Herzog: you couldn't make this up, and for much of the documentary, Herzog is arranger, art director and chief contextualiser; providing background interview material only to back up his own view of the world, which he openly concedes is quite contrary to Treadwell's (such as it was a coherent world-view). So to complain that Herzog is distorting; contorting; contriving an outcome is also (to my mind) to miss the point.  Yes, he is, just as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939594102">Marcel Duchamp</a> was contorting the true purpose of a urinal by inverting it, signing it, and entering it in an art exhibition. That's what artists do.<br /><br />While it may be selectively edited, it is difficult, all the same, to conceive that what Herzog left out might negative the impression that Treadwell was an ignorant, paranoid, delusional burn-out, and that his most impressive achievement was not being eaten earlier.<br /><br />Contrary to some reviews here Herzog is not by any means completely unsympathetic to Treadwell, but he sees him not as a naturalist but a natural film-maker. Some of the footage - when Treadwell can keep his sorry face out of it - is quite extraordinary, and reminiscent of some of the German director's own impressionist output, as Herzog remarks. As he was director, cameraman and star, Treadwell often had no alternative but to leave the camera running, and Herzog draws our attention to it - the random play of rushes in blustery wind reminiscent of the opening scene from The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, which reflects on a ripe stand of barley in much the same way. And the final shot of the film, wherein we see Treadwell hiking away from the camera towards the perils of nature - bears, mountains, brewing inclement weather - is not unreminiscent of Bruno Ganz's departure into the Transylvanian mountains to confront the count in Nosferatu.<br /><br />There are some aspects of the film I found less persuasive, and in particular Herzog's melodramatic decision to film himself listening, on earphones, to an audio-tape of Treadwell's actual death, then commending its possessor, a former girlfriend of Treadwell, to destroy it without listening. Herzog has managed to find a consistently weird cast of hangers on, ex lovers and Treadwell fans - and the oddest coroner I've ever seen - to backfill Treadwell's story - and while this does lend proceedings the unfortunate air of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305922756">Christopher Guest mockumentary</a>, I expect it is no more than anyone would find if one poked around in remote Alaska long enough.<br /><br />I loved this film. If you did, I would heartily recommend a look at Herzog's classic seventies output in particular featuring Klaus Kinski, which is anthologised in a pretty economical single edition: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YKXQ">Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski: A Film Legacy</a><br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>When I checked out this movie, I had heard enough about Timothy Treadwell to expect more Steve Irwin than Jane Goodall. Still, I was hoping for some serious enlightment about the ways of bears. I was disappointed. There's precious little enlightenment to be had in this documentary. Aside from one sequence showing two male bears violently clashing over territory/mating rights - you won't see much about bear behavior at all. You will mostly see Treadwell making a spectacle of himself, prancing his way to his ultimate tragedy, strewing self-aggrandizement, goofy bear names, and irrelevant asides as he goes.<br /><br />I was prepared to place almost all the blame for this on Treadwell himself. But then I read additional material about him that said he really did videotape thousands of hours of telling bear behavior and took thousands of pictures during his thirteen years in Alaska among the grizzlies. So the fact that there is so little substance in this film may be largely the fault of producer Werner Herzog.<br /><br />Herzog makes grand claims of significance for this movie, as he does for most of his projects. But he is being his usual pompous, pretentious self, and betrays Treadwell and the bears in the process.<br /><br />The only worthwhile part of this DVD is in the bonus material. Herzog is shown here helping coach the orchestra in composing and performing the sound track for the film. The resulting music is haunting and beautiful, with a feel for wild, wide-open spaces. They produce a musical theme worthy of Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />But otherwise, don't waste your money on this movie. If you want insights into bear behavior, you'd do better to check out the Discovery Channel film made about Treadwell. Or better yet, read a book such as Nick Jans' recently published The Grizzly Maze. Treadwell is there, in all his goofiness and ardor. But so are the bears.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>This was a fascinating documentary about a nature lover who lived alongside grizzly bears for 13 years.  Although his life ended sadly, I felt up to a point, he deserved what he got.  To me, he seemed like a self-absorbed jerk throughout the entire movie.  He refers to himself in the 3rd person ("Timothy rules!").  That is one sign of a egotistical maniac.  His behavior was really immature and childish, and the more I watched the video, the less sympathy I had for him.  He did not realize that nature is indifferent to anything and everything.  Nature will try to survive regardless of who or what it has to swallow.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Grizzly Man is the story of a man named Timothy Treadwell, a guy who spent 13 different summers living in the Alaskan wilderness with many different grizzly bears. He spent more than a 100 hours of videotaping the bears and himself living with them in their forestes and fields. This is one of the best documentaries ever made about how this man lived and breathed wild life.<br /><br />The documentary goes on to show how Timothy lived and died with what he loved so much. His death was very tragic to both friends and family but even they say if he was killed by a grizzly bear it would be the one way he would have liked to have gone.<br /><br />The documentary is filled with hundreds of beautiful shots of landscape. Mountains, lakes, streams, grass fields, and forests show just what Timothy loved to do and film. He made friends with foxes as well as bears and had names for what seemed like 2 dozen different seperate animals. What amazes me is that he remember the names for each animal and didn't even once seem to mix them up. Thats how long he lived out in the wild.<br /><br />The documentary cuts from different shots of Timothy and what he dealt with besides videotaping the grizzlies. From yelling up at god, or allah, or "That floating Hindu thing" as he called it for a rainstorm to come so the salmon could swim upstream and the bears could eat, to watching people actually have the nerve to throw rocks at bears as they came to close as he hid in the bushes nearby.<br /><br />A lot of different people who knew Timothy talked about how they knew Timothy and what they thought about what he did and how he died. While some say he actually got what he deserved [I personally disagree] to others who say he hated civillization compared to life in the wild, everyone seemed to agree that Timothy loved what he was doing and that he would never hurt a Grizzly bear on purpose.<br /><br />The story is very gripping and just watching how Timothy talks about the bears and how he manages to approach them almost to where he could reach out and touch them is fascinating enough.<br /><br />This is one documentary that you need to see for many reasons; for the scenery, for the footage of the great bears and foxes, to seeing friends and family spread the ashes of Timothy in a emotional scene, this is definately worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog, who gave us Fitzcarraldo, (one of the best movies ever made), is really in his element here.  No one understands obsession and madness quite like he does and in Timothy Treadwell he has found a perfect subject. One imagines, at first, a well-meaning introvert more at home in nature than in society. What emerges is a descent into madness and delusion played out in high stakes gaming before a spectacular natural backdrop.<br /><br />Treadwell sees himself as defender, protector, and advocate for these wild and often vicious behemoths who, ironically, are already being defended and protected in a National Park. As Herzog demonstrates, Treadwell created an elaborate mythology about himself, one major lie is that he was alone - for much of the time he wasn't. As the movie develops Treadwell's rants become increasingly shrill and desperate as he labors to convince himself and us that his uninformed and pointless dare-devil antics actually have meaning.<br /><br />We can be awed by his insane recklessness but to think that he contributed anything, as he claimed, is ludicrous. Maybe Treadwell swapped his addiction to booze for an addiction to adrenaline. He certainly didn't help the bears any, indeed, he did them a disservice. What makes this film so fascinating is how accurately Herzog captures Treadwell's many personas. Treadwell was quite literally the writer, director, producer, star, (and in an odd way also audience), for his own movie, carefully manipulating and deceiving viewers. If there is anyone who is surprised by his fate just remember that he choreographed it painstakingly and when it arrived probably greeted it with something resembling religious ecstasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>There are certain themes that never tire - such as man's humility in the face of nature.  Grizzly Man is such a story.  The ironic thing is that Timothy Treadwell thought that he was on the right side of that equation; arguing for the preservation of animals.  Yet, as you watch this fascinating documentary, you see Treadwell slipping into what can only be called madness.  I kept thinking of Captain Ahab as Treadwell yelled at the sky to rain.  He preferred the bear's world to man's world.  The problem was, he seemed to think that made him a bear.<br /><br />Yet, Treadwell is a likeable guy.  He's like a slightly nuttier version of the Crocodile Guy (if you can imagine such a thing).  You root for him, even though you know he will get eaten.  Yet, he knew the dangers he faced and he wouldn't have done anything differently had he known his fate.  Sane or insane, Grizzly Man is the story of a man who brought meaning to his life...even though his lifestyle eventually killed him.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>I had heard of the Treadwell tragedy but knew little about the man himself.<br /><br />Watching this documentary, if one did not know it was based on a true story you would think it was a comical spoof of some sort.<br /><br />Everybody in the film from the coroner to ex-friends of Treadwell act like oddities.<br /><br />Treadwell himself we learn was not a true naturalist but instead seemed to be some burned out surfer dude from California with a mental imbalance of some sort and a warped sense of reality.<br /><br />The guy was seriously mentally offbalance.<br /><br />Watching this documentary you realize Treadwell was not in ove with the Grizzly as much as he was with himself.<br /><br />This would have been a much more powerful story if the subject in question was a true naturalist who truly did some good for the Grizzly instead of some self-proclaimed whacko who fabricated 1/2 of his stories.<br /><br />It is of course tragic that he was mauled by bears, but somehow it is harder to empathize when he was basically over the line and recklessly putting himself at risk all the time instead of treating bears with respect and observing them without interference.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Werner Herzog was given a strange mission with the film, "Grizzly Man." How do you take 100's of hours of tape made by a delusional, self-centered and mentally imbalanced man who is ultimately killed (along with the poor woman he drags along after him) by his obsession with Alaskan Grizzlies and make him someone somewhat sympathetic? The documentary manages to do just that, with Herzog inserting himslef as a conscience/narrator into the tapes of naturalist and self-described "kind warrior" Timothy Treadwell. For over a decade of summers, Treadwell would haul himself to Alaska, embed himself in a State Park and try to become one with the grizzlies.<br /><br />Yes, you're right...anyone with a lick of sense would see this as a fool's errand, and the movie doesn't even bother to hide that fact by mentioning at the beginning that Treadwell and lady friend Amie Huguenard become lunch for a "bear full of people and clothes." Treadwell fails to recognize what Herzog knows by instinct and a few millenniums of evolution; nature is "chaos, hostility, and murder." Treadwell looks at nature as some sort of Disney-fied harmony, where if you just dance with the animals, they'll be your friends and all will live in the big unity of the universe. This despite ample evidence to the contrary (adult males eating cubs to foster mating with females, the killing of one of his fox pup 'friends'); Treadwell rails on about the bear world versus the people world.<br /><br />Herzog keeps Treadwell from looking like a blithering idiot by balancing some of the most intimate footage you'll probably ever see of bears in the wild and commentary from both the friends and enemies of Treadwell, and ultimately sacrificing an opportunity to exploit Treadwell and Amie's death. A narcissist to the very end, Treadwell had a camera running even as he and Amie were being attacked and killed, and Herzog makes the decision to not include the audio (the lens cap was still on the camera) or include the pictures from the coronor, going as far as to implore one of Treadwell's few friends to destroy the final tape and never look back. It's Herzog's sense of compassion for his subject (aided by a terrific score by guitarist Richard Thompson), even as he understands the madness, that makes "Grizzly Man" so compelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>GRIZZLY MAN (Dir., narr. Werner Herzog, 2005, 103 minutes, for The Discovery Channel) is a cautionary, spooky documentary that carries a spooky title. Here Herzog investigates the backstory of one Timothy Treadwell, a/k/a "The Grizzly Man", a well-known environmentalist kook who got himself (and his poor girlfriend Amy) eaten by a brown grizzly bear in Alaska on 5 October, 2003.<br /><br />"That bear was full of people and clothes," comments one interviewee - and it gave me shivers. Herzog's gentle, hissing German-accented narration heightens this story of a dishonest, mentally ill adventurer who began dreaming of being a bear and ended by willingly sacrificing himself to the one who killed him. Herzog praises Treadwell's spirit and work, respecting him to the point of disagreeing with his stance as a naturalist. Of course, Treadwell was a loser with apparently no brains at all.<br /><br />Treadwell (an adopted phony surname) was a native of Long Island, New York. A big, muscular and beautiful blonde, he obviously struggled with his gayness and simply could not live with it. At an early age he drank and drugged, eventually posing as an Australian orphan. Due to his silly accent and mental imbalance, no one ever believed him. He found himself reborn as a naturalist when he realized he could simply go out to Alaska, camp in the "wilderness" (the national park actually) and there commune with the real bears. This was a man who had cuddled teddy bears well into his young adulthood.<br /><br />"I always wished I was gay," Treadwell says in one of his rambling films, and in the space of two minutes says the word "gay" a dozen times. But he insisted how straight he was, and lived that way. Herzog encountered at least three women who clearly loved Treadwell. In turn, Treadwell essentially used them.<br /><br />In this newly invented life as an environmentalist, Treadwell would try to cuddle up to real bears. Running through women like socks, he managed to found Grizzly People, a conservationist group dedicated to the bears. The work and Treadwell's wildlife films may be laudable; Treadwell himself was not. He was a selfish, foolish idiot who began to believe more than anyone in this character he had created: the dedicated naturalist/activist. "The Kind Warrior", he called himself, while Herzog repeatedly comments that Treadwell was insane. "I have seen this [type of] madness on the film set," Herzog says of him.<br /><br />As usual, Herzog is thorough, he is fair, he is understanding - and he is taken with Treadwell's wildlife film footage. He speaks to everyone from the Alaskan locals who despised Treadwell to the women who allied themselves with Treadwell. Herzog interviews the medical examiner, who waxes poetic about the last minutes of Treadwell's life, and that of his intrepid girlfriend Amy. It is a harrowing story, and the examiner loses himself in the emotion of recounting Treadwell's final moments. Herzog later weeps, his back to the camera, as he listens to the audio of these moments which were captured in full. He tells Treadwell's former girlfriend and colleague, "You must never listen to this" and admonishes her to destroy the recording. No images exist because they had no time to remove the lens cap prior to the bear attack.<br /><br />It was simply an angry, half-starved bear who decided these two humans would be a good meal. "He got what he deserved," one local remarks to Herzog. After seeing the true toll of Treadwell's mental illness and his struggle against homosexuality, I was nauseated, fed up and exhausted. I do not know if you could stand the footage of Treadwell - and I am not sure whether the audio of his death is worse than seeing the film footage of his so-called life.<br /><br />Herzog always makes one think and retreat into oneself in a wonderful way. Here, he made me fully realize I have no respect for those who have no respect for nature. Perhaps that was Herzog's intention. Herzog says the universe is ruled by chaos and murder - something he says Treadwell ought to have understood but did not.<br /><br />Mr. Herzog, great genius of film and documentation, I disagree: the universe is ruled by STUPIDITY and the senseless death of Treadwell and Amy is the proof. Though I am addicted to Herzog's documentaries (see my review of the stunning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037EAJA2">Encounters at the End of the World</a>), I will not be adding this one to my collection.<br /><br />Stupidity is stupidity, and even a cautionary documentary by Werner Herzog will not soften that hard truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Yes, Timothy Treadwell was certainly narcissistic; he clearly tried to create a personality that screamed "hey, look at me!"  And his life among the bears was just as much about filling certain voids, disappointments, and shortcomings in his own life as it was about protecting the animals.<br /><br />But, oh, those animals.  There was a genuine rapport between Mr. Treadwell and his subjects.  It wasn't just in his head.  The way those little foxes followed him around all during the movie (playing with him, sitting on the roof of his tent, etc.) will break your heart.  Maybe the bears ultimately didn't have a clue, but those little foxes knew that Timothy Treadwell, whatever else was going on in his head, genuinely loved the wild denizens of the Alaskan wilderness.  So, for me, the central tragedy of the movie resonated well beyond feelings of "well, his death was a shame but he kind of asked for it."  Or, to put it another way, though a definite animal lover, this cynical reviewer doesn't usually anthropomorphize our four-legged friends, but I somehow know that those foxes mourned and were saddened by their strange human companion Timothy Treadwell, so that made me mourn Mr. Treadwell, too, at least more than I would have otherwise, if I'm honest.<br /><br />On the special features front, an excellent look at the scoring sessions of the film, rich with comments and input by director Werner Herzog, further enhanced this special little film.  I enjoy special features that genuinely illuminate the creative objectives of a film's director, and the way his or her process fulfills those objectives, and this fifty-plus minute extra feature did that nicely.<br /><br />This unique film, perhaps the first genuine "constructed from found footage" project (unlike the enjoyable yet ersatz docs "The Blair Witch Project" and "Cloverfield) is highly recommended for documentary fans. Its strange and moving portrait is one for the ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Why is glorifying the insane and stupid an American obsession over the last couple of decades? The documentary Grizzly Man does not attempt to answer this query, yet it does its best to bring this tendency to its odd apogee, and is literally unlike any other documentary film I've ever seen. Coming off his participation in the great mockumentary Incident At Loch Ness, it should not come as a surprise that German filmmaker par excellence, Werner Herzog, would stick with the documentary format in this, his latest film. No, it is not a nature documentary, as most film critics, including Roger Ebert, have written, simply because it follows a man who spent thirteen consecutive summers filming grizzlies on an Alaskan wildlife refuge, Katmai National Park, on Kodiak Island, but a documentary whose subject matter is a man's flaming insanity, as it charts the life and death of a fey, severely mentally ill blond man with a Prince Valiant haircut, originally from Long Island, New York, named Timothy Treadwell, who spent summers filming bears, and the rest of the year going to schools, showing his films freely.<br />  I get tired of books and films devoted to the worst in society- the insane, criminal, selfish, greedy, shallow, etc. While watching the tale of this supposedly reformed drug addicted alcoholic-cum-New Age weirdo, I could not help but compare his life and death to that of another deluded narcissist who perished over a decade earlier than Treadwell, also in the wilds of a Alaska- Chris McCandless, whose delusions of being one with nature led to his death in 1992, chronicled in adventure writer Jon Krakauer's bestselling book Into The Wild. McCandless was another bored, spoiled, upper middle class white boy whose easy life was seen as something `terrible' to deal with. So, he bummed around the country, using many aliases- including Alexander Supertramp, until he decided he would go and rough it in the Alaskan wilds, alone and ill-prepared. That he ended up starving to death in an abandoned bus made him a hero to addle-minded nature buffs, and a target of scorn to Alaska natives who respect nature, and resent twits like McCandless being seen as anything other than the fools they were. Yet, Treadwell was worse, and his end even more ignominious, because not only did he get himself killed and eaten by a bear, but also his 37 year old blond girlfriend- Amy Huguenard. And, when he died in 2003, Treadwell was 46 years old, while McCandless was only half that age upon his death in 1992.<br />  Yet, there is no denying Treadwell, was mentally unhinged, even as Herzog rapturously declaims his filmic abilities with a camera, and imbues the most banal shots with an intent and skill that just is not there onscreen, lacking any real style. Herzog must have had to tell himself this to justify his fascination with Treadwell's bizarre antics.... I would have cut the film thirty to forty of its one hour forty-five minute running time, because much gets repetitive. This is a film worth seeing, but only if you bear in mind the wisdom of one of the helicopter pilots who flew home the duo's remains. He calls Treadwell a retard, then states, `He was treating them like people in bear costumes. He got what he deserved,' a statement echoed by a Native American Kodiak Island museum director, who says, `My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.'<br />  That Treadwell did not only begs the question I opened this review with- why does Herzog feel this man's stupidity and idiocy are worth glorifying in film? Especially when he clearly believes Treadwell's philosophy is wrong. Where Treadwell sees cuddly things he'd die for, cooing he loves them, even as he actually taunts the bears, as if they were stuffed animals, like the teddy bear he sleeps with in his tent, Herzog sees indifferent creatures who could make a meal out of you at any time, and we see a well meaning idiot, the New Age nuts that revere him, and a film that is perversely fascinating. Ah, the answer!</p></br></body></html>

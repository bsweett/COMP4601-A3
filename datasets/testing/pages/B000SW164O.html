There is no real suspense or mystery surrounding the plot. It's quite a shame that Robert De Niro would be involved in something like this. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress for her age and this film does not do her justice. It is a shame, really. This film does not scare, thrill or satisfy. I would stay away if you have not already watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>There is an interesting concept buried in this film however either the director or the powers that be decided to play it safe and in the end served up an unimpressive horror movie.  It's pretty bad when your red herrings are OBVIOUS red herrings and motivation is given through a montage of events that happened off camera.  It's a shame because it really could have been much better.  Plus, the whole tagline of 'come out come out whereever you are' lost it's power with this viewer because it was such a powerful line in Cape Fear that I felt the film-makers were stealing from an earlier DeNiro film.  I don't think the acting was bad as some have reported, I believe the downfall were the decisions to play it safe.  Overall, it's just an okay movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Hide and Seek has some awkward moments but overall, this movie is  quite scary and intriguing. Great performances by Robert De Niro, Elisabeth Shue, and of course Dakota Fanning. Fanning makes this film work, she is a remarkable talent!

The trailers lead one to believe that it is a film with supernatural overtones, but it turns out to be something else all together. The story line seems simple on its face. Alison Callaway (Amy Irving), a wife and loving mother, unexpectedly decides to slit her wrist in the bathtub one night, killing herself. Her husband, psychologist David Callaway, comes upon her lifeless body, and so does their beloved daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning). Emily goes into shock and comes under the care of a therapist named Katherine (Famke Janssen).<br /><br />Sometime later, when Emily's condition seemingly improves, her father then decides to leave New York City, where they live, and relocate to a small upstate town. No sooner do they move there, they meet the real estate agent and the town's sheriff, both of whom seem a tad peculiar. Moreover, there appears to be something not quite right with the couple next door, especially the husband. When Emily starts talking about an ostensibly imaginary friend named Charlie, the viewer knows that something is afoot. When David develops a new friend of his own, Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue), trouble lies ahead, as Emily exhibits bizarre behavior towards her, as well as towards Elizabeth's young niece who is trying to befriend her.<br /><br />As Charlie appears to be becoming an ever present and ominous entity in their lives, and Emily's odd behavior continues unabated, David remains the most kind, concerned, and understanding of fathers. He contacts Emily's therapist Katherine, who is very concerned about the eccentric behavior Emily is exhibiting.

It cheats the viewer with its subplots that go nowhere and are used merely to create red herrings for the sake of creating them. The film ends up being no more than total nonsense. Ari Schlossberg, the screenwriter, has made the mistake of underestimating the intelligence of the average viewer who would go to see a film starring Robert De Niro. Not even De Niro's otherwise fine performance can elevate this film to more than what it is, which is a far cry from what it promises in its trailers.<br /><br />The video provides clear audio and visuals.

Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning give good performances in this movie. Full of twists and turns, Hide and Seek keeps you entertained.... especially with the surprise ending. After the loss of his wife by suicide, De Niro decides to move and try to start a new life with his daughter to help her get over the loss of her mother. After moving into their new home, the daughter develops an imaginary friend named Charlie. This is when she starts acting in an odd behavior. De Niro now tries to find out who Charlie is and why his daughter is changing before his eyes. Not a boring movie and a good thriller. It will keep you guessing until the very end as to who Charlie really is. I recommend any thriller fan rent this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>Now come on, how many times does an ending like this have to be done to no longer be considered surprising. I won't say exactly what it is, but for those of you curious about it, I will say that nothing in this movie is ever surprising. Occasionally, the film-makers attempt to mislead you, but it fails every time. And it's so painfully slow that by the time the ending does come about, you're blinking through heavy eyelids.<br /><br />This movie's one saving grace was Robby D. Any movie he's in, I'm willing to watch, especially since, late in his career, he's trying new things. He succeeded with his furay into comedy; so why not horror? Sadly, though he did a convincing job playing the role of a psychiatrist who must care for a grief-stricken daughter, the movie just wasn't something he should have taken a part in.<br /><br />I could name a whole list of movies that has an ending similar to Hide and Seek, but I won't in case of spoilers. I also won't recommend buying this title since it isn't worth the money. Renting it, maybe, and be sure to watch it after a nap since chances are you'll end up nodding off while you wait for the horror part to happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hide and Seek (John Polson, 2005)<br /><br />Polson (who is far better known as an actor than as a director) was responsible, before this, for a travesty of celluloid called Swimf@n. Had I known that before, I'd probably have been a lot more wary of this interesting, if ultimately predictable, Robert DeNiro vehicle.<br /><br />Psychologist David Calloway (DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dreamer's Dakota Fanning) relocate from New York City to a small town upstate following the suicide of Calloway's wife (Amy Irving). Things immediately start going somewhat awry-- in addition to some extremely odd townsfolk, Emily finds herself a friend named Charlie. David starts off convinced that Charlie is an imaginary friend into whom Emily is pouring her emotional reactions to her mother's death, but as Charlie's pranks get more and more vicious, David has to face the fact that Charlie really does exist. Things come to a head when David tentatively befriends Elizabeth Young (Mysterious Skin's Elisabeth Shue). Charlie doesn't like that-- no sir, not one bit.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the movie works like a charm, building up suspense like nobody's business-- we know Charlie's not just a figment of Emily's imagination, but David steadfastly refuses to believe it. Unfortunately, once he starts believing as well, the film goes downhill fast. Polson wanted to pick up the pace, I guess, and lost pretty much any sense of suspense, continuity, or believability he'd bought for us in the first hour.<br /><br />Interestingly, the DVD version gives us four alternate versions of the final scene, all but one of which actually work better than the film's climax (I preferred the fourth, YMMV). A bit of rewriting in the third act, and this might have been the film Darkness so desperately tried (and failed) to be; as it stands, it's just another routine cheap-thrill flick. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>While not the most original scary movie ever made "Hide and Seek" is a very well acted & creepy little twister with 1 or 2  real heart stopping jumps. Another kill or two & i would,ve given it 4 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Good cast and contrary to some reviewers, I felt that nudge of surprise we all felt when a door was flung open or something popped out from under the bed, at least in the first half.<br /><br />Dr. David Callaway, Deniro, is a successful New York practitioner of psychology, Amy Irving his wife, Allison, and Dakota Fanning the wasp-gothic daughter.<br /><br />It must be tough to act as an adult with Fanning. She is quite attractive (I mean she's attractive as a child) and she is very gifted as an actor. Two successful actors who pulled it off were Washington (Man on Fire) and Cruise (War of the Worlds) but in the former she was kidnapped for 1/2 the movie and in the latter she was comatose for 1/2 the movie. Here she's in most every scene and embezzles each one.<br /><br />Deniro, the brilliant, brilliant actor of the 70's and 80's (everything he touched turned to gold) does somethings better than anyone else and many things very well. Being warm and fuzzy isn't one of them so when he tells his colleague that he can't stay in the city after Allison apparently kills herself because "now I have to be a Dad," you know there are problems ahead.<br /><br />He's probably miscast. Elizabeth Shue, gorgeous, talented, plays every scene as a country recently divorced Mom with exceptional cleavage and boots. Couldn't figure it out.<br /><br />All in all the ending as the film's success in the market was predictable. Not bad to rent; I hope you didn't drop $25 to see it in the movie house. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Hide And Seek" is okay.  It's better than De Niro's other recent thriller, which involved cloning(the title escapes me right now).  But in the long run, it's just another run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter thrill flick.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is sufficient as DeNiro's daughter who has become rather silent and stand-offish since walking in on her mother's successful suicide attempt.  DeNiro moves to the country hoping to bring her out of her shell.  Unfortunately for the both of them, Fanning finds a new "imaginary" friend who commits some rather ghastly deeds and makes her take the blame.  Famke Janssen plays Fanning's psychiatrist and close friend and former student of DeNiro.  Elizabeth Shue has a small role as a country local who DeNiro has a sweet spot for.<br /><br />The climax of the film is what makes it fail in the end.  It sort of ruins the "evil" atmosphere that is set by Fanning's creepy performance.<br /><br />Only recommended to fans of DeNiro and modest thrillers.  I would steer clear of purchasing this until I've viewed it as a rental or on TV.  You may not want to commit too much money to this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Plotwise I wasn't confused by it. It was the direction of the movie. I honestly thought it was a ghost movie. Then there's a point in the film where it could be a creature movie, then a possible stalker movie. Then it becomes something else entirely. Really to blame is the really lackluster script which gives nothing new to the film or even scary.<br /><br />David Callaway and his daughter Emily are just reeling from the suicide of his wife Alison. Wanting to take her out from the house, he moves an hour away upstate. There, he meets some neighbours and everything seems fine. But his daughter Emily is turning rather gothic with vacant expressions, inconsiderate attitudes towards David's new friend Elizabeth and her daughter and starts talking of an imaginary friend named Charlie. At first David dismisses it, until strange things start happening(as usual, right?) and David gets suspicious of this friend "Charlie".<br /><br />That imaginary friend part makes you think of a ghost right? Well so did I. It becomes something else entirely and the "twist" is straight out of something like Secret Window or Fight Club(did I just spoil it for those who've seen those movies?). Not to mention the movie isn't even creepy or scary.<br /><br />I'm not going to blame the actors. Robert De Niro is in that rare category of actors that can emote so much with just a facial expression. He doesn't need big overracted speeches to convey something, he just shows it. And Dakota Fanning is starting to have an impressive resume, that is if you discount Cat in the Hat. She's done better(that shot in War of the Worlds where she gasps from behind the car is far better than anything here) but there's something odd about her where you keep watching. The other characters do what they need to with theirs but don't really go anywhere.<br /><br />I'd take a chance with it. I've seen it and wouldn't recommend it but if you want to, try it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Robert De Niro (Heat, Taxi Driver) and rising child actor Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam, War Of The Worlds) star in this suspenseful new thriller directed by John Polson (Swimfan).<br /><br />Hide and Seek is about a man, David, and his daughter, Emily,  who have to cope with the sudden death of the mother and move out to a small town in upstate New York to help the stricken young girl heal. What happens next is Emily begins communing with an imaginary friend named Charlie that her father fails to see eye to eye but senses his existence after strange occurences begin happening around the house, including murder.<br /><br />Hide and Seek succeeds in gluing the viewers eyes to the screen and making him ask the usual question of "Who's doing it?"<br /><br />Although I figured out who done it about half way through the movie (because I'm psychic...just kidding!), due to some common horror movie cliches, the movie's stars De Niro and Fanning light up the screen with their excellent performances.<br /><br />A recommended viewing<br /><br />B-</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Well worth watching, a pretty good spooky mystery and some suspenseful moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This was a bit more of a thriller than my wife and I had anticipated.  The characters were a bit hard to relate to but it was good acting.  Robert DeNiro plays a very intense character, whose personality takes a little twist.  Not everything is completely believable in the film, but it kept me on the "edge of my seat."<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is amazing.  I don't know how a little girl can act so many horrifying scenes like those.  She must be able to separate herself from what she is acting.  This film is definitely not appropriate for children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I liked this movie, Yes wasn't all that and great movie, But was suspense and thriller..And of course loves De Niro,, He's acting is great in any movies he played,This movie remind of  movie "FRAILTY "such as I loved that movie, and superior to this of course, But after all I  enjoy" hide and seek", Maybe not to buy,But worth a rental for  sure.

And whatever you do - DON'T take your kids to this one!<br />  The basic plot: Emily Callaway's (Dakota Fanning) mother has committed suicide. Her dad, a psychologist (De Niro) moves to an old house in New York (upstate New York) to start over.<br />  That is when things start to get creepy- or should I say they are SUPPOSED to be creepy? Nothing was surprising in this film except the less than stellar performances of De Niro and Dakota Fanning. Both seemed to be stymied by the script and neither got a chance to exercise their acting chops to the fullest. A pity. Wait for this one on cable. It shouldn't last long in theatres.z</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Sometimes a movie tries too hard to be something more than it really is.  `Hide and Seek' is that type of movie.  Sure, there are moments when the movie is a tad on the creepy side, but for the most part it is a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together in a tired fashion that comes across corny and out of place as apposed to genuinely scary and frightening.  I had truly no desire to see this movie.  Sadly Robert De Niro has fallen away from everything that made him great and so upon seeing the trailer for this movie I immediately made the connection to the debacle known as `Godsend' and figured that this would be the same kind of mess.  In actuality though, I think that this was even worse.  At lease `Godsend' has a somewhat original plot.<br /><br />`Hide and Seek' follows David Callaway and his troubled daughter Emily as they travel to upstate New York shortly after David's wife Alison commits suicide.  The tragedy has had a terrible effect on Emily who is cold and distant and destructive.  Soon after moving Emily makes a new friend, Charlie, and it's shortly after this that things get weird.  Emily's demeanor gets worse and worse and things start happening around the house that suggest something sinister in the works.<br /><br />What irritates me the most about `Hide and Seek' is that it doesn't know when to quit.  It wants so badly to keep one guessing that it veers off on what promises to be eerie subplots only to abandon them with questions left lingering and take us in a completely different direction.  One wonders in the end just what Laura was talking about when she said that she's "said too much" or just what Emily said to Sheriff Hafferty or maybe even more so, what in the world Sheriff Hafferty was getting at when he was questioning Emily.  These loose ends and plenty others regarding Charlie especially beg to be answered but the sloppy script leaves them all unanswered.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that the four main stars in this film are far better than this.  Robert De Niro was at one time our greatest working actor.  Iconic performances like that of Vito Corleone or Travis Bickle will go down in history as some of the best the world has ever seen; so why is he starring in this tripe.  Elisabeth Shue, while not my favorite actress, has proven to be above this, and Famke Janssen (easily the best thing about this movie) needs to further explore the brilliance she brought to the second season of `Nip Tuck'.  Dakota Fanning is decent here, not as stiff or mechanical as De Niro, yet she overdoes it quite a bit.  I prefer her to play the sweet mature child (see `I Am Sam' or `War of the Worlds') to the eerie gothic girl.  She comes off as trying too hard.<br /><br />In the end I would stay far, far away from this film.  It isn't even a decent B-Grade horror film.  The chills are short lived, and in the end when Charlie is revealed you'll be let down at the fact that you guessed it way too soon in the game.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I can only assume great bulging bags of money were dangled in front of a lot of stars because I can't think a plot this vapid would coax this much talent in on its own strengths. This pretends to be a horror movie, then reveals itself to be a psychological piece, and never once scares, surprises, thrills, or engrosses anyone I personally know who has seen it. It's sadder than it is suspenseful, and in the end such a painful waste of time I was astonished that it ever got made, let alone made with the participation of the big names it lists in a sallow (s-a-l-l-o-w) effort at validation.<br /><br />So thinly plotted was Hide and Seek that it can be sketched out in haiku form, condensing two irretrievable hours of viewing time to five seconds.<br /><br />Ready, kiddies?<br /><br />Mom--tub-based death scene;<br />Dad and girl move to country;<br />Playmate---real?---kills lots!<br /><br />Yep, that's about it, folks....</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This movie wasn't what I expected.  It moved along at a decent pace with supernatural undertones, but took a sudden turn that I should have expected but didn't,  which caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning gave a sublime performance and De Niro had a couple of really creepy moments that were 180 degrees from the understated performance he started out with.  Enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>The actors are great, only problem is that the movie didn't ultilize their full potential. As in surprise ending, predicted it in the beginning and firmed my prediction after 30 minutes. Nowadays audience are harder to trick, more or less I suppose, because of the many movies out now. Most ideas that movies base themselves on, plots, settings, etc are already taken in past movies. Its very hard finding originals nowadays and still there's no definate originals even if they try. I'm already seeing a limit to songs as it is. Nowadays, people just remake songs over again to bring it back, other words? They're running out of ideas.<br /><br />I did sort of got scared in some parts, but again its just the surprise and not really anything else.<br /><br />You should watch this if you want to know whats it about etc, because its not a HORRIBLE and totally time wasting movie since they do have to great actors in there, its just not all that great.

Soon after they move in Fanning starts to tell her dad of her imaginary friend named Charlie. De Niro starts to become more and more worried about his daughter and strange things happen. The end is another one of those twist endings we all love....sometimes. I think De Niro and Fanning did a good job though this movie is neither scary nor suspenseful...it has its moments. Also starring Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas, The Saint), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes, Along Came A Spider), Robert John Burke (Fled), Amy Irving (13 Conversations About One Thing, Tv's Alias) and Famke Janssen (X-Men 1 and 2, GoldenEye).</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Let me just say, that is dismal, this is horrible. This is a waste of Robert Deniro's talents and Dakota Fanning's talents, They have worked long and hard and made great movies and they make this crap? Well, I hate this movie with a passion. I thought it was boring, it had no scares, thrills, nudity, or any cussing. It should be G for god sakes, It was not that scary as People are saying it was. I felt that the critics kissed it too much by comparing it to the likes of Pyscho and The Shining(???).<br /><br />The movie stars Robert Deniro as David Callaway, a psychologist, who witnesses with his only daughter, the brutal suicide of his wife. So, He decides to go to some woods and start fresh with his daughter,Emily(Dakota Fanning). Then David starts seeing signs in the bathroom that somebody knows that what he has done and his Daughter all the sudden, has this playmate named Charlie. Then the problems get worse, Emily tries to scare off Elizabeth, who Emily thinks is replacing her mother, with the grusome details of her mom's sucide, and David doesn't condone it and tries to talk to her and see who is making her act this way, she says her imaginary friend Charlie. Charlie isn't your ordinary run of the mill imaginary friend. He is a sick demented fake person that is making all the signs and killing off the family cat and David's girlfriend.<br /><br />by the way, you will be pissed at the ending, I was too, and The trailer(if you have seen it), reveals too much about ending.

I've been suckered enough by his presence("The Godsend") in a thriller and this is it, I'm done with him in this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>the best things about this movie is robert de niro, and dakota fanning. de niro, excellent actor, great in all kinds of films, especially mafia films. love him in those. in hide in seek he did what he does, and that was not a disappointment. as for dakota fanning this little girl sure knows how to act better than some adults do. the girls got talent, and she brings it out in all she does. she can be cute, adorable, and smart, but she can also be dark, scary, and weak. beautiful work. the movie overall was good, but it was pretty predictable. but there were some tid bits that you didn't expect, and the ending was pretty good.</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>The first 20 minutes or so didnt seem very good but as i got into it, i found it quite a good film.

Great performances by Dakota Fanning and Robert De Nero.  3 out of the 4 alternate endings on the dvd are pretty sweet to.

Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue are hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Let me cut to the chase. This film did not, at all, meet my expectations. The trailers lead one to believe that it is a film with supernatural overtones, but it turns out to be something else all together. The story line seems simple on its face. Alison Callaway (Amy Irving), a wife and loving mother, unexpectedly decides to slit her wrist in the bathtub one night, killing herself. Her husband, psychologist David Callaway, comes upon her lifeless body, and so does their beloved daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning). Emily goes into shock and comes under the care of a therapist named Katherine (Famke Janssen).<br /><br />Sometime later, when Emily's condition seemingly improves, her father then decides to leave New York City, where they live, and relocate to a small upstate town. No sooner do they move there, they meet the real estate agent and the town's sheriff, both of whom seem a tad peculiar. Moreover, there appears to be something not quite right with the couple next door, especially the husband. When Emily starts talking about an ostensibly imaginary friend named Charlie, the viewer knows that something is afoot. When David develops a new friend of his own, Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue), trouble lies ahead, as Emily exhibits bizarre behavior towards her, as well as towards Elizabeth's young niece who is trying to befriend her.<br /><br />As Charlie appears to be becoming an ever present and ominous entity in their lives, and Emily's odd behavior continues unabated, David remains the most kind, concerned, and understanding of fathers. He contacts Emily's therapist Katherine, who is very concerned about the eccentric behavior Emily is exhibiting. Meanwhile, the male neighbor interjects himself into the picture in a seemingly ominous way. So, David, who is also having flashbacks of events involving his wife, appears to have his hands full on the home front. By the time things start to go totally askew, the viewer can pretty much guess what the final denouement will be.<br /><br />Despite its great cast and excellent performances, the script is weak and leaves a lot to be desired. It cheats the viewer with its subplots that go nowhere and are used merely to create red herrings for the sake of creating them. The film ends up being no more than total nonsense. Ari Schlossberg, the screenwriter, has made the mistake of underestimating the intelligence of the average viewer who would go to see a film starring Robert De Niro. Not even De Niro's otherwise fine performance can elevate this film to more than what it is, which is a far cry from what it promises in its trailers.<br /><br />The DVD provides clear audio and visuals. It also provides four alternate endings that are moderately interesting, at best. What it does not provide is a film worth adding to one's personal collection. This is a film that is worth a rental, when you have nothing better to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>It's important for a director to immediately establish a level of trust with his/her audience. We need to believe that we are in capable hands that will introduce us to characters and situations that make perfect sense, and that events will follow one another with unyielding logic.<br /><br />At first, I felt that a decision made early in the film was a decision that was outside the "trust" I described above. Toward the end of the film, I realized that the decision was OK - even though I thought it was a bad idea on the filmmaker's part to make that particular decision. I wish that the screenwriters had worked harder to come up with a different way to get from point A to point B. The problem with the "real" decision was that I lost faith in the director/story almost immediately because it appeared - at the time - to be utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />There was a scene where a cat came jumping out of a closet for shock value, and my lord, I can't count the number of times where that tired old trick has been used. Whenever that happens, I immediately think that someone's being lazy and can't come up with a better way to give the audience a quick scare. Besides - it's quite awful to leave a cat locked up in a closet because they tend to start using it as their bathroom, and you just can't get cat pee out of *anything*.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, it began to move in a fairly reasonable logic flow, and I started to gain trust in the director/story again, even though there were some unnecessary characters and scenes.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning (Emily), is an amazing actress whose ability to portray a wide range of emotions that many actors and actresses with years more training and experience would give their left foot for, is the perfect character for the part. We see her happy, we see her completely dead inside, and we see her unbearably terrified. Her tremors and tears are terrors ring true. She is the best actor in the film. (Which is saying quite a bit.)<br /><br />The movie is about a man whose wife dies and he moves to the country to help his daughter cope. This didn't make sense to me, because as a psychologist, the father, David, (DeNiro), should have known that was just plain stupid. We don't see many emotions from DeNiro after his wife dies, and that too disturbed me. Again - I didn't feel in capable hands, so I questioned everything that looked wrong.<br /><br />While in a beautiful house in the country, Emily has what everyone calls an imaginary friend - Charlie. David is frustrated by this, and has a few conversations with a former student of his that is close to Emily.<br /><br />And that's where the story starts to pick up. Charlie is more and more a part of Emily's life, and David feels isolated.<br /><br />In the end, it seemed that the movie was going for a "Sixth Sense" feel, and it almost achieved it, but fell short. We're shown the obligatory flashbacks, but they aren't as convincing, shocking, or as immediately understood  as those that occurred in Shyamalan's film. (I saw "The Sixth Sense" in the theater in its opening weekend. As I'm hard of hearing, I wear headsets that, thankfully, drown out idiots who like to talk through films. However, those headsets couldn't keep me from hearing the shocked gasps from the audience. It's a shame that Shyamalan has been trying to recreate that same shock in the rest of his films, because he's failed miserably.) If "Hide and Seek" wasn't incorporating the elemental template of "The Sixth Sense", it would have made for a more interesting film. Or if "The Sixth Sense" had never been made, it might have been more interesting. But I don't think it would have been much more interesting, because as I said, the flashbacks and the shocks that those flashbacks were supposed to cause fell short.<br /><br />Case in point: "The Sixth Sense" has a rating of 8.2 on imdb.pro, and Hide and Seek has a rating of 5.5. I tend to trust those ratings, because members of imdb.pro are film aficionados, and thousands of people (129,000 for SS and 13,600 for HaS) cast votes. It's a good sample.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Hide and Seek is about a father and daugher (Deniro and Fanning) who move to start over after the mother dies tragically. Fanning has no friends there and soon a friend named Charlie enters the picture. However she's the only one that sees him. When weird things start to happen in the house Deniro suspects Fanning because she's the only other person there. She puts the blame on her friend Charlie though which makes Deniro think she needs to speak to a shrink for kids. The under-rated  Famke Janssen (X-Men and Nip/Tuck season 2) plays the shrink who wants to help Fanning. Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas)  also stars as a women who starts dating Deniro. At dinner Fanning warns Shue that she might wind up like her mother. Fanning pulls off scenes like that great. She's pretty creepy in this movie.<br /><br />  The movie is well paced and well acted but the trailer itself never left much for the imagination. I mean it takes the surprise out of Shue's characters fate and what even happens to her. Plus when the sheriff asks Fanning what she's drawing and says "you dieing". Well then you know his fate as well. So the trailer doesn't leave many surprises. Plus is disapointing to me that it's not the "my imaginary friend is the killer" kind of movie I expected. I mean I can't really think of any movies that had that concept. So it could've been a great idea for a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, that's half way the idea of this movie but it doesn't go all the way with it. It's a shame because Fanning is in top form here and could've really done something with that. If it did this could've been the next Sitxh Sense. The twist still is decent though I guess. if you never saw Secret Window you might even see the twist as original... I hope saying that didn't give too much away though.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>Most people already know the ending of this movie which is pretty easy if your using commonsense but this movie is pretty good with strong performances by the actors which hold the movie up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I almost didn't see this movie today due to the harsh reviews, but now I am really glad I did. While it would have been received better if it came out before Johnny Depp's thriller "Secret Window," it still remains a creepy and interesting little thriller in its own right. Robert De Niro is good here, but doesn't thread into any new territory in terms of his performance. Dakota Fanning is the standout by far (she could have said the name "Charlie" ten times less), looking like a reject from the Wednesday Addams auditions. She is creepy and those big eyes demand attention. Without such a good young actress in this important part, the film would have fallen apart from the start. Spoiler Ahead! Just to clarify last minute or so of the film. Some people I was with didn't understand the two-headed drawing at the end. It just meant that she now has the same "symptoms" her father had. Anyways, this is a good thriller that always entertains and was worth my money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>It's an obvious film, who Charlie is, especially when people tell you before you get the chance to see it.

AND I DIDNT READ EACH REVIEW, JUST BROWSING THE TITLES TO SEE IF PEOPLE LIKED IT OR HATED IT AND SOME MORON ACTUALLY WROTE THE ENDING TO THIS MOVIE IN HIS TITLE!! AND I COULDNT GET IT OUTTA MY MIND. WHAT A SPOILER TO ALREADY KNOW THE ENDING BEFORE WATCHING IT. IT'S A SUSPENSE THRILLER AND DENIRO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS, BUT TO THE IDIOT WHO WROTE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END IN HIS REVIEW THANKS ALOT. I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS MOVIE MORE IF I DIDNT KNOW ROBERT IS CHARLIE. SHEESH. YOU CAN WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT IN YOUR REVIEW BUT DONT SPOIL IT FOR OTHERS AND WRITE THE F*CKING ENDING IN YOUR TITLE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVENT SEEN IT YET. BUT ANYWAY, THE MOVIE WASNT BAD AT ALL. NOT A HORROR, BUT DEFINATELY DISTURBING ENOUGH TO BE CREEPY. I LIKE SUSPENSES, AND I'M SICK OF PEOPLE COMPARING MOVIES TO OTHER MOVIES. THIS MOVIE HIDE AND SEEK HAS BEEN COMPARED TO SECRET WINDOW WITH JHONNY DEPP AND THAT'S A GIVE AWAY ALSO TO COMPARE IT TO THAT MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN HIDE AND SEEK BUT SAW SECRET WINDOW. BUT BOTH STORIES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. DENIRO DID A FINE ACTING JOB IN HIDE AND SEEK, AND DAKOTA FANNING IS PHENOMINAL. WHAT A CHILLING PERFORMANCE SHE GAVE. THAT'S A HECK OF ALOT OF TALENT FOR ONE LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE HAD SOMEWHAT OF AN ORIGINAL IDEA. IT DID LAG A LITTLE AT THE END, AND I DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE TWO HEADED FACE PICTURE. DENIRO HAD THE SPLIT PERSONALIOTY, NOT EMILY. BUT THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATE ENDINGS, AT LEAST I DONT KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT THOSE ARE. SHEESH.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>A recently widowed doctor Robert DeNiro leaves the city with his only daughter Dakota Fanning.  They start to live a new life in quiet countryside, a deserted summer place this time, and he comes to realize that his move might be a mistake.  If you find any originality in this story, 'Hide and Seek' is your film.  If I sound a little sarcastic, I say I'm sorry, but so many thrillers seek their background in this kind of land of nowhere that I started to feel like yelling 'Not again.'  Oh, and the title!  This unoriginal title should not be confused with another 'Hide and Seek' made only 6 years ago.  At least they should have done something to that.<br /><br />But DeNiro's 'Hide and Seek' is not without entertainment value.  Though the film's main body is made from parts from other thrillers, it starts mildly interesting.  DeNiro plays Dr. David Callaway, who lost his wife Alison (Amy Irving) in a terrible situation, and their only daughter Lucy (Fanning), witnessing the scene, is traumatized by the shock.  They leave the city, and begin to live quietly in the countryside (which is conviniently only one hour's drive away from the city where Lucy's doctor Famke Jansen lives).<br /><br />But you know, Lucy starts to act weirdly, talking about her imaginary frined named Charlie.  She insists Charlie often comes to their house, and does a wicked thing or two.  The tricks Charlie (or whatever) does on them get worse as the story goes on, and finally Lucy herself is out of control.  Well, it seems so at first.<br /><br />Like M. Night Shyamalan thrillers, 'Hide and Seek' tries to be atomospheric, and at times it succeeds.  See, for example, who plays the local sheriff jingling the bundle of keys, who might be a bit too officious.  It's Dylan Baker, yes, who played the daddy who did a very bad thing to a kid in 'Happiness.'  It's good casting, for Dylan Baker could be very unpredictable, and he is a good actor.<br /><br />But it turns out differently.  For all the participations of ever-reliable Dylan Baker and equally-reliable Elizabeth Shue, the things go on like autopilot.  For all the good (and in a sense, very scary) acting from Dakota Fanning, any fans of thrillers can read the next step of the film.  Here's a doll!  There's a cat!!  The girl is looking at the sinister-looking woods!!!  You can guess what will happen next.<br /><br />Yes, I know, except that part, which the Fox Studio is so eager to protect that to reavel it here would involve you and me into an unwelcome lawsuit, so I won't write it.  You have to see it, and perhaps, just perhaps, you may be impressed with it.  Me?  Well, I admit it was unexpected, but at the same time the twist does not heighten the suspence at all.  Actually, it is an amateur's touch which destroys the professional acting from Fanning, whose Lucy character is the only mysterious part of the film.  In short, Fanning's well-measured performance is wasted to show this big, implausible, and silly surprise.<br /><br />Finally, here is what I want to ask: how many people still remember Robert DeNiro in the 70s or 80s?  Oh, he was such a sensation.  Not exactly a money-making star (which I do not say is a bad thing per se), but the name of DeNiro meant something awe-inspiring.  I enjoyed 'Analyse This' and 'Meet the Parents,' but I didn't expect 'Analyse That' was coming.  Neither his awful self-parody of Travis in 'Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'  Then, the mafioso boss in 'Shark Tales.'  What ever happened to him anyway?</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>This is a mix of bad terror cliches and a really bad plot. DeNiro has made another crap movie. Gone are the days of Taxi Driver, now we get this mediocre excuse of a movie. Fanning doesnt help the movie at all. All she's good for is to look in a catonic state.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I saw "Hide And Seek" knowing very little beyond the basic premise (a little girl, played by Dakota Fanning, loses her mother, after which her father - played by Robert DeNiro - moves them to a quiet country town to try and heal; whereupon the little girl begins having conversations with an imaginary friend.)  I didn't even know Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue were in it, two performers whose movies I seek out.  I knew DeNiro was in it (a drawing point) and I knew Fanning was here (this is the first movie I've seen her in and what a performance!) but that's it.<br /><br />  I was quickly very thankful I knew so little going in, because "Hide And Seek" moves and grows in original and very unexpected ways, not even letting you know where it plans to settle along the horror/mystery/drama/supernatural thriller arc; keeping all its possibilities wide open.  Despite appearances of elements from classic horror movies like "The Amityville Horror" in the first few minutes, it ends up not forging through familiar territory at all, but breaking through innovative ground with shocks and imagination. The whole thing is bolstered by great production and uniformly excellent performances.  DeNiro of course is outstanding (I don't think this guy could turn in a weak or even an average performance if his life dependeded on it)and Shue and Jansen are likewise great, but it's Fanning who arguably gives the best performance.  Anytime you can say that about any actress or actor co-starring with DeNiro that's bloody high praise indeed.<br /><br />  A smart, scary, multi-faceted movie; watch with something like "Dead Again", "The Eye", "When A Stranger Calls Back", "Identity" or "In The Mouth Of Madness" for a night of real suspense, surprises and shocks.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>This expert DVD transfer includes a commentary tract and four alternate endings, two of which are actually better than the one director John Polson chose, calling his judgment into question. But he has made so many other wrong choices that the holes in this original script are the least of the picture's  problems. What is absolutely right about it, however, is the remarkable child actress Dakota Fanning in the leading role. She not only carries "Hide and Seek" but she steals it easily from top-billed Robert DeNiro.<br /><br />What is one of our finest actors doing in this ho-hum psychological thriller anyway? Not much. DeNiro seems to be channeling the confrontational Travis Bickle of "Taxi Driver"  into a widowed New York psychologist who takes his nine-year-old daughter, traumatized by her mother's suicide, to a woodsy hamlet to cure her. Of course, matters get worse (surprise!), more for the audience than any of the characters. Well, they suffer, too, mostly at the hands of the little girl's imaginary friend. Yes, she has one of those, and you also won't be surprised when she sees creepy things go bump in the night.<br /><br />At least she doesn't see dead people, although a "Sixth Sense" might have helped this movie, which doesn't play fair (note the scene in which a visiting friend is murdered.) The film is filled with red herrings, plot inconsistencies, loud sound effects, spooky music, and some competent supporting actors, including Dylan Baker as the sheriff and Amy Irving as the mother whose flashbacked story is clumsily edited. You wonder what Brian DePalma might have done with this material. Probably discard it and start from scratch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>It wasn't all that bad, it just wasn't the most original script in the world (what horror movie these days is?)<br /><br />It kept me interested from beginning to end, which very few movies do these days so I gave it credit for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Don't let the presence of Robert De Niro and Elisabeth Shue fool you into thinking that "Hide and Seek" is anything more than a tacky, trashy thriller, utterly devoid of originality, credibility and suspense.<br /><br />De Niro is a Manhattan psychologist whose depressed wife (Amy Irving) kills herself in the bathtub.  Feeling that a change of venue would be the best thing for him and his traumatized daughter, he moves to a small town in upstate New York, hoping to start life over again in an unfamiliar setting.  Almost immediately, the child begins to turn strange, claiming that she has an "invisible" playmate who is none too happy with her dad for letting her mom off herself.  Soon, animals and neighbors start showing up dead, and De Niro realizes he needs to start doing some serious intervention if he`s to prevent his little girl from turning into a miniaturized Norman Bates.<br /><br />"Hide and Seek" takes a serious issue - the effect a parent's suicide has on a child - and exploits it for cheap commercial purposes.  Rather than dealing intelligently with this sensitive topic, the film uses it as window dressing for a squalid little horror film that feels like a thousand other thrillers that have come before it.  The "surprise" twist ending will come as a surprise only to those who have never seen "Secret Window" or anything of that ilk, and whole sections of the last half hour feel as if they have been lifted almost verbatim from "The Shining."  And what modern suspense film worth its salt would be without that single most hackneyed scene in the horror film canon - the old cat-jumping-out-of-the-closet trick!?  In this respect, at least, "Hide and Seek" does not disappoint.<br /><br />De Niro and Shue are professional enough to turn in yeomen work, but even actors of their caliber can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear.  Dakota Fanning is fairly effective as the creepy child, but if you want to see a truly great film on the subject of creepy children, check out Jack Clayton's horror movie masterpiece "The Innocents" and avoid "Hide and Seek" at all costs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>When you have rented a video, have you ever felt like once you watched the entire product you rented that you never thought you'd watch it again for a long time? Well, HIDE AND SEEK happens to be that kind of a movie. It's premise is very tantalizing, its actors are quite solid in their roles, and the twist is somewhat satisfying, while the last shot of the film leaves chills down your spine. HIDE AND SEEK, while a satisfying, does have some holes from time to time that don't keep it from being a good movie...just not a great one.<br /><br />Robert De Niro plays David, a well-respected psychologist who has a cute little daughter, Emily, played by Dakota Fanning. His wife, it seems, committed suicide due to the recent trials of their marriage, which in turn seems to be unwinding at a steady pace in the beginning. David is horrified one night waking up and discovering his wife in a blood-soaked bathtub, with poor Emily shocked and in a complete state of disbelief from what she has seen.<br /><br />We pick up some time later with Emily in a children's hospital working with a staff member (Famke Jennsen, in fine form here) who's trying to help Emily cope with the loss of her mother, while David tries his best to keep being as good a father as he can be. David decides that he and Emily should move somewhere quieter and more peaceful to start fresh, and they move into a new house by a lake which draws a crowd during summertimes. Things seem to go from weird, to worse, as David and Emily grow further apart. Emily, however, develops a friendship with her new imaginary friend, "Charlie", who seems to make her very happy. But "Charlie" isn't interested in harmless child's play and things soon go to worse as after David meets the sweet Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue, once again acing her acting), "Charlie" begins making bad things happen because he seems to hate David. The rest of the movie plays like an M. Night Shymalan thriller, leaving you guessing what will happen next. Some parts seem tepid and slow, but the "twist" will leave you guessing until it happens. The last shot of the film has Emily and her new friend, the staff member, living together, and while Emily loves to draw, her drawing ultimately leaves the movie open for a sequel, which is yet to appear. I won't give it away but let's just say you'll be left chilled to the bone when you see the "drawing".<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is in superb form here, and at first you want to hate her character so much for the way she treats her father, but as the movie goes along, especially later in the second half, you start to wonder if she's the one you should be afraid for. Nevertheless, she's a pro in this movie, bringing one bone-chilling and rock-solid performance to the table here. Great job kid!!<br /><br />So if you're looking to kill 100 minutes on a Saturday night and get some good chills, HIDE AND SEEK might just be right up your alley. But be warned: the last shot of the movie will send a chill up your spine.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Not since "Godsend" has a movie had four alternate endings, not to mention both starring the nearly unflappable Robert DeNiro.

She looks a lot more serious, but no less watch-able as she portrays psychologist DeNiro's dark haired, depressed daughter.  Seems Mommy killed herself, so Daddy decides to move to Upstate New York to get away from it all and purchases a huge house that harbors a mysterious new "friend" of his daughter she calls "Charlie".  Soon, the bathroom contains lots of gruesome wall notes and Dakota is drawing scary pictures of people dying.  Then there are those darn unexplainable deaths that happen.  Who is the murderer?

Could be any one of a long list of (way too obvious) candidates, but one thing is certain: Charlie is very, very dangerous!<br /><br />This buildup is stale but fairly well played out, almost Night Shyamalanesqe in its use of visuals and sound.<br /><br />But then after having patiently humored the film for over an hour a bizarre and supremely idiotic climax is dropped on us.

Perhaps because it IS so mild, the climactic revelations aren't nearly as shocking as director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg might have hoped, and the narrative builds to a lacklustre conclusion. DeNiro is miscast as the 'saintly' psychologist who tolerates his daughter's worst excesses, and the glossy production values are wasted. Also starring Famke Janssen as a fellow psychologist, and a virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving as DeNiro's ill-fated wife. Casual viewers will get their money's worth, but die-hard horror fans are urged to look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Unoriginal seems to be the predominant word that comes to mind when describing this movie, although the movie doesn't really "cop-out" until the latter part of the film. Beforehand, it does have its chilling moments, despite throwing in a clich&eacute; every now and then (the cat jumping out of a door, etc). And then the last part of the film the plot literally fizzles, and the thriller/horror movie formula is used.  It is then we decide we have seen this ploy done many times in movies before, and we may feel cheated as a moviegoer.<br /><br />How notorious is it for Hollywood to take a movie formula and use it repeatedly? Quite, apparently.<br /><br />Starring Dakota Fanning as Emily, Hide and Seek is about a girl who is traumatized after the apparent suicide of her mother. As Emily continues to be withdrawn after this incident, her father, played by Robert De Niro, decides to take her away from the city and start over away from the house and its memories. From there, Emily becomes obsessed with her imaginary friend "Charlie", and bizarre events begin to happen.<br /><br />What irked me most about this film was its logic, or lack thereof. Many of the characters just seem to fall into their convenient little places so the movie's plot will fit just right. For instance, you just know the worst thing the father can do is take Emily out into the country in a creepy old house and even creepier neighbors and sheriff to try to help them recover. (As a psychologist, you think he would know better).<br /><br />There are also inconsistencies and loose ends that are never explained, just left for one to ponder. For instance, what is with the neighbors who continually tell De Niro's character that his daughter is "beautiful?" Also, what is up with the man showing up at two o'clock in the morning to drop off a key to the house? The creepy sheriff apparently is just that: a creepy sheriff, and no more.<br /><br />Although this wasn't an awful movie, it is certainly won't be one remembered years down the line. Although this movie was scary at times, there are many other scary movies that will leave one feeling more satisfied.<br /><br />It's my suggestion that you rent this movie first, and judge for yourself, rather than racing out and buying it when it comes to DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Well, I just caught this on DVD recently and I liked it. It was more drama than horror, but that's a good thing cause then if you save your horror for last, then it's better.<br /><br />This movie is about a Father who has a creepy (but cute) daughter. After the mom commits suicide in a bathtub one night, they move to a nice house in New york state. then one night, The girl develops an imaginary friend named Charlie. But Charlie starts to complicate the place...<br /><br />I thought this movie was cool. It had a nice twist ending and plus, the acting was great. So I think you should see it.<br /><br />Any psychological movie fan (or person who likes the weird and the wonderful) should see it. You'll like it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I was so disappointed in this movie.  It was obvious who Charlie was and there was so many questions I still had at the end that made me mad.  Such as what was up with the neighbor and why did both of them seem creepy for no reason?  Why did everyone always tell her she was so beautiful?  It got real annoying after a while because nothing came from that story line either.  And it was obvious who Charlie was from the middle of the movie.  I didn't like that I knew who he was.  I just felt this movie was lacking in a story the actors and actresses were fine the story was weak.  It tried to throw people off so it started story lines but never ended them--which is quite annoying leaving a movie going okay but why was this person doing this, etc. I was hoping for a good creepy movie but this movie did nothing for me and was a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>80% of this movie is fantastic.  I was actually sitting in the theatre and thinking, "Wow, I'll be able to give this a really good review on Amazon!"  Unfortunately, though, the last twenty minutes or so ruined the whole moviegoing experience for me, which is why I'm only able to give "Hide and Seek" three stars.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is good: Robert De Niro plays David, a psychologist whose wife recently committed suicide. His young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) saw her dead mother in a pool of blood and has been left traumatized by the experience.  Her father decides that it would be best if they leave New York City and move to the country to make a fresh start.  As soon as they arrive, Emily makes a new friend, Charlie, who is presumed to be invisible.  That's when all sorts of creepy things start happening, and the events get deadlier as time goes on.<br /><br />As far as the casting goes, this movie is up to par.  Robert De Niro gives a solid performance (but then again, this is De Niro...the man is good in everything he does).  The real star of the film is Dakota Fanning, who is amazing in her role in a troubled (and creepy) young girl. Famke Janssen (that's right, it's Xenia Onatopp from "Goldeneye") shines in a supporting role as a friend of David's (who also happens to be a shrink).  The only possible miscast in this film is Elizabeth Shue.  Her character is pretty bland and seems to serve no purpose except to fall victim to Charlie.  (What bothered me most, though, was the fact that Shue had to show her cleavage in EVERY SINGLE SCENE.  I just didn't need to see all that!)<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but the final twenty minutes of the film basically turns into "Secret Window," which is a very good movie, but why did they have to copy it almost exactly?  "Hide and Seek" had everything going for it in the beginning: it was scary and suspenseful, but then it just threw everything away at the end.  What a shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Dakota Fanning is the best child actress in Hollywood but even she can't save this movie. Robert DeNiro is a legend but he just seemed all wrong for this part. I never once saw him as a father and his character seemed to treat the daughter as more of an experiment than anything else. A lot of things happen in this movie that defy logic. If your little girl suddenly started looking like she's been to hell and back would you scratch your head and spend hours writing in your journal?<br /><br />The character of Elizabeth Shue was ridiculous. I've seen women move in on widowers before but this characer behaved like a she'd just found the last man on earth.<br /><br />When the twist came things picked up a bit but the climax and the little coda at the end were lame in the extreme. Hide and Seek isn't worth buying. In fact, unless your video store is offering a rent-one-get-one free sale, it's not even worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I watched this one over the weekend after my wife brought it home unexpectedly from the video store.  She likes creepy flicks far more than I do.  This one wasn't bad, but it didn't grab me either.  If anything, I found it a bit disturbing.<br /><br />I want to be very careful not to give anything away, because this is one of those mind-twister, big ending movies along the lines of "The Sixth Sense" or "The Village".  Like those other films, this is one where everything seems normal on its face, all the laws of physics are operating normally, yet there appears to be no rational explanation for why these "paranormal" events are occurring.  It's only toward the end that a significant truth is revealed that turns all this on its head, and makes all the unusual stuff fit together in a nice neat little package.<br /><br />Overall I would say this story is reasonably suspenseful and has some eerie elements to it that are only semi-predictable and modestly cliche -- for example, the door with eerie light glowing around it.  There are some moderately graphic death scenes which I don't recommend for the kiddies.  Like "The Village", I thought the "big secret" was given away a little too soon.  From there the story degenerated into a chase sequence more reminiscent of Stephen King's "The Shining".  I thought DeNiro did a bang-up job in a wide-ranging role that really carried an otherwise mediocre story.<br /><br />Would I recommend this movie?  &lt;Shrug>  I dunno.  I guess if you liked "The Sixth Sense" or or a DeNiro fan you'd probably like this one.  Otherwise you're likely to be a little disappointed.</p></br></body></html>

The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a particularly dysfunctional family on a mission: Their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) has been chosen to be a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent contest. Her parents, Richard and Sheryl Hoover (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette) decide to indulge their daughter and take her to the show. Along for the ride, both literally and figuratively, are Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin). Look also for Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who refuses to talk because he loves Nietzsche.<br /><br />Things aren't easy for the Hoover family. Richard's motivational "nine step" program won't sell and the family is losing practically all their money in the process; and Richard's father does heroin when nobody's looking just to get through the day. Dwayne wants to fly jets even after he discovers that he's colorblind; and Frank wallows in a type of self-pity depression because his male lover left him and he wasn't awarded the number one Proust scholar in the nation.<br /><br />Of all the characters, however, little Olive holds out the most hope. She's nervous but she really thinks she just might win the talent contest and be crowned Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />Will Olive be crowned Little Miss Sunshine? What happens after their ancient, rapidly decaying VW bus gets a broken clutch and a broken horn? Will they get to the contest in time? Will they all get there in the first place? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The cinematography is rather fine; I liked the scenes of the countryside as they traveled in their VW bus; and the scenes of the talent/beauty contest reflect good judgment. The choreography shines through in scenes where the little girls all compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a commentary by the directors and there is another commentary with both the screenwriter and the directors. There are four deleted ending scenes that also have optional commentary. In addition, one side of the DVD presents the movie in widescreen while the other side of the DVD presents the movie in full screen format. Impressive for a single DVD release!<br /><br />Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is fantastic entertainment. Funny at times, sad at times, the film never loses its focus. Some people may say that it tries too hard to please but I didn't pick up on that; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The movie is rated R so I would caution parents not to let young children watch this movie.<br /><br />Great job, everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last few years. This is the result of a combination of fascinating characters, great dialogues and outstanding performances by an all-star cast. On top of that, the final scene is so unexpected and hilarious that you will be rolling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />Olive is a seven-year-old girl whose hobby is to compete in pageants. She spends a lot of time practicing her routine and watching recordings of the Miss America pageant and mimicking the gestures of the competitors. She has one of the most dysfunctional and peculiar families you can think of. Her father, Richard, has created a nine-step program to transform people into winners. He is trying to get a publisher for the book, "Refuse to Lose", and the economic future of the family depends on the success of this enterprise. Her mother, Sheryl, likes to be brutally honest, feeds her family chicken out of a bucket every night and hides her smoking habit. Sheryl also has to deal with the suicide attempt by her brother, uncle Frank. Olive's grandpa also lives with the family. The old man is Olive's coach and has a drug addiction. Finally, there is the brother, Dwayne, who has promised not to talk until he is accepted into the Air Force and who idolizes the German philosopher Nietzsche.<br /><br />The dialogues are so good that it is unreal. For example, the honest approach of Sheryl led to a discussion during dinner in which Frank ended up explaining about his suicide attempt. But this carried further, since one of the reasons for it was being rejected by his male lover. Imagine the faces and comments of a seven-year-old when hearing about this! During this dinner, Olive finds out that the girl she lost to in the regional Little Miss Sunshine pageant has withdrawn from the finals. Now Olive has the chance to take her place and compete for the national title. The result is a road trip to California with the whole family in an old yellow van.<br /><br />There are a variety of complications during the trip and we get so see how the different members of the family react to stress. Once again, the conversations are what drive the interest, and grandpa (Alan Arkin) stands out with his incomparable sarcasm. Arkin's is the best performance of the bunch, but the other members of the cast do not lag far behind. Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell play their roles convincingly, and Paul Dano really shows us how a conflicted teenager behaves. Abigail Breslin deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her performance, and she joins the group of outstanding kids in movies, like Elijah Wood, Macaulay Culkin and Ivana Baquero. If you want to have a good time and laugh for a while there are few options better than this one. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>As Hollywood movies go, this is definitely not bad.  It's supposed to be an Indie film, though, and won raves at Sundance.  This surprised me; I would have expected it to have been made at Disney.  The story is nothing special although there are some genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />What saves it and earns my four stars here is the excellent cast.  Greg Kinnear is always terrific, in my book.  Alan Arkin gives the performance only an old master can do.  Abigail Breslin is truly Little Miss Sunshine;it's great to see a child's performance that isn't overly adorable.  Steve Carrell is very good in what had to be a difficult role, rising from his suicidal despair to life before our eyes. Paul Dano is good too as the suffering teenager.  I am not a big fan of Toni Collette.  Somehow she is too good at playing disagreeable, to make me warm up to her character.  But she does sweeten up a bit in the end.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned there are some things that are too improbable for us to take the film seriously, such as the fact that no one but grandpa has bothered to see the child's act.  I think that what bothered me the most was the stereotyped way of presenting most of the characters. We are clearly shown who the good guys and the bad guys are, in the eyes of the writers, and personally I find that annoying.  We're supposed to love the long suffering mom but I found her to be a dismal crank who has nothing but ridicule for her husband.  We're supposed to hate the dad but he is the one who by sheer force of will, pulls the family through all of the set-backs.<br /><br />More cliches:  the stupid cop, the superficial folks at the beauty pagent, the cold hearted "bereavement counselor" etc.  Yeah, there's some truth in all of that, I suppose, but it detracts from the overall value of the film for me.  If this were just a screwball farce, then fine, but we are asked to take it seriously and the heavy handedness of the writers in telling us who we're supposed to cheer and who to boo, leaves me a bit disgusted.  However, that's Hollywood, and as I said above, if you don't take it too seriously, it's an entertaining two hours.<br /><br />I have not seen the alternative endings but if I were to make one, it would feature Dad dumping Mom as soon as they get back to Albuquerque.<br /> :-)</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>"Life is nothing but a beauty pageant with everyone judging you all the time." So complains Dwayne, a sullen teenager who reads Nietzsche and scribbles notes to his dysfunctional family because he's taken a vow of silence. Not a bad move, either. His father Richard spouts cliches about his motivational series called "Refuse to Lose" that is an abysmal failure. Wife and mom Shery is the peace-maker-enabler. Her brother Frank is a Proust scholar who tried to commit suicide, and her foul-mouthed father who lives with the family kills himself snorting heroin. "Welcome to hell," Dwayne scribbles to Frank. Little Olive, the darling of the family, won a trip to the "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant, so the entire family piles into their dilapidated VW van for the 800-mile trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach. They endure the calamities and indignities you would expect, then find redemption of sorts that bespeaks a larger and more serious lesson to us all when they deconstruct the pageant in unlikely ways. Thank God for the Harris family!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Most reviewers describe the Hoover clan as dysfuncional which is erroneous.  The Hoovers are flawed individuals yet somehow cohere as a loving family unit.  "Little Miss Sunshine" is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it.  The film also succeeds as an indictment of the beauty pageant mentality that perpetuates the Jonbenet Ramsey syndrome that unfortunately exists in our society.  No film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since Michael Ritchie's "Smile" in 1975.  The cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.  Arkin, whose star rose in the sixties but has kind of waned in recent years, gives a cliche free performance as the drugtaking grandpa.  Breslin, as Olive, has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the Hoover clan together.  The tender scene between Arkin and Breslin prior to the pageant is heart-rending.  I cite Arkin and Breslin only because that of the cast members they should not be forgotten come Oscar time.  For that matter the film shouldn't be forgotten by the Academy members either.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>The story of a family of real oddballs who are determined to take the little daughter to California to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pagent. Satirical, touching, hysterically funny and terribly sad, this film is a must-see. The entire cast is incredibly good. Standout performances from Abigail Breslin (the daughter), Greg Kinnear (the father), Alan Arkin (grandpa), and Steve Carrell (the disallusioned, suicidal gay brother). Highly, highly recommended. Oscars all around for this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>This movie is so funny, I'm so glad to see a great comedy like this released on DVD just before Christmas!  Olive wants to make it to the pagent, and when she finally does, with her family's help, the result is hilarious.  After all the prissy perfect kids acts, just wait til you see what Olive has in store for her talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" is as good as comedy gets. If you can see only one funny movie this summer-- I'm not sure what else is out there-- run to see this one while it's still in the cool theatres. Abigail Breslin, a runner-up in a local children's  beauty pageant, is thrust into the limelight when the winner renounces her title and this child must go across the country to enter the national "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant finals. She is joined by her hyper-dysfunctional family: her father (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to sell his motivational message to the masses;  her mom ( Toni Collette); her gay uncle (Steve Carell), a Proust scholar who has just tried suicide-- he's even a failure at that-- her teenaged brother who has taken a vow of silence and only communicates by note pad; and finally her grandfather, who likes both sex and heroin (Alan Arkin). This over-the-top family travels in a VW van, in a laugh-a-minute trip that turns William Faulkner's novel AS I LAY DYING on its head.<br /><br />This movie spoofs a lot of things about America, not the least of which are those beauty pageants for toddlers and children. (My own hometown did have something called "Little Miss Petite Beauty Pageant".) Without giving away the plot, I'll just say what this child chooses for her entry in the talent competition (it has been a well-kept secret between her and her grandfather) will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />This movie is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>The cast in this quirky, very dark comedy make it fresh and very appealing.  It is less funny than it is melancholy, and somehow the players - from the always-fantastically real Toni Colette to the surprisingly layered Greg Kinnear, put heart into a screenplay that likes to go out of its way to be wacky and offkilter.  And to top it off, Steve Carell's turn as the suicidal Proust scholar should get him an Academy Award nomination -seriously.  It is one of those wildly great performances that pop out of nowhere - his innate humor informs the soul of a man who is brilliant, haunted and observant. The movie's slapdash ending has a generic, been-there-before silliness, but this is often a very entertaining and moving slice of life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Friends of mine are already telling me they were disappointed in "Little Miss Sunshine;" the reviews have been so unanimously glowing, they complained, that it set their expectations unreasonably high. This really is a shame, because Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' debut feature is second only to Rian Johnson's "Brick" as the best American film so far this year, and a more surefire crowd-pleaser than Johnson's more stylized film. But "Little Miss Sunshine" is not a movie that wows you; it sidles up to you, tickling your ribs gently at first, then gradually turning up the laugh meter as it progresses until, before you realize it, you're covered in popcorn and spilled Coke from rolling in the aisles. Like other recent quirky comedies--"Sideways," "Garden State," and "The Squid and the Whale"--"Little Miss Sunshine" mines unforgettable humor from the lives of desperate characters who are lovable despite their glaring character flaws. The plot is simple: The six members of the Hoover family pile into a decrepit VW bus for an 800-mile trek to California so that daughter Olive can compete in the "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant finals. All of them are smarting from separate, painful insults to their egos and their hopes, and along the way each one suffers a final, crushing blow--in one case, with extreme prejudice. The beauty of "Little Miss Sunshine" is that it overcomes all this sorrow to become a joyous experience. No other recent film has demonstrated how thin a line there is between tragedy and comedy, or the crucial difference between embracing life and despairing of it. The buoyancy of the screenplay is matched by the absolute perfection of the ensemble cast. It's virtually impossible to single any of them out, they are all so good. I have to admit a predilection for Alan Arkin and Steve Carell, but I don't want to shortchange the shining, sparkling contributions of Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano and little Abigail Breslin, an almost frighteningly gifted child actress. All I can say is, at the next Screen Actors Guild award show, when the "Best Comedy Ensemble" award is announced, they had better read these names, in alphabetical order: Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, and Greg Kinnear. If they do not, rioting in the streets will be completely warranted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>finally a great movie intelligent story and extremely fun funny and engaging. If you see my reviews you see I have low tolerance for bad movies. This one is really well done. It's not one of the best movies of all time but it's a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is an odd film and it's down right creepy in places, but it also makes you smile too.  In that sense it is like real life.  Many families today are dysfunctional and, sadly, many end up breaking apart.  This film, contrary to some critical commentaries here, does not glorify the dysfunctional family as much as it seems to respect those that manage to stay together and support one another in spite of their idiosyncrasies, issues, self-absorbed claptrap and the like.  These characters aren't all likable, but that makes them all the more real.  That doesn't mean that their dysfunctional behaviors are being "glorified" as I've seen written in some reviews here.<br /><br />Yes, the grandfather is something of a stereotypical old pervert who loves to use the "f" bomb at every turn, and is an addict to boot, but no one will doubt that he loves, even adores, his granddaughter, and even though he appears to be very intolerant of his self-centered, narrow-minded, unforgiving son, he loves him anyway and even tells him how proud he is of him even when he doesn't agree with his mission in life, which fails.  He at least admires his son's guts in trying to succeed at something.  I think that is the focus here and not his flaws.<br /><br />Yes, the son seems to be a stereotypical self-absorbed, intolerant, cold, and counter-cultured just for the sake of being different teen-ager, but he really does love his family.  His shirt, "Jesus was wrong" notwithstanding, doesn't make him anything more than a confused teen-ager with a heart he tries to hide.  He even apologizes to his family at one point.  To point to this film as anti-Christian is just reading too much into it (the shirt, the conduct of the actors and so forth).  If we use this character and his famous shirt as an excuse or evidence that this film is somehow anti-Christian, then we ignore his good qualities that are far more memorable and far more important than his poor fashion counter-culture t-shirt.<br /><br />My only real issue with the film it that it is very unevenly paced and that often puts off an audience.  Regardless of that the acting is nothing less than terrific by all the actors involved.  Toni Collette is perfect as the caring by burned out wife to a pipe-dreaming husband, excellently portrayed by Greg Kinnear, who hopes to be the next self-help guru.  Alan Arkin is convincing as the grandfather and a very restrained Steve Carell is perfectly cast as the gay brother who attempts suicide early in the film.  Paul Dano gives a interesting performance as the son who can't stand living in the "hell" of his dysfunctional family.  Lastly Abigail Breslin, "Signs" fame, is wonderfully cast, as the forever optimistic girl who longs to be the next "Little Miss Sunshine", but already is in our hearts and her family's hearts.  She is just irresistible in the role.  Just as every large family seems to have the black sheep, the responsible one, and the one that everyone can rely on to bring a ray of sunshine onto any family tragedy, so this family has Breslin's character.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Do NOT right this movie off because of the first 15 minutes.  It's a slow start, probably because you're supposed to be introduced to all the characters.  The boredom continues while the family sits at the dinner table eating chicken.  But, as soon as this scene is over, the movie improves drastically.<br /><br />As you've heard by now, Little Miss Sunshine is about a dysfunctional family who has to travel to a beauty pageant together for their 7-year old daughter.  Each member of the family has their own wacky problems, and you will find out about them as the movie rolls along.  You have to be patient and pay attention or else it won't seem like a very funny  move.  Trust me, it is.  Good writing truly makes this movie a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine, the little indie film that could, is in my opinion one of the best films of the year. extremly funny, quirky characters, and a simple plot that makes it work. the story is about this really dysfunctional family, the father and wife always argue, the grandpa spews profanity, the son refusses to talk, and the gay uncle tried to kill himself. however, the only normal one in the family Olive, has just been informed that she has entered the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. and with that, the family piles into a huge yellow bus and there off to California were as you can excpect things never go right. the family slowly but surley come together because of this pageant and though there far from perfect, at least there better then they started. whats best is this transformation isent shoved down our throats but is done in a very subtle yet prominent way. the humor is definently the funniest i have heard in a while but the most hilarious part is definently the pageant. i thought i was going to die laughing. the performances are also top notched, the best definently being Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, they just shine in the film but Breslin is the standout. i was pretty shocked that Alan Arkin won the oscar for Supporting Actor but, he's also a very nice choice though i still think Eddie should have got it. so if you want to see the most funny and dysfunctional family since the Burnhams, then this Sundance approved film is definently for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" is the story of the Hoover Family. Olive (played by the adorable and very funny Abigail Breslin) has just been accepted into the "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant (because of a cancellation) and her family decides to drive through three states so she can make the competition on time. Richard Hoover (played by former Talk Soup host, Greg Kinnear) is Oliver's dad who believes that winning is number one. When Richard tells poor Olive that she shouldn't eat ice-cream (because there aren't any fat Miss America contestants) I thought it was both extremely funny and also equally sad.<br /><br />Paul Dano played Olive's (very comical) morbidly hate-filled brother, Dwayne. Alan Arkin played the coke-snorting, sex-crazy grandfather. Toni Collette was the kids' mom Sheryl; it was obvious that Sheryl was wrapped way too tight but she really did love her family. And rounding out this ensemble cast is Uncle Frank (played by "Forty Year Old Virgin" star Steve Carell.) Frank came to stay with Sheryl and her family after he recently tried to commit suicide after his homosexual love of interest rejected him.<br /><br />So the family embarks on a car trip across NV, AZ, and CA in a broken down, old 70's bus (they have to push it to get it started!)<br /><br />There are so many funny moments in this picture. It was also touching to see Olive put her head on her brother's shoulder to try to cheer him up, and I did suspect at that moment that Dwayne actually didn't hate everyone because he seemed so sensitive.<br /><br />Anyone that watches this picture will certainly agree that Olive's dance routine was the hit of the entire movie. Olive dances to the tune of the Rick James hit "Super Freak" while prudish Pageant Official Jenkins (played perfectly by one-time "Malcolm In The Middle" star Beth Grant) goes absolutely BERSERK! I don't want to give anything away, but the entire family was involved, a huge scene resulted, and the police were even called!<br /><br />After watching the first thirty minutes of this movie I thought to myself, "why are these people all together..." ...But I suppose family is whatever you make of it and the Hoover family must have really loved each other to go through all they did and still stay together. Maybe they don't make the same decisions as the "traditional American family" but that's ok because they still find their own happiness.<br /><br />I reluctantly went to go see this movie after a friend told me how good it was. I protested because it looked totally ridiculous but my friend had already seen it and he insisted that it was a superior picture. And I am so glad that I went because this was one of the best movies I have seen in months. It is dysfunction at it's funniest!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is one of the finest low budget indie comedies you are ever likely to see and the finest I have seen since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.  For a "small" film this one has a surprisingly strong cast and I would love to know how the producers managed to get so many fine individuals together for this project.  There is no star of the film, but an ensemble cast in which each performer has to carry his or her weight.  Probably the hottest performer in the film at the moment is Steve Carell, who here plays a suicidal Proust scholar and former professor who is grieving over losing a grad student he was in love with to another Proust scholar.  Anyone going to see the film hoping to see Carell as he was in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN is going to be crushed, but those open to something unexpected will be delighted.  The very gifted Toni Collette, who does her usual fine job as the mother in an exceptionally dysfunctional family, plays his sister.  "Dysfunctional" might actually be a weak term, since "chaotic" might be better.  Most of the film turns around the attempt to get her daughter Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California, a long drive via Volkswagen bus from their home in New Mexico.  One of the joys of the film is Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, who while cute as a button is not traditional beauty pageant material.  Many will remember her from SIGNS as Mel Gibson's young daughter.  Greg Kinnear, a rather harried motivational speaker who hopes to achieve great success through his 9-Step plan to become a winner, plays her father.  Alan Arkin plays his father in an absolutely hysterical performance as the lewd, vulgar, and unselfconscious heroin-sniffing grandfather.  Rounding out the family is Dwayne, played wonderfully by Paul Dano.  In the preview that I saw, Dano may have been responsible for many of the loudest laughs from the audience.  Dwayne is a hostilely independent teen who has taken a vow of silence until he manages to get into the Air Force Academy to pursue his dream of becoming a test pilot.  When his uncle Frank (Carell) asks him if he has many friends Dwayne scribbles on a notepad, "I hate everybody," then takes time to underline "everybody" after Frank reads the note.<br /><br />The ordeals the family experiences are all original and exceedingly funny.  I won't spoil the adventure by recounting them, but I was struck throughout by how original the humor was.  Virtually none of the humor was recycled or flat.  There are a host of great scenes that any viewer will remember vividly.<br /><br />After another summer of mind-numbing films that attempt to be blockbusters but only manage to depress, this film will be a tonic.  A long time ago Hollywood seemed to forget that more often than not less is more.  While this is a "small" film, it manages to be infinitely funnier than any of its larger-budgeted competitors.  It could also quite possibly end up the funniest movie of 2006.<br /><br />I did have one quibble with the film.  I thought the last few minutes were a bit of a disappointment.  Without revealing precisely what happened, I thought the reactions of all the characters were a bit hard to buy.  But apart from that, this is an utterly delightful and very funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is best viewed as the surprise sleeper independent film that made it big. The problem is, I don't know that that's true. From the first trailer, I felt that this film was branding itself as such, before anything like that had happened. If this film had come out a few years ago, before we had Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, and even Wes Anderson films like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, it might be more groundbreaking. Also, is a film really independent when it stars Alan Alda, Greg Kinnear, and Steve Carrell (the fastest rising name in comedy besides Sacha Baron Cohen)?<br /><br />The truth is, this film is an interesting, sometimes funny, almost poignant look at a dysfunctional family. However, most of the circumstances that take place in the film are at best slightly unbelievable, at worst entirely silly. Often a huge argument will erupt, only to be settled seconds later. The entire premise of the film is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />On the other hand, all of the acting is superb. Steve Carrell is surprisingly successful as a depressed Proust scholar... I could go on about the rest of the cast, but they all nail their characters. The standout is little Abigail Breslin as young Olive, who has a Dakota Fanning-esque acting talent which really makes the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable film, but really that's all it is. It doesn't live up to its great hype, and it never transcends its "I'm a quirky independent film, love me" style. It's nice to see an original film in a time when our theatres are packed full of remakes, but Little Miss Sunshine isn't the hallmark of quality that it's made out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>I am hard on movies about quirky characters and their obligatory "dysfunctional" families. I've seen too many that are nothing more than chains of tired cliches strung end to end. But "Little Miss Sunshine"'s vibrant, genuine characters stand out among quirky indie relationship films. Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a frustrated motivational speaker with high hopes for a book deal. When his 7-year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is accepted in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, the family wants to make sure she has the opportunity to pursue her beauty pageant dreams. But wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) can't drive a stick shift. Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) can't be left alone. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Olive's talent coach. And silent teenaged brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is just put upon. So they all pile into the family's yellow VW minibus to drive Olive 700 miles to California.<br /><br />Owing to Michael Arndt's heartfelt script and its wonderful ensemble cast, "Little Miss Sunshine" is both hilarious and credible on an emotional level. The characters are active and deliberate, never reactive, and never played for laughs. The interplay of several generations of characters without demeaning or marginalizing any of them always does wonders for relationship dramas. The middle-aged parents, delinquent grandpa, optimistic child, and morose teen are all fully-realized, equally interesting people. "Little Miss Sunshine" never feels contrived even though it could hardly be moreso. The characters don't feel like cliches, even though I've seen them before. The family actually functions very well. In the end, I couldn't help liking all of these people and laughing with them all the way to California.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): This is a 2-sided disc with a full screen version on Side A and widescreen on Side B. There are 2 audio commentaries, both of which can be found on either side of the disc. The first audio commentary is by husband and wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They discuss the film's tone, casting, filming in the van, the actors, the sets, and  more. The second commentary is by screenwriter Michael Arndt and directors Dayton and Faris. There is more about characters and dialogue in this commentary. But there is a lot of repetition between the commentaries, so if you want to listen to one, I recommend the writer/directors commentary. Also on Side A, there is a music video of "Till the End of Time" by Devotchka and a Soundtrack Spot. On Side B are 4 alternate endings (5 min) with optional directors' commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (LMS) is a wonderful example of a movie that has many moments that make you want to laugh and cry at the same time...both for legitimate reasons.  Why do I think this is a notable accomplishment?  Because I think you have to really care about the characters to reach that point.  When outrageous things happen to characters you don't care much about...you'll just laugh.  And if the circumstances are too horrific, and you care about the characters, you'll cry.  This movie walks the line, and that isn't easy.<br /><br />LMS is about a fairly typical "indie-movie-dysfunctional family."  A loser father who tries to teach empowerment workshops (Greg Kinear), his wife (Toni Collette) who is the closest thing to a voice of reason, their young daughter (Abigail Breslin, who is a finalist in a young-girl's beauty pageant...but has no business being).  There's also Collette's longer teenage son (who has taken a vow of silence...THAT'S something we've never seen a teen do in the movies!!!) And Colette's suicidal gay brother who is Proust scholar (Steve Carell).  Rounding out the group is Kinear's cantankerous old father (Alan Arkin), who has been kicked out of his retirement community for doing drugs.  So, the movie loses some points for lack of an original group of characters. Indie movies are alway SO interested in quirky people...but after two decades of post-Sex, Lies & Videotape independence...we've seen all the "new" archetypes before.<br /><br />The movie is about the family's eventful roadtrip from Albuquerque (my home town and current residence) to SoCal for the contest...and then the contest itself.  The trip is undertaken in an old VW bus, which early on, loses its clutch, and can thus only run in 3rd and 4th gear.  This leads to some very amusing and somehow touching moments with all these characters push-starting the car and then one by one, leaping into the open door!  This is creative (and very believable if you've ever owned a VW!).<br /><br />Most of the film chronicles the journey, which includes moments both ridiculous and sad (as I said above).  Plans go awry.  You can feel the sweat of impending despair.  Then, they arrive, and the contest itself is almost like another movie.  It becomes as much a comment on the beauty pageant industry as anything else.  This part, while amusing, deflates some of the power the film was building towards...and the "climactic" scene wants to be sublime, but is only mildly pleasing.  We've had our tone jarred too much.<br /><br />I don't want you to think I didn't like the film.  Most of it is excellent, primarily because of the outstanding performances.  Alan Arkin is always great (in my opinion, he's the single greatest film actor never to win an Oscar...I will pretty much see anything he's in.)  Greg Kinear, doing another take on his "decent loser" is in fine form.  His character generates equal amounts of pity and frustration...and that's exactly what it should do!  Toni Collette is another performer who can seemingly do no wrong...including one of the most convincing American accents ever done by an Australian.  She is simply a terrific actress.  Steve Carell steals the show in many ways.  His character undergoes the most growth, and in some ways, the most pain.  Yet Carell hardly changes expressions.  (Although I must say that when Carell smiles, he has a wonderful, glowing, innocent smile that cannot help but make you feel better.)  His performance is very internal, deep, and best of all...really, really funny.  He's so different here than in THE OFFICE, or BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  If anyone thought his string of success is a fluke...think again...this guy is the real deal.<br /><br />So I heartily recommend the film for its richness (even when it descends into cliche...it's heartfelt) and the great acting.  Frankly, that's enough right there.  It is R-rated for some obscene rants by the grandfather...but for all that, it feels strangely innocent.<br /><br />And for natives of Albuquerque...none of the film was shot in New Mexico, and it shows.  Even the interior shots don't "feel" like a house you would see in Albuquerque.  This doesn't detract from the film at all...I'm just mentioning it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This very funny comedy concerns old Olive, a sweet little seven-year old who wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  She lives with her eccentric family in New Mexico, so the whole brood piles into the old VW bus for a road trip, and there's never a dull moment.  Her father (played by Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is a trouble-making curmudgeon, her uncle (Steve Carell) is suicidal, her mother (Toni Collette) is always screaming, and her alienated fifteen-year old brother refuses to speak.  They all go through a lot on the trip, are deeply affected by changes, and leave California stronger than ever.<br /><br />The excellent ensemble cast and surprisingly clever script make this a genuinely funny comedy with many laugh-out-loud moments and just the right blend of serious and touching and manically silly.  Except for the constant use of foul language, it's a movie everyone could enjoy.  The script gives each member of the family plenty of time to shine, and each part was perfectly-cast.  I left the theatre with a smile on my face, glad that I saw this movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine does very little to piss you off. It is a small budget film about a road trip a family takes so that the youngest member can participate in a fancy competition. The film has an impressive start and by the tenth minute, all the characters are introduced in a very effective way. Then on, it is really the discomfort between the characters that helps the storyline proceed.<br /><br />I felt there was a slight miscasting since Greg Kinnear made me want to sock him in the eye. I mean, his character was quite interesting but there is this one dimensional "80's hangover" look on his face that doesnt do much to bring out the unpredictability of the film. Not in one scene did I feel surprised at what his character does. Maybe it's just me but please, how can someone with the same haircut (since As Good As It Gets..) get the particular role. I do understand this was a low budget film with limited aspirations but...<br /><br />Alan Arkin (grandpa) has a short yet mutilatingly effect cameo. His dialogues are to the point and hilarious, his quotes are unforgettable. I carried one with me after the movie ended. "A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."<br /><br />Coming to my favourite character, Steve Carell was very good. He seems to lend the film more purpose. His run is funny, his silent un-accusing looks, his way of hiding himself from his love, the fact that he plays someone gay so nonchalantly, his scenes with the character Dwayne and the grandfather were quite funny. He has this guilty look on his face as if he's an escaped convict of some sort. Funny.<br /><br />Paul Dano (the 15 year old kid) is actually 23 and his character was very interesting as well. My favourite scene in the film involves him and Olive in a ditch while the bus has stopped. He speaks in that scene.<br /><br />Overall, I feel Little Miss Sunshine deserves three stars because of how it doesn't dig deeper into issues it dramatizes. It doesn't have a huge scope and there is no one single OUTSTANDING performance. Paul Dano could have had a better role.<br /><br />The last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>I kind of came into this movie in the middle but all I can say from what I saw is when the little girl did her talent performance. Let's just say I cannot view Rick James' "Superfreak" the same again.  For one thing, this family is dysfunctional from the word go. Big time back seat drivers, but in spite of their own quirks and such, they do rally behind the little girl so that she could enter The Little Miss Sunshine contest and enter it she does. I am a bit surprised how they came cross country in such a broke down vehicle, but then again, I seen worse, and if your determination is more than the circumstances, that wins through. But when that little girl did her song, I fell out. First of all, you got all these prim, grown looking little girls up there looking Jon Benet Ramsey clones doing cutesy stuff; but you got this little girl  dancing to "Superfreak" albeit not appropriate for a little girl, not for a beauty show of Jon Benet clones, and when the folks went off, I could see the mother's concern for her child shine through for a bit, but when they joined her, I saw a family who showed love and concern for the smallest of their family. So to me, they can't be that dysfunctional.Quirky, not your average, everyday family, but family nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and in the year 2006, that little movie was "Little Miss Sunshine."<br /><br />Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family.

Every character has the requisite wacky personality and/or oddball mannerisms (as is the case in every film of this type).  The plot is minimal and contrived, existing for the sole purpose of forcing this unlikely family together.  Handled incorrectly, I would usually loathe this type of film.  So I'm pleased to report that "Little Miss Sunshine" is far more successful than it has any right to be.  While I still feel as if this "little" picture was slightly overpraised upon it's release, it provides many laughs and works as screwball comedy.<br /><br />One thing that sets "Sunshine" apart from similar indies is a stellar cast.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette do fine work as the embattled parents.  Abigail Breslin brings a refreshing blend of hope and delusion to the title character.  Alan Arkin chews the scenery as the foul mouthed addict father--it's nice to see him again, especially in such a showy in-your-face performance.  Steve Carell is surprisingly sympathetic as the depressive gay brother.  And Paul Dano delivers the movie's best performance as the disconnected son who has taken a vow of silence.  So even though this colorful, supremely eccentric bunch are character "types" as opposed to real people, the actors make it work.  The moments of drama that appear succeed only because the actors make you care.<br /><br />But, first and foremost, this is a comedy.  And I forgave the calculated eccentricities because the film is simply funny.  Outrageous and slapstick, yet smartly observant, this film earns your respect and laughs.  It's a fun ride with many identifiable situations.<br /><br />Beloved by audiences and most critics upon it's release, I would hesitate to overhype this film for the DVD market.  A viewer who discovers this picture is likely to appreciate it's charms more than someone who goes into it having heard it's the best film of the year.  "Little Miss Sunshine" is not particularly original (it shares many plot elements from "Vacation," in fact)--but it is extremely well done.

In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!<br /><br />I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>A dysfunctional family takes to the road for their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has a shot at the finals of a beauty pageant for little girls in California. Greg Kinnear is Richard a success obsessed father who developed a mental training method to succeed, and Alan Arkin is a powder-sniffing Grandpa. Everyone in this family has some problem; Toni Collette as Sheryl, Richard's wife, Steve Carell as suicidal Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne who vowed never to speak. The film has already been praised by the critics and general audiences, but it is also true that the film is not to everyone's taste.<br /><br />Many people say "Little Miss Sunshine" is a funny comedy. I don't disagree with their opinions, but I find the film totally different way because the film contains a considerable amount of sadness or poignancy in it behind the apparently hilarious part of the film. I am not sure this sadness creeping into the film's world is really the original intention of the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer Michael Arndt, but I can say if you're looking for a kind of story in which underdogs become what you call "winners," maybe this is not your film.<br /><br />For all the absurd scenes in their cross-continental journey or the farces at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the characters take themselves very seriously, and are determined to be true to themselves. And their adamant decision might sometimes irritate you. The characters are not begging to be liked, but still you will notice the changes of heart in every one of them by the end of the story. So "heart-warming" would be a misleading tag to this film for the people in it are often annoying like someone in your own family.<br /><br />The actors are all great. Many have already praised Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and of course Abigail Breslin the centerpiece of the film, so I won't add any more words. The filmmakers are clearly helped greatly by their talent - Paul Dano's son part needs more improvement and some minor characters like police officer or hospital doctors are not as great as others -- but the entire cast of the main characters still did a fine job.<br /><br />`Little Miss Sunshine' is not free from clich&eacute; and unnecessary quirkiness. The satires could have been more biting with more skillful or daring treatment of the pageant scenes, where little girl Olive does one thing. It is not my cup of tea, but the film is certainly a good character study, not afraid of showing unlikable part of them. Or you may come to like them in spite of (or because of) their flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: There has been a lot of garbage out in the theaters so far this year. The only movies I can list that I truly found to be great were United 93, DaVinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and now Little Miss Sunshine. This is one of the best films of the year, and the first movie that deserves some attention from Oscar voters. The story is about a family who takes a road trip to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. We start the story and our ensamble cast is introduced one by one. We have Richard the overcontroling father, Sheryl the loving mother, their foul mouthed grandpa, the rebel son, Frank the suicidal homosexual genius uncle, and little Olive. I could spend a long time just describing the brilliance of each character and what they all mean to the plot, but that would take awhile. So, now this dysfunctional family goes on a roadtrip to California so that their daughter can enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. What follows is a heartwarming, emotional, and hilarious journey. Each character finds their own personal journey through Olive. Olive is the center of the film that holds the family together. The film isn't called Little Miss Sunshine beacause of the beauty pageant, it's because of Olive. This sweet innocent girl has no idea of the world around her, and no idea that she is the center of the family. A great scene in the film has Dwayne, the rebel son, refusing to get off the side of the road and continue with the trip even though everyone else is trying to comfort him into getting back in the car. Then his sister comes and rests her hand on his shoulder, he looks up at her, gets up and carries her back to the car. The film addresses many of life's problems and basically shows how it's all one big beauty pageant, but of course beauty doesn't matter at all. The only complaint I had about the film, which constitutes it's 3.5 stars, was the ending. I can't really say anything without ruining it, but let's just say it left a lot to be desired. I felt like the story deserved a more complete resolution versus what we were given.<br /><br />ACTING: The film is filled with an incredible cast, and I mean incredible. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, and Abigail Breslin all give outstanding performances. Steve Carell is an amazing actor and I really feel like he's going to get nominated for his role here. The film is truly something special and the script definately calls for an ensamble, which they deliver.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Right now I am calling nominations for Steve Carell and Michael Arndt's amazing screenplay. Who new that this first time screenwriter would produce such a rich script. You also have to acknowledge the superb directing from real life married couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. We may just be looking at the Best Picture of the year, what a suprise if it did go on to win.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>The timing of the film's theatrical release with the latest bombshell about the JonBenet case is practically uncanny. However, as a viewing of the DVD will plainly show, the satiric critique of the Little Miss Living Doll beauty pageants is relatively contained, occupying the last 20 minutes, though the point is unmistakable. The ultra polished, talented contestants against whom the film's slightly pudgy and awkward hero, Olive, competes aren't so much little girls as miniature Las Vegas show queens, coached in seductive eye use and sexy posturing. How ironic that the manager of the beauty contest is scandalized by Olive, whose "improper" strip tease, taught to her by her grandfather, doesn't contain a hint of seduction or sexuality.<br /><br />Olive's quest to be a beauty queen appears to align her with other members of her family. Her obtuse, self-programmed father, who preaches #1 or none, wants to be a published authority on positive thinking and winning. Her suicidal, sensitive, gay uncle wants to be recognized as the world's #1 Proust scholar. Her introverted, tormented and driven brother wants to be a jet pilot in his own private Nietzschean world. Toni Collette as the mom, on the other hand, is the model of tolerance and forebearance, a supportive "gamer" whose ability to eat ice cream without guilt fortunately has a more profound effect on her daughter than the father's insistence on winning at any cost.<br /><br />By the end of the film, our family of losers ultimately emerge as true winners. Alan Arkin, as the profane patriarchal grandfather, provides the film's enduring wisdom, counseling both his son and granddaughter (Abigail Breslin deserves a supporting actress award for this scene alone) before his death about the importance of simply living life to the fullest. A real winner, he tells the family, is someone "who's not so afraid of losing he's afraid to try." It's not the destination that matters; it's the trip. And the film literally offers one hell of a ride. Apart from some raw language, this is a family film recommended for all dysfunctional families who enjoy crying as much as laughing together.<br /><br />At the same time, thanks to inventive scripting and directing, this little gem transcends the "family film" genre, providing moments of subtlety, nuance, and genuine "life." The very different, often ambivalent, responses of various members of the pageant to Olive's performance suggest that not everyone buys into the Little Miss America mentality. And again the mom is the one member of the family who has sufficient confidence in her daughter to sense that the men's concern about Olive's being "laughed at" speaks less about Olive than their own childish fears and self-consciousness.<br /><br />Finally, by making Grandpa the unlikely voice of wisdom, the film takes on universal, life-affirming resonance. "Little Miss Sunshine" counters our tendency to see living merely as a "means" to some distant end or goal. Often the means needs no justification: being fully alive in the here and now can be the biggest prize of all.<br /><br />Count this one is an all-around winner--an entertaining, formulaic movie with enough twists, vitality, heart, and thought to almost atone for all of those long, dull "Talledega Nights" which moviegoers increasingly have to endure as part of their desensitizing training.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>What do you get when you put a divorcee (Toni Collette), a suicidal brother (Steve Carell), a drug addict senior (Alan Arkin), a life coach (Greg Kinnear), a teenager with a vow of silence (Paul Dano) and an adorable six year pageant finalist (Abigail Breslin) into a yellow Volkswagen bus? Well, I'll tell you. You get a roller coaster ride of emotion<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is about a middle class family, struggling to get by and struggling to keep the pieces of their dysfunctional family together. This is put to an even greater test when they pack up the bus to travel to California so the youngest, little Olive, can compete in a beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />I'm totally in love with this film and plan to watch it again and again. I laughed really hard and cried numerous times. I'm not a big fan of Steve Carell (40 year old virgin, The Office) but I loved him in this film. Olive first won my heart in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs and again in Raising Helen. All the actors young and old were superb and harmonized one another.<br /><br />Some may not think the story line is original--family forced to travel together-- but this really is a dynamic group of actors providing quality entertainment from beginning to end. It has some dark subject matter at times; dealing with issues of depression, suicide, drug abuse, unemployment, and death but most are handled with the utmost respect. I said most.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, hysterical and sad film. I highly recommend seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Death, drug addiction, attempted suicide, emotional instability - these are just a few of the elements that make up what is fast turning into the sleeper hit comedy of 2006 - "Little Miss Sunshine," in which an extended family of six piles into its rickety minivan and takes a thousand mile road trip from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Newport Beach, California, so that their daughter can compete in a beauty pageant for pre-teen girls. Needless to say, the family experiences many colorful and lesson-instilling adventures along the way.<br /><br />The characters, for the most part, fall into that category that anyone familiar with independent movie-making will instantly recognize as the "photogenically dysfunctional." That is to say each has his own individualized "quirk" stamped onto his character to make him both "weird" and "recognizable" at the same time. The father, Frank (Greg Kinnear), is a win-at-all-costs motivational speaker who has designed a nine-step program for success that he expects not only his clients but his own family members to internalize and follow. Cheryl (Toni Collette) is his generally pragmatic wife whose relative sanity is the only thing that seems to be keeping the rest of the family from spinning off into unrestrained movie quirkdom. Frank's father (Alan Arkin) is a cantankerous, heroin-sniffing old man who cusses a blue streak, obsesses over pornography, and says everything that is on his mind no matter how politically incorrect in nature. Frank (Steve Carell) is Cheryl's morose gay brother who has just been released from a mental hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is the teenaged son who wants to be an Air Force pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. Finally, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the adorable little moppet with dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and who seems, along with her mother, to be the one levelheaded thinker in the group.<br /><br />This is, for the most part, a charming, extremely well acted film that can be very entertaining provided one doesn't go into it expecting too much. The conflicts and interactions among the various characters are often sharp and shrewdly observed, and directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the tone and pace of the film lighthearted and breezy (even in its darker moments). The screenplay by Michael Arndt walks a fine line between cynicism and sentiment, only occasionally stumbling along the way. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, one of the most engaging and entertaining characters drops off the radar screen, and his absence is definitely felt. There are also a few too many sitcom level routines and situations, and the scene at the beauty pageant comes perilously close to endorsing the very thing - the sexualizing of pre-pubescent girls - that the film is supposed to be savaging (although I can see where the filmmakers could mount a counter argument to me here, but I'm not sure it would be all that convincing).<br /><br />Although all the performers are fine, Toni Collette is really the one who brings this film to life. In portraying the one generally "normal" adult on hand, Collette lets reasonableness and common sense guide her reactions to the near-surrealistic events that are happening to them. And young Abigail Breslin is a natural-born scene-stealer.<br /><br />Apart from its few flaws (including the fact that not a single one of the six riders in the car - not even the little girl - is ever seen wearing a seatbelt), "Little Miss Sunshine" is a winning film that seems to be saying that, good, bad or indifferent, family is what really matters in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>The reviews posted here tell about a brilliant satire that explores and reveals great subjects, grand topics, and enormous themes.

I loved the comedy, the acting, the wild story line, the goofy antics and odd displays of maladjustment, but I didn't get the feeling that great truths were being explored. The grandfather character was played so well by Alan Arkin that I began immediately to say the big "O" word, Oscar. His every gesture and expression is the work of a master comic actor. About half way into the movie, I got tired, though, and after the grandfather dies, I lost interest in the film altogether. Frankly, I didn't like them very much and only cared about the old man. The silent son was interesting until he opened his mouth, and then he seemed very ordinary. The parents were awful, the road trip became terribly long, and the arrival scene in LA seemed suddenly too goofy, as they drove over the flower-beds and through gate posts, I really wondered where the police were and figured, as a life-long LA resident, that they would have been shot after 10 minutes of that kind of craziness. So, yes to the acting, and yes to Arkin, and yes to the idea, but I'm happy not to have to see any of those awful people again.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Has there ever been a better metaphor for the challenges of uniting a family than this rag-tag band of emotionally bent gypsies pushing their ailing VW bus in order to get it going?  Times is tough for the Hoover clan, but somehow, miraculously, they make it.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is faultless as the obsessively positive self-help guru wananabe, a homeless man's Tony Robbins.  Toni Collette is equally on point, here's a mom who serves dinner out of a box and empathy out of a scowl.  Secondary characters lift the level higher; Alan Arkin is hilarious as the smack-snorting gramps that coaches Olive in dancing and Dwayne in dating, his political incorrectness is simply inspiring.<br /><br />Writer Michael Arndt must be given high marks for this motley crew of characters.  Brother Frank, realized to perfection by Steve Carell of "The Office" fame, is a suicidal homosexual in danger of losing his title of world's leading Proust expert.  Dwayne, by contrast, is a teenage devotee of Nietzsche, consumed by hatred, strictly practicing a vow of silence. Watching their relationship evolve is particularly touching.<br /><br />As the bizarre events unfold, one knows that the payday will come at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  That said, when it does, you're still not ready for it.  Gramps, by now long gone, is so very alive in every bit of it.  It is uproariously funny, and very defiant too, mirroring Dwayne's rage.  Watching this family, and I use the word carefully, finding themselves on stage, for all the "perfect" world to see and ridicule, despise, and condemn - is joyful celebration.

Simply put, Oscar doesn't go for this stuff. Yeah it'll probably get a nomination but I usually call those<br /><br />"rounders", meaning they're solely picked to round out the 5 nominations. Some were great movies, some were merely okay while others were like "why's this up here?" Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie sure but the idea Oscar will end up choosing this over some "historically important" but rather empty film"" is either when they finally got some sense knocked into them or people will think this is some massive budget epic in line with Braveheart or Gladiator.<br /><br />Thanks to a contestant unable to compete, Olive Hoover is selected to compete in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. However, family problems including suicide, a really mouthy relative and a struggling self-help guru wannabe prevent her from going. Unless you're in the Hoover family and they go on a road trip complete with a poor working vehicle and any other problem they run into.<br /><br />At a certain point, the grandpa of the family rants that they're having chicken again and I definately felt like that with my family. Not a week goes by where someone doesn't order pizza. This is one of those kind of films where it's easily to pinpoint the same occurence in real life complete with all its rough spots. While very "R" talking, the grandpa has a sweet relationship with his granddaughter that I've seen quite a few times and the angst-filled kid hates everyone yet can't resist the power of a good hug when everyone tries to figure out what to say.<br /><br />The casting is always essential in a movie and thankfully not a single cast member is interchangeable. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin and Paul Dano are note-perfect as the father, mother, grandfather and the son respectively. The 2 standouts are restrained Steve Carell who's likable and funny without being overbearingingly so in a Jim Carrey/Robin Williams way. But the real star is actually Abigail Breslin. Known as the too-adorable daughter from Signs (how cute was it when she said she couldn't drink water because of her brother's amoebas) but here she's adorable and sincere without in that kind of cloying "isn't she cute? We wrote her to be super cute" way.<br /><br />Expect a double-dip, most likely around Oscars time since the special features are kind of skimpy. We get commentaries and alternate endings which are fine but don't beat the one in the film. Those girls that everyone was cheering over were so creepy, one literally looked like a porcelain doll. So when Olive does her routine, not only is it different and unique but it was actually more thrilling that showed the alternate ending was not the way to go.<br /><br />Sometimes if a thing gets too big, unfair expectations are placed on it. After the massive hype a film like Brokeback Mountain got, you walking thinking this is the greatest thing ever (and to be honest, I'm one of the few who hated it and it wasn't because of the issue in it) so if Little Miss Sunshine gets nominated and even wins, I'd bet dollars to those fattening Krispy Kremes the words "overrated" will be thrown around loads. But like a character says in the film, losers is when they're scared of winning and don't even bother trying and this is a film that tries its damnednest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This is a good movie, but not the funniest of the year by far, nor of all time. This movie really starts off slow, and after a while things wind up falling into place, then the real laughter starts.  By the end, it ends up being a really funny movie.  This is a good movie to rent, but I would not spend the extra to buy this.  This has good dark humor, greg kinnear's and steve correll are both funny, and this is a great showing of a dysfunctional family, and a worst case scenario of whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.  worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Here's the movie the Motion Picture Academy overrated and nominated for best picture for 2006, much as it did with "Sideways" a 2004 flick about a pair of middle aged guys travleing through California's wine country a few years earlier. This one is about a dysfunctional family traveling in California too. Think there's a coincidental relationship between the academy nominating each for best picture? Maybe it has something to do with all the electors and voters living in California?<br /><br />As you probably know, this involves a typically dysfunctional family (highly Hollywoodized) that consists of an out of work dad (Greg Kinnear), standup mom that holds it all together (Toni Collette), pervert father that lives with them (Alan Arkin), loser brother that lost his boyfriend and job, tried to commit suicide, and now lives with them (Steve Carell, better known as the "40 Year Old Virgin"), bitter and alienated teenage son (Paul Dano) and the star, Little Miss Sunshine herself, 12-year-old Olive (Abagail Breslin) who wins a local contest and competes for the national title of the named character.<br /><br />The action revolves around the family taking its trip from New Mexico to the pagaent near Los Angeles and the various underlying stories that go on while that's in progress. Every character is a cliche, of course, with the mother being the typical savior that holds it all together. The film is variably hilarious, stupid, insightful, energetic, arousing, perverted and sentimental. You will laugh a lot at and with these characters during their trip to, and arrival at, the Little Miss Sunshine pagaent, where a lot of nonsense breaks out that would only occur in a movie or a Three Stooges routine.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll wonder why the Motion Picture Academy thought this was one of the five best movies of 2006. Its temperament reminds me a bit of "In America", a movie from 2002 starring a pair of real life sisters that lit up the screen with transcendent performances that bordered on magic. That film didn't have the outright humor of "Little Miss Sunshine" but it was, from my perspective, a far better production and a much better story.<br /><br />This one will leave you feeling good, if that's your goal, and it will entertain you throughout, but it definitely should not have been considered an Oscar contender.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>A dysfunctional family take a road trip to enter their little girl in a pre-pubescent beauty pageant and wackiness ensues!

A bold and important statement in this film! Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This is not a great film, but is definitely worth the time for some enjoyable eccentric behavior from a brilliant cast. Ms. Breslin's and Mr. Arkin's Oscar noms speak for themselves, but Kinnear, Carrell, Paul Dano and, especially, Toni Collette are so in touch with their material that Ms. Breslin's only task is to be reactionary, which she does beautifully and naturally. I HATE bad kid-actors and she won me over. There's fire and wisdom behind those beautiful, spectacled eyes, and when she lets loose at the end, you simply HAVE to cheer. I'm glad it won the Ensemble Cast award at SAG, though I doubt it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, if only because the directors weren't nominated. The clever screenplay of Michael Arndt may be its only chance of a win. Dysfunctional families have inundated our films lately, but I can't think of one recently that had me believing that such families could be as entertaining. Indeed, the plot is outrageous, pitting one obstacle against another, but the ending is satisfying and appropriate. "Little Miss Sunshine" is a small, easy to watch film, and though some previous reviewers were offended by the foul language, I thought it was representational of the characters' state at the moment. Yes, people do talk like that a lot. Lighten up, folks... I had a good time, and laughed a lot. I also felt for the characters, something I can't always say. Due to its popularity, it almost screams for a sequel. I hope they leave it alone, and let it stand by itself. Further interventions into the lives of these characters might be overkill.  UPDATE: I love Eddie Murphy, but I'm glad Arkin won the Oscar. His foul-mouthed outrage is remembered more than the sweet moments he had with Ms. Breslin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Dwayne: [written on piece of paper showing it to Frank] Welcome to hell. "<br /><br />When we talk about dysfunctional families, I think of the really wacky or the every day family that lives next door to us. Rarely do I think of the funny as hell, loving family that does live next door. In fact I think it is rare to meet someone from a 'normal' family- just what is that, anyway?  Enter the family, the Hoovers. The family from New Mexico who welcomes Frank (Steve Carrell) home from the hospital where he was recovering from suicide. Dwayne, (Paul Dano) the elder son writes on a pad "Welcome to Hell:. He has taken a vow of silence and does not speak. Mom (Toni Collete) is trying to keep their family together and dad (Greg Kinnear) is a Tony Robbins wanna be.  The sixth member of the family Alan Arkin, is granpa, a drug user asked to leave the local senior citizen housing group. And the young woman who brings them all together, Olive, Abigail Breslin.<br /><br />Olive has won the chance to enter a beauty/talent contest ',Little Miss Sunshine' and the family decides that everyone will travel to California in their family VW Minibus. Once in the car, this American family road comedy keeps us laughing. This group of actors has become a family that we care about, and they keep us laughing; starting with bus breakdown to a death and on to the beauty pageant which is one of the funniest laugh out loud scenes I have seen. I wanted to join this family of losers/winners.<br /><br />"Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' directorial debut was a huge hit at Sundance, and it's easy to see why. Though the script is full of predictable character and car artifices, it's never weighed down by them. Instead, the story feels genuine, anchored by heartfelt performances from Sunshine's incredibly talented cast. The movie grows with their characters, the drama building and boiling as one disaster after the next affects each individual. With each life setback the family encounters, they stop flailing to fix their own lives and instead draw closer together, focusing more on Olive and her innocent little dream as it becomes clearer to each that her hopes of success begin to reflect their own need for something special in their lives" Josh Tyler<br /><br />Such an enjoyable film that I have recommended it to all of my friends. Abigail Breslin, Olive, somehow keeps this family all together and they revolve around her. We watch as the family grows and we approve.<br />Highly Recommended., prisrob 1/23/07<br /><br />.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I really don't want to talk about the plot of this movie, because it isn't all that complicated and watching it unfold is part of the movie's charm.  And, even more, I don't want to talk about the characters in this movie in much detail, although I am sure many others have.  I don't want to discuss the characters in detail because getting to know them individually and as one motley family is really the point of the whole exercise.<br /><br />The film has a terrific cast and each plays his or her role superbly.  Each makes a terrific contribution to the film, and given the special aspects of some of the characters, that is more of an achievement than you might at first expect.<br /><br />But how can I review this movie?  I think I describe what I took away from it (although you might take away very different things) and maybe offer you some suggestions of what to watch for as the story unfolds as you view the movie.  While the story is simple, it is exceedingly strange.  It might even disturb some to the point of turning it off.  Things are said that more crude than I remember ever being said in my family.  However, there are cruel things that are said in deep hurt that do ring true in their depth of pain if not in their specifics.<br /><br />What finally came from my exasperation with these characters is that they don't realize how much their own focus on what they need from outside of themselves to be happy is keeping them unhappy and keeps tripping them up.  Notice the difference in their individual happiness and joy as an extended family as they set aside these conditions and accept life for what it is offering at that moment.  One of them knows that all the way through the movie.  Notice her role in saving them even when they think it is the other way around.<br /><br />For those of you who avoid "R" rated movies, this has that rating because one member of the family stupidly uses drugs, there are some F-bombs and other profanities (but it doesn't swim in them), and there is a side issue with some porn magazines.  No, this isn't a movie to watch with young kids.  However, it ends up with some fairly strong values even in some very strange contexts.  It is also a group of characters and a van you will never ever forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>4.5, rounded up to 5.<br /><br />This is a dysfunctional family.<br /><br />Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker with, as far as we can see, about 10 students in the class he just finished. He's trying to swing a book deal, or turn his so-far one-man show into something spectacular. We are never told what he left behind to pursue his "dream", but that's really not important.<br /><br />Frank, the mother's brother, (Steve Carell) is the country's preeminent Proust scholar who recently tried to kill himself for a number of reasons, all entertainingly told over dinner. He's gay, as is the 2nd (according to him) most prominent Proust scholar.<br /><br />Kinnear's father, known only as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed heroin user who was kicked out of an assisted living home. We soon learn why - other than the heroin use - when giving advice to his grandson about having as much sex as he possibly can while he's young and it's still legal to have sex with teenage girls. There's a screw or two loose there.<br /><br />The son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a fanatical devotee of Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he joins the air force and flies a plane. He communicates through writing on a pad, and claims to hate everyone. He wears, at one point, a T-shirt that says "Jesus was Wrong". Hysterical.<br /><br />The daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorable young girl has fantasies of winning the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Unfortunately, she's only adorable - and adorable isn't beauty pageant material. Still, this is her dream, and her family supports her enough to throw themselves in their VW van and drive hundreds of miles to get her into the pageant.<br /><br />The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete) is the necessary straight character, and certainly the sanest of the bunch. Her presence holds everyone together.<br /><br />With a cast of characters like this, it's impossible for a fantastic voyage not to occur. And it does. From the van breaking down so that it can only be started by everyone getting out and pushing to an improbable hospital escape, the adventure is a lively one.<br /><br />The beauty pageant itself is extremely disturbing. I've never felt comfortable watching 8 year old girls preen about as adult women. To my sensibilities, it's the parent living vicariously through the daughter - most of the time, at least. I'm sure - like Olive - that some have dreams of their own. For those that don't, shame on the parent.<br /><br />Olive stands out, nearly literally, as a very sore thumb at the pageant. She does not have the makeup, the hair, the moves, or the skinny body to compete. That doesn't stop us from rooting for her. We have to, because she's easily the most endearing character in the film. We also feel tremendous pity for her, knowing that she just doesn't measure up to these other girls. Which, in itself, is sad. It's very likely that she more than measures up to them in terms of quality.<br /><br />Olive's dance presentation, the final of the evening, is hysterical. She begins to dance - a dance her grandfather taught her - and from the very first move, the audience is in hysterics. Throughout her entire performance, most couldn't stop laughing. Her family joined her on stage toward the end, which wasn't terribly believable, but served to demonstrate their intense loyalty to Olive and her dreams.<br /><br />The movie is centered on dreams. Richard dreams of becoming a motivational speaker; Dwayne dreams of becoming a pilot; Olive dreams of winning beauty pageants; Frank dreams of regaining his status as the preeminent Proust scholar; and Sheryl dreams of normalcy.<br /><br />Part of the enjoyment - aside from the hilarity - is watching the development of these dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris<br />Starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, Paul Dano, Toni Collette and Abigail Breslin<br />102 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />Portuguese: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for four Oscars, with Alan Arkin winning for best supporting actor and Michael Arndt taking home the award for best original screenplay.

The story is mainly driven by dialogue with the exception of a couple of situations.<br /><br />The conclusion shows what happens when they finally arrive in California for the pageant.<br /><br />It's R-rated for language, drug references and references to sex. Perhaps the most offensive thing was seeing how little girls are presented as women in the pageant. It's just a grotesque world.<br /><br />It's not easy to make me laugh and I am typically wary of any movie involving Carell, but this style of humor worked for me. Nobody put in a bad performance and I did laugh out loud a couple of times. I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />The presentation was excellent for such a low budget movie. Picture quality was good throughout and deserves a 4.5/5. Audio did the job and dialogue was clear (4/5).<br /><br />I would recommend this intelligent comedy to anyone who doesn't need to be bullied into laughter with slapstick.<br /><br />This is the type of story that has plenty of replay value as it will be fun to revisit these people and spend a while in their dysfunctional lives. For those wondering whether it's worth upgrading to the Blu-ray, I heartily recommend this presentation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>Let me start by saying 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, yet delightful gem.

Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart. Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous.

This is a movie that takes its good time in getting to the feel-good part, but does so with such a compellingly dysfunctional family of characters that you'll feel enriched for staying on board to the end.<br />The stalls are set out from the get go, when we meet each of the principal characters of the family, as different as could be.  When the young daughter has a chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant (scary that such events exist), they all up and leave en masse in the yellow VW minivan for a memorable road trip.  The worldly and outspoken grandpa, the suicidal brother, the relatively normal mother trying to keep the family on track, the father obsessed with success but unable to grasp it himself, the rebelling teenager in a vow of silence.. all are thrown into close proximity for the journey to California.  Add a seriously temperamental VW minibus, and the stage is set for some soul searching, reality checks, pathos and humor.<br />As a comedy, this is certainly no exercise in hilarity or slapstick.... but it will leave you smiling, and it WILL leave you talking about it after the DVD is back in the case.. what better compliment could there be.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>The setup is pretty simple.  A dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so a little girl can achieve her dream of being in a beauty pageant.  Yet the beauty pageant in question is merely a catalyst for a family to realize its own shortcomings and unite and agreee on...something.<br /><br />Greg Kinear is a father who is banking on the success of a 12 step self help program while his wife played by Toni Collette is putting up with the uncertainty of their future along with the suicide attempt by her brother played by Steve Carell. His character is a college professor who attempts suicide because of unrequited love from a fellow colleague. Paul Dano is the son who aspires to be an air force pilot whilst looking up to Nietsche and outright proclaiming his hatred for his family.  Alan Arkin is a profanity spewing and drug taking grandfather.  Somewhere in the midst of this, Olive, the young dauther, seems oblivious to the dysfuntion going on and just wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Paegant.<br /><br />The road trip that ensues plays on their dysfunction, with witty exchanges between the talented performers.  The chemistry between Paul Dano and Steve Carrel is most affecting, despite the fact that Paul Dano doesn't talk for a good 2/3 of the film.<br /><br />All of the characters have aspirations they can't quite achieve - like a desire overeaching their actual potential.  This is perhaps the most original concept the film has to offer.  In the end, it's ultimately about failure which is a sad concept for a comedy to address.  That the film is so funny and makes you feel so good at the end is an amazing feat.  The finale is a little over the top for my tastes, but there is something so human and honest about these characters that you can't help but want to jump in and help get their VW van on the road again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>I gave this movie four stars because I found it extremely entertaining.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys dark comedy and is not easily offended.  There are a couple of parts of the movie that are pretty sick, even obscene.  Just watch, and you will know what I mean.  Abigail Breslin was really outstanding as the contest entrant.  Her energetic personality was a perfect contrast to the stark despair that existed in many of the other characters.  Steve Carell was great (as usual).  The movie's theme is best summarized in a Proust quote that Carell delivers in a very poignant moment towards the end of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>...rather how often you pick yourself up.

Olive is a little girl about 9 years old who is positive about winning this title, even though her chances are slim.  The family bands together to overcome their own problems and help her.  It is a very rewarding and funny story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" has a brilliant cast and contains moments of pure genius. The story follows the exploits of a troubled suburban family as they drive across the country to enter their seven year old daughter in the "Little Miss Sunshine" pageant. I am a big fan of both Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell, but in this case I think Carell did the better job as a formerly suicidal professor (and America's number one Proust expert). My favorite scenes in the film were of the interactions between Carell and Paul Dano as a angst-ridden teenager who has taken a vow of silence related to his desire to become an Air Force pilot (you'll have to watch the film for all the confusing details.) Dano and Carell manage to be both genuinely disturbed and genuinely touching, especially late in the movie.<br /><br />The plot is more than a bit contrived and formulaic, although the last ten minutes were rather unpredictable. I found the film to get off to a very slow start, and the pace to be somewhat plodding throughout, although the last half hour is more captivating than the first hour. Although this is a movie about a family, this is not a family film, and the R rating is there for several reasons, not the least of which are very mature themes, and excessively foul language, especially from Alan Arkin. I was extremely pleased, though, that the film skewered the unfortunate scourge of sub-teen beauty pageants: I was genuinely creeped out by the young contestants (and their families.) The conclusion of the pageant was shocking and, while amusing, made a serious comment on contemporary mores.<br /><br />The cast is talented, and the critiques of modern society, particularly the exposure of the false values of the winner and loser, are frequently on the money if you look past the superficial veneer of the movie as strictly a comedy. Despite the obvious talent that went into the movie, I was less enthusiastic than I expected, given my respect for the cast members: the pacing was often slow (particularly at the outset), and the script was full of gratuitous exchanges seemingly placed simply for shock value and a cheap laugh (e.g. Arkin's diatribe to Dano about virility) that went far beyond what was necessary to establish the lack of functional cohesiveness as a family unit. There are moments of unadulterated brilliance in the film, but it is by no means deserving of the highly effusive praise from such luminous sources as "Newsweek" and "USA Today."</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>LMS is a very "interesting" movie--not necessarily "good" in the conventional sense but interesting.  It's more subtle and sophisticated than people seem to give it credit for.  It's funny but I wouldn't call it a comedy; it's has plenty of angst and failure but I wouldn't call it a tragedy (or melodrama, or whatever).<br /><br />Each character is dysfunctional but not to such a degree as to be unbelievable (a la "Running with Scissors").  They each have their own personal conflict to overcome but they are each defeated by it (except the little girl).  Even though the characters all fail, they do still emerge stronger and more unified as a family because of it.  (It just occurred to me--one of the characters is always reading Nietzsche, who popularized the quote "that which does not kill me makes me stronger.")<br /><br />LMS is not a "comedy" (although often funny--ESPECIALLY the ending); it's not a National Lampoon roadtrip movie; it's not "glorifying dysfunction" (as another reviewer posted); it's not a social commentary about the exploitive and pseudo-sexual industry of child beauty pageants.  IMHO it's much more existential than that.<br /><br />This, combined with a great cast makes for a very interesting movie.  People who pay money for explosions, slap-stick, big breasts, and car chases will hate this movie.  If you're not the unthinking drone that Hollywood assumes most (all) of us to be, then LMS is defiantly worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Little Olive, age 6, wants to be a beauty queen. Yeah, but daddy wants to be a motivational speaker and he can't. Big brother wants to be a pilot and he can't. Uncle wants to be an academic success and he can't. Grandpa wants to be something - anything - and he can't. That leaves little Olive, supporting the whole weight of their failure on her small and sloping shoulders, so off they go to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.<br /><br />Off in an ancient VW minibus, with mechanical condition that fully matches their personal condition - things happening that shouldn't, not happening that should, and utter collapse certain even if the moment of that collapse isn't so easy to predict. And so they arrive at the pageant, a bizarre world in itself. It's filled with six year old beauty queens in tiny flat bikinis, elaborate makeup and big hair, trying to be the seductresses that their mothers never were. And Olive, with her six year old babyfat and gawky walk, wondering why she doesn't have the taut tummy that the others do (and shouldn't).<br /><br />Then it all comes down to the final talent competition, the one that Olive has been practicing for months and the crowning moment of the family's out-to-lunchness. How could mommy and daddy NOT have known what kind of routine she was developing with grandpa? No matter, they're all a family.<br /><br />If you enjoy the kind of entertainment that leaves you happy that you're not them, you'll love it. Although the movie had its moments, I found it a bit creepy that anyone might be them.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>When a beauty contest winner is forced to abdicate her position, Olive (Breslin) is elevated to the top spot.  Now she will compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  Various situations force her entire family to come along with her.  Richard (Kinnear), the dad, is a motivational speaker who is a few steps away from making it big.  Sheryl (Collette), the mom, is the glue that is holding the family together.  Dwayne (Dano) the teenage son, has taken a vow of silence and likes to read Nietzsche.  Uncle Frank (Carrell), is living with them after recently attemting suicide.  Grandpa (Arkin) is a heroin addict and lives an edgy life.  The group sets off on a trip that will test all of them.<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine" is a genuinely funny and sweet movie.  All the actors give their characters real life.  This could very well be the most dysfunctional family around, and first time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris succeed in making them real.  At times funny and sad, their trip to the pageant is a memorable one that will have audiences talking well after the film is finished.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>It's been a while since I have written a review on this website, so I'll start off a new string of them with the best film that I've seen in a long time. "Little Miss Sunshine" is one of the most well-written, engrossing, hilarious, and touching films that I have seen in a very long time. By now, you all know the basic plot of the film: a highly dysfunctional family goes on a road trip in order to get to a beauty pageant that Olive, the youngest of the clan, has been nomintated to compete in. The first half of the film focuses on everything that happens on the way to that beauty pageant, and it is great! The performances were ALL top notch, especially the ones from Abigail Breslin as Olive, Steve Carrel as Uncle Frank, and Alan Arkin as Grandpa. Everyone else was just as great! The direction and the script were all top-notch. All in all, this film was perfect. It takes all sorts of "family film" cliches, turns them upside down, and into one of the best satires in recent memory.<br /><br />The directors themselves have stated that this was a film "not about family values, but the value of family", and this couldn't be farther from the truth. Those looking for a tidy, clean family film should probably steer clear from this one. It's R rating is there for a reason, mainly because of the language, brief drug content, and a few glimpses of pornography. It's definitely not for young children, but everyone else will be in for a treat!<br /><br />This film is highly recommended! Another great thing about this film is that it makes you appreciate your family!<br /><br />Go see it! You will not be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>As the movie begins a clear dislike of everyone but the little girl develops, but then it starts to warm up.  One after another each family member shows a humanity, focusing on Olive.  She realizes that she is no beauty, but she has convinced herself, and everyone else, that she has the skills needed for winning the Little Miss Sunshine contest.  With one mishap after another each member of the family develops a depth and snese of caring that helps them coalesce into a full and happy family.<br /><br />Dysfunctional?  Not a bit.  The family functions very well, as much as any other family, even with initial starts and stops, with each one caring for the other, which is no more apparent than at the end of the movie.  The movie is certainly not predictable, although in hindsight, Olive's performance, being coached by her foul-mouthed coke-sniffing grandfather, could have been nothing else but the delightful shocker that it was.<br /><br />On another level, this movie helped to expose the promiscuity of the parents who send their little girls to beauty contests, parading them as adults.  This is just sick, and the movie makes this point very, very well.<br /><br />A different kind of family movie, and one that works on many levels.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>An interesting film that was not released on a large in theaters, little miss sunshine is a film that is likely to be seen big on the awards stages in the next few months.  Its path will be similar to that of the film "sideways" a couple of years ago.  An interesting view into a dysfunctional family that again proves that dysfunction can function if given the right ingredients.  Although the dysfunctional family has been played out on film many a time (eg. National lampoon Vacation series of film), this film took a little darker humor, not so overboard with outrageous stunts or even nudity. Yes, some aspect (bringing dead grandpa along) may be a bit off, at least they didn't do a weekend at bernies type script. They worked it in just the once (highway patrol stop), and they didn't do it till the end. I did think the ending was predictable (the routine produced by grandpa), but it was funny.  I would expect at least a few nominations at the golden globes and oscars, and hopefully it will take home a couple. Greg Kinnear does well, and Steve Carrell was great.  Check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>I never laughed anywhere here, but I did somewhat enjoy the film. Really, there's no comedy, to speak of. It's a real lowball indie. Grandpa is a junkie. Junior is depressed and doesn't speak. Momma and pappa have problems. Guess who is the only normal one? Um, the 10 year old girl of the title. She's bent on performing in a beauty pageant, despite sporting a gut like a mini Hulk Hogan. No real plot to speak of, so you are left to enjoy the individual performances. Again, the little girl is the most impressive of the bunch. Worth your time, but don't be taken by all the raves. It's just so-so.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>During the 2006 Awards Season there was no film that made an impact quite like `Little Miss Sunshine'.  You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.<br /><br />Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.<br /><br />Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.<br /><br />Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.<br /><br />Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.  It is also a true statement that some parts of this film fall flat.  Like I said; a mixed bag.  It's fun, but not great.  You will enjoy it, but if you walk into this expecting it to deliver on all the hype you may find yourself disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It contains good dark humour. It won't appeal to many people. Many scenes made me laugh and broke my heart at the same time. It's not suitable for children because of foul language, dirty jokes, and drug scenes.<br /><br />**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ THIS if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE.<br /><br />For example, in the scene where the grandpa died in the hospital. The lady in charge of the corpse yelled at Greg Kinnear (the father) when he wanted to pospone the burial. She did not want to listen to his explanation why. It brillantly portraited how cruelly sometimes people treated each other. It moved me.<br /><br />The next scene is hilarious when it showed the family trying to sneak the corpse into their car to continue  their trip to California.<br /><br />The most moving scene was when Abigail walked to her brother who was extremely depressed and sitting on the ground. She then sat down beside him, saying nothing, just leanning on him.<br /><br />In the last scene, the director cleverly took aim at child-beauty-pageant industry. My stomach hurt when I saw kids from<br />5-7 years old in heavy makeup did their catwalk. Adults were exploiting kids for their profit and pleasure!<br /><br />Abigail Breslin was the best actress here. She's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny. She's naturally beautiful without any makeup. Yes, her dance was meant for adults. But in my opinion, it's acceptable and funny. Why was it okay for adults to exploit kids but it's not okay for kids to dance like adults?<br /><br />No wonder it got 2 Oscars in 2007. One was given to Michael Arndt for original screenplay. The other was given to Alan Arkin for best supporting actor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Finally got around to watching Little Miss Sunshine, and it was just as good as everyone said it was. The film tells the story of the Hoover family - success-obsessed dad Richard (Greg Kinnear), harried mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), wide-eyed (and completely precious) daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), suicidal Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell, in a BRILLIANT turn), a heroin-snorting grandpa (Alan Arkin), and (finally) iron-pumping older brother Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy. Due to a fluke, little Olive is invited to participate in the hotly contested "Little Miss Sunshine" pageant in California. The family loads into their dated VW van to make the several hundred mile trek to get Olive to the competition on time.<br /><br />While there is certainly enough plot to go around, this is primarily a character piece. We see Richard realize that his preoccupation with being a "winner" is awfully detrimental and none too forgiving. We watch as Frank copes with being dumped by his lover and surpassed by his professional colleagues. We see Dwayne's dream to be a pilot threatened. And through all of the family's losses, we watch them prop each other up and realize that losing isn't really all that bad, as long as you have some good company.<br /><br />EVERYONE in the cast brought their A-game, but the two standouts for me were Breslin and Carrell. Breslin was absolutely adorable as little Olive, who has no reason to believe she can't win the pageant. And she is so trusting and vulnerable that I was totally hooked. Carrell as the jilted gay academic proves once again that he is a veritable Proteus. The guy has range. His melancholy recovery from depression is something to see - smart, likable, witty, in other words, someone we really want to keep around. As odd as it sounds, Frank is, in many ways, the straight man of the piece. (Ha!)<br /><br />At any rate, you will love this movie. I did, and I strongly encourage you to check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>After a failed suicide attempt, Frank finds himself living with his sister's family.  His sister, Sheryl, seems to be the only sane member of this dysfunctional family.  Well, maybe I'll include Olive, the family's youngest.<br /><br />Sheryl's husband is a motivational speaker, who is trying to get his book published.  Sheryl's oldest, Dwayne, is a determined teenager who has vowed to silence until he enlists in the Air Force.  Living with the family is Sheryl's father-in-law, who has been evicted from a retirement community for doing drugs.  He coaches Olive on her competition.<br /><br />The movies focuses on slightly plump Olive and the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.  This all starts when Olive gets a call that the regional winner has stepped down.  By default as the runner-up, Olive gets to compete in this envious competition.  In response, the entire family drops their plans, band together in a VW bus and travel through a few states for the pageant.<br /><br />One may think that there's nothing exciting that occurs during road trips.  Not with this family, they are THE poster family of dysfunctionality.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you like family dynamics no matter how chaotic they can be, then you'll enjoy *Little Miss Sunshine*.  My favorite part was when Dwayne has a meltdown, forces the family to pull off the road and storms off in a field.  Everyone in the family tries to coax him back but with no success.  However, as a last resort, Olive comes to her brother and just simply rests her head on his shoulder.  There's something special about that bond because he comes back.<br /><br />The pageant is a little freaky especially if you have never seen the kind that Jon Benet competed in.  Get ready to be shocked.<br /><br />Anyways, no matter how chaotic this family is, they still manages to remain a close one especially in support of Olive's competition.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine was an excellent film, and I recommend it. The story is about a family of misfits who band together to take a quixotic journey in a yellow VW bus with no clutch, and a horn that is stuck in the honk position. On this journey they learn the importance of love, and family. That would be such a clich&eacute;, were it not so artfully executed. One of the scenes revolves around color blindness, and that seems an apt metaphor for the blind spots otherwise intelligent people can have when it comes to seeing their own needs to love and be loved.<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Frank Ginsberg, who is the nation's foremost Proust scholar. He has just attempted suicide because his rival, Larry Sugarman, the #2 Proust scholar, has stolen the young male graduate student he was in love with, he was fired from his teaching position, and Sugarman has just published a bestseller on Proust, and their ad campaign is calling Sugarman THE foremost Proust scholar. At the time this was made, Carell was not a hot commodity. Robin Williams or Bill Murray were considered for the part, but they couldn't afford them. The producers complained that Carell did not have enough star power to energize the film--but in the short year since, he starred in a hit movie, The 40-Year Old Virgin, as well as starring in a hit comedy series, The Office, for which he received an Emmy. He also appeared in Will Ferrell's Anchorman, but the character he played--a mentally challenged weatherman--gave no indication of the range he would display in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />The perfect storm of success changed their minds, and Carell was called upon to promote the film. In fact, I just watched a little promotional clip on Amazon where he is actually interviewing himself, and both Carells do an excellent, though tongues firmly in cheeks, job of it. He is very adept at playing a gay intellectual, and shines particularly in his interactions with Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear), Grampa Hoover (Alan Arkin), Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), and Dwayne (Paul Dano).<br /><br />Greg Kinnear plays a wannabe Tony Robbins, with a 9-Step program. He is cast well here. His boyish good looks serve him well, as they did in As Good As It Gets, but as they worked against him in Auto Focus, where he failed to play a convincing Bob Crane due to acute cuteness. Kinnear looks to be as shallow as Pat Sajak, but then when things don't go his way, he proves to be a veritable Alex Trebek, as he conveys a much more complex individual. He spouts clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, about the difference between winners and losers, and how he won't give up, but inside, he is crumbling. He is easily the least sympathetic character, just by his annoying perkiness, and that is quite an achievement when you are running against an angst ridden teenage nihilist who has taken a vow of silence, a pretentious homosexual suicidally depressed Proust scholar, and a foul mouthed dirty old man, who was kicked out of the retirement home for snorting heroin. However, by the end of the movie, even Richard is a candidate for redemption. His best line might have been spoken as they drove on with an incessantly honking horn and a corpse in the trunk, still desperately trying to get young Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant: "Oh my God, I'm getting pulled over. Everyone, just... pretend to be normal."<br /><br />Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor, and though he only appears in the first half, his presence is felt throughout, and he thoroughly deserves his Oscar for this performance. He is foul mouthed, lascivious, and in our first encounter, he is shown snorting heroin (actually it was crushed up vitamin B12 tablets). He would seem to be an unlikely target of sympathy, but beneath that rough exterior beats a heart of gold.<br /><br />The earliest movie review I remember reading was for a film called Popi which starred Arkin. In it he plays Abraham, a Puerto Rican single father in Brooklyn who wants a better life for his two boys, so he contrives to pass them off as Cuban refugees. This was in 1969, long before the Elian Gonzales incident. "Better to drown in the ocean than in the sewer" was the tagline. What I remember from the film review was that they accused the director of "doing the kids dirt" by trying to manipulate the audience with their cuteness. I knew exactly what he meant, because there were these long montage scenes set to music of the kids cavorting and frolicking through a graveyard, acting so cute you wanted to puke.<br /><br />The directors of Little Miss Sunshine do not fall into this trap. Abigail Breslin plays a young beauty contestant hopeful. She is the Little Miss Sunshine of the title, but though you might think it is meant to be ironic and sarcastic, she is a hopeful ray of sunshine, without ever going too far into the excessive cuteness mode. For being in such a dysfunctional family, she is remarkably well adjusted, and though na?ve about many things, she seems to have an emotional wisdom beyond her years.<br /><br />Abigail wore a fat suit, and is in marked contrast to the actual child beauty pageant contestants tapped to play themselves, essentially, in the film. They used their actual costumes and routines, exactly as they would in competition. She wears glasses, and good use some dental work. But you keep hoping that her routine will hit a grand slam, but that possibility is remote considering her act was choregraphed by her recently deceased Grampa (Alan Arkin, in an Oscar winning supporting role). When you hear the music he chose, Rick James' Super Freak, you know her chances of an upset victory are nil.<br /><br />Also adept at avoiding the too-cute trap was Paul Dano as Dwayne, the teenager from a previous marriage who follows the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche, has taken a vow of silence, dreams of being a jet pilot, and hates everyone, as he writes in a notepad. When Frank asks if his hatred includes his family, he underlines Everyone, for emphasis. He reluctantly agrees to go on the journey, when Sheryl, his mother, says if he does, she will pay for his flight school. He writes, OK, but I. won't. have. any. fun. This whole shtick of writing in the pad could get annoying, but actually is handled very well, as a great running gag. Key moments of his character's transformation or turns of plot are conveyed very skillfully with this device. His acting is none too shabby, either. At first he wears a t-shirt with the face of Big Brother, from George Orwell's 1984. Later his t-shirt bears the slogan: Jesus Was Wrong. Somewhere along the journey he goes through a subtle metamorphosis, and emerges as empathetic and sympathetic, while still avoiding the too-cute trap.<br /><br />Toni Collette plays Sheryl, the wife of Richard, daughter-in-law of Grampa, the sister of Frank, the mother of Olive, and the mother from a previous marriage to Dwayne. It was a very strong ensemble cast, and she was the glue that held the dysfunctional family together.<br /><br />The movie was a hit at Sundance, where it was picked up for about ten million dollars. It took a long time to make, about 5 years, due to difficulties getting financing. It was the proverbial "Little Movie That Could." The struggle to get this movie made would seem to parallel the struggle that Richard goes through to get his self help 9-step program book published. But in the movie's case, there was a much better outcome.<br /><br />Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris made The Smashing Pumpkins video for the song, 1979. In a scene in a convenience store, uncle Frank's purchase is $19.79.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film, I was mightily disapointed. It had been pushed as a comedy, so I expected to, you know, laugh. I didn't. Well, not until the pagent scene. The look on Greg Kinnear's face was priceless, and pretty well summed-up my view of such pagents.<br /><br />But I could tell there was something good in this movie, so about a month later I watched it again, and was much happier. The performances by the entire cast were wonderful, particularly Alan Arkin. I was also pleased by the directing. Dayton and Farris have come a long way since their days of music videos (of course, some of the ones they made were for the Smashing Pumpkins, my favorite band of all-time).<br /><br />I still find the film a bit twee at times. The characters are all Quirky in that indie film way. Which at least is better than being QUIRKY!, though not as good as simply being interesting.<br /><br />Still, though, at this point my only real complaint about the movie was that they missed a chance for a great inside joke. For those of you who are movie fans, imagine the fun in them driving into Scotsdale and someone saying to Greg Kinnear's character, "Isn't this where Bob Crane died?"</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Olive is a little girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant.  Her family consists of a nerotic father, a gay uncle, a foul-mouthed grandfather, and a brother who has taken a vow of silence.  They pile into a VW van which has as many quirks as the family, and head off for California so that Olive can live out her dream.  There are over-the-top moments, some of which are funny and some of which are merely tasteless.  The most heartwarming moment in the film occurs when the family has a rare show of solidarity when they serve as back-up dancers for Olive, who is doing a dance number which was unfortunately choreographed by her grandfather.  Olive is a refreshing contrast to the Jon Benet Ramsey look-alikes she is competing against, but this movie was still a bit over-the-top for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>a road movie unlike the cheap thrills of RV or other junk like that..this movie aims higher then cheap laughs or happy feelings..there's a depth to it that earns every laugh you get and there are quite a few..a brilliant cast, led by Alan Arkin, the codgy old grandfather, Steve Carrel, the suicidal brother of Toni Collete, a mother trying to keep the family running, and frayed from it. The laughs do not start until after the family is on the road and headed to Cali for the lil Miss Sunshine contest, where Olive aspires to be a beauty queen. There's something wonderfully uplifting and heartwarming about this movie but not in your typical Hollywood bloated way, and laughs are real belly jumpers not those little chuckl laughs. Love it! Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the surprise indie hit that charmed critics and probably took DREAMGIRLS place in the Best Picture nominations this year.  Is this movie Oscar worthy?  That's hard to say..it certainly is entertaining and original, with a screenplay that examines a dysfunctional family in a kindly light.<br /><br />The story focuses around little Olive, a ten year old who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  Coached by her wily grandfather, Olive wants to win so badly.  Her father is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program to winning is his ticket for the future, even though no one is really interested in buying it.  Mama is a typical supportive mother whose family means everything to her.  Her brother has recently attempted suicide due to the loss of his male lover and his job.  She feels responsible for getting him back into life.  Her son is a strange one indeed.  He has been in self-imposed silence for nine months to prepare him for a career as an airplane pilot.  Hubby's dad is a grizzly, foul mouthed, heroin addicted octogenarian whose abrasive exterior shadows his true sensitivity.<br /><br />The movie follows their journey to the pageant with some unexpected obstacles.  The cast is uniformly excellent:  Greg Kinnear is superb as the driven dad; Toni Collette is fine as the mom; Alan Arkin in his nominated supporting role provides a nice foundation; Paul Dano is good as the strange son whose future is dashed when a small technicality arises; Steve Carell is wonderful as the suicidal brother; and cute little Abigail Breslin is charming in her supporting actress-nominated role.  (While it's questionable that either she or Arkin are strong contenders for Oscars?).<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a good little film and has a lot to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I thought the acting and the characterization were wonderful. The movie overall was not wonderful, a C+ at best. It had a few funny moments. But it tried too hard to be a Seinfeld episode meets Whalerider meets Terms of Endearment.<br /><br />Also recommended: IN HER SHOES, WHALERIDER, NURSE BETTY, DEAR GOD, or AS GOOD AS IT GETS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>The actors were fantastic. They completely committed to these roles. And the cinematography was gorgeous: The yellow of the VW Bus mingled with the bright-blue sky was beautiful. And there were several genuinely funny moments: the sickly honk of the broken VW horn had me all a-giggle:) And I would not dream of quibbling with the dark-notes (Grandfather is a heroin addict, the father is a failed motivational speaker, uncle is a suicidal primadona, and the son is a psuedo-intellectual adolescent who refuses to speak and pretends to read Nietzsche). That's fine.<br /><br />I have a feeling that the "disappointed" reviews that you find here are a result of the manner in which the film was promoted: as a "comedy." I think that label is fairly deceptive. I would say that this film defies genre (which is always the hallmark of a truly innovative film). For instance, I think Boyle's Trainspotting and Kelly's Donnie Darko are hysterical masterpieces, but I surely wouldn't call them comedies. Similarly, I would be hard-pressed to label this "road-trip" film a "comedy."<br /><br />The work is well-worth the watch JUST TO SEE THE DANCE COMPETITION (no spoilers, but it is the best part of the film!) Just do not go into the piece expecting a laugh-riot . . . it is pretty subtle but thoughtful.<br /><br />The film team admits to having great difficulty in finding a suitable conclusion to the work. While this contributes to your anxiety as a viewer, you should be aware that there are other endings included. Watch these alternate endings . . . one is superior to the actual conclusion . . . but I'll let you decide which:)<br /><br />A good film, it just doesn't live up to the hype that the media and the masses constructed.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>and being a winner of a film based on so many potentially disastrous bits of black comedy works exceedingly well!  As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE  starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed, at times just having fun!<br /><br />Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque, NM, a family comprised of a grandfather (Alan Arkin) whose 'elderly status' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom; a father (Greg Kinnear, who just gets better and better) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure; a mother (the extraordinary Toni Collette) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group; the mother's brother (Steve Carell), a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt; a space-cadet teenage son (Paul Dano) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents; and last, but most important, a chubby little sister Olive (Abigail Breslin) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent show for little girls in Southern California.<br /><br />The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine.  Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there.  Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve. The film accomplishes what comedy sets as a goal: it entertains us while allowing us to take a second look at our own foibles, and that makes for a fun and healthy outing.  Highly recommended.

You have a family that has a homosexual suicidal uncle, a leecherous drug taking grandfather, the antisocial son who has taken a vow of silence, the step dad who is the world's worst motivational speaker, the little girl who wants to be a beauty queen, and the mother who tries to hold this dysfunctional mess together.  The family wants to take the daughter Olive from New Mexico to California to compete in the Little Miss Sinshine pageant.  Along the way the each deal with personal problems, and a whole lot of troubles with the old bus.  Despite everything that goes wrong, they are determined to get to the pageant in time for her to compete.  This is a fun film that takes a little while for you to get warmed up to.  I compare it to Napoleon Dynamite, another off beat film that not everyone gets.  This is a film worth seeing in the theater, and I hope hollywood makes more of these types of films with great actors rather than 200 million dollar dudes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I saw this with a group of friends who didn't know much about the film. After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, "Is this suppose to be a comedy?" That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.<br /><br />The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal BS was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.<br /><br />After watching this I thought it was very funny and thought-provoking film. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are totally believable and utterly great as the struggling couple, trying their best to keep themselves going for the sake of their determined daughter. Abigail Breslin is adorable and perfect in the role of Olive, and does all the right things to make us really love her as if she were our own sister or daughter. Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin deliver subtle yet wonderful performances as well, though I wish Arkin had more screen time (this was the film's only lacking point). Paul Dano was absolutely spot-on with his portrayal of Duane; his "leave me here scene" had me feeling so empathetic it was almost too real and too close to home (a sign of pure brilliance in his performance, the script and direction).<br /><br />The whole film feels like something snatched right out of the most bizarre area of reality, good visuals, lovable characters, and a script that never fails to be entertaining. "Little Miss Sunshine" is one of the most enjoyable comedy films I have seen this past movie year.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Road movies are a particular weakness for me, and this out-of-left-field 2006 movie is no exception. It's a charmer written by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt about a dysfunctional family that you end up liking in spite of how they often act. Co-directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.<br /><br />The plot revolves around seven-year old Olive, who finds out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach, California in two days. Her father Richard is a motivational speaker who wants the world to think he is the next Tony Robbins. Her grandfather has been thrown out of his retirement home for shouting expletives and snorting heroin. Her brother Dwayne reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted for flight training into the Air Force Academy. Her Uncle Frank, a gay academic expert at Proust, has just been released from a hospital after trying to commit suicide over his lover's abandonment. Her no-nonsense mother Sheryl tries to hold the family together through sheer will but often finds herself lost under the strained circumstances.<br /><br />Eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances. Reunited after playing a divorcing couple in 2001's "Dinner with Friends", Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette show their expertise in portraying a marriage in trouble. With a wariness corrupting his usual preppy veneer, Kinnear brings out the nasty edge of a resentful man unable to fulfill his ambitions. Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism. As Frank, Steve Carell shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited. Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth-like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead-eyed as Dwayne.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments. There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor; Beth Grant as a snippy, bouffant-headed pageant official; and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from "24") showing her trademark perturbed look as a contest assistant. There are some contrived moments, for example, the chance encounter between Frank and his lover in the convenience store or the free-wheeling freeway exit contortions, when reality is sacrificed for dramatic effect. On the whole, however, this idiosyncratic road movie is well worth the ride share.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This was a cute film, that really flys because of some wonderful performances.  The story is essentially about a plucky little girl, whose belief in herself and inner spirit makes members of her family realize things about life and what's ultimately important.  The acting is top notch in this, with Arkin winning an Academy Award for his great preformance, but it's the little girl that steals the show with her eyes that convey so much in their innocent gaze.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" is a spectacular movie about the hilarious but dysfunctional Hooper family. The parents, Richard and Sheryl (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette), constantly bicker about Richard's futile efforts to become a self-help guru. Sheryl's teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) refuses to speak to anyone due to the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Frank (Steve Carell) is Sheryl's brother who recently attempted suicide, and Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is basically a dirty old man. The whole crazy family comes together when it's time for seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, and everyone piles into a clunky old VW van for the long weekend trip. Despite several bumps in the road, including the untimely death of one of their own, the Hoopers remain focused on their goal of getting Olive to the pageant on time. Unfortunately for Olive, she really isn't pageant material...in other words, she's normal. Things at the pageant don't exactly go as planned, but all of the Hoopers come out as "winners" in the end (except for poor Grandpa).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this fun, quirky little movie. The cast is excellent, but I was especially impressed with Arkin, whose foul-mouthed comments steal the show; Carell, who proves that he can handle a serious role; and the adorable Breslin, who is a delight to watch. I thought the ending of the film was a little abrupt (apparently there are a bunch of alternate endings included on the DVD, but I didn't see them). Other than that, though, this is a great movie about the family ties that bind: definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>A fine cast helped garner the critical acclaim that the feel good comedic drama, "Little Miss Sunshine" richly deserved.  A dysfunctional family headed by unsuccessful motivational speaker Richard Hoover played by Greg Kinnear and his wife Sheryl played by Toni Collette embark on a 800 mile journey in a VW bus to a childrens beauty contest their daughter Olive played by the irresistable Abigail Breslin is a late entrant.  Olive had been choreographed and nurtured by her vulgar, heroin snorting grandfather played by Oscar winning Alan Arkin.  Also along for the ride were her gay and suicidal Proust professor uncle played nicely by Steve Carrell and brother Dwayne who'd taken a vow of silence played by Paul Dano.<br /><br />The Hoovers encounter a staggering array of obstacles that are capable of derailing the plans for their odyssey.  Family members become confronted with the decimation of their own personal aspirations during the trip.  They nonetheless pull together to assure that young Olive is able to fufill her destiny, the ability to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />Directors Faris and Dayton brilliantly capture the inane but heartfelt interactions between family members as the acting ensemble portray a discordant group that rally together in a display of solidarity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Just like 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' before it, 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, comedy masterpiece about a dysfunctional family and their quests for love and greatness.  The father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who echoes Ricky Bobby's dad in 'Talledega Nights'.  ("If you're not a winner, then you're a loser.")  He is an angry and frustrated patriarch who has difficulty living up to his own advice.  He's overbearing even with his understanding, loving wife (Toni Collette of 'Sixth Sense' fame), and his family shows that not only success, but love is missing in the family equation.<br /><br />The grandfather (Adam Arkin) is a foul-mouthed heroin addict who, unlike his son, shoots straight from the hip.  His teenage son, Duane, is a goth silent type who only communicates with a notepad.  His brother, and their uncle, is gay and has just attempted suicide before living with the family, interestingly enough sharing Duane's bedroom where they can have heart-to-heart talks.  The daughter (Abigail Breslin) is sweet, perceptive, and charming.  She's an arm for the family ego, so she is a candidate for "Little Miss Sunshine,"  a nauseatingly glamorous child beauty contest taking place in California.<br /><br />Many mishaps come along the way as the whole family goes from Arizona to the Redondo Beach contest in an aging Volkswagon van.  The grandfather has a lot to say on the journey, including a shaking piece of wisdom for his granddaughter the night before the contest.  Having the pre-contest jitters, she hears her grandfather say, "A real loser is someone who is so afraid of losing, they're afraid to try."  The uncle also has much wisdom, including some advice to Duane about suffering that he seems to need and hear for himself in the same meeting.  With the admonition that our society has a low tolerance for failure, and the wit and laughter to set us all straight, 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains a sage and funny family satire.  (It is rated 'R,' so the laughs may be only for those family members at your discretion--mainly for a lot of profanity.)</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is one of the funniest family comedies I've seen in awhile. It's a story about a typical suburban family focuses on a little girl who dreams of success in beauty pageants.  Olive, age 7, has nothing else really going for her besides her ambition.  She enters numerous contests with the dream of taking home the crown, even placing second in the Little Miss Sunshine competition.  Her mother, played by Toni Collette is the complete opposite of a stage mom.  She is encouraging to the point of being nauseous--even when the audience knows her daughter doesn't stand a chance.  Olive's father, Greg Kinnear, instead usurps the role of stage mom letting Olive know that if she even dares to eat a bowl of ice cream she might wind up fat. The cast of Little Miss Sunshine is rounded out by Steve Carell at his humorous peak as the sarcastic, suicidal gay uncle, Alan Arkin as the porn-obsessed grandfather who gives Olive hope, and Paul Dano as her introspective older brother who can't even be bothered to speak.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a movie for families--not in the traditional sense, but anyone who can understand that any of the National Lampoon's Vacations--and I mean the early ones with Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase--are family films will certainly get this one.  It's the family comedy in the way that they don't make them anymore.  Dysfunctional, sarcastic, hilarious.  If you go into it with an open mind, then I'm positive you will enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Michael Arndt claims to have been inspired by his own family's road trips to write "Little Miss Sunshine."  If that's true, the man needs a hug, stat.<br /><br />"LMS" takes a big old bellyflop into a family held together by the barest shreds of convention.  Seething rage and resentment lurks virtually everywhere, but is masked in suburban conformity.  That is, almost every family member lets their resentment show in subtle ways, but is too strait-laced to truly let go.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are marvelous as the unhappily wed parents, while Paul Dano dives into teen angst with relish.  Steve Carell unexpectedly dials it down ten notches as a jilted gay Proust scholar.  If you attended a dinner party with these folks, you'd be on your second bottle of pinot by the time the salad course was finished.<br /><br />The only two free spirits in the family are Grandpa (Alan Arkin) and Olive (Abigail Breslin).  Grandpa is freed from the strictures of conformity by his age and his drug habit.  Olive is just a wonderful young person, and fortunately the story more or less revolves around her.  Breslin is enchanting as this chubby contented soul bobbing along in this sea of misery.  Without her stellar performance, "LMS" would be another glum romp through unhappiness like "The Squid and the Whale."<br /><br />But fortunately, Olive lives.  The family decides to help Olive with her dream of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach.  So the family piles into the infamous yellow VW van and heads off.  Family road trips and Thanksgiving are Hollywood's two favorite excuses for getting families stressed out at each other, and "LMS" pulls no punches.  Fortunately, the humor is biting, but not savage, and you will laugh more than you will cringe.<br /><br />But you'll cringe a lot too.<br /><br />Occasionally over-written and hyper-clever (marks of a Sundance fave), "LMS" nevertheless brings the goods.  Fine acting across the board saves the film, and at the end of the day, the Hoover family has restored some dignity and sanity to the world.  Good for them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is an earnest and amusing little movie. There are some nice moments, a wonderful performance by Alan Arkin, and a "slice of life" feel that reinforces that gut feeling (which turns out to be correct) that all of us are pretty screwed up -- which is  at least half the reason that human beings are endearing.<br /><br />This isn't a great film by any means. The dialogue is extremely variable. The characters are, too, veering from stereotypical to very interesting.  The acting ranges from okay (Toni Collette, who channels the exact same character, down to the facial expressions, she played in The Sixth Sense) to very good (Greg Kinnear) to Oscar-nomination worthy (Alan Arkin). The story isn't as tight as it could be either, but that's part of its charm. It's a loose travelogue rather than a Hero's Journey, and a gentle, poigant pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS (SORT OF)<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine" attempts to blend two genres - the dysfunctional family study and the road-trip movie - and occasionally succeeds. There are a number of funny bits, but overall the movie is closer to a tragedy than a comedy.  The Hoovers are not a happy family, their road trip is marred by death, and Olive does not triumph at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Abigail Breslin is perfect in the title role, and many of the adult actors' performances are quite funny; Alan Arkin is particularly good. But overall, the movie misfires almost as often as it succeeds.  As I watched, I couldn't help but think how much better it would have been if the "Seinfeld" cast had performed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I had no idea what to expect from "Little Miss Sunshine" but I knew that it was nominated for "Best Picture" so it must have had something going for it.  I caught on quickly that this is not your ordinary movie and I soon realized that anything could happen.  This is a story of a hopelessly dysfunctional family whose many seperate parts find a most unusal way of coming together.  You can see it coming and it really becomes rather impressive to watch.  However, this film disappointed me in how it ended.<br /><br />I was bothered by the portrayal of the phoney plastic young girls in the Little Miss Sunshine.  Let's face it, movies and TV stereotype just about everything. For some groups it has been a real issue.  However, when was the last time you saw a pageant portrayed as a number of young ladies striving to become the best that they could be with every participant exiting the event as a better person than when they started?  I've attended a lot of pageants over the years (thanks primarily because our town annually hosts the state's Miss America contest).  The reality of the quality of the participants has always impressed me as far exceeding the demeaning stereotype that permeants society's general impressions.  Maybe it's an overblown reation but it bothered me how the movie strayed from what I saw as a theme of how to become a success.  All of the film's  unusual family members had failed to achieve their goals except for our young and endearing heroine.  How the movie treated her moment on the stage really bothered me.  Otherwise, this is an enjoyable albeit unusual film.<br /><br />I guess I should acknowledge that the message of "Little Miss Sunshine" might possibly be that the problem with chasing our dreams is that they can turn into nightmares.  Be happy with what life allots you while laughing at those who haven't yet had their comeuppance.  This could have been such a better movie!  Oh well, I noticed that this was an independent film so perhaps they were poking fun at Hollywood's glamour girls with more looks than talent while the Indie actors were doing the heavy lifting.  See, none of this really scores any points.  Oh well, enjoy "Littler Miss Sunshine" for what it is rather than what it isn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>In this era of big money, Hollywood blockbuster productions ("Harry Potter", "Spiderman" ETC.) it feels most satisfying to find a small, amiable, entertaining, film comedy like "Little Miss Sunshine", that seems to depend on nothing more than a good script and fine acting performances. To watch it win numerous awards and do reasonably well at the box office is even better!<br /><br />In "Little Miss Sunshine" we are introduced to the harried, dysfunctional Hoover family, which seems to be just barely getting by. The Father, Richard (Greg Kinear) is a would-be motivational speaker, trying to make a big deal happen, in order get financial investors for his program. The Mom, Sheryl (Toni Colette) is dealing with the family's financial stresses, plus everyone elses problems. This includes her brother, Frank (Steve Carell) an academic, who has come to live with the family after a recent suicide attempt, over a gay love affair with a student. The Hoover's depressed son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy to achieve his dream to fly. The family's drug addicted, Grandpa (an excellent Alan Arkin) is an overly opinionated old man, who lets his expletive filled, tactless comments fly if you want to hear them or not. Finally, in the title role is seven year old, Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet little girl with a sunny disposition and an obsession with beauty pageants.<br /><br />The Hoovers recieve a phone call, that Olive has made the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' Beauty Pageant in Rodondo Beach, CA. We watch as this eccentric family climbs into a decrepit, un-airconditioned, yellow, VW Micro-bus and make the 700 mile journey, which is filled with both big laughs, drama and tears. We watch as they try to follow their hopes & dreams and learn, that sometimes it just dosn't matter if you fit-in or not. In other words, sometimes you have to just let your 'Freak Flag Fly'!<br /><br />Co-Directors, Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris' have done a sure and steady job creating a wonderful film. Likewise, Screen Writer, Michael Ardnt's Academy Award winning script ("Best Writing, Original Screenplay") is filled with rich, well-rounded characters, witty, funny dialogue and a story that makes the viewer care.<br /><br />But the best attribute of the film is the talented ensemble cast of actors, who's peformances really made this movie. Toni Colette is a accomplished actress, who always seems to just disapear into her roles. She is just great as the stressed out mom, who keeps everyone together. Greg Kinear, who I havn't exactly been a big fan of in the past, does a terrific job as the frustrated, desperate Dad, who just won't give up on his goals. Alan Arkan won an Oscar ("Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role") as the foul-mouthed Grandpa, provided some of the film's biggest laughs, while showing a lot of heart. Like-wise, Steve Carell's (in a pre-"Office" role) depressed, Proust Scholar is an excellent performance, providing dead panned laughs and loads of outsider wisdom. Finally, Abigail Breslin is a juvenile actress, who is in a star-making role and more than holds her own with her fellow performers. Bravo to the whole brilliant cast!<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine" really is 'the little film that could'. It's funny and moving, providing themes about being yourself and not being afraid to go after your dreams. Great Movie!

The answers found in this film are soft and beautiful. This is a beautiful movie, absurd and real somehow at the same time. All of the technical stuff is great (writing, acting, etc.) but it is the intangible--the great compassion of the film--that carries it to greatness. It assures us that, no matter how screwed up we might be, no one gets left behind in our family.<br /><br />Touching and triumphant.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" is excellent!

The music adds to the film's originality and certainly is the right "tone" to the many pitfalls and basic bad luck that this dysfunctional family experience while on the road to California to have the youngest, Olive Hoover, compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />What is extraordinary is that all the characters are so different in personality and sensibility, the strongest being the cocaine snorting grandpa, (Alan Arkin) and the most unusual, Dwayne, (Paul Dano) a disciplined boy who reads Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, has taken a vow of silence, (more to escape from having to engage with his strange family) and goal to be jet pilot. At the end of the film we see that he is not as strange as we first thought. Of course, Toni Collette as the mother manages to somehow keep her family together despite their ecentricities and the many mishaps that befall them: a wonderful and restrained performance.<br /><br />Although excellent performances by the entire cast, Olive, (Abigail Breslin) stole the show as Little Miss Sunshine, realistic and endearing, the end of the film, her dance number truly stole the show.<br /><br />Having heard so much positive talk about Little Miss Sunshine to finally see it, all expectations were met as it is original and very funny.<br /><br />4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Having finally rented this DVD after all the praise and an Oscar, I was expecting a good dose of hilarity. What I got was a dark rewrite of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC9">National Lampoon's Vacation</a> brought up to these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNBQ">Napoleon Dynamite</a> times. It's dark, cynical and relentlessly bleak, even if moments of really funny stuff bounce off the bleakness.<br /><br />The actors are all well suited for their roles, with Abigail Breslen perfect as Olive and Alan Arkin getting the snarkiest lines as the heroin snorting granddad. Steve Carell proved he had dramatic chops here, even he is forced to play the gay clich&eacute; to the max, and Paul Dano gets a heck of a lot of mileage out of not speaking for most of the film.<br /><br />However, the film never really nails its timing. Funny bits are spaced with long pits of dysfunction, forcing you to deal with the fact that these people are genuinely annoying. The finale is a hoot, but again, every person here loses their dream. The payoff a broad comedy aims at the arthouse crowd...or maybe fans of Carell. Put aside the hype, and you have a stunningly average bit of filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Albuquerque homemaker Sheryl (Toni Collette) has a few problems, causing her some stress, leading to nicotine addiction. ("I am NOT smoking!")<br /><br />First, there is Richard (Greg Kinnear) her husband, who is an annoying and uninspired motivation speaker who thinks he's going to get rich hustling his nine-step pyramid to success.  Loser!<br /><br />Then there is her brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has bandages on his wrists after trying to kill himself because his homosexual lover (one of his grad students) dumped him, the number one American authority on Marcel Proust, for his academic rival, the number two authority.  Pathetic!<br /><br />Next there is Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a randy nursing home reject who snorts heroin, has a potty mouth and complains a lot.  (Maybe he'll overdose!)<br /><br />Then there is her teenaged son Dwayne (Paul Dano) an antisocial loner who reads Nietzsche, hates everyone, and is on a vow of silence until he gets into flight training in the Air Force.  (Our children always disappoint us.  Sometimes we forgive them.)<br /><br />And finally there is Miss Sunshine herself, her daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) a little overweight, a little nerdy, not exactly a looker, who has entered the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for little girls and is honing her dance routine following the pornographic advice of Grandpa.  Oh, boy!<br /><br />Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land.  For reasons too complex to relate, the whole family piles into the Volkswagen bus and heads for Redondo Beach, California where the beauty pageant is being held.  Along the madcap way, the bus's clutch goes out, Grandpa suffers, shall we say, a major setback, Richard learns that the family finances are not going to work out, Frank gets the heartbreak rubbed in his face, and Dwayne finds out that his dream is not going to come true.  But can Olive win the pageant?<br /><br />The pageant itself is pretty funny with the girls in their plastic hairdos and their Tammy Faye makeup and their fake smiles pitted against the decidedly unglamourous but ever hopeful Olive Hoover.  Who will win?<br /><br />Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations.  But see this for the writer.  Michael Arndt's warm, funny and highly original script has me (and half the screenwriters in Hollywood and New York) green with envy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>There's some very well-conceived and well-executed comedic moments in 'Little Miss Sunshine.'  I found myself laughing out loud many times.  I enjoy Toni Collette in pretty much everything.  She's good here, but the standouts are Greg Kinnear (his 'Nine Steps' Tony Robbins-wannabe shtick is great stuff) and Steve Carrell.  From 'Talk Soup' and 'The Daily Show' respectively, these guys have turned themselves into wonderful actors.  In fact, the movie's best acting comes from Kinnear, especially in the scene where he sits in the audience at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and realizes - with growing concern - the probable talent gap between the contestants and what he imagines his daughter Olive is about to bring to the stage.  [But even he can't imagine what Olive has in store, although her music choice - 'Super Freak' - and her grandfather's taste in reading material give a pretty clear indication.]<br /><br />Despite Alan Arkin's fine work here, I still think Eddie Murphy got totally jobbed out of his Oscar.  Arkin's role is rather abbreviated here (for reasons that are obvious to anyone who's watched the film).  In contrast, Murphy's take on James 'Thunder' Early in 'Dreamgirls' is a tour de force.  If you can't win an Oscar for that performance, there's just something wrong with the process.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This was not your typical family, but it is more normal today than the average grouping.  Every one of them faces a great disappointment but hangs in together.  It is a comedic tragedy.  Greg Kinnear was superb as the long-suffering dad Richard who dictates that "a real loser is someone who is so afraid they don't try"; he feels that it is weak to apologize, and "winners never give up."  When his big project fell through because "nobody cares about an unknown," he was told that it is time to move on.<br /><br />The whole premise revolves around seven-year-old Olive preparing to compete in a beauty contest and her granddad who is the most unhappy of them all teaches her a peculiar talent.  Olive is a misnomer, more like an Ann Margaret.  She has been told to "will yourself to win."  Steve Carell was good as the disturbed Uncle Frank who had loved the wrong person.  I'm so glad you're still here, he was told, as he entered the family to rehab from a disastrous setback.  That too was said to me after my health scare in April by a stranger.  Sometimes, the words of wisdom we need to  hear come unexpectedly from strange sources.  I was upset and said something I shouldn't have said; later, I was upset and didn't mean the things I said.<br /><br />The grandfather was the core of the family, the voice of experience.  There is a "Bernie" connection here, as his body is stolen from the hospital in order to get Olive to the Miss Sunshine contest on time, still one hundred miles from L.A.  This family had to travel in an old yellow VW bus for 800 miles from Alburquerque.  After Pop's sudden death, the supportive mom tells them "we are family, what matters is that we love each other."  The funny thing is the way they show it.  At the hospital, Linda (all business) was the typical KAT driver:  he's not the only person to die here today!  On I10, out in California, the drivers were as bad as these in Knoxville and almost cause accidents with their aggressiveness.<br /><br />They had to make a quick stop out on the highway where there was an oil well and track homes near Los Angeles.  Olive was dressed as a Sunshine Girl (my favorite of Eddie Fisher's songs) in her red boots and pink shorts.  It was a wild ride without a clutch, but they made it and mom tells them to "pretend to be normal."  Carl Hampton Southcott was the host of the little Miss Sunshine pageant where all of the contestants with the exception of our Olive Hoover were experienced in this game and talented, but Olive was incredible with her vaudeville-style dancing.  She'd dedicated her being there to her dead grandad who had coached and showed her all the moves.<br /><br />Her brother raved at his mom that "a mother is supposed to protect" but this one had allowed the children to grow in the ways which were best for them and was most supportive.  The whole family got in the act, and a good time was had by all -- even the audience.  I haven't laughed that much since I saw (and reviewed) 'The Dukes of Hazard.'  Olive blossomed into an Olivia.  Go see the transformation; you won't be sorry you did.<br /><br />A lot happens during their long road trip and this movie is about those incidents and how the family dynamics build and rebuild during the journey. The movie starts with the three generations of Hoover family that includes Olive (played by Abigail Breslin), her brother (played by Paul Dano), Mom (played by Toni Collette), her Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell), Grandpa (played by Alan Arkin) and Dad (played by Greg Kinnear). Little Miss Sunshine is hilarious and visual gag are fresh and funny. During the setup for the family's third trot, however, you think it can't possibly work again. Filmmakers Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton have the ability to gauge just how far they can go. The comedy in the movies seems to come out of nowhere.<br /><br />The Hoover family is a totally unique and dysfunctional family. Even though everybody is a little eccentric in this family, but every one of us will be able to relate to them. We will see ourselves or our family in them.<br />Olive, just like her father is an extremely pipe dreaming person. Her Dad is a motivational speaker who believes he can sell his `prosaic nine-step program for success' into a book and video. Similarly, Olive who has a fresh-scrubbed look and tiny potbelly thinks that she can beat a bunch of JonBenet Ramsey look-alikes.<br /><br />Her uncle has been put in her mother's care as he had attempted suicide after a fellow Proust scholar won a genius grant and stole his boyfriend. As he is still on suicide watch, he has to accompany Hoover to the contest also. Add to this is a Grandpa who snorts heroin and regrets not sleeping with too many women in his youth. He is the one who is teaching dance to Olive for her talent completion.<br /><br />Real life married couple, Dayton and Faris do not muck around with an enticing script by putting distracting visual effects. So, the couple uses simplest of camera work and effects possible.

Like when the door falls off, people in the theater laughed a little bit, perhaps startled by the noise of the door's clang on the parking lot asphalt.  All in all it was a pretty glum affair, but a good one, sort of like the old-time New American Cinema movies of the 1970s like THE LONG GOODBYE or FIVE EASY PIECES.<br /><br />A family group tries to complete a roadtrip of 1000 miles West, mirroring an earlier voyage of discovery and colonial conquest by American empire builders and covered wagon pioneers.  And of ci=urse you can't take a road trip in the movies without learning a lot about yourself.  For an independent film, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE hits practically all the three-act plot points Syd Field and his ilk recommend.  Each of the actors undergoes his or her own trauma, revelation, and recovery.  Most of them were pretty well done, like Greg Kinnear's encounter with Bryan Cranston at the Scottsdale hotel.  It did seem a little coincidental that little Olive would happen to have brought with her a test for color blindness to use as a game.  That was hard to swallow.<br /><br />But what really threw me off was Steve Carell's encounter with the one person in the whole world he didn't want to see, at some kind of roadside 7-11 in the middle of nowhere.  Did the screenwriters ever pause to ask themselves if an audience would believe this?  It is to Carell's credit that he almost makes it work.  And the rival Proust scholar who takes over Frank's title and his boyfriend?  Isn't it the Canadian actor who used to play the gay son on Dynasty--Gordon Thomson?  Maybe I'm getting mixed up and his character wasn't gay, just seemed like it.  If so, it's great that Gordon Thomson has hooked himself onto a hit.  It's been a long time between engagements for the man who once replaced Lane Davies as Mason Capwell on the NBC daytime drama, SANTA BARBARA.<br /><br />It was just little things that prevent me from awarding this film four stars instead of five.  Little things like, the revelation of the nature of Olive's number, which she has been practicing all through the film, at the close of the beauty pageant, is it supposed to signal that Alan Arkin's character has been molesting her during their nights together?  I can't wait for the ten years later sequel, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 2: MONSTER: THE OLIVE WUORNOS STORY.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>Darkiest comedy ever.

This was one of the most disappointing times of my movie viewing year. For the past 12 months, in my circles, I have heard nothing but praise and accolades for 'Little Miss Sunshine'. These accolades coming from 11 year old girls to 80 year old men, to film school students who praise this as a hidden gem of 'raw-art-situational comedy'. Everyone telling me in every way imaginable, "Oh Ken you have to see this movie. It's so amazing. It speaks to so many people on so many different avenues." Hmmm, clearly I am driving on an isolationist freeway.<br /><br />While there were tender moments (Paul Dano (L.I.E.) talking with the gay Steve C. (Dan in Real Life) on the docks about doing what you want to do and screwing morals and society's judgements), I seemed to be wondering when in fact the movie would become something of importance or interest. It failed on all fronts to move me to understand it's purpose, albeit trying to be hilariously funny. While the opening scenes point to a storyline with depth and tender emotions, (save the regurgated use of the word cliche) it guts what little it can delve out, with unwitty righteous ensemble displays of earnest and ill will towards Alan Arkin trying desperately to be comedic. On a sidenote, Paul Dano has intense potential, despite anyone with a pulse being able to play his roll as the quiet, isolated teenage son, he comes through when he breaks his silence with his outburst in the suburbian field, and like Jamie Bell (UnderTow, Billy Elliott) he is not afraid to take on roles which clearly shows the depth of his craft as his performances are dynamic, intriguing, diverse and controversial. We should watch his career with great intrigue.<br /><br />Uniformly, LMS falls on almost every attempt to try almost effortlessly to shine as an art-house indie flick with that sub-genre of psuedo-intellectuals who think films like these are progressively artistic in their endeavors to speak to everyone in some way. In fact it can't seem to find solid ground, save Alan Arkin who's incessant use of the F word was uncalled for in its excess. I am sheltered in believing that this little film was to be a shining, roving example of what is lacking in Hollywood, and how a low budget movie can bring momentum to an often saturated industry filled with massive CGI mega blockbusters and B Movie straight to DVD trash. However, it can only take this movie lover to a certain level of cynicism in wondering:<br /><br />what...all...the...hype...was...about.<br /><br />Ken, January '08</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>life wellness guru wannabe (kinear) and his bill paying wife (collette) try to make ends meet.this wouldnt be interesting unless quirky kids/seniors join the mix.son has stopped speaking and is training to be an air force pilot while daughter is preparing to be a future beauty pageant winner under feisty grandfathers tutelage.throw in a suicidal gay uncle and the movie is off and running.<br /><br />less than typically pretty olive has been informed she is up for the little miss sunshine crown.problem is the family cant afford the trip to cali and the event has a deadline.everyone eventually comes to terms and pile in bus pictured on cover/posters.<br /><br />im still waiting for a movie to happen........ok,i guess the ''hook'' of this hohum dramedy is olives dance routine.to be honest,''beauty'' pageants are as useful as zippo lighters are to fish.some people need to be told in public they are physically attractive while being extremely shallow.they say they want world peace and to feed the hungry,blahblabblah through insta-seal grins.i have yet to hear/read of a ''winner'' doing anything in regards to helping anyone.anyway,kids looking like adult midgets is creepy and adults allowing this garbage to take place are even creepier.<br /><br />this movie was dull and will most likely be the next trendy thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This movie was a huge waste of time.

It isn't the off-kilter comedy of its road-trip plot.  It isn't even the almost flawless acting of young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the precocious young girl with dreams of being a beauty pageant winner.<br /><br />No, what makes this movie truly unique is how it takes what could be a rote plot contrivance (Will she win the pageant?) and turns it on its head (SHOULD she win the pageant?).  By the time the family reaches the end of their difficult journey (having endured mechanical failures, an uncomfortably close experience with death, and even the saving grace of pornographic magazines) they are moving on auto-pilot, doggedly moving ahead simply because that has been their purpose.  When they reach the pageant, though, instead of a moving moment of self-redemption, it serves as a grotesque reminder that sometimes dreams are less important than the reasons those dreams exist in the first place.<br /><br />This movie is, after all, about people who have failed.  Greg Kinnear plays with exquisite desperation the patriarch, Richard, a failed motivational speaker (and, no, the irony isn't lost on him).  Dwayne is a typically-rebellious young teen who follows the teachings of Nietzsche and has sworn to a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force fighter pilot.  Alan Arkin is the foul-mouthed, drug-addicted grandfather, searching for his own version of contentment in his life's twilight years.  Toni Collette is absolutely perfect as the mother, Sheryl, who has made this frazzled family the locus of her own frazzled life.  And Steve Carell shines, cast against type as the once-eminent Proust scholar, Frank, who is attempting to recover after losing his lover, his job, and his will to keep on living.<br /><br />Given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.  Never does the film indulge in the kind of shameless self-congratulatory lesson-learning that dysfunctional family comedies are so rife with these days.  We are treated, instead, to a tender and yet unflinching look at these people and how they struggle.  This is, quite obviously, a family of losers (in whatever way you want to define that word), but -- as we are shown in the final scenes -- in a world that is sickeningly obsessed with winning, being a loser is nothing to be ashamed of.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>First, I read the script by Michael Arndt, which I found to be intelligent and interesting; but not great and only marginally funny.<br /><br />Then I watched the movie by husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They added a lot to the script visually; but many of their decisions were based on time and budget constraints, which caused them to pare down some of the more important scenes of the film, making it less impacting. Like the beauty pageant: in the script, it was much bigger, more outlandish and more climactic. Or Frank and Dwayne's trip to the beach: the script had them taking surfboards far out from shore, causing one to wonder what they really had in mind (another suicide attempt?) and coming back wearing "Loser" T-shirts. The directors pared that down to a trip to the end of a pier. Many of the comic effects (like double-takes and revealing glances) were ignored, and many of the funnier lines were spoken so nonchalantly and sotto voce that they were virtually thrown away.<br /><br />The best character in the story was the yellow VW bus. After that, Abigail Breslin as Olive and Greg Kinnear as Richard were good; Toni Collette as Sheryl and Alan Arkin as Grandpa were okay; Paul Dano and Steve Carell were disappointingly miscast and could have passed as corpses through most of the film. None of these were Oscar-winning performances, nor should this have been a Best Picture nominee. The directors took this script and tried to make it a cross between the outlandishly funny, off-the-wall comedy RAISING ARIZONA, and the more serious black comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY - and it didn't work. What they ended up with was a quirky and weird little film that is fairly entertaining but not particularly funny. I think Hollywood is so enthralled with their own quirkiness and weirdness that they interpret anything quirky and weird as being funny and great entertainment. Now, I like quirky, but I draw the line at weird.<br /><br />What could have been a good story about false values - dividing the world between winners and losers, with child beauty pageants as the example of that idea taken to extremes - ended up getting lost in all the quirkiness and weirdness, time constraints and budget limitations. You know something is wrong when the directors don't know how to end the film. They have four different endings on the DVD, none of them what scriptwriter Michael Arndt had in mind, and none of them good. Some are downright lame. The fact that this film won at Sundance does not make it a great film. Other films have won in the past and gone on to obscurity, among them SPITFIRE GRILL, which in 1996 got tremendous praise but today very few people have even heard of.<br /><br />When films like this get raised to the status of Best Picture Nominee, you know the year was not a particularly good one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is about a family trying to get the youngest daughter across country to compete in the "Little Miss Sunshine" pageant. There's the dad (Greg Kinnear), who's a motivational speaker and author of a self-help book he's trying to sell; there's the gay uncle (Steve Carell), just out of the hospital after trying to kill himself; there's the teenage son (Paul Dano) who's taken a vow of silence; there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin) who's been kicked out of the retirement community; there's the daughter (Abigail Breslin) who's not quite like the other pageant contestants; and the mom (Toni Collette) who tries to hold them all together.<br /><br />The trip tears them all apart and puts them back together, as a family.<br /><br />If the characters were less quirky, the story would be too heartwarming for words, and would require a warning from dentists. But as it is, they're understandable and sympathetic in their quirkiness, and because they're exaggerated, it's easy to see parts of them in your own life, whether in yourself or those around you, making the movie very thought-provoking.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is described as a comedy, but I don't see that. There are funny parts, yes, but the story is too tragic to be a comedy, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>This is definitely worth seeing once, due to some excellent casting, sharp writing, and a few surprises. However, I never considered it a comedy. It is an exaggerated slice of life depiction of a dysfunctional family's long weekend road trip from New Mexico to Southern California for a child "beauty pageant." Grandpa shoots up heroin, big brother does not speak at all, by choice, Mom's brother is a gay suicide survivor, Mom is disappointed in her husband's dreams of being the next self-help guru. Abby Breslin as the pageant contestant is superb, but there are several moments of tension or sadness in here which, while well-done, do outrank the laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Greg Kinnear, steve carrell and Arkin are a gass in this very funny film..<br /><br />We have seen this dysfunctional family plot a million times - but somehow it is made fresh here..

A bright spot in an otherwise bleak year for cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is a good drama about family and how not everyone's is perfect, definitely nothing like you would see on the early days of television. This movie does have a few funny moments, but mainly focuses on the problems that families have. The dad is a perfectionist, the grandfather is a crack addict, the son refuses to speak and the uncle is a gay man who tried to commit suicide. As you can see, this movie isn't a family film, but it is  great none-the-less. The acting in the film is great, I was happy when they were and was sad when they were as well. The ending was a little disappointing, it has a climax and immediately ends without a real "what happened" after the contest that the movie is named after.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  I don't quite get the hype. Up until the Olive's big number, there wasn't really anything in this film that I haven't seen before.  I mean, the audience knows that book deal isn't going to go through the first time Richard utter the words.  Other than the first five minutes, Uncle Frank doesn't seem suicidial at all.  Can't pick apart Dewayne since he doesn't even talk until the third act.  And I find it highly unlikely that a family would pick up everything and rush to enter this thing WITHOUT seeing the girl's routine.  Everyone knows that Grandpa's whacked, what qualified him to be coaching their daughter for a pageant?<br />BUT what saves this movie is the acting talent.  Good performance CAN save a mediocre skript.  And Ms. Abigail is absolutely precious in this film.  I'm happy that she looked like what a seven year old should look like and not those life-size barbie dolls that are the norm for young beauty pageants that in this reviewer's opinion should be deemed criminal.  The only thing is: for this to have been Olive's dream to win, she didn't seem all that crushed when she didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>It was a good movie but certainly nothing Oscar worthy. The little girl didn't do anything that Dakota Fanning hasn't done better. The movie had some laughs but other than that it was kind of depressing.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" has a lot going for it: all-star cast, OK writing, decent premise and an adorable child star. But something is missing, making the movie less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The story concerns Olive Hoover, a pudgy, bespectacled 10-year old who dreams of being a beauty queen. She has no chance in the world until the winner of a contest (in which Olive placed second) loses her crown. Suddenly, Olive has a shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown - if only her dysfunctional family can get its act together and help her get to the contest!<br /><br />LMS is another in a long line of "funny" movies about dysfunctional families. But this one inexpertly negotiates the fine line between crazy people being funny and crazy people being weird, mean or dangerous. Grandpa is a porn-addicted coker. Uncle tried slit his wrists - a very unfunny way to do oneself in. Brother is a Nietzsche freak who hates everyone and has taken a vow of silence. Dad is desperate to sell his pathetic self-help regimen. Only Mom is half-way sane, though how she keeps up with this gang of misfits is anyone's guess. In the hands of an accomplished writer, this might have worked, as it did every week for the writers of "Malcolm in the Middle." But with LMS I found myself alternately horrified for or horrified by the cruelty and pathetic weirdness of this bunch.<br /><br />I also found that the movie misfired in its attempt to satirize pre-pubescent beauty pageants. In post-Jon Benet America, the sight of people dressing their young daughters as sexy starlets is more than a little creepy.<br /><br />There was a very human and very funny movie lurking inside LMS. Maybe a different cast or a different set of writers could have set it free. As it was, I experienced it (and I expect that this is a minority view) as a rarely funny cringe-fest.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>.I should really stay away from these "feel good" comedies.  But I must admit I laughed out loud a little bit.  It was worth watching just to see the performance of Alan Arkin.<br /><br />The story follows a family driving from Arizona to California so that their little daughter can compete in the "Little Miss Sunshine" contest.  The film pokes fun at everything, including the human potential movement, the concept of a dysfunctional family, beauty pageants in general, and homophobia.  It all seemed so stupid that I felt like turning it off at once.  But then Alan Arkin came on the scene, cast brilliantly in the role of the "dirty old grandpa" and he absolutely stole the show.<br /><br />But one performance does not make a film I like.  And this firm doesn't even get on the playing field  in that category.  I just wish I had the power to cut and paste the sections with Alan Arkin and just watch those parts.  He was really that good.<br /><br />Comedy lovers who want to come out of the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling might like this film.  But to grumpy old me, with the exception noted above, it was barely tolerable.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Is this a remake of the Griswalds vacation to Wally World?

Vehicle breaks down...etc.......could go on.<br /><br />with that aside, it's not a bad movie, it's just that it's not that great.  Characters were annoying and unbelievable.  A goth son wanting to fly jets? wierd, whatever. I don't see this movie breaking any new ground in what it is presenting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Just before I sat down to watch the film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE I was leafing through a copy of Douglas Adam's final anthology of writings called The Salmon of Doubt.  In an article he wrote called "Turncoat" he mused "I wonder if we don't have too much comedy these days...nowadays everybody's a comedian, even the weather girls... We laugh at everything.  Not intelligently anymore, not with sudden shock, astonishment, or revelation, just relentlessly and meaninglessly."  After the movie was over I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  Here is a film that attempts to be dark, attempts to be charming, attempts to be edgy, attempts to be independent, and is yet drops the ball because in the end it has nothing cohesive to say.<br /><br />Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is the cutest little kid in the world.  The kind of kid who just looks at the world with wide-eyed wonder.  She sweet even if the world around her isn't so.  Her Dad (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker and an even worse role model, her mom (Toni Collette) is far to permissive, her brother (Paul Dano) hates his life and has taken a vow of silence, her grandpa (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin, and her Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has shown up on their doorstep after a botched attempt to take his own life.  This motley family is about to make a 700 mile trip in a beat up VW Van with a busted clutch to get Olive to the National Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in Redondo Beach. Will they survive each other?  Or will Olive's dream of becoming a beauty queen come crashing down?<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the kind of movie that will leaving you feeling good at the end only because it ends on such a high note.  The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best.  They're what you're going to talking about as you leave the theater.  As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.<br /><br />The film is far to moody.  There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness.  LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE spends too much of it early scenes developing realistic characters.  They laugh, they cry, and then the film betrays this honesty by asking them to fall into farce.  The screenplay goes into auto-pilot and the characters turn into independent film cliches'.<br /><br />The actors do the best they can with the material but alas the film feels so artificial.  You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler.  Every character gets to wax poetic then they get to do something silly.  Then the film makes some blanket statement about how life is as phony as a beauty contest, there is an act of rebellion, and then everybody hugs.<br /><br />The films biggest problem is that the screenplay is such a rip off of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION.  Except instead of Wally World the Hoovers are on their way to Redondo Beach and there is a Proust scholar in the car.  There is even a scene in which a dead body shows up and they have to put it in their car.  I was waiting for Randy Quaid to show up and ask Greg Kinnear's character for money.  That's what this film needed Uncle Eddie.<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a "dark comedy" that's far too dark and not really all that funny.  It has it's moments, and on the surface  it is very sweet and charming.  Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide-eyed wonder.  But unfortunately the film is not worth the price of admission.  I'd skip this beauty contest.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>a typical dramatized american struggling family, not even qualified as a middle class clan, got to squeeze everyway to get by since there was no steady income at all. simply put, a house poor family, every body got some demon or agenda to deal with. the only thing i felt so contrite and unnatural is why put another gay guy in the movie again? for those who like to chase or follow their (broken) dreams no matter what, this might be the movie for you. it's so typically boring. what about later? the 'thereafter'? happily thereafter? definitely not. might still have to eat fried chicken everyday as the main course, some sweets as the dessert 24/7. the struggle never goes away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and as 2006 grinds to a close, it's time for "Little Miss Sunshine."<br /><br />Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family. But "Little Miss Sunshine" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective. This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it -- it's truly glorious.<br /><br />Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an anxious motivational speaker who talks a lot about "winners" and "losers," which is pretty funny when one considers that his family is full of oddities. His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine-step program on the family, and her Proust-scholar brother has just arrived, after a failed suicide attempt.<br /><br />And then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin) -- she's wants to be in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and is being coached by her outspoken, heroin-snorting grandfather. When she gets into the pageant, the family piles into a minibus to go to Redondo Beach. Unfortunately, the trip exposes all the problems they have -- death, disappointment, suicide and lost dreams. And a broken clutch.<br /><br />If you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart. "Little Miss Sunshine" realizes this, in a little family world where a wordless hug speaks more than dozens of empty lines. These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other -- yes, even foulmouthed Grandpa.<br /><br />But lest anyone think it's syrupy, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris wrap it in a wicked cocoon of clever humor. "Sarcasm is the refuge of losers," Richard says smugly, only to receive a sarcastic "REALLY?" He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it. ("High school's your prime suffering years! You don't get better suffering than that!").<br /><br />And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn. The climax of the strangeness is the "Fawlty Towers"esque smuggling of a dead body, and a truly surreal song-and-dance sequence. It has to score a 9.5 on the "bizarre endings" scale.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress -- cute, yet not cutesy -- and she tends to fill up the screen with her natural appeal. The other actors wear their parts like comfy old sweaters, such as Colette's weary mother and her business-obsessed hubby, not to mention Alan Arkin's priceless turn as the drug-snorting patriarch.<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine" is a comedy as dark as it is funny, but somehow it never becomes depressing. Instead, it's a little gem of an indie film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>If you've ever been on one of those family vacations where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, then moments of Little Miss Sunshine will resonate with you. The finest part of the film was the casting, and the ability of the director to draw out an excellent ensemble synergy. No one person in the cast stands out, and all slip right into the skin of their personal dysfunctional character like hand in glove.<br /><br />The nuclear family in the story, of Albuquerque, is headed by Kinnear as Richard, the developer of a "self-help" routine that he's trying to sell, wife Sheryl (Collette), stepson Dwayne (Paul Dano, brilliantly cast as a misfit teen, a devotee of the combination of Nietzche and the Air Force) and young 7 year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has not yet been touched by the pessimistic air of the family, and who is the vital force that keeps them all moving forward. Breslin is perhaps the finest part of the film (she has appeared before, in "Signs").<br /><br />For the "road trip" on which the film centers, the family is trying to get Olive to Redondo Beach, CA for a young girl's pageant know as Little Miss Sunshine. It's not clear why Olive is fixated on the pageant, but the family pulls out all the stops to go. In doing so, they can't leave behind their houseguests, Richard's father (Alan Arkin as Grandpa) who was thrown out of assisted living for shooting heroin, and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell), who has recently lost his tenured position, his lover and has tried to commit suicide. This is not a laugh out loud role for Carrell, and it's excellent to see the bittersweet side of him.<br /><br />Along the trip, there are many challenges that would have sent a family less devoted to their daughter back home again...there's a great scene with ice cream in a diner...but nothing tops the family's reaction when they get to the pageant. Given the recent developments in the JonBenet case, and the endless fascination the public has with those shots of JonBenet in her "glam" pageants, the bizarre competition that Olive faces in the person of many little girls aged well beyond their youth is startling.<br /><br />Olive's been working on the talent portion of the competition with her grandfather, and her talent is completely inappropriate and hilarious. The support she receives from her family, however, shows that even the most dysfunctional families can pull together in a crisis, and grow from it.<br /><br />Without giving away any more of the film, I'll tell you that you will find "Little Miss Sunshine" metaphorical and sweet at some turns, laugh out loud at others. What more can you ask from a comedy?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The Screen Actors Guild have an "Outstanding Performance by a Cast" award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).<br /><br />Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />And the story goes...<br /><br />Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his "are you a winner or loser" motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.<br /><br />Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off -- or sometimes smashing against -- each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.<br /><br />The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask "if" I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate!<br /><br />I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling. That says a lot, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine is a pleasant, humorous, well-cast romp of a film.  It tries to hard to be that kind of non-PC that is actually so-PC today that it can cause the occasional eye-roll, but it still brings on the chuckles and moves a long with a great open good-heartedness. All the actors here do a fine job - Kinnear in particular considering the lack of attention he's recieved comparared to others in the cast.  A very pleasant and enjoyable film, but certainly not a classic or Oscar-worthy piece of film making.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>I watched this movie twice - the second time just to understand if I was missing something that the critics were raving about - but no.<br /><br />I think that the only true dysfunctional tale on film has been told only twice - once on TV in the beautiful "Six Feet Under", and once in the offbeat comedy "The Daytrippers" with Parker Posey. After watching both of those, this seems like a poor second cousin, with very little going on that would qualify for so much praise.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I loved this movie - in parts. To me, the strongest actors were Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (who I think, is a good actress beyond her years, and a REAL actress unlike the young Dakota Fanning). Paul Dano plays the young Dwayne, and his is the most unnerving and realistic depiction of a troubled teen I have seen in some time. The other characters were good, but the actors weren't really breaking new ground with their performances. Toni Colette especially was disappointing. At one point, I used to watch every movie she was in, she was just THAT good, but of late she seems to be signing every weak film in existence. Weird.<br /><br />Alan Arkin did NOT deserve the Oscar for this performance. First of all, he dies half way through, and secondly, he had the most boring lines and the worst screen presence. That Oscar belonged to Hounsou for "Blood Diamond" - Arkin had no business getting it, as much as I love his body of work.<br /><br />What did not work for me was the climax - granted it is "Sweet", but what about reality? If the intention was to make a comedy, they should not have thrown in the element of realism that they tried so hard to create through the film - it was more of an anticlimax and a very disappointing one at that. I can see people smiling and clapping through the end of the movie, but I was just sitting there wondering "Is This It?".<br /><br />But if you must watch this movie, watch it for Paul Dano, the young star who plays the recluse Dwayne. That was the only good thing about this movie other than Abigail, and to me signalled the arrival of a huge new star.<br /><br />There are other better movies on the same lines out there - please check out the wonderful "The Daytrippers" starring Hope Davis and Parker Posey, as well as the Beauty Contest satire "Drop Dead Gorgeous". After those, you'll be left wondering why on earth "Little Miss Sunshine" is garnering so much praise.<br /><br />An average film. Don't buy it, just rent it. It has no "repeat value" whatsoever.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>What a great, great movie "Little Miss Sunshine" is; it tells a simple yet genuinely effective human story, and it includes characters that are very realistically portrayed. That's a treat from the audience's point of view; no matter how quirky or unconventional the circumstances of the film may be, normal characters have the remarkable ability to connect with viewers. The characters in this film make up the classic dysfunctional family, each member going through their own inner turmoil. They often fight, they regularly swear, and they each have personalities that clash to an incredible degree. How much more real can it get, especially when elements like financial trouble and emotional suffering are thrown into the mix? No one in this film is a rigid caricature, and that made it worthwhile.<br /><br />It's also a very funny film. But I'm using the word "funny" in a very different context, almost (but not quite) with an air of sarcasm. For the most part, it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud kind of way; rather, it's funny in an I-know-exactly-how-that-character-feels kind of way, presenting situations that the audience is able to understand and sympathize with. It was an interesting storytelling method, especially since every main character in this film is forced to partake in something they would rather do without. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a seven-year-old girl who dreams of someday winning a beauty pageant. To say her family life in New Mexico is chaotic would be an understatement; she shares a home with family members that, at first glance, don't seem compatible in any way.<br /><br />The father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a completely misguided motivational speaker-wannabe. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette), is a typical caring mom who understands how bad the family's financial situation is. Of course, Richard is certain that his new program--a self-help system that is supposedly completed in just nine steps--will be hailed as the next big thing in striving for excellence. The brother, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is an incredibly unhappy teenager who wants to be in the Air Force and has recently taken a vow of silence (he's also taken to reading the works of Frederick Nitzsche). The uncle, Frank (Steve Carell), has recently attempted suicide due to a failed gay relationship, the loss of his job, and the loss of a prestigious teaching award. Finally, there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin), a cantankerous old man who seems to have many regrets in life, most of which involve not having lived fast or died young. For these reasons, he's now snorts heroine on a regular basis.<br /><br />Apparently, Olive had competed in an Albuquerque child beauty pageant and came in second. But some weeks later, Cheryl's sister calls and tells the family the good news: the first place winner of that contest has been disqualified ("Something to do with diet pills!"). By default, Olive is now eligible to compete in the national Little Miss Sunshine pageant. As you can probably imagine, this sends Olive into a whirlwind of excitement. But because Cheryl's sister is unable to take Olive, this sends the rest of the family into a whirlwind of doubt, uncertainty, and panic. The pageant is being held in Redondo Beach, California; not only can they not afford to fly there, Richard is also trying to contact marketing exec Stan Grossman (Bryan Cranston) in the hopes of turning the nine-step program into a sellable product. What's worse is that Frank can't be left alone for fear of another suicide attempt. The only viable solution is for the entire family to drive to California.<br /><br />Thus begins the family's journey across the Southwestern United States, one that will test them in almost every conceivable way. One of the biggest obstacles is their Volkswagen bus; the clutch is completely shot, and since they don't have the time or the money to repair it, they have to physically push the car until it reaches third gear (they also can't rely on the brakes). But more compelling are the emotional obstacles each character will have to clear in their own way. The scenes in the van were probably the most significant in terms of allowing the characters to face their problems. Bickering ensues almost immediately, especially between Grandpa, Richard, and Frank. But it's Richard's dialogue that is the most priceless: he just can't get out of his you-should-only-be-a-winner mode, constantly spewing his self-help banter about how methods like sarcasm and quitting are only used by losers. In fact, he thinks they represent one of the lowest of the nine steps. The only kinds of people who do deserve respect are those who actually have goals and are trying to follow them through.<br /><br />He praises Olive for this mindset; she wants to be involved in a beauty pageant, and because of consistent practicing and the firm belief that she can win, he's willing to support her. Of course, this makes Olive very concerned. From her point of view, her father hates losers, and if she doesn't win, she fears he'll stop loving her. Ready to reassure her is her grandfather; as crotchety as he is, he's also a caring individual, standing by his granddaughter's side no matter what (there's also a very touching scene in the van when he praises Richard for going after what he believed in). He even goes as far as to teach her some moves (none of which we actually see until the end of the movie; boy, is the audience in for a surprise).<br /><br />But this kind of character complexity isn't limited to just the grandfather; at one point or another, all the family members display different personality traits, ones that make them impossible to label. Again, I go back to the realism of the story: no one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype, just as no one is completely good or bad. They're just ordinary, everyday, flawed people, and they do everything they can to get Olive to California in time. One gets the sense that no matter how much this family goes through, no matter how many arguments they have, they'll always be together, for better or worse. That's the kind of family we'd all like to have, especially when everyone can learn something valuable.<br /><br />By the time they reach California, they've gone through enough to last them a lifetime, from emotional breakdowns to malfunctioning van equipment to an escapade with a dead body (whose dead body I dare not say). And yet they're ready to let Olive do what she's always dreamed of doing. This is despite the fact that the world of children's beauty pageants hits them like a ton of bricks. Backstage, we see just how far these little girls go to look beautiful: they don hairpieces and false teeth; they're airbrushed with makeup and sunless tanners; they're dressed in sparkly, provocative dresses. When the contestants are on stage, Olive is the only one that actually looks like a real child (which basically means that she's not beauty pageant material).<br /><br />The final scenes of "Little Miss Sunshine" are almost too perfect for words. I won't describe them for want of you going out there and seeing this movie for yourself. I will say that it all comes together in a way that's beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time. How appropriate for a film about the trials and tribulations of family life. There's quite a bit one can learn from a movie like this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it. One thing I learned was that this was more than story about a beauty pageant. It's actually much simpler than that; it's a story about life and discovering who you are in this world (and I don't mean that in a hokey way). What a perfect message; there aren't enough of them in movies these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>A country, that produces movies, which are as scathingly sarcastic about its own culture, cannot be entirely lost to civilization. America does understand America after all. I have hope.<br /><br />This movie is as black a piece of humour as you can find. Possibly not even the title hero is quite right in her mind, but let us be generous. She is cute. The most so when she loses her mind over having qualified for the finals.<br /><br />The rest of the family has been accurately summarized as "dysfunctional". What a nice word. Whoever found it and popularized it deserves a special praise. It is even better, all by itself, than Greg Kinnear's wonderful lecture on refusing to lose. Only in America...<br /><br />It is so realistic, you could shed tears over it. It is so funny, you can hardly ever laugh, seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I was a little leery when I heard this movie was about a "dysfunctional family." Oh no! I thought I might meet one of the many movie families we've seen in recent years who bounce a series of contrived eccentricities off each other. But this movie turned out to be a wonderful surprise.<br /><br />This was like eavesdropping on a real family, a family of real people who care about each other and who draw us into caring about them. As I was watching, I was reminded of the 1970's TV documentary featuring the Loud Family. In that pioneering reality programming, cameras were installed in a "typical" suburban home, and we viewers got to be flies on the wall as the Louds went through a series of anything-but-typical triumphs and tragedies. Coincidentally, the Director and Writer of  "Little Miss Sunshine" mentioned the Loud documentary in their DVD commentary. They said their screen drama began to remind THEM of the Loud chronicle as they tweaked the script and got it on film.<br /><br />Now, because of all the probing Dr. Phils and webcams everywhere, we can continuously eavesdrop on real life family drama. It's hard for any scripted drama to compete with all this reality. But I think "Sunshine" succeeds. It has the ring of truth; but it also has a satisfying dramatic arc. It captures what could be the plausible dynamics between family members as they, with all their diverse preoccupations, take to the road to get their little daughter to the spot she qualified for by default in a California beauty pageant.<br /><br />The only lapse in logic here is that none of these family members have foreknowledge of the kind of contest they are headed into. With all the notoriety surrounding the JonBenet Ramsey case, you would think everyone would be aware of what standards little girl beauty pageant contestants have to meet. But it seems all the members of this "Miss Sunshine" movie family are na?ve on that score. They don't suspect that their youngest child may not be geared to project the right sort of precocious sex appeal. And there is a disconnect between the little girl's looks and the talent presentation that her grandfather coached her into preparing.<br /><br />But this is a minor quibble. On the whole, I bought the premise and became engrossed. I rode along with this family in their clutch-challenged van through all their copings. And I was sorry when the ride was over.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Little Miss Sunshine has a sunny heart. The movie is heartwarming, without being sugarcoated; it's sweet without being saccharine.<br /><br />Exiting the movie theater, I overheard a woman say that Little Miss Sunshine was real. I agree. The movie might not have the most common plot or the most ordinary characters, but its dysfunctional family and a sense of failure resonate with all of us. This movie does not follow a formula and it doesn't try to impress you with any of the traditional Hollywood gimmicks; instead it tells a story the way it's meant to be told - unbegrudgingly and unhinderingly. Its allure is that it's fresh, funny, and innocent, even when profanities are being uttered left and right.<br /><br />What is most redeeming about this movie, however, are the characters and the superb cast of actors who play them. If one look at the cast reveals a cast full of B movie stars that have never made it big, then these talented people are extremely misjudged and underpaid. Steve Carrell, who arguably is no longer a B movie star after the 40-year-old Virgin crossed the $100 million at the box-office, is incredibly convincing as Frank, the uncle who attempted to commit suicide because of an unrequited homosexual love. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, In Her Shoes) delivers Sheryl, a mother trying to keep her family together, who is at her wits' ends about the life;s failures, so distinctively that it's a wonder if Collette is actually acting or portraying her own experience. Alan Arkin (Jacob the Liar, Gattaca)'s Grandpa is one of the best forefathers on screen. Seeing Paul Dano (The Girl Next Door, Taking Lives) as Dwayne one is amazed and belittled by Dano's tremedous talent. Dano, who spends most of the movie mimicking and writing his lines on a notepad, is an exceptionally talented young man and a promising actor. Furthermore, Greg Kinnear (As Good As it Gets, You've Got Mail) has one of the best performances of his life as Richard, the father who invented a 9 Step Program to winning, but can't seem to win in life himself.<br /><br />Yet, what this movie needed was a strong heroine, a girl who isn't waif thin; a girl who has the charm and charisma to steal the show and delight us and it could have no one better than Abigail Breslin (The Signs, Raising Helen), who plays Olive, the little girl who is eligible to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, a California beauty pageant for 6- to 7-year-old girls. Breslin is a girl with a very, very bright future. She isn't a supermodel, but she is better - more human and more real.<br /><br />The last ten minutes of this movie will delight, surprise, and entertain you. The rest of the moviegoers in my theater laughed until their hands could clap no longer and their faces were full of glee after the movie ended. The movie brought a childhood smile, one of true wonderment and enjoyment to everyone's face.<br /><br />If you can make people laugh that hard about everybody's worse fear, you don't only have a comedy, you've got a true classic.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a winner, but not because it tries and never gives up. It's a winner in the truest sense of the word - it warms your heart and entertains you until the very last credit rolls.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I caught a free screening of Little Miss Sunshine in Chicago the other day at the reccomendation of a friend of a friend.  I had seen previews for the film and I thought that it looked good, and when I learned that the producers were holding promotional pre-screenings to get word-of-mouth going, I was very excited.  I went to the theater with high hopes of a quirky road comedy with Steve Carrell, who never fails to make me laugh.  I did have a slight worry in the back of my mind; road comedies tend to be trite and formulaic, but I was relying on the fact that this is an indie film to show me something new.<br /><br />I was not disappointed; in fact, the film was much better than what I was expecting.  Even though I knew the entire story going into the film, the family's journey was the focus of the film, not their destination.  For anyone who doesn't know, Little Miss Sunshine is about a bizarre lower class family from New Mexico.  When Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), the young daughter, wins the local Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant by default, she is entered into the nationals in California.  She and her family pack themselves into an ancient VW bus and take a two day drive west.  Father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe motivational speaker who takes his schtick a little too seriously.  He preaches about the difference between "winners" and "losers" and tries to use his routine on his fed-up family.  His inability to actually get an audience is a big factor in keeping his family barely above the poverty line.  His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) is probably the most normal of the group, but she seems to be constantly on the verge of a nervous break-down.  She tries to keep the rest of her wacky family from killing each other, and resorts to smoking (a loser activity by Richard's standards) to relieve the stress.  Olive's brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a kooky Neitche fan who wants to be an Air Force test pilot.  He has taken a vow of silence and claims that he will keep it up until he achieves his goal of becoming a pilot.  He also claims to hate "everyone".  Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell) also live with the nuclear Hoover family.  Edwin is a heroin-snorting old man who uses profanity-laden speech, loves pornographic magazines, and tends to offer lewd advice to people who don't really want it.  He also is Olive's coreographer.  Frank is a homosexual Proust scholar who tried to kill himself when someone he loved rejected him.<br /><br />If nothing eventful happened to the Hoovers on their trip, their personalities alone would be enough to drive the comedy of the film.  However, crazy things do happen, such as the clutch failing.  This forces them to park uphill in order to have an easier time getting the car going again.  If a hill isn't around, they have to push the car, then jump in while its moving.  Navigational errors, getting pulled over, and an unfortunate encounter with a certain person from Frank's past all factor in to the trip, and many of the events are simultaneously hilarious and sad.  The film's climax at the pageant is amazing because it is both hilarious and creepy.  I don't want to give away why, but suffice to say that I was trying to figure out whether it was ok to laugh at certain things.<br /><br />It's interesting to watch how these different characters react to the situations around them.  Richard has his motivational speaking, Sheryl has her smoking, and Edwin has his drugs.  However, the best person in the family is Olive, who completely embraces everything that happens.  Walking around in huge glasses, a sweatband, and huge headphones, Olive doesn't care that she and her family are odd, she only wants to do LMS, and is the only genuinely happy person in the family.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a great film that I think most people can enjoy.  Even if you claim not to like indie films, Steve Carrell alone is worth the ticket price.  I will say that his performance here is like nothing he's done before, but he is great playing this new kind of character.  Little Miss Sunshine did well at Sundance, and it earned every award it got.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Little Miss Sunshine", the new independent comedy, is that rare thing. A comedy that works. And works consistently. It is a delightful film filled with memorable performances, in one case, the actor's best performance. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this gem. You should rush out to see it.<br /><br />Sheryl (Toni Collette) hurries to the hospital to pick up her brother, Frank (Steve Carell). The doctor would prefer he stay there, but they don't have the insurance to pay for his recovery. Frank just lost his job, his apartment and his boyfriend, so he tried to commit suicide. As he later observes, yet another failure. Sheryl brings him to the family home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He will share a room with Dwayne (Paul Dano), Sheryl's teenaged son who is in month 9 of a self-enforced vow of silence. He later tells his uncle, through a written note, he isn't talking because he hates everyone. Uncle and nephew have to share a room together; Frank can't be left alone and there isn't room anywhere else in the crowded house. Sheryl's second husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), a budding Dr. Phil, preaches his `revolutionary' "9 Steps To Success" program to half empty community college classrooms as he waits for a big book contract. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) also lives with the family, after his eviction from the retirement community, preferring to live out his last years as he wants, having sex, doing drugs and saying whatever he wants. Sheryl and Richard's little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a budding beauty queen and spends every available moment with Grandpa working on her routine for any upcoming beauty contest. One night, they receive a call. Olive will be able to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach. That means one thing. The family is going on a road trip.<br /><br />"Little Miss Sunshine", written by Michael Arndt (his first film) and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who previously worked on music videos for REM and Janet Jackson), is a delightful comedy. It creates genuine moments of laughter and also manages to tell a touching story. Every single moment seems to fit with every other moment, so if you aren't laughing during a particular scene, there is a very believable reason for this. "Sunshine" is all the more amazing because it is the first film from these people to hit the multiplex screens. The film is rolling out slowly and will add new screens each week. Keep an eye out for it.<br /><br />"Sunshine" caused a bit of a stir at the last Sundance Film Festival. After screenings, Fox eventually paid $10.5 million for the distribution rights, a lot of money to pay for a film at Sundance, but they clearly saw something special in it.<br /><br />The key to this film is that it was initially made outside of the studio system. The directors, writers and actors were free to create a film as they saw fit, how they felt it worked. I guarantee you the creative process was a lot more streamlined because they had fewer people to add their two cents and `suggest' changes and fiddle with the end product. The writer and directors have created a lively, interesting, funny film about a family falling apart at the seams. The opportunity for Olive to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant serves as an opportunity to bring them together, but there is too much bad history in their lives. The road trip brings them together, to a certain degree, but also serves to naturally expose their problems to an even greater degree. In a studio film, we would most likely see the family members make some sort of phony resolution. In "Sunshine", the story progresses naturally to its surprising conclusion. Yes, I know it seems odd to say natural and surprising in the same sentence, but it works in this film. Once we see what is happening in the resolution, everything just fits. Its hilarious, but human and we can honestly say the family does the right thing.<br /><br />The majority of "Sunshine" takes place during the family's road trip from New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California in an old yellow VW bus. As they travel along the highway, watching every penny, much of the humor derives from their close, confined proximity. The film also manages to revisit comedy bits, using the same joke, but making it slightly different each time. This makes us all the more receptive to the laughter because we are able to anticipate when a laugh might be coming, yet the filmmakers change it and make it unexpected, making it even more funny.<br /><br />The cast is universally excellent. Toni Collette is very good as Sheryl, the mother of the family. She is the least funny of the group, but her role is invaluable, she is the glue holding the group together. She makes sure everyone is moving together, trying to keep everyone on the same page, yet she is a modern day mom and is pulled in many directions at once. Rushing from her job to the hospital, she walks in to see her brother still wearing her work uniform. She didn't have time to change or even think about it. On the way home, she picks up dinner, a bucket of fried chicken and all of the sides. As the family sits down to dinner, she plops a salad on the table and starts to open a bottle of soda pop, asking if everyone wants some. Throughout, she provides support and encouragement, but isn't beyond having an argument or a disagreement with her family.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is also very good as Richard, the budding self-help guru. This is easily Kinnear's best performance to date. Richard is always living his self-help program and finds it difficult to turn the switch on or off when he is dealing with his family. In one hilarious scene, he starts to impose his self-help teachings on young Olive, as the family sits at a diner, enjoying breakfast. Despite the warnings from everyone at the table, he continues to persist, slipping little comments in. As we learn more about his character, we begin to see little cracks in his armor; he seems awfully desperate for that book deal to happen, he seems like he will crack at any moment due to problems with the car. It is a funny, funny performance showing a man at the edge of his rope.<br /><br />Steve Carell is, as always, very funny. Frank is a man with little to hope for, so he is very low key. Yet, he isn't beyond telling anyone and everyone that he is the Number One Proust Scholar in the Country, despite he no longer holds a position as a professor. Even without the job, I guess the title still holds. It is also amusing to find that his rival, the Number Two Proust Scholar in the Country is the catalyst of Frank's current problems. Through much of the film, Frank stares at his family like they are aliens from another planet. How did he get himself into this situation? Then there are moments when he simply can't take it anymore and responds in a sarcastic fashion to a family member's ramblings.<br /><br />Paul Dano is very good as Dwayne, the sullen teenager who hates everyone in his family. His role is very difficult because he doesn't speak for a long period, everything he experiences has to register in his facial expressions and body language. Naturally, as a teenager, he doesn't emote a lot, but when he does, we feel it. He seems real, interesting, unusual and believable.<br /><br />Alan Arkin is easily the star of the group. As Grandpa, he has a lot of habits that he doesn't feel the necessity to cover up. He talks openly and frankly about sex, imploring Dwayne to have sex with as many women as possible, he's young, and he should be having a lot of sex, experiment. He also has less acceptable habits involving drugs, but he doesn't really care to hide those very much either. Because he is so frank and open, he almost becomes a sort of Greek chorus, providing a reality check for all of the madness his family creates.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is a real find as Olive, the little girl who has a dream of becoming a beauty queen. She is simply perfect as a child who is sheltered, yet inquisitive. When her Uncle Frank arrives, she asks about his situation and after a little bit of a disagreement, he tells her. Yet, because she doesn't fully understand, it doesn't really bother her.<br /><br />When the family finally arrives at the pageant, Olive is nervous because she is about to fulfill a lifelong dream. Yet, she is also entirely uninhibited and doesn't realize how different she is from the freakish Jon Benet Ramsey look-a-likes she is competing against. Olive is an endearing character and Breslin does a great job.<br /><br />Do I really need to say more? Hasn't this love letter already convinced you?<br /><br />Go already. Buy your ticket.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Here they come now. One is wearing a 'Jesus was wrong' t-shirt while his eyes burn with hatred for everything around him, another is a suicidal scholar who is still getting over a failed relationship, and their leader: a self-help guru who just can't seem to help himself. These are some of the faces that make up the Hoover clan as they attempt to get their yellow van moving back down the highway by first pushing it. Their destination  is the Little Miss Sunshine competition in Redondo Beach,  California.<br /><br />Olive, the young, slightly overweight daughter of the Hoovers who has earned a spot in the competition, is the principle character here. She seems to be the force that brings this eclectic family unit together, and it is through her that all the members of the Hoover family find commonality and loyalty toward once another.<br /><br />Perhaps the wittiest film of 2006, Little Miss Sunshine is at times vulgar and will make you squirm a bit, but the subject matter is all about the fine trimmings of family and the message is clear during the last, nutty segments of the film, "Family is family, and you've only got one, so get over your differences and DANCE, baby!"</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>Dysfunctional family + road trip = Hollywood gold<br /><br />In all seriousness, this independent film surprised many.

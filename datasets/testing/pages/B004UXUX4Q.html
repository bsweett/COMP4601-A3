Clooney has made quite a few good films in the last several years and I am glad to see that he is not loosing his stream.  His performance is wonderful, but movie itself falls a little short.<br /><br />It is a story about the man who is native Hawaiian and lives somewhat modest life compared to the wealth he inherited.  He is a lawyer, specializing in real estate in charge of the land trust that his family owns.  On the surface is life is perfect: he has nice law practice, wife and two daughters.  One day tragedy hits home and his wife ends up in a coma.  It is during her hospitalization that he discovers she had a well kept secret from him that changes his entire outlook on life, marriage and family.<br /><br />Like any encounter with death, family members need closure with the person that is dying.  This family goes through that process with close family members, friends and grief councelors. No matter how difficult the truth is for this man who is loosign his wife of nearly 20 years, he pulls through it and carries on with whatever is left.  It is the story of endurance, during most difficult times and story of a family capable of finding their peace once the trauma of loosing one of their own is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This "dramedy" (a comedy with dramatic moments) was well received by the critics, attaining  an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture - Drama and Best Actor - Drama for George Clooney (the main character of this picture). It won a number of lesser known awards so I'm not kidding when I tell you the critics loved it.<br /><br />So what's it about? Focus on Hawaii and a guy named Matt (Clooney) who runs a steady real estate law practice and is also the executor for a huge chunk of land worth millions to developers. It has been in the family for generations (hence the title) and most of Matt's relatives want to sell the land and make millions. Matt is going along with it but part of him wonders if they're doing a disservice to later generations in the family.<br /><br />But the real catalyst is when Matt's wife has a major boating accident and is in the hospital with a coma and Matt believes she is going to come out of it and then the doctor tells him it isn't going to happen and he needs to tell the whole family that she will be dead soon. That's when the poignant moments come into this movie which are most likely the major reason it was so well received by the critics. Add to that a dysfunctional family with secrets and you start to see everything unravel but you also get these strange moments where you can't help laughing or maybe laughing but still feeling their pain. At one point Matt tells his eldest daughter that their mother isn't going to make it (he does it clumsily at best) and the daughter submerges into the pool holding her breathe and the camera spends an inordinate amount of time focused on her facial grief. She comes up out of the pool and starts to walk away from her father not wanting to share her pain with a family member you would think she would want to do so with but that just reinforces the dysfunctional actions of this family.<br /><br />Minor spoiler coming up so stop reading if you want to go in totally blind and already know you will see this picture. Matt's eldest daughter, who is at that difficult teenager/young adult transition, tells him that his wife was cheating on him with some real estate agent (she doesn't known his name or location). As to be expected this sends Matt into an emotional meltdown and you get to see him in this undignified moment in which he's running in his boat shoes down a road to confront the best friend of his wife to find out who the cheater is and where he lives. What follows is a journey with his two daughters and a guy friend of the eldest named Sid to confront the real estate man but to also come to terms with their grief, unsaid words to the mother/wife in a coma and their overall place in the universe. This is a definite soul searching movie on several levels. People who watch this casually and don't appreciate the poignant moments will wonder what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Sid is arguably and surprisingly the closest echo character to Matt. There are a few moments of clarity in which they have these revealing conversations. That said, he's kind of an insensitive jerk at times so I enjoyed it when he got face punched by Matt's father-in-law. The eldest daughter lashes out in her rage at times, especially towards what her mother has done to the family, and the youngest daughter knows something is wrong so she goes off into dramatic situations to get attention.<br /><br />Themes about forgiveness versus vengeance when your spouse cheats on you are obvious. What type of person would you be and the film suggests you really do not know until it happens. Additionally, there's a definite thematic focus on how weird family can sometimes get with large sums of money as well as how a family can still be a family even though it's noticeably dysfunction (if the psychological stats are correct well over half of American families are dysfunctional).<br /><br />Based on a novel of the same name by  Kaui Hart Hemmings. The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office. Clooney's performance, subtle at times, pumps up the quality of this picture.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SCENERY: B plus; THEMES/FOCUSES: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This is not a happy film, and there is no Hollywood-esque upbeat ending. As such, this family tale is not likely to be a big hit. Clooney's intelligence in his choice of films is obvious, and this one is a cut above most Hollywood fare. It's a film about dysfunctional people. The mom spends the entire thing in a coma, looking more and more corpse-like. Great acting there! The kids are better than usual. Actually, the best thing here is the soundtrack of genuine Hawaiian music. I'm going to look into getting it. It is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In the tradition of "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Ordinary People," "The Descendants" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.<br /><br />Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.<br /><br />With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial moviemaking. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.<br /><br />This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.<br /><br />With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.<br /><br />A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, "The Descendants" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I'd read Kaui Hart Hemmings' excellent novel once I heard that it was Alexander Payne's newest project.  It seemed the perfect Payne vehicle: small enough to tell in whole without stripping out key parts (it's notable that Hart Hemmings' work started its life as a short story), featuring a flawed (though not deeply) protagonist at the heart of the story.  Piling this success on top of 'Election,' 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways,' I can only say: this guy needs to work more.  I can't believe that he waited seven years after the brilliance of 'Sideways' to deliver another gem like 'The Descendants.'<br /><br />George Clooney has never been better than he is here as Matt King (though I thought his work in the title role as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014B8KSI">Michael Clayton</a> was superb).  He is (as widely quoted in the trailer) 'the backup parent.'  Now, with his family suddenly reeling from a tragic event, King is thrust to the forefront - primary caretaker of two daughters who grew up quickly under his nose - right at a critical professional juncture in which he needs to make a critical decision about his family's stake in large swathes of Hawaiian lands held under their trust and jurisdiction.  How King (and Clooney) handles those two rapidly evolving matters is the crux of the story.<br /><br />Whenever you read a book and then see the movie, you can't help but compare...<br /><br />What I liked...<br /><br />Shailene Woodley - She is stunningly good as older daughter Alexandra.  It's an awesome portrayal.  She's supposed to be model beautiful (check), a bit of a screw-up in her past (the movie gives a nod to that) and - to her father's surprise - a lot tougher and mature than he thought at event's outset.  In every scene with Clooney (and there are many of them), she's every bit his equal as a presence<br /><br />Hawaii - Hart Hemmings' is Hawaiian, so she doesn't spend a lot of time discussing what makes Hawaii Hawaiian.  Payne needs to do that for his wider audience.  He does so deftly - at the opening in King's voice over in which he tells you that living in Hawaii is not like living in paradise (they have their own concerns like everyone else), in a scene in which they go to look at their property "for one last time," in the houses and neighborhoods he shows (most modestly middle class).  This is the Hawaii of its residents, not its tourists.<br /><br />Other casting nuggets - Laird Hamilton as Troy (sounding reedy and borderline pathetic as you would expect someone in that situation)...brilliant choice; author Hart Hemmings tucked into a little Easter Egg as Matt's secretary...loved that; Matthew Lillard (Shaggy!) as Brian Speer...an unexpected choice, but pulled off very well indeed (his frozen face when confronted with King is perfect); Judy Greer as Julie Speer (was Payne casting due to the name rhyming?)...always a scene-stealer in supporting roles, she's great here again<br /><br />Pushing the the wife's story into the background - Here was the major script choice made by Payne: in the book, we come to know a lot more about Matt's wife (she's 'Joanie' in the book, 'Elizabeth' on screen).  We learn that she and Matt were vastly different.  The boating accident that put Joanie in the hospital is very representative of the way she lived her life: loud and and way up on the risk-o-meter.  One passage the stuck with me in the book.  A restauranteur tells him that he "liked when Joanie came because her presence encouraged everyone to drink more."  We learn about Joanie's personality in Matt's remembrances (the book is first-person from his perspective).  Payne could have done the same by going back in time and showing them together as a couple.  He chose not to do that.  I think the movie is better for it.  First, he's got two hours to tell a story that unfolded in print over almost 300 pages.  Second, the movie works better with Matt needing to go it alone...he can't be helped by his wife. Her near-lifeless presence brings that home.<br /><br />What I didn't like...<br /><br />Matt and Joanie/Elizabeth's relationship - They're depicted here as having been mutually unhappy (the words "ask you for a divorce" are mentioned at least three times).  In the book, it's more nuanced.  They were, right from the start, very different.  But Joanie "always came home with me."  It was a marriage of opposites that - despite what outsiders might have seen and felt - worked.  Or, rather, always had.  That's why the revelation about his wife and Speer stung so deeply.<br /><br />Sid - In the book, Alex's friend Sid is a steady stream of surprise to Matt.  He writes him off at the outset as shallow.  Turns out, he's anything but.  In movie, there's a hint of that.  In the book, it's better: it's Sid that calls Julie Speer to the hospital.  In the movie, Julie says she could "smell it on [Brian]" (after Matt and Alex's visit). In the book, she relates that "Sid told me.  He called the house yesterday."  Matt's response: "Sid," I say.  Well."  You can feel Matt's respect go up immensely with that one small scene.  I liked that Sid was instrumental in letting that key moment come to pass.<br /><br />All in all, those are small quibbles.  I heartily recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>I remember about seven years ago when video rental stores were still in their prime and I frequented Hollywood Video instead of Netflix when I picked up Sideways on a whim, brought it home, and thoroughly enjoyed it but never really had the chance to talk to anybody about it. It was long before I started reviewing movies and most of my friends have the typical guy taste in movies: if there isn't a ton of nudity, blood and violence, or explosion of some kind in the first ten minutes then they essentially get bored with it and fall asleep or turn it off without giving it a proper chance. So I kind of felt like I was this closet Sideways fan for years. Up until The Descendants, it was actually the only Alexander Payne directed film I've had the chance to see as well. With that said, I'm also not the biggest George Clooney fan. His pretentiousness in real life seems to have crossed over into many of his performances and my favorite memories from his acting resume are mostly Seth Gecko from From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Sparky and Dr. Gouache from "South Park". There have obviously been better movies of his since then (O Brother, Where Art Thou? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Up In the Air, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are personal favorites), but none have spoken to me the way Seth Gecko did. There has already been quite a lot of Academy Award talk with The Descendants, but Clooney's roles always seem to be associated with The Oscars so that wasn't too surprising. However The Descendants proved to not only be one of Clooney's best on-screen performances but is also one of the best 2011 has to offer.<br /><br />Visually speaking, The Descendants is extraordinary. It's filmed in Hawaii after all, so it's kind of difficult to make it look bad. The scenery is almost overly-beautiful even though much of the film is overcast Hawaii's green landscapes and clear ocean water makes nearly every scene visually striking. Even when it's raining you can't help but feel the urge to visit this amazing place or return there if you've been fortunate enough to have gone to Hawaii before. There's also a staircase scene where we're looking down at Clooney while he's climbing stairs that caught my eye while he narrates about his life which mostly revolves around trying to fix a broken marriage. It sounds so simple on paper, but it's one of those scenes where the camera was in the right place at the right time and makes something so brief memorable.<br /><br />This is easily the most emotional George Clooney has ever been in one of his performances, as well. He's on the brink of a breakdown the entire film and while I would've liked to have seen something a bit more expressive especially after the hype for "his first on-screen breakdown," what we do receive is still really emotional and heartfelt. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also fantastic as Matt King's (Clooney) children. They provide many of the laughs a good portion of the film and show they're also fully capable of displaying what feels like sincere sorrow and emotion. That's one of the best things about The Descendants; it provides plenty of hilarious laugh-out-loud moments but also isn't afraid to show you more tender moments that tug at your heartstrings. Alexandra's (Woodley) friend Sid (Nick Krause) is very entertaining, as well. His scenes in the car and at Elizabeth's (Patricia Hastie) parents' house are some of the greatest the film has to offer. Matt's friends Mark (Rob Huebel) and Kai Mitchell (Mary Birdsong) are also a highlight. Mark provides some really hilarious one-liners while Kai is obviously a very devoted friend to Matt's wife Elizabeth.<br /><br />There are little to no faults to be found in the film. The entire cast delivers, the story unravels in a very pleasing fashion, and the film is magnificently shot. There's very little to be unhappy with. Even the Hawaiian music was a high spot. While I'm not the biggest fan of foreign music, this was generally very soothing featuring Hawaiian lyrics accompanied by guitar or ukulele plucking. The one thing that might come off as kind of silly is the Matthew Lillard kitchen scene being fairly reminiscent of the ending to Scream, but that was more humorous than anything.<br /><br />I'm sure it differentiates a bit from critic to critic, but for me the best movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, engrossing storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels genuine and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his absolute best and it's safe to say that Alexander Payne has outdone himself. The Descendants is chaotic, charming, hilarious, and emotional. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>THE DESCENDANTS got a lot of press around awards time, and it deserved none of the accolades it received. I don't know if critics thought they had to like it since it came from Oscar winning director Alexander Payne, or if it was because it started Hollywood Golden Boy George Clooney, or if it because it had a nice, sweet, anti-business message. For whatever reason, critics got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this movie is a total bore, except for Sid (Nick Krause) and possibly Julie Speer (Judy Greer), the slacker boyfriend, because the story is a good one.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A man (Matt King, Clooney) is caring for his wife who is in a coma. He discovers she was cheating on him. She is going to die. King has to cope with losing his wife, and never getting to confront her about her cheating. He also gets a chance to meet the man who she was cheating with. The movie had all sorts of opportunities to create a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Or, it could have gone darker and crafted a story of revenge and bitterness. Instead, it takes the approach of apathy. I'm not saying King or his two daughters (the non-entity Scotty, or the foul mouthed, cute 18-year old Alex) don't care about their mom or her cheating ways. I'm saying that the viewers have no reason to care. Perhaps one of the reason I cared so little is because of the stupid side story about the descendants. It seems King and his numerous cousins have descended from Hawaiian royalty and they face a big decision on who they should sell some property to and make millions. That story line added nothing to the plot.<br /><br />If this movie hadn't been lauded as one of the best of the year, I would have enjoyed it. Instead, I'm tired of watching movies Hollywood claims to be good and being bored out of my mind.  I remember reading a story about Matthew Lillard, who plays the man the wife cheats with, Brian Speer. It made it sound like his part mattered in the movie. But it didn't. He was hardly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie. It doesn't matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>When Matt King (George Clooney)'s wife goes into a coma, he realizes how distant he was from her and from his two daughters.  Then he learns his wife was cheating on him.<br /><br />George Clooney plays against type as a clueless father and husband with baggy eyes and a beaten-down face.  He slouches through the story and generally looks pretty ordinary. He's good in the role, but not good enough to save the movie.  My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's off-putting, to say the least.  Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles.  Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast.  And lastly, I didn't like or care about any of the characters.<br /><br />The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and it represents unvarnished reality, but it's just not my idea of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A story about being set adrift and trying to find your way back to life. Fine performances across the board with some characters developing unanticipated connections and unexpected depth. Not tremendous depth, but more than is apparent at first meeting. Still, the movie treads a lot of familiar territory with only slight diversions that don't go too far astray from the expected and with a few slightly exotic problems - just right for making a holiday movie-going crowd feel like they were challenged but safe while still delivering an above average film and a great cast for those who want more than safe holiday fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voiceover by the protagonist: "Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing." I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a> in 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a> in shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.<br /><br />It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>This is a serious ambitious movie about relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children, peers-- and it deserves credit for the attempt. It also has pathos and wit. Its themes is seemingly unconditional forgiveness and tolerance but that seems at times unreal and sentimental. The extended deathbed scenes also get too close to schmalz at times. There is also the irrelevant Sierra club type of stupid decision NOT to develop a choice piece of real estate.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>I cried off and on throughout this movie, and I am not usually one to appreciate that (I prefer movies that offer escapism) but in this case it was worth it to me. This movie is just so well-written and acted that I was willing to go through the experience. And in a way it is about anti-escapism, set as it is in Hawaii, with George Clooney's character bitterly noting in the opening voiceover that his friends on the mainland think his life must be heaven, living in paradise as he does, but don't they realize that people still suffer, and break each other's hearts, and die?<br /><br />For those who don't know, the plot of this movie (although 'plot' is not quite the right word) is that Clooney's character's wife is in a coma, and soon to be dead. He has to deal with this, and the reality of their troubled marriage which he will now never get to save, along with explaining it to his troubled daughters, ages 10 and 17, other family members, and friends. There is also a backstory involving valuable land his family owns, and is considering selling. I don't want to give everything away, but the essence is that this is a rich and quirky cast of characters, where no one is perfect and everyone is struggling to understand what is happening and how to connect, and forgive.<br /><br />The writing, the acting, the tone and the filming are all exactly right. It's a real film about real people, with no special effects, and grounded in the realities of life - both the harshest and most beautiful realities - and that makes it very special, and well-worth the praise it has received.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Descendants" is a great movie about a man named Matt King (George Clooney) whose wife is in a coma after a boating accident. Because he's always been kind of a hands-off dad, Matt is unsure of how to relate to his two daughters, 10-year old pretentious Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old troublemaker Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He's also thrown for a loop when his eldest daughter reveals that his wife had been having an affair before her accident. Matt has to cope with the cold hard facts about his marriage, coupled with his wife's grave condition and the toll this is taking on his family. In addition, Matt's family is pressuring him to sell a large sum of land that their ancestors passed down to them, which is located along the beautiful Hawaaiian coastline. The debate over the land has unexpected connections to Matt's personal situation, and the poor guy has to somehow figure everything out on his own.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Matt King is George Clooney's best role, but it;s definitely one of them. He delivers a moving performance as a man who is completely broken, yet forcing himself to keep it together for the sake of his two kids. I was also very pleased with Woodley's performance as Matt's teenage daughter. Hers is a very complex role, and the young actress tackles it with grace and honesty. The film itself is incredibly well-done, though extremely depressing. I'm glad I saw the film and I definitely recommend it, though it won't be one of those movies that I'm dying to watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.<br /><br />Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt.  Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami! Grady Harp, March 12</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>It seems hard to believe that it's been seven years since Alexander Payne's "Sideways" became the critical darling of 2004. Nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winning Payne an Adapted Screenplay Oscar--that picture (along with Election and About Schmidt) signaled a talented filmmaker with an unorthodox worldview. Blending elements of comedy and drama, Payne has crafted complex characters simultaneously frustrating and sympathetic--but altogether real. In adapting Kaui Hart Hemmings' intimate novel "The Descendants" to the big screen, Payne demonstrates (once again) a deft balance of emotions to create a picture both funny and heartbreaking. I so admired how Payne made vineyards and fine wines a major component, an extra character really, in the sublime "Sideways." In much the same way, Hawaii is a principle character (and I would contend one of the most pivotal) to "The Descendents." It would be easy to imagine someone jettisoning much of this rich texture, but Payne has crafted a loving tribute to the state's heritage in addition to one of the year's most surprising family dramas.<br /><br />George Clooney plays one of the titular descendants, someone whose family has great historical significance to the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, he and his many cousins own a great tract of undeveloped land that plays a major role in the film's fascinating side story. Front and center, however, is a more personal tale of family dysfunction and pulling together in crisis. When Clooney's somewhat estranged wife is incapacitated in an accident, Clooney must take charge of his troublesome teenage daughter (an astute Shailene Woodley) and his rebellious younger girl (an appealingly unexpected Amara Miller). With mom in a coma, Clooney is left to do his best to reconnect with the girls that he hasn't made enough time for. While this seems to be leading to some routine comic hijinks, the film takes a decidedly more serious turn as Clooney learns about his wife's true feelings. The rest of the movie walks the tightrope about how he and his daughters can channel these revelations and emerge stronger for it. And the film runs the gamut of emotions with anger, betrayal, love, and regret sharing equal time as the family embarks on a tumultuous journey together.<br /><br />While I know this makes the film sound like a bit of a downer, there is much humor to be enjoyed as well. While I'm confident that many will reveal far more about the plot than I am willing to, I think that it is best to let the story unravel without expectation. This is very much an in-depth character study. As such, Clooney has one of his most rewarding roles. He goes through a lot, but he maintains a subtlety that always keeps the picture grounded (even in its more extreme elements). Woodley is a revelation and this is as far a departure from TV's "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" as she's likely to experience. I'm confident we'll be seeing more of her. Miller has a real ease and provides many well placed laughs and a few tears as well. Perhaps the film's biggest secret weapon is Nick Krause playing Woodley's friend. As a laconic and laid back surfer dude, Krause's scenes with Clooney have real impact. As an odd source of wisdom and support, he is a unique character in this piece.<br /><br />"The Descendants," at the end of the day, is a quiet and thoughtful film. The film never plays up the huge emotional moments or strains for melodrama. It simply lets the characters exist as complex creations, with all their foibles and flaws in evidence. Its understated power, therefore, is all the more successful as it feels patently real. A treat for adult movie goers, 4 1/2 stars.

The writing and the entire cast are great. I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but his work in Up in the Air and The Descendants has totally made me a believer in his acting talents when given the right material. The girl who plays his oldest daughter is very good as well.

Just about all his cousins want the deal; they'll get a lot of money. But his wife has an accident and now is on life support. He has to learn how to be a parent to his young daughters. And then to learn to live knowing that his wife was sleeping around with a real estate agent and had plans to divorce him.<br /><br />Not much on the politics of family financial tugging but a lot on one family learning how to live with each other. Clooney keeps it from becoming a daytime soap serial. The self-discovery portions (there's a lot of them) are mostly wry and often affecting. No big-time movie star aura from Clooney and he's not afraid to make his character (and himself) look a bit silly at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>this movie is just very average.  the story seems a bit forced many times and it tries to twist a few emotions out of you but there is never really any depth or anything to feel a conviction about in the story.  it feels like it's trying to push buttons from the formulas from other stories (wow, that was a mixed metaphor).  the whole hawaii setting never felt like a good match to me either.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>We kick off this week with an Oscar-winner, made by and starring previous Oscar-winners, and though The Descendants only took home one of the five trophies for which it was nominated, most still agree it's a thoughtful drama worth watching. Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and directed by Academy Award-winner Alexander Payne, The Descendants is funny, moving, and beautifully acted. Shailene Woodley, playing Matt's older daughter, also deserves kudos and the supporting cast is solid all-around.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Matt King (George Clooney) is a wealthy land-owner in Hawaii, approaching a big land-sale deal.  At the same time, Matt receives word that his comatose wife has no hope of survival, and that by her own instructions, the plug is to be pulled.  Matt finds himself the guardian of a rebellious ten-year-old daughter (Amara Miller), and seeks out his other daughter, an equally rebellious teenager (Shailene Woodley).  The latter informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, and while on a journey to inform her family of what is happening, Matt decides to seek out this other man.<br /><br />It's a rather complex plot, actually, layered with deep character development and details.  Director/screenwriter Alexander Payne holds everything together marvelously; this is a beautifully crafted, beautifully shot film.  What truly breathes life into THE DESCENDANTS, however, is Payne's way with his actors.  The film rests squarely on the shoulders of George Clooney; while at times ripping off his mannerisms from UP IN THE AIR (the narration doesn't help), Clooney ultimately delivers a very nuanced, very natural performance that probably deserved the 2012 Best Acting Oscar (but we all knew Jean Dujardin would win, didn't we?  Yes, we did.)  Woodley matches Clooney step-for-step, in what will be regarded as her breakthrough performance.  Miller also gives a solid performance (I've ranted about child actors before; there's no need to rant about Miller).  Robert Forster gives a memorable performance at Matt's father-in-law, while Matthew Lillard takes a nice dramatic turn as "the other man" (with Judy Greer as his wife).  Nick Krause provides some fantastic comedic moments as Sid, a teenage suitor.<br /><br />And that's the great thing about THE DESCENDANTS: even at its darkest, saddest moments, it doesn't forget to be funny.  Because humor can be found anywhere, and Payne and company aren't afraid to show you.  Some viewers may be put off by the fact that a movie about a family coping with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.  Payne has found the perfect material, and the perfect cast, to create a tale of humor and tragedy.  It doesn't hurt that this is, quite simply, an amazing film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>A man is having the worst time of his life whilst dealing with a wife in coma, a ten year old daughter and another seventeen year old daughter who're all relentless and unforgiving towards him. For Clooney who plays the man things are unraveling faster than he can possibly catch his breath. The Descendants is one of those films that come once in a way and they have the discerning eclipsing element of moving you with just srark reality.<br /><br />Not a single friend of mine agreed to go for this film with me. The ones who'd already seen the film seemed to have forewarned others about the film's lack of entertainment. It seems people don't go to the films anymore in search for what I would term as the truest form of a drama. Anyway, so I had to see this film at home and I really loved it. I knew I wanted to watch this film when I heard the reviews (same exact words from all my friends)<br /><br />My favourite scene involves the protagonist running senselessly as if it his sense of dignity he is running after. The Descendants with it's uniquely executed well studied storyline seemed to be an imperative formula I thought despite it's DARK sense of humor that may stump most viewers.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful study of superficiality and on a side note it was also interesting to watch how well the director Alexander Payne managed to catch the sheer ungratefulness of rich kids who've inherited a large wealth. The emotion or lack of is captured masterfully in a scene or two.<br /><br />Overall, Clooney acted so well, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets the nod for the best actor in lead role.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>"The Descendants" is going to be a really big disappointment to people who think that life should mirror the kind of interactions you see on "Jerry Springer" or that every movie should include gun fights or car chases. I'll go ahead and drop this spoiler: there is hardly a whiff of any of the above.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawai'i whose family is partially descended from King Kamehameha. Although they're now "about as Haole as you can get", the family still has the rights to a beautiful and large tract of prime real estate on Kaua'i. As the movie opens the family is contemplating a big decision: the rest of the family are not successful Honolulu lawyers and selling the land will set up the rest of the family nicely.<br /><br />But the real estate plot plays in the background for the main storyline. As the film opens Matt's wife is in a coma that occurred in a boating accident off Waikiki. The Doctor tells Matt in the opening scene that it is hopeless - Elizabeth King shows no evidence of brain activity and her living will instructs everyone to discontinue life support. The Doctor tells Matt to let everyone know so they can say good-bye.<br /><br />This begins an emotional Odyssey for Clooney's character. There are two King Daughters: Ten year old Scottie, played by Amara Miller, who is acting out and having difficulty at school after Mom's accident, and seventeen year old Alexandra, played by Shailene Woodley, who was apparently having difficulty before the accident. Alex has been shipped to a boarding school and she is none too eager to reconcile with Dad or cut Mom any slack just because of a little coma. Robert Forster is realistically gruff and bitter as the father of comatose Elizabeth - he blames Matt for being a neglectful husband - driving Elizabeth to the thrill-seeking lifestyle that resulted in the accident.<br /><br />In his quest to let family and friends know they need to say their final farewells to wife Elizabeth, Matt discovers information that causes a seismic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.<br /><br />In this portion of the film special notice goes to Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh who represents the "you're not going to let down the WHOLE FAMILY are you, Matt?" side of the King clan, and Nick Krause as Alex's friend Sid, who shows that in Hawai'i, where type A personalities are as hard to find as a snowstorm, you can't always judge a person's intelligence by their appearance or demeanor. Sid looks like any of the Beach Bums on the North Shore, but in a few telling scenes he offers Matt invaluable insight.<br /><br />Clooney well-deserves his Oscar nomination for his performance. Matt was never a man of action, and in this film there are a few moments where he specifically chooses NOT to act. In the audience we can see his pain, and we know there are times that a lesser, more vindictive person would have escalated the proceedings with a "Springer-Style" knock-down drag-out. But this isn't that kind of movie, and I'm grateful to have not been dragged into the viewing mud.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I looked at some of the other Amazon reviews and noticed some viewers found this film boring.  I am not one of them. The film is about a middle aged man who is in crisis because he has life altering decisions and events to face.  This character is played by George Clooney.  Some people when faced with immense land holdings in one of the richest real estate markets on earth, Hawaii, would be wastrels.  Not him.  He is an attorney who supports himself even though he has final power in a trust that involes huge land holdings which came from the original family.  Although these descendants all look white now, way back on his maternal end, there was a full Hawiaan great grandmother who was the heiress,<br /><br />What he is facing is that all of his relatives want to sell the land and he has that power under the trust.  They do not. Also, his wife was in a boating accident, ended up in a coma and now lays dying in a vegatative state.  She has signed a living will which everyone is honoring. He has two daughters who also must be brought into the picture.  They think she's going to recover.<br /><br />In the midst of all of the above, his older daughter tells him his wife was having an affair.  He decides to find the guy and tell him what has happened.  The guy is a real estate agent who stands to make a fortune if the land deal goes through,<br /><br />None of this is played at a melodramatic level.  It unfolds as it would likely unfold in real life, mostly very quietly.  Clooney does a wonderful job.  This is where we all live at some point, where there are decisions and events that will follow us until our days wind down.<br /><br />There is a small role of the dying wife's father which is really fantastic.  Everyone has experienced this kind of person.  Given the bad news of his daughter's coming death, his sole reaction from there to the end is to lash out and blame everyone.else in the family.  He even makes the accident their faults although the wife was with someone else who was driving the boat at the time of her accident. He never lets up, just finds new ways to continue the attack on others as the day of death moves closer.<br /><br />This film has Oscar written all over it and I expect it to do very well at the Oscars.  It already won the Golden Globe for best drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>George Clooney's character, Matt King, is quick to point out that even living on an island paradise doesn't exempt one from exposure to the kinds of messed-up crap that inflict everyone else. Life in its essence is the same for the inhabitants of Hawaii. You just live it wearing colorful shirts, shorts, and sandals. THE DESCENDANTS certainly has its laugh-out-loud bits, but mostly it's a drama about loss and grief and acceptance and all that superfun stuff. And if I were to gauge this film's quality by how often I heard guffaws and sniffles in the theater I went to, then THE DESCENDANTS has earned some big bragging rights. And maybe an Oscar nod for Clooney, and maybe another one for a superb young actress, Shailene Woodley. Both of them anchor the film.<br /><br />Clooney inhabits his role with a thoughtfulness and an intelligence that not too many of his contemporaries could've matched, and every so often he's not afraid to play the fool (did you check out his goofy jogging?). Mostly, attorney Matt King is just trying to keep his head above water, as he juggles several pressing issues. As the sole trustee of the family's highly coveted ancestral land, there's pressure from his sprawling cast of greedy cousins to sell. Matt is also trying to keep his two troubled young daughters in check, never mind that he views himself as the back-up parent. Most painfully, his comatose wife, Elizabeth, had suffered a grave boating accident, and it's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled, in accordance to her living will. And if you've seen the trailer then you know that his foul-mouthed oldest daughter, Alexandra (Woodley), springs a huge shock on him. In one of her frequent raging tantrums, she informs him that his wife had been cheating on him. Because even paradise sees its share of rocky marriages.<br /><br />Clooney's restrained performance is compelling and I love his acting choices, the things that he does and how he expresses his dialogue (and there's plenty of dialogue). But I knew Clooney could act. Shailene Woodley is the revelation. Even more than Clooney, Woodley, angry and conflicted and forceful, provides the story's emotional impact. It's a splendid cast across the board, really, from Amara Miller (who plays Matt's ten-year-old daughter Scotty) to a surprisingly grown-up Matthew Lillard to Judy Greer who is absolutely fantastic as the wife of the man cheating with Elizabeth. Nick Krause steals several scenes as Alexandra's st0ner surfer boyfriend Sid. Sid accompanies the Kings as Matt, Alex, and Scotty go island-hopping in search of the elusive other man in Elizabeth's life. I guess it's one way to cope with the impending loss of a loved one. Sid starts out as this oblivious tool but later demonstrates unexpected levels of insight and loyalty. One of Matt King's voice-over observations is that in Hawaii "the most powerful men look like bums and stunt men." In a tiny but pivotal part, Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's laid back cousins, and it's worth it to see Bridges not missing a beat as he goes from affable to affably menacing.<br /><br />Hawaii provides a picturesque backdrop, and it's maybe jarring that we're watching this sad family affair unfolding on an idyllic island paradise. Or maybe that's the conflicting emotion director Alexander Payne was going for. A certain askewed perception. Grief looks a bit odd when the mourners are always dressed for a barbecue. Ultimately THE DESCENDANTS is frank and honest, and sometimes brutally honest. I like that it doesn't pander or try to be cute. The story runs the gamut of laughter and tears, and there's something rewarding in watching Matt and his kids pull together. Elizabeth, the dying wife and mother, is portrayed as a complicated real person, and not put on a pedestal, or not much, anyway. We become privy to her virtues but also to her faults, and the film suggests that Matt, too, is not without blame. And Payne doesn't shy away from exhibiting the degenerative physical toll exacted on a failing coma patient. Each of Matt's visits to the hospital documents Elizabeth's further wasting away. Which sort of wends back to Matt King's point early on. There's no escaping life; it comes with heavy baggages; and death even in paradise is the great leveler. But it's hard to console yourself with that. Me, I'd probably act out, like Matt's kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A man sees his wife suffer a head injury, and then finds out that she had been unfaithful to him. He then sets out to find out about the man was that had been with his wife, while dealing his difficult children. When complications arise regarding the sale of the family land, due to the wife's affair, the man has an interesting dilemma. That keeps the movie from being simply a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker, and inserts an element of mystery as to how the man will proceed regarding his family's inheritance. This was a realistic look at how a sudden tragedy can impact a family, with some humor sprinkled throughout to keep the audience engaged. This viewer was fully engaged and completely engrossed in the fate of this family. Outstanding performances highlight this one and solidify it as one of the year's top films.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth has been in a coma in the hospital for almost four weeks. She was involved in a boating accident. Also, Matt, one of several descendants of a Hawaiian princess, is the sole trustee of a family trust that controls over 25,000 acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i. Matt must decide for his family what is to be done with the land. At the same time, he's given the news that his wife will never recover and she has a living will, so all the machines will soon be unplugged and she will slowly die. So, Matt has to contact his in-laws and all of his wife's friends and notify them of his wife's impending death so that they can say farewell. In addition, Matt is getting used to raising his daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) by himself. In the midst of all of this, Matt learns that his wife was having an affair for the past two years and decides to find Elizabeth's lover and inform him that she's dying so he can say farewell. Thus begins a mini-journey with his children (and a tag-a-long friend of his daughter, Alex) that brings his family closer together.<br /><br />The film has some really beautiful scenic shots, but when you're filming in Hawaii, that's not too difficult. The movie also features the finest performance of George Clooney's career. Even though Clooney has starred in lots of tv and film, he's best known for his good looks and comic ability (see O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU) and hasn't had many opportunities to display his range as an actor. THE DESCENDANTS gives him plenty of opportunities. It's his best role to date.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS also features the breakout performance of Shailene Woodley. Woodley is a young actress who hasn't had much exposure but THE DESCENDANTS will be her springboard to stardom. She displays the depth of emotion of a person who has lived several lifetimes.<br /><br />Beyond the fine acting, THE DESCENDANTS really doesn't offer much. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, the film has been nominated for and won all kinds of awards and has been listed on numerous critic's "Best Of 2011" lists. I think the main reason for this is because this is an Alexander Payne movie. Make no mistake, Payne is a talented director. I loved ELECTION and SIDEWAYS and even though I find ABOUT SCHMIDT incredibly depressing, it's also fascinating. However, THE DESCENDANTS lacks the life and personality that make those movies so interesting. There are a few really funny scenes in the movie (I don't know why, but watching Clooney run is hilarious), but there's nothing outstanding hilarious. Close to a third of the movie is told in voice-over from King. I don't have an issue with voice-over, but you can't overuse it and it has to be done correctly. THE DESCENDANTS abuses the voice-over. Also, the movie has way too many close-up shots. I realize that it's done for affect, but like the voice-over abuse, the close-up is used way too much in the movie. However, even putting these technical abuses aside, THE DESCENDANTS isn't good movie because it's really not that interesting of a story. The audience is glad to see how things turn out in the end, but it's almost an afterthought. I was looking forward to seeing THE DESCENDANTS, but much like the way I felt after seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK in 2010 my reaction at the end of the movie was, "That's it?"<br /><br />There's some great acting in THE DESCENDANTS, but overall the movie is a tale, "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Nothing new appears in the plot department in "The Descendants". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more "parental" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing.<br /><br />The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, "The Descendants" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows patience and exasperation, -self-control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.<br /><br />For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him, though this "righteous crusade" is somewhat tempered by the fact that Elizabeth may have cheated on him because Matt neglected her in favor of work. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her "sullen teen" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. Therefore, at least and partially for underhanded reasons, they grudgingly get closer, though as the movie progresses, their relationship improves for more honorable ones.<br /><br />As another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.<br /><br />Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.<br /><br />As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doom her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her "Do Not Resuscitate" wishes. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. Hypocritically, Matt even tries to restrain the others' ventings, especially from Brian's wife, as if only he has the right to complain unreservedly against his wife.  Nevertheless the venting eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier and truly genuine.<br /><br />To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the "right" decisions, we often do so for at least partially "wrong" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in "The Descendants".</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Look guys, I did get the movie...it's just, I didn't like it. Alright, I'm not sure if I'm putting it the right way. I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.<br /><br />Actually, I'm not sure if "lots" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.<br /><br />First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.<br /><br />The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.<br /><br />First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.<br /><br />But... The film just bored me.<br /><br />First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming?<br /><br />The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clich&eacute;d in terms of development.<br /><br />Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clich&eacute;s. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself "I think this is going to happen" and -gasp- it does!<br /><br />But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award. Don't kid yourself. This film is really forgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life.

I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.<br /><br />Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.<br /><br />Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.<br /><br />And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.<br /><br />Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.<br /><br />It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>The Descendants is Alexander Payne's first movie since Sideways in 2004.  Much like its predecessor, The Descendants deftly mixes pain and humor with snappy script that won Mr. Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash a best adapted screenplay Oscar.  George Clooney stars as Matt King who is a real estate lawyer in Honolulu and a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  He is the trustee of a family trust that owns 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai that his family is looking to sell before the trust expires.  While this is happening, his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is left in a coma after a boating accident.  He refers to himself as the back-up parent to his two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley).  He now has to step up as a full-time father. After taking Alex home from her private school, she tells him that Elizabeth was having an affair.  This sends Matt's world spiraling even more out of control.  The rest of film deals with Matt trying to find his wife's lover and the selling of the land.  Mr. Clooney shows his versatility as an actor playing Matt as a beaten down man trying to rise to the occasion.  He received a well deserved best actor nomination.  Ms. Woodley is a real find.  She could have played the part as much more of a caricature of a screwed up teen, but she adds real depth to the role.  The scenery as one would expect is gorgeous and the pacing of the film is just right. Let's hope Mr. Payne waits less than seven years before he make another picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>The ` Descendants" chronicles the struggle of a dysfunctional family trying to come in terms with a tragedy and a impending monumental decision. George Clooney is wonderful as he sheds his image of cool and tries to take charge of fatherhood and struggles to keep his family intact.<br />As Matt King ( Clooney) tries to face the death of his wife due to an accident  with his younger daughter Scottie ( Amara Miller) and cope with the rebelliousness of his teen daughter Alexandra. He also has to decide the sale of prime real estate in Hawaii to developer, and the sale is causing his family to become even more hostile. If this is not enough, he comes to realise that his comatose wife was having an affair behind his back. The movie is easy to watch and is lit by wonderful performances by Sid (Nick Krause), Alexandra's friend; Matthew Lillard as Brian, the wife's lover; Judy Greer as Brian's sweet-wife; Robert Forster as Matt's  father-in-law.<br />Alexander Payne, finding his form again after ` Sideways" allows all these people bare their emotions and act wonderfully while doing, amidst the backdrop of beautifully shot Hawaii.<br />Four stars. 4/12/2012</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I didn't really expect this to be noticeably good -- even though it was nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar). But, regardless, I gave it a try; and I'm happy I did. "The Descendants" is one of my absolute favorites of the year! The story is fresh and the acting is superb; Alexander Payne's directing is stellar! It's been a while since I've seen a film that hits all the right marks. Even though there is one small aspect to the film that was predictable, it doesn't subdue the effect of the film's message, nor does it take away from the overall excellence of the film itself. Thank goodness George Clooney chose this film after last year's disastrous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG993Q">The American</a>! And Shailene Woodley (the horrid ABC Family show <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C46L3O">The Secret Life of the American Teenager: Volumes 1-6</a>) dazzles in her first major movie role; I can't wait to see what she does next ... even though it will probably be some dopey teenage comedy. I especially liked the fact that Clooney portrays a father who was not always emotionally present in his family's life and now he is the one to take care of his two unruly daughters, both of whom he has no idea how to raise (welcome to the club of every father with two daughters). This film takes a desperately tragic situation and injects a small dose of comedy in with a touching story of family bonding to make one of the movies you should definitely see!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Drama. Beginning to think I have become so used to TV action, dialogue, that I have trouble taking the pace of a true drama. Liked this film. This drama. Predictable for sure but liked it anyway.

Neither a recommend or no recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I found 'The Descendants' to be quite interesting and touching with a nice performance by George Clooney.  It is somewhat of a family picture as well with no crazy car chases, gun fights or stuff like that.  My only complaint was at the end we were not exactly sure what he did with the land.  Appeared he kept it but then again I left the theatre with that question which I did not like since it really did not bring closure to the film.  Maybe I missed something but I never got bored during the movie so would be hard for me to think I did miss something.  Nonetheless, a very fine picture.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.<br /><br />'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).<br /><br />Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.<br /><br />I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy--it's a film that features a "quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo." The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.<br /><br />When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.<br /><br />Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).<br /><br />Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.<br /><br />'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.<br /><br />I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>The enjoyable, moving "The Descendents" (written and directed by Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings) smartly depicts how a major development in a family- in this case, a tragedy- immediately steamrolls and negates all petty drama and grievances, and quite efficiently illuminates everyone's true colors and true feelings.<br /><br />George Clooney is terrific as Matt King, a marginal parent who all of a sudden is thrust into the role of central parent and responsibility bearer when a boating accident puts his wife Elizabeth into a coma.  Things become more complicated when it becomes clear that Elizabeth isn't going to wake up, and that her legal wishes indicate that she doesn't want to be kept alive via artificial means if a situation like her current one ever arose.<br /><br />Despite the subject matter, the film isn't relentlessly sad.  It's nice to see the strong bond that immediately develops between Matt and his oldest daughter Alexandra (beautifully played by Shailene Woodley), who tosses aside the usual teen issues that drove a wedge between her and her parents in recent years, and starts helping her dad put her mother's affairs in order and prepare for her funeral.<br /><br />And when I use the word "affairs" above, I don't just mean finances and legal stuff.  Matt soon learns from his daughter that he wasn't the only imperfect spouse in their family, though he is shocked to learn exactly what his wife was up to during her last months.<br /><br />With the help of his family, and one or two hangers-on, Matt puts things to rest during the course of the movie, resulting in situations that are funny, sad, moving, sometimes ridiculous, but always very human.  It's interesting that Matt's forgiveness of his wife's infidelity comes fairly early on (though residual anger surfaces here and there), because there's work to be done. Despite what he's learned, he's determined to put his wife to rest with dignity and love, and to honor her memory properly with friends and family.<br /><br />Filling out the movie are some beautiful locations in Hawaii, a quirky subplot involving Matt and Alexandra trying to locate Elizabeth's secret lover (despite their negative feelings about that part of her life, they want to give the guy the opportunity to properly say goodbye to her), and another subplot involving a major land deal being overseen my Matt, which ultimately ties into the movie's theme of identifying what's really important in life.<br /><br />In the end, "The Descendents" is an involving family drama that honestly earns the emotions it brings forth. And, really, don't let the premise scare you off.  You'll likely leave the film feeling upbeat and chatty, ready to discuss the film's humor and humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>People think of The Ides of March as George Clooney's big political film of last year, but this title actually it could be claimed for The Descendants, which is every bit as much about politics, family values, wielding power and the responsibilities of the "one percent," to the degree that I'm amazed Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck didn't denounce it with the usual vitriol they reserve for anything vaguely liberal. The story, based on a book I'm not familiar with, deals with the tension between wanting your rewards now now now and looking out for the future with some present-day self-sacrifice.<br /><br />The selfish side is best represented by the greedy cousins of Matt King, who's played by George Clooney, as well as his suspicious and proudly ignorant father-in-law. (I love the way we learn without his having to tell us that he is probably militantly right-wing: he still sports what looks like his GI haircut, talks in a very "ten-hut!" manner and his first words, looking at the living will, are "Might as well be in Korean," so we know which war he likely fought in, a war that seemed to leave him with at least some PTSD.) This one side of the matter sees issues in very black and white ways and jumps to conclusions, never really listening to the positions King spells out in great detail. King, meanwhile, is the hard-working but absentee father trying to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is fatally injured in a boating accident. (And no, I didn't just give away a spoiler; even though we see Elizabeth King alive and happy in the first shot, we find out ten minutes later that she will never recover from her injuries and must be unplugged from life-support.) Meanwhile, Matt King is far from perfect: his marriage was a wreck long before the movie began, and his own selfish ways have resulted in children who do not respect him (or their mother) and are emotionally adrift.<br /><br />The older daughter is played in a stellar performance by newcomer Shailene Woodley, whom I would have loved to snag a best-supporting actress Oscar. If she continues to get good parts and doesn't wreck her career a la Lohan I think she could become very big. Her subtly-shifting acting as she gets to know and finally bonds with her dad is masterful, and the scenes with Clooney on the vacation as she's helping him track down the man who slept with his wife are the highlight of the film, at least from an acting point of view.<br /><br />But ultimately it's the screenplay that makes The Descendants extraordinary. I hate to be lazy and quote someone else, but Roger Ebert summed up exactly what struck me: "The film follows Matt's legal, family and emotional troubles in careful detail, until [director Alexander] Payne shows us, without forcing it, that they are all coiled together. A solution for one must be a solution for all. This is so much more complex than most movie plots, where good and evil are neatly compartmented and can be sorted out at the end." Amen. This is a nuanced and layered screenplay, something very rare these days. We see characters grow by their actions. Woodley's character initially despises her father, but after a scene in the car where her boyfriend Sid acts snide and immature, she offers to sit up front with him and from then on begins quietly supporting him. And though Sid is childish at the beginning, we learn it's largely a cover (as it is with so many teens) for scars he's borne on his own: later, at a very awkward moment, Sid has the maturity to take everyone in the room to the cafeteria so that Clooney can have some privacy with a jilted spouse. None of this is italicized; it happens very quietly. The one-star Amazon reviewer below me who says this is standard TV fare isn't seeing the forest from the trees while thinking he's being clever. Yes, this is the stuff TV melodramas deal with. No, they almost never deal with it this richly. That's the difference. All the difference in the world.<br /><br />But more interesting is the film's political message, which is oddly both subtle and obvious simultaneously. On the one side are the people who spent their trust money up front, satisfying instant gratifications, and are now broke because of it. They now want to sell the land to a developer who will build resorts or retail stores or whatever, while they sit home and count their newfound money, not caring about what this means for the future. ("Drill, baby, drill!") "When do I get to play here?" the youngest daughter, who's never enjoyed this family land, asks her dad at one point. On the other side is the Clooney character, who lives well, but who also works hard to do so, and understands that happiness is not entirely about money, embodying an outlook a certain political party preaches all the time but rarely practices. I find this sort of "political film" more effective than direct thrillers. This is the perfect vehicle for Clooney, who does a great job with it.<br /><br />The Descendants looks reasonably good, though a little soft, in this DVD transfer. Supplements consist of the theatrical trailer and three bizarre mini-docs. The first, titled "Everybody Loves George," is a fifteen minute love-fest about George Clooney. We learn from his co-actors that he's so funny and talented (he does impressions!) and generous, over and over, until we are ready to barf our pi&ntilde;a coladas. The second doc is even odder: a similar fan-boy treatment of director Alexander Payne, with praise about how brilliant he is. ("He really is an auteur," we're assured.) This video starts with Payne making omelets on location and I'm wondering for who, when at the end we realize it's for his wonderful cast! He cooks for them because they're family!, and the one he dishes out just as we fade to black is for Nick Krause, who plays Sid. I'm betting this is the only omelet Krause ever got from Payne. Really, I'm sure the director is a nice enough guy, but isn't the best proof of magnanimity keeping quiet about it?<br /><br />The third mini doc is the weirdest of all. It's about the location, the land of Hawaii and what the rituals of filming there were--saying prayers to the spirits at the beginning of the shoot and so on. There are a few interesting things to learn, such as the meaning behind the yellow blanket first seen on Elizabeth in the hospital and in the end shot with the rest of the family, but overall this video was too much, especially after the other two, and so I ejected the disc after a few minutes. I would have liked a making-of featurette, or a discussion of the story's intent with the author of the book (the author's thoughts are barely acknowledged, as usual), rather than watching the cast and crew kiss George Clooney's and Alexander Payne's behinds.<br /><br />So just skip the extras--there's better supplementary material and cast interviews on imdb and YouTube anyway. The Descendants itself is very good, a little slow in spots, with a few too many generic scenic pans and ukulele montages. But overall this is that rarity, a film with depth as well as many plot surprises. Definitely *not* a garden-variety TV movie-of-the-week.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The Descendants marks Alexander Payne's return to directing after a seven year absence and before The Artist stole its thunder it was considered the Oscar front-runner in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories. In the end, it won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Critically speaking, it's quite the comeback. In almost 20 years Payne has directed only five films, all from screenplays co-written with his writing partner Jim Taylor. This is the first film the two have not collaborated on the script for, although Taylor remains a producer and Payne's consistency remains as well. As a director, Payne has displayed a unique style that functions through the acting, editing, music, camera work, and writing. That style that was so prevalent in Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways is not as prominent here. It has that quirky Payne-humor coupled with heartwrenching drama, but I wonder if Payne chose to play it safe for his comeback. It obviously worked for him in most circles, but this being his most commercial, straight-forward, and safe effort left me underwhelmed. Payne still deftly blends poignant drama with just the right dose of comedy, once again giving us one of the best films of last year. I just say this with less enthusiasm than I have had for his previous films.<br /><br />The Descendants is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings and was shot on location in Hawaii. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and the sole trustee of untouched Hawaiian land. With the trust set to expire in seven years, Matt is in the middle of a big deal to sell the land when his wife Elizabeth is involved in a boating accident that puts her in a coma. A dire prognosis forces Matt, who has always been the "back-up parent," to take charge in caring for his two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). His relationship with Alex is already strained when she reveals a secret about her comatose mother that unravels Matt's entire life.<br /><br />The beautiful Hawaiian setting adds an ironic contrast to the heavy material. Like any film shot in Hawaii this is beautiful to look at, but the scenery takes a backseat to the involving and touching story. There's a good reason Payne is on the short list of filmmakers retaining final cut privileges to their films. He's a master at handling heavy dramatic subjects with subtlety and humor, while demonstrating a firm grasp on characters and their development. This is a very consistent film with several wonderful scenes. Look at the beautifully acted confrontation between Clooney and Matthew Lillard. It's a bittersweet, tense scene, heartfelt and funny that reveals Lillard as an effective, underutilized talent. He plays this scene to perfection, never over-playing it and finding the perfect balance of guilt, fear, and regret.<br /><br />There's a character named Sid (played by Nick Krause), who shows up doing his best Keanu Reeves impression and seemingly has no role in the story except to accompany Alex and frustrate Matt. Never one to stick to conventions, Payne builds this character to a surprisingly poignant moment with Matt that feels remarkably sincere when it would've seemed contrived in the hands of a lesser writer/director. Finally, Matt's goodbye to his wife is one of the most quietly moving scenes of any film last year. It's a brief, beautiful moment; understated, despite being the film's emotional climax.<br /><br />Robert Forster and Beau Bridges do memorable turns with very few scenes, while Lillard emerges from his permanent spot as Shaggy in anything Scooby-Doo related to show off unexpected range. Miller and Woodley are terrific as the daughters, particularly the 20-year-old Woodley who gives a performance that blows many of her contemporaries out of the water. It announces the emergence of a bright young actress, who is wasting her talent on that unfortunate television show.<br /><br />Clooney, meanwhile, gives his most mature performance to date and certainly one of his best. It's a far cry from the suave, deliriously handsome characters he usually plays. His performance as Matt King is quiet, heartbreaking, and without an ounce of bravado. It shows him in a completely different light. That scene between Matt and his comatose wife is real, powerful acting. Out of the five Best Actor nominees, Clooney was no doubt the runner-up.<br /><br />The Descendants is professionally-made, high-quality melodrama that never diverges into new territory and only separates itself from the pack with Payne's offbeat blend of the comic and tragic. It doesn't rank too highly on the list, but it is one of 2011's best films despite the faint scent of Oscar-bait that surrounds the entire movie and its failure to make the same impact of Payne's previous work. It may not be profound, but it's hard to dislike or not be affected by. It's a melancholy, pleasing effort that I just don't foresee being discussed years from now. Even with these shortcomings, it has heart and is a welcome return from Alexander Payne and a nice change of pace for George Clooney.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>George Clooney.  I'll never understand the appeal.  I take that back.  I get it, to a degree, and I even buy into it, to a degree.  I just feel that the world, much like with Johnny Depp, is too late to this party.  I mean, back in the 90's, Depp was amazing.  When does the world take notice?  When he stars in that Disney `pirate' movie.  Back in the early aughts, Clooney was starring in quality films with varying subjects and smart directors who knew how to use him.  When does the world embrace him?  When he gets obnoxiously political and starts starring in a slew of pretentious films pretending to be smart.<br /><br />And I thought `Up in the Air' was bad.<br /><br />`The Descendants', as expected, was high on Oscar's radar.  They love Clooney now.  Sadly, this film is a complete misstep in that it just appears so surface; so miniscule.  It is trying to say so much about family and heritage and the preservation of both (literally and then again figuratively portrayed by the Hawaiian landscape).  Instead of getting into the heart of it though, `The Descendants' throws a slew of unlikable characters at us and expects us to weed through their flaws to find ourselves.  I've never in my life wanted to hit so many people.  Sadly, Alexander Payne forgot how to make movies.  I mean, `Sideways' and `About Schmidt', while not perfect, were really well done films  that haunted in certain ways.  With this film, Payne merely resorts to layering his ill-conceived drama with a bunch of poorly executed `monologues' that are supposed to amount to something in the end but wind up amounting to a lot of hot air.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Matt King, a lawyer who is trustee to a lot of beautiful land his family left to him and his cousins.  His cousins (or at least most of them) want to sell the land and make a fortune.  Matt is old school and believes in working for his money and so he deprives his family of an overtly rich life.  He has lost touch with his wife, who has been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.  His eldest daughter is wayward and his youngest daughter is confused.  Oh, and his wife was in a severe accident and is on life support.  This obiovusly makes him reflect on his life and go soul searching (sort of) and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Shailene Woodley is rather excellent here, but the rest of the cast is so uneven.  Clooney is wooden and somewhat phones this in.  Amara Miller is annoying.  I wanted to run Nick Krause over with my car (seriously, a film trying to be this poignant should not resort to such depths of stereotypical clich&eacute;s).  What is Matthew Lillard doing in this movie?  Judy Greer seemed promising and then she had that ridiculous outburst in the hospital that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />UGH, and this won an Oscar!  Seriously, the script is really skeletal and needed so much more fleshing out to make it feel well rounded.  Instead, this just became so faux important.  I hate that Clooney picks these films that attempt to be taken seriously but say so little about the subject they are pretending to know so much about.<br /><br />And if you have to basically read us the book through voice over narration during the film's opening ten minutes just to get us on track with the film then maybe you should rethink your scripting approach.</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>Clooney does a good job carrying this picture - much the same way he made a name for himself on TV doing a doctor show.  The picture is reminiscent of other successful bourgeois melodramas like KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, ORDINARY PEOPLE and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, albeit more of a one-man show.  DESCENDANTS is least interesting when it focuses on the supporting characters, particularly the smarmy daughters and the goofy boyfriend of the oldest.  After a promising opening narration, the story breaks down simply because Clooney seems way too smart to have a wife and kids like the ones depicted.  It simply doesn't ring true because Clooney is too cool to fall victim to this kind of TV-drama, midlife crisis.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"The Descendants" covers family relations in the wake of an impending death against a backdrop of squabbles over a massive land inheritance.  When money is involved, family squabbles are always at their most tawdry.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer based on Oahu with an attractive wife as well as two daughters aged 10 and 17.  His wife is involved in a tragic accident and becomes, essentially, a vegetable.  She is diagnosed never to regain consciousness.<br /><br />It is during this trauma that King learns that his much-adored wife had been cheating on him.  This comes a terrific shock.  He must manage this trauma while at the same time coming to a conclusion on a family inheritance that dates back to the time of Hawaiian annexation.  The decision involves hundred of millions of dollars and he has to balance the competing objectives of his various cousins who are all potential beneficiaries.<br /><br />Clooney plays the part magnificently.  He is a struggling parent who is trying to understand his daughters whilst simultaneously managing his own savaged emotions.  He is ably supported by a strong cast playing his daughters, the broader family and friends.  Clooney may well have played himself into an Oscar.  It is hard to conceive that he will not receive a nomination.<br /><br />I recommend this film strongly.  Yes, it's a tear jerker but it's also a wonderful performance that deserves high accolades.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I tried to give this movie a shot. In the beginning of the movie, it made me wish I was back in Maui because of the beautiful scenes and music. Then the movie started and it went downhill from there. Most of what I saw was about two incredibly bratty kids (one a college student) who curse, throw up their middle fingers, disrespect their father and think it's OK to completely ignore anything he says. Then the college student brought along her incredibly tacky guy friend who thinks jokes about mentally challenged people and the elderly are funny. That's in addition to making fun of a grandmother with Alzheimer's and not knowing how to greet a friend's father. I liked watching George Clooney, but the rest of this film was a waste of my time. By 56 minutes I gave up. I thought it was ridiculous to try to find the "other man" to let him know Clooney's character's wife was about to have the plug pulled. When I think of good movies that fight to get filming money and then see this kind of stuff make it to the big screen, I realize time and time again how Hollywood gets it wrong. I don't even care what the ending was. I didn't like any character but Clooney's and got tired of people chatting with him about Hawaiian property. If I was him in this movie, I'd pull the plug on myself. I definitely could've given this movie a better shot if the supporting actors' personalities weren't so irritating. The only thing that I applauded was the grandfather who gave the irritating family friend a black eye. Go Grandad! You needed more characters like him and less characters like the daughters and the friend. Then I'd have watched the other hour.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Some films have the intention of creating a lush, emotionally-moving story that works on a number of different levels, but end up failing due to a lack of overall execution.  "The Descendants" is exactly that kind of movie.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Descendants" begins with Elizabeth King (Patricia Hastie) in a coma after a severe boating accident.  When husband Matt (George Clooney) learns that she will not be waking up from her coma, he must take his two daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) & Scottie (Amara Miller) on a trip to inform the relatives.  Along the way, Matt discovers that Elizabeth was cheating on him, and alternatively confronts the man who she had the affair with.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that it utterly fails to tug at the emotions whatsoever.  We are supposed to become deeply involved with the King family, but instead the character development just falls flat.  It takes a great director to weave everything together, but in this case Alexander Payne just fails to get it done.  All the elements are present...but it just doesn't jell together as it should.<br /><br />It is also strange that, despite the very Hawaiian soundtrack & locale, Hawaii doesn't add anything to this movie.  If a movie is made that heavily features such a locale, it needs to be an integral part of the storyline.  Instead, the Hawaiian flavor doesn't add a thing to this film...only muddying the waters further.<br /><br />Overall, "The Descendants" was a big letdown for me considering its Oscar buzz earlier in 2012.  It is miles behind films like "War House", "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close", and "The Help".  It doesn't even touch Clooney's earlier "Up in the Air" effort, which was one of the better films I saw that year.  Unfortunately, this one just falls flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>It seems hard to believe that it's been seven years since Alexander Payne's "Sideways" became the critical darling of 2004. Nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winning Payne an Adapted Screenplay Oscar--that picture (along with Election and About Schmidt) signaled a talented filmmaker with an unorthodox worldview. Blending elements of comedy and drama, Payne has crafted complex characters simultaneously frustrating and sympathetic--but altogether real. In adapting Kaui Hart Hemmings' intimate novel "The Descendants" to the big screen, Payne demonstrates (once again) a deft balance of emotions to create a picture both funny and heartbreaking. I so admired how Payne made vineyards and fine wines a major component, an extra character really, in the sublime "Sideways." In much the same way, Hawaii is a principle character (and I would contend one of the most pivotal) to "The Descendents." It would be easy to imagine someone jettisoning much of this rich texture, but Payne has crafted a loving tribute to the state's heritage in addition to one of the year's most surprising family dramas.<br /><br />George Clooney plays one of the titular descendants, someone whose family has great historical significance to the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, he and his many cousins own a great tract of undeveloped land that plays a major role in the film's fascinating side story. Front and center, however, is a more personal tale of family dysfunction and pulling together in crisis. When Clooney's somewhat estranged wife is incapacitated in an accident, Clooney must take charge of his troublesome teenage daughter (an astute Shailene Woodley) and his rebellious younger girl (an appealingly unexpected Amara Miller). With mom in a coma, Clooney is left to do his best to reconnect with the girls that he hasn't made enough time for. While this seems to be leading to some routine comic hijinks, the film takes a decidedly more serious turn as Clooney learns about his wife's true feelings. The rest of the movie walks the tightrope about how he and his daughters can channel these revelations and emerge stronger for it. And the film runs the gamut of emotions with anger, betrayal, love, and regret sharing equal time as the family embarks on a tumultuous journey together.<br /><br />While I know this makes the film sound like a bit of a downer, there is much humor to be enjoyed as well. While I'm confident that many will reveal far more about the plot than I am willing to, I think that it is best to let the story unravel without expectation. This is very much an in-depth character study. As such, Clooney has one of his most rewarding roles. He goes through a lot, but he maintains a subtlety that always keeps the picture grounded (even in its more extreme elements). Woodley is a revelation and this is as far a departure from TV's "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" as she's likely to experience. I'm confident we'll be seeing more of her. Miller has a real ease and provides many well placed laughs and a few tears as well. Perhaps the film's biggest secret weapon is Nick Krause playing Woodley's friend. As a laconic and laid back surfer dude, Krause's scenes with Clooney have real impact. As an odd source of wisdom and support, he is a unique character in this piece.<br /><br />"The Descendants," at the end of the day, is a quiet and thoughtful film. The film never plays up the huge emotional moments or strains for melodrama. It simply lets the characters exist as complex creations, with all their foibles and flaws in evidence. Its understated power, therefore, is all the more successful as it feels patently real. A treat for adult movie goers, 4 1/2 stars.

He has two daughters he is trying to raise with thier mother and his wife in a coma. At the time he gets the news that his wife is for all accounts dead he finds out that she was also cheating on him. There are some movies that are so good that after you watch there really are no words to describe it. This is one of those movies. Anything I say may cheapen the way this movie makes you feel. I can say that Clooney did an amazing job in this movie. He plays a guy that is down on his luck and a type of "everyman"...and he makes it believable. For someone like Clooney to pull that off is amazing. Also the girl that plays his older daughter is absolutly wonderful and almost steals the movie. This is again a movie that needs to be watched but there are not enough words to describe why. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and I have to say "The Artist" must be amazing in order to beat this for best picture. I give it an A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>There are movies that are released and then discussed later when Oscar time rolls around as being the next best thing since sliced bread. The actors and directors are talked about and make the talk show route. Almost always these incidents are nothing more than hype, trying to drum up interest in a film that is nominated but nowhere near as good as they claim. Then there are the rare times when it all clicks and turns out to be true as with THE DESCENDANTS.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Matt King, a hard working property lawyer whose made his mark while living in Hawaii. As the film opens Matt has had a major setback arrive in a speed boating accident involving his wife Elizabeth. As she lays in a coma while the doctors wait to see how she responds to treatment, Matt is faced with day to day life at home involving his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller).<br /><br />This is not Matt's area of expertise. It soon becomes apparent that home life has little to do with Matt of late and that he has no idea how to be involved in his child's life. Scottie has been acting up at school, presumably dealing with the life threatening situation her mother is in. With no idea how to cope with Scottie, Matt flies the two of them to another island where his older daughter Alexandra (Shallene Woodley) is enrolled in boarding school with the hopes she will help him.<br /><br />But Alexandra doesn't offer all the help Matt needs. Following in her rambunctious mother's footsteps, Alexandra has shown a drug problem in the past and when Matt arrives he finds her drunk. Flying home the next day they talk about what is going on and why she fought with her mother the last time the two spoke. It is then that Alexandra drops the bomb in Matt's lap that spurs on the rest of the film. She lets him know that her mother was having an affair and that she had planned to divorce Matt. This scene displays the acting ability of Clooney perhaps more than any other in his career as he displays shock, outrage, pain and disbelief within a matter of seconds. In addition Matt is told there is nothing more to be done and that due to her living will his wife is soon to be taken off life support.<br /><br />So begins Matt's quest, aided by his daughters and Alexandra's friend Sid (Nick Krause) to find the man his wife was involved with. It turns out the man is a realtor and in witnessing one of his signs in a yard, Matt and Alexandra are able to find him on another island. Soon the four are flying once more to find this man.<br /><br />With little solid clues they trace him to a hotel only to find he's not there. It is by chance that Matt passes him on the beach one morning while jogging and follows him home to a cottage where he sees him with a wife and two children. Having told himself over and over again that he wants to offer this man the chance to say goodbye to Elizabeth, reality isn't quite what he expected. What does he do now?<br /><br />While all of this is going on a side story has Matt trying to decide what to do with a huge acreage of land that his family owns. As trustee for the land, it is up to Matt what they finally do. One group of cousins wants to sell to a high finance man from Chicago who intends to develop the land with hotels and golf courses. The other is a local man who wants to do the same but continue to involve local people. And then there is the minority who feel that the land should remain as it is in pristine condition. In seven years the trust falls apart. If they sell now each cousin and Matt have the chance at making millions.<br /><br />At the heart of the film are two quests involving Matt. One involves his discovering the family that he left behind for the office, getting back in touch with his children and rediscovering who they really are as well as who he is. The second is relating to the land he was put in care of, a land and history that goes well beyond years and property rights and involved a tradition and sense of community. Where Matt will go with either quest isn't seen until the final reel.<br /><br />Clooney is amazing here. Rather than go for an over the top performance he displays so many subtle signs of emotion that you can feel each and every thing that goes through the character's mind as the story unfolds. His frustration, his rage, his sadness are all on display through the performance Clooney offers and it stands out as one of his best. Equally amazing is his supporting cast, most notably Woodley and Miller who show a large emotional depth for their young years.<br /><br />This film isn't a feel good movie but at the same time it isn't a downer either. It offers true moment of humor as well as drama and tells a story that involves you from beginning to end. As I watched I wondered if this was a movie I would watch again or just place on the shelf. In the end I decided it has to be seen more than once with time spent between viewings the better to appreciate what is seen on screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>It is hard to think of Matt King and his family as ordinary Hawaiians, given the fabulous land grant they administer, which could make them almost as rich as the Walmart family if they sold it to developers.  Alexander Payne goes to great lengths to make Matt feel ordinary, confronted with his wife's untimely accident and the sale of the estate.  Clooney plays his character like a less dashing Miles from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026IYLQS">Intolerable Cruelty</a>, trading in his Armani suits for Hawaiian shirts and flip flops.  The music carries you through the film, with some great pieces by Ray Kane and Gabby Pahinui and other <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2ANY6">Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Masters</a><br /><br />Shailene Woodley steals the show, as Matt's plucky teenage daughter who helps him sort through his failings and try to repair what's left of the family, as her mother is kept alive on a respirator.  Her boyfriend Sid provides a handful of comic moments, but otherwise seems rather useless.  Amara Miller as young Scottie King appears at first to be a major part of the story, but is all too quickly pushed to the sidelines in favor of her big sister.  From this nuclear family we meet the extended King family, which once ruled Hawaii in colonial times, Kauai anyway.<br /><br />It is more or less based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812982959">book</a> by Kaui Hart Hemmings.  I think she wrote it more as a comedy than a melodrama, which unfortunately is the way Payne presents it, hoping to mine more of the emotional vein in the book,  but ultimately the story rings hollow the way he presents it on screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne knows how to make a character-driven film. In his previous movies "Election" and "Sideways," the good guys are inherently flawed and the villains have many virtues, but people constantly get themselves into trouble by making those little decisions that have major, unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />"Everything just happens." The line heard in Payne's latest film, "The Descendants," neatly sums up the writer-director's philosophy. Much happens to Matt King (George Clooney) in this movie, set entirely in Hawaii, where King's life is teetering on the edge of picturesque seaside cliffs. His thrill-seeking wife lies in a coma following a powerboat accident, and her chances of recovery are slim. The couple's 10-year-old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), rages against the world, and King is so feckless a dad that he turns to his 17-year-old, Alex (Shailene Woodley), for help, even though he has already sent her to boarding school to wean her off alcohol, drugs and men.  The other potential source of help, King's father-in-law (Robert Forster), blames him for the accident.<br /><br />King's family brings another huge piece of baggage: a piece of Hawaii's soul. The King family are Haole descendants of King Kamehameha's family (Haole is Hawaiian for honkey) and King's cousins have each squandered their vast inheritances. King has preserved his share by living a comparably frugal life and, understandably, he is the sole trustee of the family's once-vast trust. The trust owns one major asset, an unspoiled 25,000-acre plot of paradise on Kauai that most of King's cousins want to sell to a developer. Such a sale would infuriate most of the state, but Cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) makes it clear that a few hundred million soothes a wounded conscience quite nicely.<br /><br />To top it off (as we saw in the movie's trailer), King learns that his wife has been cheating on him. And so it is we see King's point when he observes, "Paradise? Paradise can go . . ." (Well, you know.)<br /><br />Ultimately, "The Descendants" is about King's quest for redemption: as a father, a husband, and a Hawaiian. In a lesser movie, he would move smoothly through the steps of healing and emerge triumphant with a big speech announcing his hard-won wisdom. "The Descendants" does not take any easy shortcuts. While King wants to connect with his daughters, he doesn't have a clue how to do it. He, naturally, is also consumed with tracking down his wife's lover (Matthew Lillard) and finds an unlikely ally in Alex; this is hardly the traditional bonding experience for a father and daughter. Clooney, a nominee for a best actor Oscar, is a perfect choice to play King. Looking a bit more haggard than his normal Danny Ocean self, Clooney is as vulnerable as we've ever seen him. We believe it when he turns to his daughter's stoner boyfriend (Nick Krause) for advice.<br /><br />As usual in a Payne movie, all the performances are first-rate, and Shailene Woodley is particularly strong as the frustrated older daughter. Ultimately a comedy, "The Descendants" is a rich character study steeped in the romance of Hawaii. Gorgeously shot (I watched the high-definition Blu-ray) and scored with a charming Hawaiian guitar soundtrack, the movie stands proudly next to Payne's best work, and that's high praise.<br /><br />A healthy dose of extras include deleted scenes and several small documentaries, including an exploration of the real-life "Descendants," an examination of the Hawaiian mystique, and a discussion with Clooney and Payne.<br /><br />Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"The Descendants" is a comedy-drama genre film where the lives of the King family is shoved into a state of disarray following the critical injury of Elizabeth King, who is the wife of Matt (George Clooney) and mother to Alex and Scottie.<br /><br />The tragedy of Elizabeth's injury brings the King family together, and suddenly Matt has to urgently reassess his priorities. Despite their mother's injury the children like any youths are experiencing a confusing stage in their lives and Matt is forced to find caring and leadership skills, which he for years has avoided. Matt already has his hands full as the sole trustee of a family trust, which has ownership of 25,000 pristine acres of land on the island of Kaua'i, and also his normal job as a lawyer.<br /><br />The narrative is very much focused on a collective path of discovery and transition for Matt King and his daughters, which is at times tragic, humorous, and satisfying for the viewer.

He sits in a hospital room where his wife lies in a coma after a horrific boating accident that occurred off of Waikiki Beach. He goes home to care for his 10 year old daughter that he rarely has been with because of his travels and work load. His daughter is an out of control foul mouthed brat who has no respect for anyone. His older 17 year old daughter is in a private boarding school and she is even more ill-tempered and disrespectful.<br /><br />Matt was so involved in his life as a lawyer and the fact that he was the caretaker of the family's trust fund of billions of dollars of pristine land in Hawaii that he rarely had time for his family. Now he is seeing the results of his self-centered life and he is facing the consequences.<br /><br />When he tries to tell his older daughter that her mom is severely injured she tells him that she doesn't care. She has hated her mom since their big fight at Christmas. She tells her dad that she caught her mom cheating on him with another man and that he had no clue what was going on.....<br /><br />This is a tragic story of a dysfunctional family faced with the potential loss of their wife and mother and having no relationship with each other. Matt who wants to blame his wife for having an affair, realizes that if she had been happy then she would not have cheated. If he had been a better father then his daughters would be more respectful and loving.<br /><br />How they cope with the pending loss and with each other is an endearing story of human relationships and failures. The saga is a sad story of lost loves and lost family members and of trying to rebuild a normal life. In the end Matt realizes that no matter what has happened, he loves his wife and his daughters more than ever. Perhaps there is a chance for some happiness after all!<br /><br />We enjoyed this movie and felt that it was very good. It is a good lesson that life is not about money and riches but of the love and the relationships you have with your family and friends. I believe you will like this movie. It is well acted and the storyline is very good.<br /><br />Nothing can touch the following words of Matt to his wife:<br /><br />Goodbye Elizabeth. Goodbye my love. My friend. My pain. My joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye!</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />I had high expectations for this movie, and having finally seen it myself, I have to say it's definitely a good movie, but it's not a great movie either. I did enjoy the film, and it's certainly another more than competent effort from director Alexander Payne ("Election," "About Schmidt," "Sideways") who hasn't disappointed yet. But I have to wonder at the movie's stellar reputation which doesn't seem to me to live up to all the hype. This is why I rate it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />All that having been said, I think the most interesting question here, given all the glowingly positive reviews and the very few negative ones, is why the movie seems to have struck such a responsive chord with the viewing public. And I think I have as good a theory as any about that. As hundreds of reviewers have already commented on the usual movie topics such as the acting, direction, script, plot, and so on, I'll mainly discuss this idea since I've read quite a few of the reviews here and I didn't see anyone else discuss this so far.<br /><br />The movie starts with  a voice-over of Clooney musing about "life in paradise" and wondering how people can think it's any different from anywhere else--people are the same, they have all the same problems--the only difference is that in Hawaii they have them in paradise. Clooney comments that people seem to think Hawaiians just sit on the beach or surf and drink mai tai's all day long, and that life is always idyllic.  "Are they insane?" Clooney asks. LOL<br /><br />And I think that right there sums up the appeal of this movie. The Germans have a word, "schadenfreude," which means "taking pleasure in the suffering of others." And I think the appeal of this movie has exactly to do with that. I suspect Americans in general envy those who get to live in Hawaii, and this story about a dysfunctional family and the tragic situation which the family has to deal with, all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, appealed to the public by showing that people in Hawaii can be just as miserable, and their lives can be just as screwed up, as everywhere else.<br /><br />In the case of Clooney's family, they might live in a natural paradise, but his family life is anything but. The kids are insolent and disobedient, use foul language inappropriate to children, court the wrong friends (mainly Alex, the teenage daughter, whose current flame is an oafish boor), and are in general constantly misbehaving and disrespectful of Clooney, the hapless father, who's just trying to get everyone through a very stressful and difficult time for the family.<br /><br />Yup, it's not exactly paradise; in fact, if you take away the location, it's more like hell: Clooney is miserable, the kids are miserable, the relatives are just lazing about hoping to cash in on Clooney's land deal, (spoiler alert!) his wife is dying, and on top of all this, Clooney finds out that his wife was cheating on him before she had her fatal boating accident. Oh, and did I mention the father-in-law has no respect for Clooney either? This is despite the fact that Clooney has a busy career as a lawyer, although he could easily retire if he just sold the huge 25,000 acre parcel of land that the family inherited from the Hawaiian royal family several generations earlier.<br /><br />Well, wives cheat on husbands, husbands cheat on wives, kids are ungrateful and spoiled, and the relatives are often less than stellar representatives of humanity pretty much everywhere. The only difference here is that it's in "paradise." In other words, life is pretty unhappy, depressing, and miserable in paradise too--and I think that in a nutshell summarizes the great appeal of this movie--and all the glowingly positive reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>The single most accurate film about Hawaii that I've ever seen. Bar none. And I'm still stunned.<br /><br />Too often the portrayal, without malice, falsely depicts some kind of wondrous, spiritual and exotic locale. It's not. Not really, or at least not entirely. It's a state in the Union Of The United States. No better or worse than any other of the other 49, notable only for the fact that it's a series of islands sitting in the middle of a vast ocean. The film honestly depicts the congestion - of cars, pollution and people - and the shocking amount of concrete that is paving over much of what used to be "Old Hawaii". Clooney's character, Matthew King, opens with a prologue that includes, "Are...our cancers less fatal, our heartache less painful?". Exactly.<br /><br />It's a revelatory and moving film that successfully grasps subtle local themes and issues - many of which malahini won't understand. Not that any of that is an impediment to enjoying this amazing movie.<br /><br />However, here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />- The amalgamation of several prominent Missionary Families here in the islands represented by the fictional King clan. Some of which, like the film, are divided about their moral and legal obligations. A tarnished heritage that bestows great wealth to a select few, while simultaneously exposing their lost connection to the people and the 'aina. Often, carrying a blood lineage associated to Cooke, Bishop, Castle, etc., tends to foster a conflicted mixture of admiration, envy and anger amongst the people who actually live in Hawaii and call it home.<br /><br />Interestingly, the Kings, at least from my perspective, are likely a representation of the Sinclair-Robinsons. Their internal family debate in the 1990's, regarding stewardship of an entire island, sparked a statewide discussion about hereditary landholders and their relationship to the greater community.<br /><br />- Another aspect which I deeply appreciated: When Matt announces to a gathering of friends that he will follow his wife's wishes to be removed from life support - all of them are caucasian. It would've hollowed this film tremendously if Director Payne had attempted to display some shibai it's-a-small-world-after-all cosmopolitan show of skin colors to appease the politically correct. I'm grateful that it was honest.<br /><br />And honesty is what this film is all about. Whether it's the cultural rift between the haves and have-nots, and the racial divide that often represent the same groups. Or the tangled human relationships we have with one another, often repressing an ugliness we would rather not confront, 'Descendants' truly delves and explores these often sublime and gray issues.<br /><br />Tremendously deep, with so many layers of dramatic construction, it's almost indescribable without writing a thesis about the islands and our ohana. Every time you think you have it and the characters down, the story unexpectedly wheels and turns, and suddenly you're looking at a completely different film. Really, sincerely, this is a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Absolutely five stars.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Regarding Clooney - '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054PSY2W">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>' will always be my favorite performance of the man, but this comes so awfully close to topping it. His deilvery as an absentee-dad and distanced husband was about as complete a character as I've seen in a long time. Neither hero nor villain, but like most people, a mix of something in between.<br /><br />- Was enchanted by Shailene Woodley, who carried the difficult and critical role of daughter Alexandra King. And along with Saorise Ronan, an impressive young actress whom I'll be watching.<br /><br />- Wasn't sure who Alexander Payne was, so in doing an IMDb reference check, I realized that I had indeed screened an earlier work. As I think back on it, I wasn't particularly impressed with '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a>', but I wonder now if I misjudged the film. Based on the incredible detail he captured in this film, and given that I'm not familiar with California wine country, I'll have to set time aside to rescreen that earlier production.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>This review is of the Standard DVD version of the film.<br /><br />While this film by Alexander Payne ("Sideways", "About Schmidt") garnered LOTS of Academy Awards nomination - and some Oscars too - I wouldn't consider it in a class with the other nominees like "Hugo" or "The Artist". This is a "family relationship" drama, pure and simple. And we have the dying, cheating wife to add some emotion to the story. (No, I'm not doing a spoiler alert here. The trailer tells you she was having an affair and she goes into a non-reversible coma in the film's first five minutes.).<br /><br />The star of the movie is George Clooney, plain and simple. And he gives a great performance - though you'll still see him as "handsome actor George Clooney playing a role". Young actress Amara Miller, as the nine-year old Scottie nearly upstages Clooney in some scenes. The film is a great promotional ad for visiting Hawaii (and a geography - and history - lesson) as Clooney and his two daughters hop the islands searching out his wife's lover.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the film - and so will you. Just don't expect to have a life-changing experience. And, oh yes, bring tissues. You'll need them.<br /><br />There are well over 100 reviews here already - nearly all about the theater version of the film so you can read as many as you want. This review is focusing on the Standard DVD.<br /><br />There are four bonuses on the Standard DVD: "Everybody Loves George" (7 min) where the cast talks about working with Clooney, "Working with Alexander Payne" (13 min) where everyone - including Clooney - talks about the director, "Hawaiian Style" (16 minutes) which covers modern Hawaiian culture and the films "theatrical Trailer"<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I was pleasantly surprised to find myself absorbed in this fine drama/comedy starring George Clooney in another fine performance with fine direction from Alexander Payne, who waited several years before committing to this film--but the wait was worth it.  Another plus of course is the Hawaiian background since I lived there many moons ago but again the story is the key here plus the acting especially from the Shaleen Woodley who should've copped an Oscar nom for her supporting role as Clooney's wayward daughter.  It's a shame that "The Artist" overtook this fine film but I think the Academy was patting itself on the back for giving it to that French film rather than this masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>There is 90 seconds of film where George Clooney is not on the screen. But don't worry, he narrates for us so we don't forget he is in the film. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident we don't get to see because Clooney wasn't there. She is in a coma and is going to die. Clooney has been so involved with his job (he has a big deal in the works) that he has alienated himself from his family. Now he is attempting to reconnect with his two daughters, the older of which has harsh feelings for her mother.<br /><br />The story develops to a point where Elizabeth's coma becomes almost secondary. Clooney's deal involves all of his cousins and a realtor Clooney would rather not deal with for personal reasons. In order to help her cope, the older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) has a boyfriend (Nick Krause) who hangs out with her during this interim.<br /><br />The movie is a drama, but the dysfunctional family provides for light humor and some dark humor to keep the film from getting too heavy. Good acting. Well written and directed. Film is really great if you like the color blue: blue skies, blue water, blue Hawaiian shirts...and Clooney.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex or nudity. 4 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Based on the trailers, you would expect this film is mostly a comedy.  After all, it takes place in Hawaii and it stars George Clooney who we see in the trailer running with a funny gate and determined but weird look on his face.  Yes, this scene is in the movie but this isn't a comedy.  It's about a death...and life.<br /><br />Matt (Clooney) is a wealthy attorney but his real nest egg rests with some large acreage than he and a bevy of cousins have inherited from their families that have roots with a native Hawaiian princess.  The land is pristine and undeveloped.  Although jointly owned, Matt is the sole trustee therefore can decide on what happens with the land.  A plan is in place to sell the land to developers which would provide each of the owners a huge fortune.<br /><br />This really isn't the main story however, important as it is to the outcome.  Matt's wife is in a non-reversible coma and on life support after a boating accident. She will soon die.  They have 2 daughters, one 17 and another 11.  He's never been overly involved in their upbringing as this was the mother's role.  To complicate matters, Matt finds out that his wife had other outside interests besides boating.<br /><br />Alexander Payne ("Sideways") doesn't make a lot of movies but they always resonate.  This one is no exception.  He and his co-writers have put together a strong drama that is never heavy-handed or depressing.  This takes a deft hand at the helm and Payne provides it along with a stellar performance by Clooney and a cast of newcomers (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as the daughters) and veterans (Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Robert Forster and Matthew Lillard).<br /><br />Blu ray update:  I still love the story and the way director Alexander Payne manages to get great performances from virtually every person on the set.  From surfing legend Laird Hamilton to George Clooney in what must be considered the finest of his career.  One thing the Blu ray allows you to do is study the actors in a closer more personal way as they inhabit their characters.  Clooney's character Matt King runs the gamete of emotions as he tries to deal with multiple catastrophes including the loss of his wife.<br />The other standout performance is by Shailene Woodley as Matt's oldest daughter Alex.  She goes from a wild partying 17 year old to a mature take charge older sister.  The younger sister Scottie is played by Amara Miller and frankly I didn't pay much attention to her the first time I saw the film.  I was so absorbed with everything else.  But watch this young actress steal scenes and add a bit of needed humor at the appropriate moment.<br /><br />Even small roles are played for all they're worth.  Robert Forster is the dickish father-in-law of Matt.  But Matt gives him an opportunity to grieve in his own way.  Watch the tender scene in the hospital as Forster's character says goodbye to his daughter.  Check out Judy Greer as the aggrieved spouse of her husband's infidelity.  The husband played by Matthew Lillard is likewise remarkable.  Far removed from Scooby-Doo. Beau Bridges has a couple brief scenes as Matt's cousin, but he takes full advantage.  Finally, you have to give it up for Patricia Hastie in an unappreciated and probably agonizing role as the comatose Elizabeth.  "The Descendants" is one of the finest films from 2011.<br /><br />The Blu ray shows a perfectly presented video in 1080p.  The colorful Hawaiian landscape shows up well with sharp focused detail.  It has a very film-like quality which is appropriate.  The aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and while not spectacular it is not distracting either.  This is a dialog centered film and it is clear and centered.  The guitar and ukulele plays in many scenes and they sound great.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>MOVIE REVIEW #20: The Descendants<br /><br />Alexander Payne, director of a couple of my favorite independent films "Sideways" and "Election" -  has done it again. The "Descendants" was a surprisingly warm, entertaining and thoughtful film. It deals specifically with a family going through a specific tragedy and dealing with that tragedy and all the secrets they never knew existed.<br /><br />George Clooney pulls an emotionally charged and compassionate performance as a father dealing with his wife and her near fatal accident. (Played by Patricia Hastie of "Lost", basically playing a invalided accident victim - no dialogue at all.)  He needs to deal with the solitude of losing a wife and dealing with estranged children who are remarkably good actors themselves. The oldest daughter is played by Shailene Woodley ("The OC", "Secret Life Of An American Teenager")  and the youngest daughter  played by Amara Miller (in her very first project ever).<br /><br />What made this movie so good for me was the complexity of Clooney's character and the depth he went to in order to deal with a big family secret, an estranged daughter, a curious daughter and a dying wife. It felt real and heartwarming to see his friends and a new real estate agent and his wife literally turn his world upside down!  Try keeping a dry eye during this film.<br /><br />The movie feature a completely Hawaiian underscore with classic songs and ukulele strums as well as a realistic look at life in the modern day Hawaiian Islands. The greenery, the land, the ocean and even the never seen rural areas of middle-class homes - all are woven in such detail as to only enhance the story.<br /><br />The cast includes some other incredible performances by Mathew Lillard ("Scooby Doo", "Madd TV") , Judy Greer ("What Women Want', "13 Going on 30")  and Beau Bridges ("Fabulous Baker Boys", "Stargate").<br /><br />Overall this movie has a lot to offer. Real-life drama and passion and the only thing that might be off setting is that the "R" rating for this movie is because of the language. (Which includes the kids.) I can see why it's winning all the awards and the fact it is currently up for  five Academy Award Nominations including;  Actor In a Leading Role - George Clooney, Best Picture, Directing -Alexander Payne, Film Editing - Kevin Tent, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.<br /><br />A very well made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The Descendants (2011)<br />Comedy, Drama, 115 minutes<br />Directed by Alexander Payne<br />Starring George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Nick Krause and Amara Miller<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />It took me about two minutes to decide that The Descendants was going to be my kind of film. It happened during Clooney's opening voice-over in which he observed that, just because they live in paradise, Hawaiians aren't exempt from the usual problems people face. That statement caught my attention because it's true, but it also alerted me to the possibility that the script would be both truthful and more intelligent than most.<br /><br />Matt King (Clooney) is the kind of character that I can identify with. He's a lawyer and his job is more important to him than his family. He regularly travels to neighboring islands on business and hasn't had a proper relationship with his wife and two daughters for several years. When his wife has an accident which places her in a coma, Matt's life changes instantly. He has to be a father to his daughters and he's completely unprepared.<br /><br />His younger daughter, Scottie (Miller), is 10 years old. Matt last took care of her when she was three. His other daughter, Alex (Woodley), is 17 and is in a boarding school to help her overcome alcohol and drug problems. When Matt learns that his wife will never wake up, he takes Scottie to collect Alex from the school. Alex is drunk when he turns up and openly defies him early in the film.<br /><br />Place yourself in Matt's situation for a moment. How would you attempt to console your daughters? What would help you establish some kind of connection with them? If you're all they have left, how will you make them feel as if everything is going to be all right?<br /><br />Matt isn't happy with Alex because she argued with her mother the last time they spoke, but her reasoning is sound; she found out that her mother was cheating on Matt. Alex insists that her boyfriend, Sid (Krause), stays with her while she is home. Sid appears to be fairly dumb and occasionally stoned. Matt is not happy.<br /><br />The story really takes off when Matt takes Sid and his daughters to a neighboring island in search of his wife's lover. Another story thread explains that Matt and his many cousins are descended from Hawaiian royalty and own a piece of land worth around $500 million. Matt is the sole trustee and must organize the group of cousins and decide who to sell the land to. A complication emerges later in the story which could have a major impact on his decision, but I won't reveal any more of the film's secrets.<br /><br />I've watched Clooney develop as an actor over the past few years. He used to be criticized for "always being Clooney", but I think he's proved that there's a lot more to him. His timing is excellent and he always delivers his comedic lines well, but he has to show considerable range as Matt. Many of the scenes require him to show his feelings without the use of words. He goes through a lot of emotions during the film and pulls it off perfectly whether the situations are positive or negative. His performance is human, real, touching, emotional and understandable. I thought he should have won the Oscar for his performance in Up in the Air, but this latest oversight is a glaring error.<br /><br />What I really liked about the film was the character development. We see Matt grow as expected, but I was stunned by the development shown in Alex and Sid. They both have more to them than meets the eye and I ended up liking both characters tremendously.<br /><br />The conclusions that Matt reaches by the end of the story seem plausible and fit well with his development as a father and as a responsible adult. I might have reached the same conclusions if I were placed in his shoes.<br /><br />You'll definitely laugh during The Descendants and you may even be moved to tears.<br /><br />Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won the Oscar for their adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' book and it was thoroughly deserved. It's rare to witness a film with such intelligent writing. The characters and situations are always believable. If you were in their position, you might find yourself behaving in the same way.<br /><br />The Descendants is my favorite film of 2011 and, in a few years, I suspect many will wonder why it didn't win for Best Picture when we find out whether The Artist has lasting appeal.</p></br></body></html>

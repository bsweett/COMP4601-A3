Something about them just fascinated me.  (Ironically, I was also terrified of wolves)  In second grade, I was determined to see "An American Werewolf in London" as soon as possible.  It sounded like a great movie.  After about three years of begging, my father finally allowed me to watch it.<br /><br />The film begins with two college students travelling through the English countryside.  After a bizarre encounter with the locals at a pub, the boys stumble on to the British moors during the full moon, where they are attacked by a giant wolf.  Three weeks later, David (Naughton) is in a London hospital and Jack (Griffin Dunne) is dead.<br /><br />John Landis, who wrote and directed this film, is famous for his great comedies, such as "Animal House", "The Blues Brothers", and "Kentucky Fried Movie".  People expecting the constant humor of those films may have been disappointed with this was released.  This film has humor - some parts are quite funny - but it's not a huge part of the film.  But the film maintains a light tone throughout most of that film, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />David Naughton is very good; he makes many of his scenes very funny.  Griffin Dunne was a great choice; he makes a very believable, cynical young man.  Jenny Agutter, Naughton's love interest, is beautiful and a fitting casting decision.  John Woodvine and Brian Glover are very good in their roles.  Paul Kember was very likable and amusing as Sergeant McManus.  "Muppets"/"Star Wars" fans will enjoy a brief appearance by Frank Oz.<br /><br />The soundtrack is very good.  (Trivia fact: every song in the film contains the word "moon" in the title)  Elmer Bernstein's score - what little of it that there is - is excellent and at times beautiful.  It's a pity that a soundtrack CD was never officially released.<br /><br />Landis' direction is great, but it's Rick Baker's effects that are really spectacular.  The werewolf transformation is rivaled only by that of "The Howling".  "The Howling", which was released before this film, had special effects by Rob Bottin, whose mentor was Rick Baker.  I think it's neat that Baker did the effects for this film and did such an outstanding job; it's almost like he was reminding Bottin who was the student and who was the mentor.  The Academy Award for Best Makeup was created specially for this film, and for good reason.  The transformation scene is masterfully done (Sam Cooke's "Blue Moon", which plays during the scene, was a perfect choice - it really enhances the mood).<br /><br />When I first saw "An American Werewolf in London", I thought that it was very likely the best werewolf movie ever made, and I still believe that.  It's a well-made, very entertaining movie with some spectacular makeup work.  Beware the moon and stay off the moors, but don't worry about picking up this wolfishly good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>From directing ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS , John Landis really grew up with this film , but stayed true to his comedy roots .<br /><br />It shows he would have been a great horror director too .<br /><br />It is very effective , very entertaining and very scary at the right times .<br /><br />Buy it and watch with the lights out !!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>With the exception of Michael Jackson's "Thriller", this is the greatest work director John Landis ever produced. This comedy/horror hybrid is fast paced, brief and to the point. Alternating between producing genuine frightening moments and real eroticism (the use of Van Morrison's "Moondance" during a steamy sex scene is sheer genius) while allowing subversive imagery (the Jewish in-jokes are really a Jungian buffet of dark humor), and genuine organic laughs, Landis (WEREWOLF being unlike the rest of his work) uncannily finds a way to create a lusciously loaded and layered film with economy and precision.<br /><br />Much has been written about the Rick Baker special effects and they are truly stunning and there isn't a hint of CGI to be found. The famous transformation scene is the best of the werewolf sub-genre as it is well-lit and performed with Sam Cooke's golden throat silking through "Blue Moon" on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The leads are capable, likable and evoke empathy- a rare feet for a contemporary horror film. Jenny Agutter, one of films great underappreciated  female leads, lends her usual strong, sensual support.<br /><br />Celebrating the classic horror film while also gently spoofing it, Landis creates a contemporary horror/comedy classic hybrid that improves with each successive viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>There's this scene in An American Werewolf in London where our protagonist is having a conversation with the decomposed corpse of his best friend while watching a pornographic movie in an adult theater.  There are others in the screenroom that eventually reveal themselves to be victims of our tragic werewolf.  Why are they here?  To convince the poor man to commit suicide.  "You gotta kill yourself, man.  Tonight's another full moon."  He then proceeds to change into the beast and terrorizes the movie theater.<p>I bring this one scene up because it had a profound effect on me when I first saw this at eight years old (I know, I know...an eight year old shouldn't have been watching this).  I had never scene anything as twisted before and I've rarely seen anything like it since.  That's the most important thing about this film.  It has never been successfully imitated.<p>Two American best friends are backpacking through England when one night on an lonely road out in the old country, they're attacked by a vicious creature.  One man dies, the other receives near-fatal injuries.  After a brief stay in the hospital, the protagonist is taken in by his lovestruck sympathetis nurse.  The visions of his deceased best-friend begin to haunt him delivering a terrifying prophecy:  On the night of the first full moon, you'll become the creature that attaked you.<p>______________________________________________________<p>I recently saw what I consider to be a disaster of a movie...Van Helsing.  I bring this up because of the interesting werewolf transformation in the film.  The werewolf would convulse and then proceed to rip his flesh from his body revealing the monster underneath.  All of this was done photorealistically as CGI.  But with all the realsim, it still doesn't have the impact of the first werewolf transformation in An American Werewolf in London.  But why?  Are we desensitized as movie-goers?  Personally, I think it comes down to style.  Modern filmakers are too obsessed with how real their effects look that they've become lazy convinced that the realistic CGI will be enough to satisfy the audience.  They've forgotten how easy it is to creep someone out.  Modern special effects should inhance the atmosphere set by a monster...not replace it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I'd read that the impetus for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON started in the former Yugoslovia in 1969.  A young John Landis was working on KELLEY'S HEROES and saw a burial at the fork in a road straight out of an old Transylvania movie.<br />He wrote his werewolf movie, but it went nowhere until Landis hit it big with ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS.  He then took out his werewolf script called (as the story goes) AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, a take off on the Gene Kelly musical, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  When the French didn't cooperate with locations, the setting was changed to London.<br />That's what I'd read.<p>One of the things that makes this film so special--other than the lean writing and the (at that time) eye-popping special effects--is how it manages to be both funny and scary.<br />How often do you find that?<br />I met John Landis at a film festival recently and he's very modest about his films.  He shrugs off ANIMAL HOUSE and WEREWOLF, sometimes referring to them as "my dumb little movies."  I'm just Joe Schmo Fan but I hope he someday realizes how great those films are.  Hollywood is STILL trying to make lightning strike again like it did with ANIMAL HOUSE and how many horror movies can you count that strike such the exquisite balance of AMERICAN WEREWOLF?  (If you bring up the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, then you've already lost the argument).<p>As far as the extras on the DVD, I was disappointed by the actors' commentary.  Too many dead spaces.  As much as Landis loves to talk about movies, I'm still wondering why he doesn't do commentaries for ANIMAL HOUSE and AMERICAN WEREWOLF.<br />He did an excellent commentary for KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE with Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. <p>What young American boy, especially the space cadet nerd, didn't have a crush on Jenny Agutter after LOGAN'S RUN and AMERICAN WEREWOLF? <p>(One last little note: the film also makes great use of London locales.  Picadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, the London Underground, etc.).</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>ADULTS ONLY! David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are together again for the Audio Commentary of this Collector's Edition of the now-classic An American Werewolf in London (1981).  They laugh together as they share their memories about filming the movie and share some interesting tidbits for you.  Bonus materials: An original five-minute featurette on the Making of An American Werewolf in London (Behind-the scenes).  A new 18-minute interview with John Landis.  An 11-minute interview with Academy Award winner Make-up Artist, Rick Baker. Also a very interesting featurette with David Naughton and the make-up crew on the casting and molding of David's hand and arm.  The Outtakes are for ADULTS ONLY to see and hear.  One outtake is pornographic.  Absolutly the best werewolf film ever made.  It's scary and made as a comdy too.  It gave me the chills in the movie theatre.  Goosebumps all over my arms.  David Naughton (Dr. Pepper commercials, "Makin' It" tv-series and song) is perfect in the lead role.  Griffin Dunne plays David's friend.  Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run [1976]) plays David's nurse and soon to be his lover.  Lila Kaye plays the barmaid.  The special effects in this film were new at the time.  No computer imaging in this one because it had not been invented yet.<br />  Not for children to see.  Film includes male frontal nudity, female nudity, pornographic scenes and audio, and very bloody and gory violence.<br /><br /> ***Update: A new Hi-Def and Blu-Ray DVD version,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304675771">An American Werewolf in London</a> will be released September 25, 2009.

The beginning of the film is downright scary. As the 2 characters wonder through the moors at night, and the werewolf is howling in the distance, then gradually gets closer and closer, scary stuff.<br />Another awesome scene is in the subway. This movie still stands the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>I must admit, I was extremely disappointed with this film.<p>1)It's not scary (although the scenes in the moors were excellent, and turn out to be the highlight of the entire film).<p>2)Since it's a John Landis (THE BLUES BROTHERS, TRADING PLACES, ANIMAL HOUSE), I had expected there to be a TON more humor . . . . . there was hardly any at all!<p>3)The ending is simply atrocious! It's so disappointing, that it's on the verge of destroying the entire film. I mean, the film wasn't very original to begin with (though the living dead segments were cool), but they had to go and use the ending that was used in THE WOLF MAN, THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF, and it goes on and on. Shoot the werewolf, see him in human form, flash to the credits!! The whole thing happens in less than 30 seconds (very, very sloppy and rushed).<p>One thing I must say in its defense, however: the transformation scene.  It may very well be the greatest ever put to film!  Rick Baker is simply the best makeup man who has ever graced the silver screen with his extraordinary talents.<p>Not all it's hyped up to be. You want werewolves? Go see the previously-mentioned two werewolf films, or SILVER BULLET and WOLF, and I hear that THE HOWLING is really good, too. It had at least be better than this overrated movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>Excellent copy of this movie. Fun to see this one again, the changing sequence is one of the best. The special effects are excellent, and his friend...you have to see it. Another movie for the late night collection. Want to visit merry ol' England, and treck around?</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>The copy of this 1990 VIDEO TREASURES VHS that I received in Feb. 2010 has a cover photo of the two young Americans' nightime wandering of the moors in Wales. Recorded in LP speed, picture sharpness suffers slightly but is still acceptable. A linear mono audio track, not HiFi, is strong and clear. Of greatest importance:  this particular "used" tape tracks flawlessly.<br /><br />In AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981), writer/director John Landis respectfully tips his hat to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001TZ6Q">Lon Chaney Jr. lycanthropic classic of 40 years earlier</a>, then deftly surpasses that picture both stylistically and cinematically. In special effects alone, this one is worlds beyond the clumsy film overlaps used to transform Chaney from an upright man to an upright hirsute. Under a full moon, Landis's misfortunate bite victim moans, screams, thrashes, emits guttural sounds and writhes in naked terror as hands and feet elongate into paws, face stretches to a snout, body hair thickens to sparse fur and the newly-born creature loses all bipedal abilities.<br /><br />We witness this chillingly detailed metamorphosis one time only, and that's more than adequate. Often the stalking monster is represented by a camera looking out  from its viewpoint; also effective as we close in on fleeing prey. There's gore, but it's not gratuitous and is used only when necessary. A new element is that those killed by a werewolf are doomed to wander Earth as undeads until the last of the creatures either commits suicide or is destroyed, which is best accomplished by someone who loves the man underneath the wolf.<br /><br />Simply put: despite a recent CGI-laden version, this well-done, by turns dramatic, humorous and frightening work just may be the werewolf to see. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I saw this film in the theater when released and was very impressed. I have always loved Universal's Wolfman and was skeptical when they went with the four legged variety in this film, but it works. Rick Baker's effects are outstanding and the wolfman transformation still looks incredible. I personally like the mix of horror and dark humor in this film and having Claude Rains in this film is a respectful nod to the original! The DVD has a good transfer and some interesting extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>John Landis's "An American Werewolf in London" is without a doubt the best werewolf movie ever made. Basically, the plot features David Kesseler and his friend Jack Goodman in England on a trip.  While on the moors, they are attacked by a werewolf rendering Jack dead and Kesseler badly wounded.  Hence, Jack survived the attack and becomes a werewolf where he is taken to a London hospital.  Slowly but surely, Kesseler feels the transformation from a human being into a creature of the night, all of which provides great entertainment for any horror movie audience.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are second to none...in fact, the scene where David Kesseler actually transforms into a werewolf is so real looking that it actually hurts the viewer just to watch.  Of course, the always funny but undead "Jack" is also brilliantly done in his undead form as he appears numerous times with his neck torn out and his body continues to deteriorate throughout the movie.<br /><br />Even the dreams of David Kesseler are absolutely horrifying and so well done that the creatures in these dreams, upon a first viewing, appear to the audience like this action is actually taking place in the movie and not just in Kesseler's mind.  One of my personal favorite scenes is the dream where Kesseler is in the bed in the woods when Nurse Alex visits David and he turns around with an absolutely harrowing monster face that will scare the pants off of just about anyone.  These dreams provide a logical transformation process of David into a werewolf that the audience can actually intellectually grasp and appreciate, which makes this movie that much more effective as a horror movie.  The acting in this movie is outstanding as is the directing and production values.<br /><br />The inserted dark comedy, e.g. Jack in "undead" form and the silly cop, in "An American Werewolf in London" actually meshes quite well with the horror in this movie which is quite rare for horror movies.  Nevertheless, "An American Werewolf in London" actually pulls this dark comedy-horror flick off quite well where other horror movies that have tried the same tactic have failed miserably i.e. the comedy actually neutralizes the horror in these second rate flicks relegating the flick to "joke status".<br /><br />The only real cricism I can come up with "An American Werewolf in London" is actually one of its charms/strengths that make it a great movie.  That being said, however, from a "TRUE" and unadulterated horror critic's perspective focusing on the aspect of fear evoked in an audience, the dark comedy actually provides comic relief to said audience where if left out, the audience would be left confronted with this pure and unadulterated horror this movie clearly evokes in any sophisticated horror movie audience...however, if the dark comedy is omitted, one is left to ponder whether the movie would work as well in a general kind of way without this advent of dark comedy.<br /><br />While I do not think that "An American Werewolf in London" is one of the greatest horror movies of alltime, I do believe it to be a great horror movie and is without a doubt the best werewolf movie of all time and is certainly a must own for any true horror movie fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>I give this movie 5 stars, its an excellent WereWolf movie. For it being made in the 80's , I believe it was 1980 it has the best Human - werewolf transformation. The action is good the story does not get boring and it will keep you up and on your toes, never bored. the acting is very good the gore is there, not like dawn of the dead 1978 gore but its bloody. It is without a doubt a classic werewolf movie, just a classic in general and worth the buy and especially if you are a fan of horror/cult type of movies its a must to have. To anyone who rates it low if I was you I wouldnt take there but take the word of the people who gave it 4 or 5 stars cause they are not lying. Just an excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>There may be a lot of comedy in this film, but it is really horror and tragedy.  As soon as one starts watching one can tell that this film will not have a happy ending (unlike Landis's Innocent Blood).<br /><br />A pair of young Americans are touring the English countryside when they fall afoul of a werewolf.  One winds up dead while the other is only wounded.  He wakes up three weeks later in a hospital to discover that there is some sort of coverup regarding what happened.<br /><br />The tending nurse falls for him while the doctor trusts the sincerity and looks into the events.  But the full moon quickly rises and all concerned begin to realize that something is very definitely wrong.<br /><br />The werewolf is a classic tragic monster and this film maintains that tradition.  No one asked to be a werewolf and they did not get that way through their own actions.  But this is not a typical werewolf film.  There is a higher degree of characterization and interaction than is usual.<br /><br />Landis fans will recognize his signature catch-phrase taken from the title of his "adult" movie attempt.  That movie is actually being shown in the theater where one of the film's important meetings takes place.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>Two American's are attacked by a massive beast one dark, foggy night while back-packing in the English moors. One is killed, the other is sent to the hospital. David, the survivor, is then plagued by disturbing, violent nightmares brought on by his near death experience. Soon his dead friend begins re-appearing (in various stages of decomposition) informing David that they were attacked by a werewolf and if he doesn't kill himself soon, he will become one himself and will be responsible for many deaths. David does not believe his dead chum and dismisses his claims as rubbish. That is of course until that night when things start to get a little hairy.<br /><br />Next to "The Howling", this werewolf spectacle is one of my favourite all time horror movies. It's an odd mixture of horror and humour. So even if you hate "fright" films, you may find something to like here. The film's cast is first rate. It doesn't have any world famous superstars but the actors give good performances throughout. Jenny Agutter, the werewolf's love interest, is lovely to look at while Griffen Dunne is hysterical as the walking dead friend given the difficult task of tormenting his buddy. The lead actor, David Naughton is also excellent. His portrayal of the tormented David is touching. But despite the film's impressive cast, the real reason to see this film is for its ingenious makeup effects. No CGI monsters here folks, instead the viewer is rewarded with several creative scenes of grotesque imagery. The transformation scene is especially spellbinding. It qualifies as the greatest werewolf transformation scene ever screened. The beast is not clearly shown until the final frames of the film so during those earlier attack scenes, the camera acts as the beast's eyes and the overall effect is chilling (The subway scene never fails to send chills up my spine). This picture's major highlight is its spectacular climax. Once the beast is unleashed upon the people of London, all hell breaks loose. There are car crashes, bus crashes, people being run over by cars. It's wonderfully chaotic and violent.<br /><br />I don't know which film I like better, this one or "The Howling". They're both outstanding horror films but despite the werewolf theme, they are different. "The Howling" takes place in a rural setting while "Werewolf In London" takes place in an urban one. In my opinion, "The Howling" is darker, more frightening, "Werewolf In London" is funnier but gorier. The transformation scenes also differ. Dante's film is less spectacular but nastier, more bone-chilling and the werewolves look more like wolves and stand upright. The beast in "London" walks on all fours resembling a massive, mutated dog. I urge the viewer to watch both films and decide for themselves which they like better.<br /><br />"An American Werewolf In London" is a classic and it's highly recommended. It's tongue-and-cheek horror done splendidly with one of the fiercest werewolves ever captured on film. Enjoy!<br /><br />4.5 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is my second favorite werewolf film ever made.Actually,its such a close tie between this film&The Howling...it is virtually impossible to choose between the two.This film has just the right ammont of folklore,gore&scares to satisfy anyone,plus it's own added touch of dark comedy.There are a number of good funny bits in it,like waking up in the London zoo naked&stealing a little boy's ballons to make his run for it,or having coversations with his dead,rotting friend in a [...] theater.The special effects are legendary,and nothing out there between this film&The Howling have come close in recent years to my recollection.With the onslaught of cgi effects taking over in the last 10 or so,I'm hoping&waiting someone out there will resort to "the old school" and make something else as memorible as this film.This is a great movie,and if you have never seen it...you won't believe your eyes.This one is a classic,and well worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>So these two american guys are walking around england, on vacation. And they come to this creepy little town out in the middle of the misty moors. And ... they don't stay the night; instead they choose to push on, despite the rain and general nastyness and their being on foot. Which, given the general attitude of the townsfolk, seems perfectly reasonable. <p>Anyways, I'd never seen it, I'd never heard anything about it when I watched it. It's funny and gross and silly, and I love the music. (Is there a soundtrack? "I seeeee a baa-aad moon risin'...") I recommend it to werewolf & horror fans everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>Great special effects in this movie push my rating to a four. As a fan of the old time werewolf movies this one lacks in atmosphere and acting. Its a fun watch but without Lon Chaney Jr. it just aint the Wolfman. Sound and picture quality are excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is one of the few movies that have consistently given me nightmares since I was a child.  It is at least a decade ahead of its time.  Most of the negative criticisms that I have read use the word "uneven" a lot.  Even Roger Ebert, whom I admire, claimed that the humor and the horror were an uneasy mix.  This was years before he gave the movie Scream a positive review.  Now I LIKE the movie Scream, but there is no way that one can claim that it gets the balance right whereas Werewolf gets it wrong.  Scream simply benefits from occurring in the cynical nineties - Werewolf suffers from being avant guard.  .<p>The new DVD has a few good extras on it - especially a new interview with Landis.  Even after all these years, the film still holds up.  Unlike most films, I see more things in it the more I look.  What, for instance, is up with the townsfolk of East Proctor and what is their relationship with the original werewolf?  My guess - they brought it on themselves somehow.  Maybe one of their own ran over a gypsy and was cursed.  Instead of killing the bloke, they all decide to hide beneath the pentangle in The Slaughtered Lamb every full moon.<p>I am recently returned from England and this movie is listed in Fodor's as one of the films that best showcases London.  I heartily agree.  I visited the infamous tube stop at Tottenham Court Road and it still looks much the same as when the David made his kill there.  And as I walked, alone in the countryside, beneath the light of the full moon, I had to ask myself, "Am I crazy?"  Fortunately, I made it to the pub.  There I waited, beneath the pentangle, for my friends to walk me home.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>This is the only 5 star Blu I have given that is not a reference quality picture, but they put so much on here I could not avoid it.<br /><br />The picture quality and clarity were underwhelming, but it still looks better than any of the prior versions. Plenty of artifact, hair, grain and fade throughout but the colors turned out nice, especially the reds (plenty of red in this film). I would have to say it preserves nicely (in a nostalgic way) how we all remember seeing this back in the 80s scaring the something out of us. The DTS rears actually get used but only in the howling sequences, otherwise everything is funneled into the front three channels. But what makes this so worthwhile are the supplements.<br /><br />The new features with Rick Baker and John Landis are worth the two hours and have TONS of great material (personal favorites include the ratings board clashes, how the screenings went and Baker being interviewed in front of his favorite prop - the whole wolf, still looks so real). The additional features are from the prior releases and include the interviews, making of, outtakes, photos and more. The subs and menu listings are in 18 languages and the film is dubbed into four others. This also has the D-Box Motion Code, BD Live and is laid out in the typical left-feeding Universal menus.<br /><br />Like I said, not a reference picture or sound, but overall this makes for a great deal at this price. If you only have a couple hours for a rental, at least watch the Beware the Moon (new) feature as each location is visited recently with some great Landis material spliced in appropriately.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>David Kessler and Jack Goodman are two Americans taking a break from school and family by taking a three month trek across the English countryside. Wet and hungry they venture into a small country village where they stop in at the Slaughtered Lamb hoping to eat and warm up. They come across some eccentric residents who are anything but warm and are encouraged to leave even though it's late and the full moon is out. Shortly after leaving they venture off the main road onto the moors where they are attacked by a creature of the night.<br /><br />David (played by David Naughton) is the only one who survives the attack but he's having horribly gory dreams and his mutilated dead friend Jack (Griffin Dunne) keeps coming to him, in various degrees of decay, and telling him he should kill himself before the next full moon. One of the ways David remains sane is hooking up with his nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter / Logun's Run).<br /><br />An American Werewolf in London was written and directed by John Landis who also directed the movie Animal House and Michael Jackson's Thriller video. It was filmed entirely in Wales, London and Middlesex, England. This is one of the best horror movies of all time with incredibly detailed make-up effects by Rick Baker that still hold up for today's viewers. Baker set the standards for future monster movies.<br /><br />I love the music too. It's addictive. Probably because there are only three songs throughout: Bad Moon Rising (Creedance Clearwater Revival), Moondance (Van Morrison) and three renditions of Blue Moon (Sam Cooke, The Marcels and Bobby Vinton).<br /><br />This is one of my favorite all-time movies. There's comedy (a bit campy at times), there's blood and guts, there's wolf lore and there's a white guy running around in his birthday suit in the middle of the London. I've seen this film dozens of times and enjoy it every time. It's a must see film for horror buffs and werewolf fans. Reviewed by M. E.

Buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good monster movie with some truly fine actors, in particular Agutter.  However, unlike the classics of the genre, where a dark mood of foreboding and anguish build, this film strays into a comedy that didn't hold together for me.  You enter scary scenarios and then the actors get almost flippant, even sloppy in the way that they depart from the mood for a few laughs that don't add to the story.  For example, the nurse keeps meeting with a cute little boy who says, "no!", to everything she asks; this shows she is warm and it is touching, but it detracts from the plot rather than advancing it.<br /><br />In terms of plot, it is pretty formulaic.  Two American friends are doing Europe, when they stumble across a strange village.  Feeling unwelcome, they walk out into the rainy night only to get attacked by you know what.  One of mauled, but survives, hence is doomed to monsterdom.  He meets a girl who falls for him, lives up to the curse, and gets offed while she is looking.  One shouldn't  expect more than this, of course, but it should cast a spell that the viewer enters and can forget everything else for a time.  This it completely fails to do, in part by indifferent direction - it feels almost like they are making it up as they go along - but also because of the misplaced humor that pops up, like the bumbling policeman whose character is never developed beyond knocking over medical instruments under the eyes of a glowering boss.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is the transformation scene, which is one of the best and most graphic that I have seen in the genre.  It is well done, though the werewolf himself often appears stiff and puppet-like.  One comic twist that does work are the visits (as spirits in limbo) of his friend and victims, but even they are sometimes stupidly lighthearted.<br /><br />REcommended tepidly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>David Naughton and Jenny Agutter were outstanding in John Landis' classic take on lyncanthrope, but Griffin Dunne as Naughton's friend, fellow victim ( fatally attacked by the same werewolf that mauls Naughton's character ), and rotting 'cheerleader' is gruesomely, outrageous. Rick Baker's FX work was simply amazing, and still holds up well ( it certainly beats the CGI 'mud puppies' created for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS by a few lightyears ). The cinematography ( particularly on the moors ) is beautiful, and creepy. This is a genuinely scary movie, with a nice love-story, an excellent cast, and still the best transformation scene ever. Definitely a meat-lovers choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Another cult film with Jenny Agutter. She nurses a guy turning into a werewolf. The movie parodies itself. Moon songs are played. The best is Bad Moon Rising by Creedence Clearwater Revival. John Fogerty of CCR wrote 20 rock classics including Proud Mary and Green River. The scene where David Naughton turns into a werewolf is disturbing. Jenny Agutter has had some weird love interest. In Walkabout, she is with an aborigine. In Logan's Run, it is a Sandman. In Othello, it is Shakespeare's black soldier. Here, it is a werewolf.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>And if you love werewolves, all the better. "An American Werewolf in London" works on so many levels, that its small wonder so many regard it as a latter-day classic of the genre. A quarter of a century has passed since its original release and An American Werewolf in London still stands (hairy) head and shoulders above any other lycanthrope movie. Its perfect direction from John Landis, great black humor, groundbreaking make-up effects, and wonderful performances make the 1981 classic absolutely unmissable. Naughton plays David Kessler, an American back-packer traveling across Europe with his best pal Jack (Griffin Dunne). However, stopping off to visit the Yorkshire moors turns out to be a big mistake when the two lads are attacked by a werewolf and so goes the story.<br /><br />As the "Werewolf" of the title, Naughton does very well, especially in scenes where his costume consists mostly of excess hair. And as his buddy, Dunne easily steals the film with his observations and his worsening situation. And the special effects! Rick Baker once again makes his name supreme as makeup wizard unparalleled with so many different effects for werewolf transformations, attacks, zombified victims, etc. But there's another side to this film you may not see coming. This film has one of the best senses of humor in this genre since "The Bride of Frankenstein". You'll forever try to mimic the mother's response when her son tells her, "A naked American man stole my balloons!"<br /><br />I would never dream of telling you how it ends; but consider that this was directed by John Landis, think about the other films he's directed then see if what you expected comes out in the end. It did for me. One final note: I haven't seen "An American Werewolf in Paris", but I have no desire to see any film trying to ape on the greatness achieved here. Let well enough alone. Great film but one ugly disc cover.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>One of the great horror films.  A nice mix of chills and humor at all the right place.  The story finds 2 hikers in the English countryside when they are attacked.  One is killed, the other ends up with bites and scrapes, but still alive in a London hospital where he takes up with a nurse.  He is not sure what attacked them, but with regular visits from his dead friend and the next full moon, he finds out.  David Naughton of "Makin It" singing fame does a real good job with his role.  The werewolf change scene done long before CGI is still top notch.  This film holds up well in rewatch.  A worthy addition to any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>I wasn't really looking forward to watching An American Werewolf in London, but the film has gained a strong cult reputation over the past two decades, and that was enough for me to give it a shot. For the most part, the film is deserving of its rep. Werewolf movies are pretty rare these days, finding a good one is even rarer. And even though AWIL wouldn't overall qualify as a great film, the fact that it's among the best of its subgenre is a good implication of the lack of quality evident in movies based around lycanthropes.<p>David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are two American friends on vacation in the hills of England. One dark and foggy night, they're attacked by a werewolf, Jack is eviscerated while David is only injured. He awakens in a hospital, put under the care of pretty nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), whom he quickly finds himself attracted to (and vice versa). But the day he's to be discharged, he's met by the undead spirit of Jack, who informs David that he will turn into a werewolf during the next full moon, and will proceed to go on a killing spree. The only way he can end his torment is to die, an option David is not willing to accept.<p>The opening scenes, set in the hills of England, display a quietly creepy atmosphere (which would be evident throughout all of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie ever made) that gets the film rolling to a good start. Surprisingly, once the movie settles into its London setting, it doesn't lose momentum. This is thanks mostly to the budding romance between Naughton and Agutter, which is really sweet and believable. The two also share one of the steamiest love scenes I've seen.<p>Naughton is very likeable as the cursed young man, infusing his role with youthful energy and vitality. Because of his performance, it's hard not to find his dilemma distressing and even poignant. Agutter is excellent as David's new love, taking what could have been a cliched role and shaping it into a focused and layered performance. No one else makes much of an impression, except maybe Griffin Dunne as the ever decaying, undead Jack.<p>Much of this movie's fan base stands behind it because of its humor. But to be honest, except for a morbidly funny scene inside a porno theater (involving David talking to all his victims), I didn't really get much in the way of laughs. Who knows, I may have to give the film another look to get all the jokes, but An American Werewolf in London feels like it mostly wants to be taken seriously, and director John Landis packs in enough tense and suspenseful moments to make it work as such.<p>The most famed aspect of the film is David's transformation, a scene that show off Rick Baker's superlative make-up work. However, not as impressive is when the werewolf actually moves about while stalking and attacking its victims. A couple of scenes are obviously nothing more than a bunch of f/x guys waving a furry animatronic wolf head at would-be victims, not exactly effective when it comes to evoking pure, shuddering terror.<p>The abrupt ending is initially bothersome, but further thought has convinced me that to continue with the film after the final scenes would have been unnecessary and probably less emotionally effective.  This is one superb horror thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Okay I know I wasn't suppose to laugh at, but I did, and I saw this when I was eight. Now I'm all for a good scary movie, but this isn't scary, but the movie rocked so much. I think the only werewolf film to ever give me the shivers was Wolfen. This is hysterical and you can' deny that the line where the little boy say, "Mommy some naked american man stole my balloons." wasn't funny. Just see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>There's a lot to like about American Werewolf in London -- and just as much that's aggravating and disappointing.  Apart from David Naughton's thin performance in the lead role, the acting is solid, with Jenny Agutter the standout as a pretty young nurse who's a sucker for animal magnetism.<br /><br />The film snaps from comedy (some of which works, some of which doesn't) to fairly realistic gore -- with nightmare scenes that give the entire story a sense of the surreal which is fairly unusual in a mainstream film.<br /><br />The story is short and highly simplistic -- with little depth; the twists and turns, such as they are, simply don't engage.<br /><br />I like American Werewolf for its tone, its sense of freshness.  It's a flawed film, but likely John Landis' best work.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>All these years later and the movie is still awesome! You can't beat the classic scene of when you actually see the character turn into the werewolf. The werewolf isn't scary, but the movie is still fun to watch. You will be thinking about the end of the film for a long time after it is over! It is that much of a mind freak.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>John Landis crafts an enjoyable piece of horror hokum, a tongue-in-cheek werewolf thriller that gives an affectionate nod to the old horror movies and also manages to deliver a few scares.<p>The title says it all: The mainstay of the film's humour, at least for the first half, is the irony of an American finding himself in England. The jokes are as much a poke at American perceptions of England as jabs at Englishmen themselves, from the class-riddled consciences of the native characters (they are all either inferiors or superiors) to the grim, rural northerners (&quot;Don't go out on't'moors&quot; -- and we all know what happens next).<p>Special effects were pioneering, and still look pretty good today. Naughton transforms spectacularly into an actual wolf, albeit a pretty hefty one, rather than the half-wolf/half-man of an earlier era.<p>The soundtrack helps with the irony. Watch out for the alluring Jenny Agutter. If Amazon allowed half-stars, I'd have added an extra half to my three. Entertaining, if macabre, stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Two American students are on a walking tour of England and are attacked by a Werewolf. One is killed, the other is mauled. The Werewolf is killed, but reverts to it's human form, and the townspeople are able to deny it's existence. The surviving student begins to have nightmares of hunting on 4 feet at first, but then finds that his friend and other recent victims appear to him, demanding that he find a way to die to release them from their curse, being trapped between worlds because of their unnatural death. A near definitive werewolf movie that's bloody, scary, funny, satirical,intelligent, sexy, charming and ultimately sad. With a soundtrack that's perfectly placed, and composer Elmer Bernstein perfectly placing the music. Grab the popcorn and hang on folks.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This film plays more like a Black Comedy, than a Horror Film, partly due to the fact that Griffin Dunne's character Jack Goodman, isn't to be taken too seriously. Also, due to the fact that John Landis (The Blues Brothers, Trading Places), is also known for comedy films. So, the script, tends to look at the humor, rather than the horror. In any case, the film is entertaining, and when the film came out, 1981, it was a different approach, to the material, that's been done before.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite horror movies.

After watching this "legend" of a movie (I have no idea why it is so famous?) I felt confused. Is it supposed to be scary? Or funny? Or both?<br /><br />"An american werewolf in London" was a disappointing movie-experience -not that "Wolf" (Nicholson, Pfieffer) was that great either, but it sure is much better than this so-called cult-classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Hollywood werewolves have long been characterized as serious creatures who lope after their victims like an hirsuit Groucho Marx.  The image of this loping werewolf was originally etched by Lon Chaney and succeeding generations of actors merely continued his style.  But with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, director John Landis not only pushed the werewolf back down on all fours so it would resemble nothing less than a bristling mobile lycan tank but he also added a much needed touch of humor to force viewers to stand apart momentarily from the gore to contemplate what they had just seen.  David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans backpacking their way through a gloomy English moor right out of Heathcliffe's WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  They are attacked by a howling werewolf who kills Dunne but merely bites Naughton before it itself is shot by villagers.  This introductory scene in which Naughton and Dunne are banished by an unfriendly group of pub drinkers is an unsettling mixture of creepy fear leavened with biting wit.  It is precisely this same melding of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engage in extremes of emotions that range from laughing to choking, with the viewer sometimes not sure which one to choose.  <p>Jenny Agutter is a much underappreciated actress who shines as a nurse who falls for Naughton, and cannot understand a radical change in his eating habits as he increasingly comes to prefer his meat extra rare.  Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that in another and less competent director's hands might have relegated her to little more than a fetching piece of English eye candy.  Griffin Dunne supplies visceral humor as a corpse that keeps popping up, like Hamlet's father's ghost, at opportune times to remind Naughton that the price to pay to be free from lycanthropia may be a tad too high.  And then there is the music, played in much the same vein as Simon &amp; Garfunkle's lyrics from THE GRADUATE, but here Credence Clearwater Revival's lilting &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; punctuates the eye popping transformation scenes that a bad moon leads to bad vibes.  Finally, the special effects of Rick Baker are stunning in that you can see bones elongating, fur sprouting, and nostrils stretching as Naughton is seen scaring himself as much as the audience.  Ultimately, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is a ground breaker in the werewolf genre in that sight and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way as their victims are in their own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>&quot;An American Werewolf In London&quot; is one of those movies you can go back to again and again, without getting bored of it. It is a nice mix of horror and comedy, while being the best werewolf movie to date. Not since &quot;The Wolfman&quot; from the 1940's has a movie about Werewolves been so good.<p>The story starts off simple enough. Two American travellers in England cross paths with a vicious werewolf, one is killed, and hte other survives. The one who survives starts to experiences strange mental episodes, and he wonders if all those stories about werewolves are true--if you are attacked and survive, do you yourself become a werewolf. Director and writer John Landis took his time with the characters, making them believeable and likeable. The dialogue is very well written, with touches of black humor to keep the movie from becomming a standard &quot;bump in the night&quot; horror movie. The special effects and makeup were, for their time, cutting edge. And even today, the transformation scene is unmatched. <p>The DVD is an excellent package. I always enjoy the commentary buy the film makers, but on this DVD, the two main actors (David Naughton and Griffin Dunn) do the commentary. Their commentary is more like a friendly chit-chat, with amusing anecdotes and plenty of insight. Also included are two excellent featurettes, one of the makeup, and the other is the original 1981 &quot;Making of&quot; special. The outtakes reel is the funniest, with one in particular that will make you fall to the floor laughing. You'll know which one when you see it, but in case you don't, it involves a falling &quot;setpiece&quot;. <p>This is one of my favorite movies of the 1980's, and one of the first I looked for when I bought a DVD player. With all the extras and the top quality transfer, it is worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>Director/Writer John Landis and Make-up Artist Rick Baker reinvent the werewolf movie with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. With definite nods to the classic werewolf and wolfman films of years past, and though more or less adhering to the basic tenets of the traditional werewolf legend, Landis and Baker create a werewolf film that is more tragic, more horrifying, and more realistic than any that have come before it.  In other words, it ain't your father's wolfman.  (Actually, if you're too young to have seen this movie during its original theatrical run, this just might be your father's wolfman.  But Lon Chaney it ain't.)<p>Borrowing from the successful formula of James Whale's classic horror films of the 1930s, Landis uses both macabre humor and visual gruesomeness to tell the story of David Kessler, a young American college student who is bitten by a werewolf and subsequently begins to engage in &quot;carnivorous lunar activities&quot; himself. The juxtaposition of jocularity and repugnance creates a sense of uneasiness that only adds to the tragedy of David's fate, and Landis is successful in milking from this ambivalence a crescendo of terror that reaches its apogee with the film's abrubt, though effective, climax.<p>The contributions of Make-up Artist Rich Baker to the effectiveness of this film should not be underrated.  The realism and hideousness that Baker creates with his make-up and related visual effects provide the audience with the ability to suspend disbelief and buy into Landis' tragedy, and without them the film would certainly fail.  Many of the effects for the scenes depicting the man-to-wolf metamorphosis are actually ground-breaking make-up effects, and Baker was awarded the 1981 Oscar for Best Make-up (first ever for this category) for his work on AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.<p>The 2001 DVD edition of this film does not include Theatrical Trailers or TV spots--a required bonus these days, especially since a previous DVD release did include them--hence the four-star rating.  The film alone actually deserves a five-star rating, as it represents both ground-breaking filmmaking and great entertainment.  It is a must for fans of the horror film, especially those genre fans who place the werewolf flicks at the top of the list.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I had heard about this movie for years, but I had never watched it until recently. The main reason was that I don't really care for Werewolf movies that much. Theres so many of these films, its usually the same basic story every time, the effects usually aren't good, and to be honest, I just don't find the whole Werewolf concept that interesting or scary at all. But with this film, I had always read rave reviews about it, especially about the special effects in it, so since I found it cheap, I went ahead and purchased it. But there it laid on my shelf for many weeks before I did finally take the plunge and watch this classic werewolf tale. Again, I wasn't expecting to fall in love with this film, but I gotta say, I really did like it. And though the film does have comedy in it, its well balanced with scares as well. Usually comedy in horror films is something I don't want to see, but this film knew its limits, and I feel that it never went too far in doing that. Yeah, this is basically the same old werewolf tale, but modernized in a very good way. The story is of a American traveler David Kessler backpacking through various parts of Europe when him and his friend are attacked by a werewolf. His friend is killed, and David is bitten but saved. David soon discovers that he too, will become a werewolf during the next full moon, and that anyone who is close to him, is in danger. The special effects in the film are quite good for its time, and the transformation sequence of David first changing into the werewolf was undoubtedly the most impressive. But only did I like the special effects, I enjoyed the scenes with David and his "undead" friend Jack, who appears throughout the movie, each time looking more and more decomposed, who repeatedly warns David about becoming a werewolf and what he must do to stop it. Yes, I know, those are comedic sequences, but for some reason, I liked them. It was something different and fresh. After all, who many times do you see zombies/ghosts in the same movie with werewolves, and it actually work? In fact, a lot of people call this film a comedy horror, but I disagree. This is definitely a horror film just with some comedic elements added to the mix. This DVD has some pretty good special features including a commentary by cast members, a short little featurette, and an interview with director John Landis. In closing, I've seen my share of werewolf movies, most of them aren't that great in my opinion. Need I mention the horrible sequel "American Werewolf in Paris" or the crappy Wes Craven film, "Cursed"?? Indeed, this film has been the best werewolf movie I've seen so far. (I don't know if that saying a lot, though!) I think its done in a clever way, and it has a good balance to it. If you are a big fan of these movies, then I'm quite sure you've long since viewed and purchased this one. But if you're a newbie or just looking for a good werewolf tale, then look no further!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Backpacking across England seemed like a great idea for a vacation.  Americans David Kessler (David Naugthon) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) were having a great time until they got dropped off near the moors and walk into a small pub to warm up and get some food and drink.  When Jack asks about a five pointed star on the wall of the tavern everyone in the pub begins to act strangely.  Not feeling welcome the boys get ready to leave and they are told to beware of the moon and keep to the road.<br /><br />After they leave the pub owner tells the people there that they have to go get the boys and that they shouldn't have let them leave the pub.  A loud howling is heard outside and the pub patrons lock the doors and refuse to go outside.  Jack and David suddenly realize that they have left the road and are deep into the moors and the full moon has just come up.  They hear the howls and are being hunted and then they are attacked by a creature. Jack is killed and David survives as the pub patrons arrive with guns and kill a large creature that dies and turns into a man....<br /><br />This movie is just one of the classics of the werewolf genre.  It is well filmed and it has great special effects and some plot twists that are really good and make the story very creative.  To top it off the acting was excellent.  It was a fresh look at the werewolf stories and that is why it as so wildly popular.  I love this movie and it is also one of the favorites of my family.  This is one of the best monster movies ever produced and it will always remain near the top of my favorite movie list.  I recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />I First saw "An American Werewolf in London" in the theater, way back in 1981. 1981 was the greatest year for Lycanthrope films, not producing one or two masterpieces, but three! "An American Werewolf in London," "the Howling," & ""Wolfen," all different, but all masterpieces in horror, let alone the Werewolf sub-genre, & I loved it, as Werewolves were always my favorite monster, other than giant monster films.<br /><br />"An American Werewolf in London" stands as my third favorite horror film of all time, behind "Hellraiser" & "the Exorcist" historically, but I find myself enjoying "An American Werewolf in London," now more than "Hellraiser." That is really saying something for me & this film, as I've watched the film probably fifty times in the thirty years it has been out. This is what truly makes a great horror film, or any great movie for that matter, one that repays the watcher with great entertainment, viewing after viewing, year after year. A movie that you can probably almost recite every line of dialog, & you find your self sometimes spouting off lines from it in a conversation. That is what "An American Werewolf in London" means to me.<br /><br />"An American Werewolf in London" is without a doubt in my opinion, the greatest comedy/horror movie ever made. It has terrifying moments of dread & suspense, it has great jump out of your seat scenes, & it has comedic scenes that match the terror & horror of this film, a relief from the tension it builds. It is filled with pathos, comedy & creepiness all at the same time in scenes with David & Jack. Jack was killed by a Werewolf in the first part of the movie (that in it's self is one of the greatest scenes in horror) & rises back from the dead to tell David who was also attacked, but survived, that he will become a Werewolf in two days, the start of the full moon. David does not know whether he is hallucinating or dreaming Jack at first, & questions his own sanity. These scenes are some of the best in the movie, they truly make you jump when you first see Jack appear. They make you laugh with their delicious black comedy. They make you shudder with their eeriness as Jack talks straight to David about becoming a Werewolf, killing people, making others, & that he is the last in line of the Werewolves & should take his own life, so all the victims from previous Werewolf attacks can move on from being bound to walking the earth. There is such pathos in these scenes, that it causes sadness, as the two actors are truly superb in their performances, there is great chemistry here. I really can't understand why David Naughton, who plays David, fell into obscurity after this film, his sad, funny, & terrifying performance as the man doomed to be a werewolf is one of the greatest performances in horror. You really feel empathy for this person. You care what happens to him. You feel his pain. Also a special mention for David's dream's sequences, truly disturbing dreams.<br /><br />All of the actors in this movie give top flight performances, from the men & a woman at the Slaughtered Lamb, to the doctor who cares for David, to the beautiful, truly talented actress, Jenny Agutter, the nurse who falls in love with David. The end scene is a real heart wrencher. I'm not  ashamed to say, even after all these years, it gets me every time.<br /><br />The make-up & transformation scene in this film was & still is a landmark, & 30 years latter, it has not been matched, though "the Howling" came close. Speaking of "the Howling," Rick Baker started doing make up for that film, but then left for "An American Werewolf in London," because this was his & John Landis's dream movie. Rob Bottin then took over the reins for the make up of "the Howling" & did a wonderful job, as he has many times since. I've always liked two legged Werewolves over four, but it is a great tribute to Rick Baker, that he has made the most terrifying Werewolf ever, one with four legs. A hound straight from hell, right in to your worse nightmare!<br /><br />A special mention has to be made about the soundtrack to this film, one of the greatest in horror! "Blue Moon," "Moon Dance, & "Bad Moon Rising," really add atmosphere to this film. The original music is great too, especially during the scenes with Jack & David. All of sound track first rate, which is so important to making a film more successful!<br /><br />Anyone who has even a remote interest in horror films must see "An American Werewolf in London, not only because it is the greatest Werewolf film ever made, or for that matter, one of the greatest horror films ever made, but it's more than that, it is a masterpiece of movie making! Long destined to be a film remembered for decades to come!<br /><br />The Blu ray was great! Though there is some grain in some of the scenes shot at a distance, but the close ups are crisp. The colors are vivid. The sound is great for a film this age. Well worth the upgrade!</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"An American Werewolf In London" is an expertly crafted horror classic.  It is one of my favorite werewolf films for numerous reasons:  It was written and directed by John Landis who also gave us the late Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video.  Davis Kessler`s (David Naughton) transformation into the werewolf was created by makeup artist Rick Baker who also worked on Eddie Murphy`s "The Nutty Professor" and Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes."  The scenes on the Welsh moors were very eerie and gothic; they were reminiscent of the horror films produced by Hammer in the late fifties to early seventies.  Gorgeous Jenny Agutter of "Logan's Run" fame is perfect as the beautiful Nurse Alex Price who falls in love with the horrible beast that is terrorizing London.  Alas, as in so many other films of this nature (such as "King Kong") beauty can never have the beast.<br /><br />  Normally, I don't like humor mixed in with my horror.  However, due to Landis' superb direction, the humor doesn't distract from the horror.  My favorite scene:  When the werewolf breaks out of the porn theatre in Picadilly Circus; mayhem and panic ensue.  "An American Werewolf in London" has a high body count that will not disappoint.  It rivals "The Howling" - another classic that was released the same year.  Wes Craven's "Cursed" - a mystery slasher involving a werewolf - is also recommended.  For connoisseurs of the classic horror films, Hammer's "Curse of the Werewolf," starring a young, dashing Oliver Reed, is a must see.  Also, if you enjoy a lot of violence and gore, "Dog Soldiers" may be the ticket for you.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>For a longtime this was my favourite film of all time, its not anymore, but it is still a genuine classic film, that deserves a place amongst the greatest horror films ever made.<br /><br />The reasons for this are threefold:<br /><br />Firstly the special effects by Rick Baker are amazing. Remember this was made 25 years ago, there was no digital effects then, what you see on the screen was either done with make-up or animatronic puppets. Rick Baker won an Oscar for his work on this film in 1982.<br /><br />Secondly the blend of horror and comedy. If you watch the extras you will hear the director Jon Landis state that the film is not a comedy, although he admits it is funny. Some of the scenes are very funny and this comedy, sometimes black comedy works really well against the horror in the rest of the film. The horror in this film is brilliantly done with the double nightmare sequence being a particular favourite of mine.<br /><br />Thirdly of course its a love story. The ending to the film is ultimately all about the love story, but once again John Landis confuses our emotions by immediately playing The Marcels great version of Blue Moon over the end credits.<br /><br />The scene in the Slaughtered Lamb is a direct reference to the multitude of classic Hammer Films that featured a Pub that went silent went our hero entered it. You will spot quite a few well known faces in the Slaughtered Lamb including a fresh-faced looking Rik Mayall.<br /><br />The extras on this edition are pretty good, with both Rick Baker and Jon Landis having some interesting things to say. Perhaps the most surprising was that Jon Landis wrote the script for this film in 1969. There's also some fascinating stuff on how Rick Baker created the amazing special effects.<br /><br />Beware of the moon.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>'An American Werewolf in London' is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, and is also one of the very few ones which actually works as a horror film.  Overall the humor is perhaps more important than the horror, but most horror-comedies don't take themselves seriously at all.  The film has a bizarre, unsteady tone, and the humorous and horrific elements are often juxtaposed unexpectedly, which will doubtless aggravate many.  Frankly, it doesn't really have much particular drive much of the time either, but the individual scenes all play nicely enough that it all still works.  Also, it's got some of the most awesome practical special effects of all-time.  Definitely one of the most worthwhile werewolf movies of all-time.<br /><br />The film opens with two young American, David and Jack, hitchhiking across the English moors, and eventually entering a pub ominously named 'The Slaughtered Lamb'.  The locals are rude and distant, so they eventually wander off into the night.  Turns out this wasn't such a wonderful idea, and that the locals did indeed have good reason to be in a bad mood:  There is a werewolf on the prowl, which attacks David and Jack, and is then dispatched by the locals.  Jack is killed but David survives and is hospitalized.  That's just the beginning, of course, and we all know what happens when you're bitten by a werewolf.<br /><br />Again, the film doesn't have an overwhelming amount of narrative thrust.  We have the setup, then David basically sits around for a while and falls in love with the nurse, Alex, there are some  amusing and strange dream sequences and eventually David turns into a werewolf leading to the final climax.  Still, we've got some fun stuff going on.  The film is rarely, ya know, laugh out loud funny, but it's consistenly amusing and clevr.  The best humor involves the mangled, gradually desiccated corpse of Jack who comes to David repeatedly, telling him to kill himself.  He's got most of the best lines, and is very nicely played by Griffin Dunne.  He's a humorous character, but not with out a certain menace.  David Naughton is good in the lead, your standard average everyman type character, but likable and believable enough.  Unlike many horror movies, humorous or otherwise, Landis really tries to get you to like the major protagonist, and succeeds, so the film has got a lot more human interest than a lot of horror films.<br /><br />The movie becomes a fair bit darker and more violent in the climax, though they certainly don't abandon humor entirely.  The transformation scenes are still extremely impressive today, and I do not doubt that they would've caused your head to explode back in '81.  The werewolf itself is less impressive, but I've seen a lot worse.  The major stalking/killing scenes are sharply done, and, again, played almost completely straight.  The ending is, perhaps, slightly anticlimactic, though it is nicely chaotic, with numerous car crashes and whatnot.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  A weird movie, but I like it.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This is one of the first horror movies where the make-up and transformation effects were truly frightening and realistic, even though we've certainly come a long way since this 1981 cult favorite.  Director John Landis has helmed a whimsically humorous yet terrifying vision of the standard werewolf movie.  Originally chastised for its extremely violent climax in Piccadilly Square, this movie still remains a pretty effective thriller.  David Naughton eschewed his Dr. Pepper background as the young American who survives a werewolf attack only to find he is destined to become one.  Griffin Dunne as his friend Jack is fun as his deceased friend who comes back in varying degenerative stages to try and convince Naughton to kill himself lest he does more killing.  Lovely Jenny Agutter and austere John Woodvine offer fine support, but it's really Rick Baker's marvelous makeup that steals the movie.  The movie spawned a less effective sequel set in Paris.  This one is the best though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>David Kessler and Jack Goodman are two young Americans backpacking through Europe, just trying to have a carefree, good time. On a particularly chilly night, they find themselves wandering across an English countryside and getting pretty desperate for shelter, when they come across a pub called "The Slaughtered Lamb." Not deterred by the graphic advertisement, inside, they find the pub is really quite cozy and atmospheric. Fellows are playing darts, having a game of chess, telling politically incorrect yet totally hilarious jokes... Everyone seems a bit disturbed at first sight of the two American travelers, but things warm up once they are accepted as being completely harmless. That is, until Jack asks the forbidden question: "What's that star on the wall for?" The two young men are quickly turned out into the cold without an answer. If only they had known, but the only information they were given was a bit of advice: Beware the moon... and stick to the road. But these are two carefree American boys just looking for a good time. They're not worried about things like...werewolves! After only walking a short distance, the boys have wandered off the road and onto the moors, and only a few moments later, they are being circled by something horrible! The fog is too thick to see, but before they can react, the beast has attacked! In seconds, Jack Goodman is ripped to shreds! His friend David is running in fear! He stops to think for a moment, then runs back to help is already dead friend. Now, David is the one being slashed at, but before the creature can do his worst, a shot rings out and it's all over.<br /><br />David wakes up to find himself in a London hospital 2 weeks later, desperately searching for his less fortunate best friend. He is cheerfully informed of his situation by the stern but benign Dr. Hirsch and the short-tempered American representative, Mr. Collins. But when David insists that it was a wolf that attacked him, he is treated less than respectfully. It seems to have been confirmed that it was an escaped lunatic that did the damage to David and Jack, and no one is interested in hearing otherwise. David is frustrated, and his new animalistic nightmares aren't helping, nor are the ones involving nazi were-creatures, but his mood is lightened as he is distracted by a lovely nurse named Alex Price. Alex is equally infatuated with David, and the two grow closer by the day, despite David's apparent mental state. You see, while having breakfast one morning, David had a visitor: his friend Jack; his DEAD friend Jack. The purpose of his visit was to warn David that he would transform into a werewolf at the next full moon, and if he doesn't want to hurt anyone he must take his own life. When David is finally released from the hospital, his next stop is Alex's flat. The young pair indulge themselves in each other, but all is not well with David, who is plagued by repeated visits from his increasingly decaying friend. Soon, the full moon is upon him, and David's moment of truth has finally arrived.<br /><br />In 1981, John Landis put his own spin on Universal's "The Wolf Man," and the result was a new classic for werewolf fanatics everywhere. The story is very familiar. A young American travels to England and gets bitten by a werewolf. He falls in love with a local girl, but their romance is interrupted when he grows convinced that he will become a werewolf himself. He finally transforms, reeks some havoc, and commits some murders. He becomes a sympathetic character as he expresses his fear and guilt over what he has done, but soon he transforms again and is finally killed, the film ending as suddenly as his life. With the brilliant look of its werewolves, Rick Baker's masterful effects (thankfully, CG free), and the genius of John Landis, "An American Werewolf in London" brought a realism to the werewolf genre that is reminiscent of the olde legends and lore. No silver bullets or fully dressed lycanthropes here! Many call this film a horror-comedy. Well, it's definitely more horror than comedy, despite what you might hear. It doesn't have any more comedy than one would find in the real life of an average, young American male. It's just so honest that it's funny. I was in London last New Year's, and they DID have Dart competitions on TV! As for horror on the other hand, this movie's got it. You may not find the film scary at first, but try taking a lonely, nighttime walk after viewing it. I've always found the subway scene particularly disturbing. And what can one say about the cast? Simply perfection. David Naughton plays the American werewolf superbly, from carefree traveler to suicidal lover. Jenny Agutter is lovely and sympathetic, Griffin Dunne is funny yet convincing, and John Woodvine is the Doctor you hate to love. Brian Glover is disturbingly suspicious, and who can forget the cast of "See You Next Wednesday?" *ahem*  It all adds up to one of my favorite motion picture experiences!<br /><br />A sequel was released in 1997 called "An American Werewolf In Paris." CGI effects, a few confusing plot points, and zombies that were more annoying than funny marred the final product, but overall it was still a highly fun viewing experience, despite all its criticism to the contrary. See it and judge for yourself. Some say it's not a legitimate sequel because the story has nothing to do with the original film. I've heard conflicting theories though. Some sources have stated that the female lead in "AWIP" is supposed to be the daughter of David Kessler and Nurse Alex Price. Intriguing and highly possible, even probable, but it's never stated outright in the film, so I'm still waiting for some official word on that.<br /><br />No matter how you feel about the sequel though, the original "An American Werewolf In London" is a must own for the werewolf or horror film fanatic! This DVD edition, which is the first release (and the only version I have at the moment) offers nothing more in the way of extras other than the theatrical teaser trailer, though I found it to be very cool and scary. For a better viewing experience with plenty of extras, pick up the newer and very affordable collector's edition release. I certainly intend to!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>"An American Werewolf in London" was the first horror movie I saw in my life. I guess it was in the end of 80s and I was thrilled then. As was I about ten years later when it unexpectedly came in my hands. Immediately I decided I had to possess this flick because I thought it's a movie for ages. And till now I haven't changed my mind. "American Werewolf" is a real horror film in all the meaning of this word and it has the right amount of humor ("Mom, a naked american stole my balloons"). There are some sequences which I consider classic - this is what a true horror movie should be like (I'm talking about the sequence with a werewolf attack at moors in the beginning or about the subway scene or ingenious episode where the main character is chasing a deer in the forest). "American Werewolf" looks rather frightful although sometimes it seems John Landis didn't have such an intention. It seems the movie was supposed to be "horror" only in quotes and indeed to be fun. But the creators achieved more than they expected - one of the best contemporary (well, I guess we still may call it contemporary) horror films was born.<br /><br />The make up is a whole different story. If someone tells you he saw a better man-werewolf transformation scene than in "American Werewolf", don't believe this person, he's lying. I have never seen better and I have seen a lot. It's amazing how nowdays they try to make everything with computer graphics and fail because we can always tell the difference between a living person and a computer one. Why don't they just return to good old make up? What Rick Baker (who got an Academy Award for this film) did is absolutely astonishing. Now, 25 years later the transformation scene still looks awesome, I can't figure a single detail which seems out of place. I repeat: there's no werewolf movie which can top this one as far as make up is concerned. Just "Howling" (which by the way was shot also about 25 years ago) was very close but still...<br /><br />"An American Werewolf" to my opinion is the best werewolf movie ever and one of the most notable horror films in general. So I guess it's a must for every cinema fan. Besides this edition has a very interesting "making of" featurette.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>When two american travelers (David Naughton, Griffin Dunne) decide to traval on foot in the country side of English Moors.

John Landis crafted a comedic and horiffic classic with An American Werewolf in London in 1981, forever changing the way werewolf movies, and possibly horror movies in general, are made.  The story, if you don't know it by now, finds an American student (David Naughton) surviving a werewolf attack in England.  Things get much worse though when he starts seeing his dead friend (Griffin Dunne) informing him to kill himself before the next full moon.  Loaded with sharp humor, incredible script work and directing (Landis has never done better), and superb makeup effects by industry legend Rick Baker (many of which still hold up today), An American Werewolf in London is an all time classic that deserves it's legendary status.  With a great assortment of DVD extras, and at this cheap price, picking this up is a steal, and it's a crime if you're a horror fan and it's not already part of your collection.</p></br></body></html>

The two directors have a great deal in common as filmmakers. They differ in one major fashion: Tarantino likes to wallow in Americana in his films, while there is no similar celebration of English culture in Ritchie's films. Ritchie also tends to be far more kinetic in his use of the camera, using a lot of jump cutting, shots with unexpectedly harsh lighting, and some almost surreal insert shots. If Quentin Tarantino were English and had watched RUN LOLA RUN twenty or thirty times, the result might be a film that very closely resembles this one.<p>The cast, many of whom are either well known in general or known from Ritchie's other hit film, LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, is absolutely first rate. One of the great virtues of the film is that despite having a large cast and a devilishly complex plot, one rarely gets genuinely confused about the interrelationships among the various characters.<p>The one actor who especially impressed me was Brad Pitt. In my opinion, there are two Brad Pitts. The better known is a mildly entertaining but mainly boring romantic leading man. Star of such dull flicks as MEET JOE BLACK and LEGENDS OF THE FALL. The other Brad Pitt is one of the most effective character actors in Hollywood. We have seen this Brad Pitt before in films like THE TWELVE MONKEYS (for which he received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor) and TRUE ROMANCE. Pitt stands out in this film as a gypsy who is both an extraordinary street fighter and the speaker of his own language. Approximately 10% of what Pitt says in this movie is recognizable language; the other 90% is some form of indecipherable language. But the great thing is that it never sounds like just gibberish. Personally, I wish Pitt would never make another romantic movie--whether comedy or drama--and spend all his energies as an actor on quirky character roles. He is fairly boring as a romantic actor, but is utterly remarkable in his character roles.<p>Ironical casting: One of the gypsies is portrayed by Jason Flymyng, who played Frederick Pope in THE RED VIOLIN, an English Lord who obtained the title instrument from some gypsies, one of whom he later &quot;entertained&quot; in his bedroom. The actress portraying this gypsy was the then unknown Minnie Driver.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>By this point, I've seen all five feature films written/directed by Guy Ritchie, and his first two still remain my favorites and I believe, his best. Ritchie's debut "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. "Lock, Stock.." also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies "who can't be trusted" because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.<br /><br />I've seen Snatch many times. It is one of my favorite movies that I can watch from any scene and I would not switch the channel on it. I think it is the best Ritchie's film. A lot of his fans prefer "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" but my favorite is certainly Snatch. It is so perfect in its nastiness. It does not preach anything; it does not have deep message or any other purpose than to entertain and entertain it does. I've seen it so many times that I happily expect the familiar hilarious quotes or scenes or exchanges between the characters which are the best part of the movie. I pay attention to the soundtrack and to Ritchie's style that is known for frequent fast cuts and quick edits.  Just want to mention that the same technique was also successfully used in his latest, Rocknrolla in one of the most hilarious sex scene I've ever seen.  Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching.  I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.<br /><br />Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though. You have to appreciate this kind of dark humor that goes together with strong violence. Otherwise, I have something to declare - stay away from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Guy Ritchie's kinetic, ultra-stylish heist film is an amalgam of all the best caper films, rolled out with a punk attitude and bristling Cockney accent. The plot is outrageous but loads of fun (wait until a certain dog swallows a squeaky toy), and the ensemble cast--Statham, Graham, Del Toro, Ford, and Serbedzija--may not all be household names, but their cocky, fiercely funny performances will stay etched in your mind. Nearly stealing the show is Pitt, playing a crooked bruiser whose Gaelic brogue is hilariously incomprehensible to everyone. "Snatch" this punchy, black-humored romp through London's criminal underbelly--before someone else does.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Fans of gangster movies, especially those with some comedy will love this one. I bought this based on the reviews here, and I'm glad I did. Being a fan of movies like "Weekend at Bernie's", "Get Shorty", "Formula 51", and "The Transporter", I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. It has superb editing, great acting, and wonderful music. It was so seamlessly made I have to say I am surprised this was not a big hit. But at least apparently it is getting its second wind like "Get Shorty" did some time after it was released on DVD. Don't be surprised if we don't see a sequel to this one in a couple years. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie.<br /><br />It drew me along and familiarized me with the characters as we went down this winding path. The characters you thought would be killed somehow survive, and those you expected not to die are sometimes killed. The ways they are killed are often funny. There truly is genius that went into putting this all together. I didn't use the subtitles and I loved it in its raw in your face form. Most of the dialogue is easily discernable if you have watched Brit movies for awhile. If not it may take you a couple viewings to take it all in. Quite honestly I'm looking forward to watching this again very soon. It has great replayability and plenty of extras on the disc. The picture and sound quality were excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>A few weeks ago I looked at Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), and I was pleasantly surprised with what a good movie it was. So how could I resist picking up 2000's loosely tied in follow-on Snatch (aka Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds)?<br /><br />In Snatch, several of the actors are back from "Lock, Stock", but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. The first few minutes of Snatch looked like it was going to be a cash-in imitation of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch quickly developed its own story and characters.<br /><br />Both "Lock, Stock" and Snatch are stylistically similar presentation-wise in a Pulp Fiction (1994) kind of way: Characters involved with various criminal activity are unaware of each other's presence throughout most of the movie, but then they are ultimately all connected by the closing credits.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence seasoned with a good amount of black comedy. The acting is great. Ritchie is a master at getting a realistic reaction out of his cast...not just to situations and shocking acts of violence, but to people. The way the cast reacts to Brad Pitt's character is as believable as it is priceless.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of criticism about Pitt's acting abilities, but I've got to say that I am mostly impressed with the roles that I've seen him in. And his character in Snatch, due to how well he played it, will stand out in my mind for a long time.<br /><br />Jason Statham is as good as ever too. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Statham always seems to be the same guy in all of the movies he's in...same persona. And it just works every time.<br /><br />Looking for a blast from the past with good actors, good action and a good story? Look no further. Here it is. Snatch may not be a collector's item, but it's worth the price.<br /><br />And check out Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels too if you've not done so already.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>The plot of Snatch is hard to explain, but while you're watching the movie it's not hard to follow. There are two story lines that eventually cross each other. Two low-level boxing promoters, Turkish and Tommy, get in trouble with a nasty mobster called Brick Top who likes to feed people to his pigs. Brad Pitt plays an incomprehensible Irish gypsy bare knuckle fighter who boxes for Turkish after putting Turkish's boxer in the hospital. His one problem is that instead of taking a dive as instructed, he knocks his opponent out with one punch.<br /><br />In the other story, Benicio del Toro steals an 86 carat diamond in Belgium, then comes to London to give it to a man named Doug whose American cousin, played by Dennis Farina, is waiting for it.  However, there is a Russian named Boris the Blade who hires two pawn shop owners to steal it for him. Dennis Farina has to leave the states and come to London to find his diamond with the help of a man named Bullet Toothed Tony. The diamond changes hands several times and then there's the cute little dog who eats a squeak toy so he squeaks every time he barks.<br /><br />Eventually the two story lines cross several times and it all makes sense in the end. Snatch is a fast paced movie with a fair amount of violence and humor. The overall story is clever and the characters are wild and varied. If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, you'd probably like Snatch.</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>&#8220;Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels&#8221; reinvented the British Gangster film and gave the world a Great new director, Guy Ritchie. &#8220;Snatch&#8221; is Guy&#8217;s Second film, and although it doesn&#8217;t reinvent any genres, it is still one of the most Fun Gangster films Ever made.<p>The Story is far too complex to summarize, so I&#8217;ll just jump straight into the Review. Everything that made &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; such a Success is Here in Abundance, The Oddball Characters, the Ultra-Slick Dialogue, the Over-the-top Violence, &#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Everything &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; had Except it&#8217;s Freshness and Originality.<p>The Performances, Familiar or Fresh, are Wonderful. The Casting of Brad Pitt and the Creation of his Odd-ball Character was a Stroke of Genius. Vinnie Jones might as well have been called Chris (his character from &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;), as his Bullet-tooth Vic character here is virtually Identical to him in Every Way. Dennis Farina does his Mob guy routine again and it&#8217;s as Funny as Ever. Jason Statham isn&#8217;t really good enough of an Actor to Lead the film, he fit better as Bacon in &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;, the Ultra-Slick dialogue comes out of him a little Stunted, but he&#8217;s Likeable enough. Benicio Del Toro is as Wonderful as Ever, his lack of Screen time downright Angers me. In the end it was Rade Serbedzija as Boris the Blade who I wanted to Win the Day. He is a Character that Cannot be Killed and an Actor who Cannot give a Bad Performance. (eg. &#8220;Eyes Wide Shut&#8221;, &#8220;The Saint&#8221;, &#8220;Space Cowboys&#8221; and &#8220;Mission Impossible 2&#8221;<p>&#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Stacks of memorable scenes, Dozens of Quotable lines and a Cast full of Bad guys and Worse guys who you Can&#8217;t Help but Like. Fans of Crime-Capers, British Humour and&#8230; of course &#8220;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&#8221; will Obviously enjoy this film. They should also check out the Criminally Underrated &#8220;Love, Honour and Obey&#8221;.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>Guy Richie, Snatch's director, for those who don't know it is Madonna's husband. This was basically all I knew when I saw the movie the first time. This, and a very good recommendation from a peer at work. <p> What I found was a movie that is simply brilliant. It is filled with some of the funniest scenes you have seen in a long time (top-notch humor, the type of Saturday Night Live, but British-style), and therefore deals in that way with a whole ganster-like plot with originally many separate threads, which are progressively combined in a very smart way, much like the maestro Tarantino would do. <p> If you enjoyed &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (Richie's first movie) you'll love this one. If you haven't seen it, after you see Snatch, you'll die to see it and will love it every bit as much. Richie uses again a large part of the same cast from the first movie (including the main star, Jason Statham).  <p> The only thing I regretted was that Del Toro did not play a more important role in the movie. But then again, Pitt's rendition of the impossible-to-understand-yet-incredibly-funny gipsy was a sample of sheer genius!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>Granted, as it has been written before, "Snatch" breaks very little cinematic ground when compared to Guy Ritchie's equally entertaining debut "Lock Stock". He uses many of the same high octane editing and super smooth camera angles as well as snappy smart dialouge that is hip, profane and quotable much in the vein of Tarantino. And because of that overriding similarity to the previous film, "Snatch" a very very entertaining and intoxicating work in its own right, suffers from the "been there done that blues".<p>That said, "Snatch" possesses a phenomenal ensemble of character actors all playing at the top of their game. There is not a weak sister to be found in the 98.9% male cast (save for the all too brief turn by the charming twins!). Like Tarantino, Ritchie structures his films like novels. He manages to balance character exposition with true development. It is far too rare to see real character development in contemporary film.<p>Where Ritchie surpases Tarantino, is in his ability to be hip without resorting to the endless self-conscious parade of pop culture reference. Tarantino's characters are often too self aware, while Ritchie manages to create beings that live truly in the moment, without awareness of the world at large.<p>Ritchie does need ( like Tarantino!) to vary he work, or he will end up repeating himself endlessly and lose the audience he so richly deserves.<p>Snatch is a great DVD also. The extras are a delight. The "making of" documentary really shows care and insight. The atmosphere that Ritchie creates on the set fosters the high energy spunk of his movies. The deleted scenes add fleshing out to the detail heavy movie and are a blast in their own right. A special feature allows the viewer to re-insert the deleted scenes into the film. <p>All in all, not a great movie, but an extremely entertaining story that out Tarantinos Tarantino.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Some people write in their reviews the movie is braindead, stupid and not funny at all. Well, it depends on what kind of humor you prefer. If you like Tarantino, Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", films like "Thursday", "Get Shorty" and "Way of the Gun", then this opus is just for you. If you can't stand all of the listed above - just skip this one.<br />To my opinion "Snatch" is much better then previous Ritchie's work, more than that - it's one of the best criminal comedies. It's more criminal than others, it's more funny than others. Guy Ritchie actually did his best here and created an atmosphere of absurd, chaotic fun. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt is totally different from what we used to see, Dennis Farina is just soooo hilarious! Now I can't normally see him in other movies - I recall "Snatch" and begin to laugh hysterically.<br />The characters' lines are funny and the way they deliver them is even funnier. By the way it's one of the few films I had to watch with captions - I couldn't understand much of being said because of their cockney (if I'm not mistaken) accent.<br />Anyway if you like crazy criminal comedies - watch it without any question. If you don't - watch something else instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Snatch" is a wild ride with a complicated plot that centers on a stolen diamond and 3 different gangs who try to steal it.  This was Guy Ritchie's second film after "Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels."  I'm looking forward to Ritchie's "Revolver" with Jason Statham & Ray Liotta.  Obviously, "Swept Away" with wife Madonna starring was a misstep.<br /><br />The cast is excellent.  Jason Statham is now a star after the two "Transporter" films.  As Turkish, he has a droll sense of humor, his own code of ethics and loyalty to his friend Tommy played by Stephen Graham from "Gangs of New York."  Turkish serves as the film's narrator.<br /><br />The obvious scene-stealer is Brad Pitt as the nutty Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil.  Since Pitt's breakthrough role in "Thelma & Louise" back in 1991 and through his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for "12 Monkeys" (1995), he's developed into one of Hollywood's brightest stars.  The frustrating and amazingly hilarious schtick here is that you can barely understand a word of the inarticulate Mickey's dialogue, yet all his friends nod and agree profusely.  It really is funny once you get into the swing of noncomprehension.  The fight scenes are also excellent.<br /><br />Somewhat overlooked, but equally impressive is the short cameo of Benicio Del Toro as the Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers who loves crime but has a weakness for gambling.  Del Toro is obviously a highly regarded actor with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Traffic" (2000) and his nomination for "21 Grams" (2003).  His ability to go from Jewish Orthodox to the volatile Frankie demonstrates great range.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones plays Bullet Tooth Tony who is hired to find Frankie.  He does a great job.  Jones was excellent in "Swordfish" (2001) and is set to appear in next year's "X-Men 3."  Lennie James who was in "Sahara" this year plays Sol who owns the pawnshop and has two bumbling cohorts to help get him in trouble.  Alan Ford who was in "American Werewolf in London" back in 1981 and in "Exorcist: The Beginning" last year plays the wild gang leader Brick Top who likes to feed his enemies to the pigs.  Rade Sherbedgia who was in a film "Fever" (2003) with Vanessa Redgrave & Angelia Jolie (--makes you wonder, eh?--), plays the delightfully sinister Russian gangster Boris the Blade.  Dennis Farina who had a great cameo in the HBO mini-series "Empire Falls" romps around as Avi.  And of course, the dog that swallows the diamond is also tremendously funny!<br /><br />"Snatch" is excellent because it combines the MTV-style editing with a complex plot whose unifying element is the stolen diamond.  It's so fast-paced that it demands the viewer to be engaged or get lost in the action.  Ritchie and this excellent cast make this a memorable DVD.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I found it hard to take my eyes off this movie.  Guy Ritchie's flair for the action scene is impeccible.  The combination of music, lighting angles, and sheer verve in Snatch and Lock Stock... is outstanding.  I loved the plotline and suspense.  As usual, I had no idea what would happen until the end. Brad Pitt is almost as good in this movie as he was in Kalifornia; his accent is hilarious. Brick Top is terrifying and other than Dennis Farina's overacting, its hard to find any fault in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Snatch is a bit over the top but it is incredibly fun movie to watch for a number of reasons. First the combination of London gangsters, Gypsies , Jewish diamond merchants and dogs contribute to some of the sharpest and memorable exchanges that I've heard in a movie since Pulp Fiction. There are many funny lines that will stay with you a long time after watching this. Brad Pitt does a fabulous job as a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champ with an inscrutable accent. Dennis Farina is great as the only American character in the film. The rest of the cast is what makes the film tick Jason Straham as Turkish the narrator and small time hood is the glue that holds the whole thing together.<br />Snatch may not be for everybody but if you like Tarrantino you'll like Guy Ritchie as well.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I can't say that Snatch is my favorite movie of alltime, but it's up there.  It has the most perfect cast imaginable, one of the best soundtracks, and a super slick directing style that makes you wish the movie would never end.  There's a lot going on in the movie, but it all comes down to everybody chasing a diamond.  To be honest I hardly ever thought abotu the diamond.  I was too busy laughing at all the great lines from all the great characters.  Bullet Tooth Tony has to be the coolest guy alive, Brad Pitt's character can't speak a word without getting me to laugh outloud, and the rest of the characters are all extremely entertaining.  Usually I would rate a movie as good if there are 1 or 2 characters I like, but Snatch has like 10.<br /><br />Rating- 5/5<br /><br />I have tried so many times to do a review for this movie, and I have failed once again, but this time I will let you read my rambling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>Whoever said Brad Pitt was just a pretty boy? Here he shows a mastery of comic timing. Every word that comes out of his mouth is totally incoherent. Marvelous! This film has "Pulp Fiction" stamped all over it. They sell the screenplay to "Pulp Fiction" in the classics sections of bookstores in England, believing it comparable to "Bleak House" and "Macbeth." This film was made in the shadow of Tarantino's enormous influence on the Brits who love the antics of down and outers. It has many wonderful bits, combining a kind of Scorsese brutality with a Marx Brothers hilarity. It doesn't quite match its model for invention or genius but it is a lot of fun. It also has the virtue of being politically incorrect and is a tad less romantic than Tarantino's picture, which I remember as cloyingly optimistic. There's been a string of these goofy gangster flicks lately coming out of the UK, all with small-picture scope, but with big-movie acting. All one can do is hope for more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>You don't see many movies like Snatch. There really isn't a genre to put this in. There is so much going on at one time, yet its never confusing. Plus, there are quite a few important characters to keep track of, and they all have their own proper place in this film. Even with 1 less actor, it would seem incomplete. This movie flows perfectly. Basically, the plot sort of revolves around a large diamond. Its not necessarily a heist film. Nor is it a 100% comedy, though, you gotte love that British humour. And no, Brad Pitt isn't a main character, however, he is a great, essential character. There are actually quite a few different nationalities in this film. Its all very interesting, how all the characters interact with one another, bantering, or threatening each other. Its alot of fun. The movie has a great soundtrack as well that really adds to the mood of the film. Its really an impressive film that would appeal to many people.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Ritchie hits another homer with this one. His unique cinematography, cutting, and balls-out style works perfectly here. If you like Lock, Stock, you'll like this.<br />Rather violent, but Ritchie has a gift for making violence seem entertaining in an odd way, and I'm no fan of violence in general.<br />Some truly funny characters and lines. Pitt is quite humorous; love the accent.<br />Helps if you know London and its hooligans, but if not, you'll learn about them here.<br />Compare this to most modern Hollywood shoot-em-ups and it becomes clear how much better films can be if someone with vision is making them.<br />Especially if he has a sense of humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>Guy Ritche slid this one out a few years ago, and I missed it. A good cast including Jason Statham plays Turkish (the transporter, Crank) and Brad Pitt as mickey,the bare knuckle gypsy boxer.  Essentially an Action Comedy.  Turkish, a unlicenced boxing promoter, narrates the story as it revolves around and 84 carrot Diamond, and what eventually turns out to be a stuggle to try and save his own hide from Brick top, the underground promoter that "tells you what will happen". Its intriguing how thing and paths finally entertwine.  Must see. If you like Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, this one I believe is better. And if You like Jason Statham, this movie is good as well. A good movie for any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>_Snatch_ is a hard-hitting, fast-paced, fun film.  From the opening of the film, where we are introduced to the gigantic cast of misfits (each with hilarious nicknames and wonderful rich personas), _Snatch_ takes the audience on an incredibly entertaining and hilarious adventure that is a delight to watch.  While many have criticized the film for being a copy of _Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, or a sequel to that film, I would argue that it is exactly what we wanted.  While I would love to see Guy Ritchie extend himself beyond his current scope, I think that he does what he does really well.  I loved his first film and I loved _Snatch_.  At the end of the day, a good cockney gangster film is still a good film.  Period.<br /><br />_Snatch_ is a success because of its characters, many of whom I would love to see explored further in other films-Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish Gypsy Boxer is an obvious frontrunner of the pack.  These characters are allowed to develop and display their quirky selves, largely due to the wonderfully written script.  The dialogue in this film is stunning-both engaging and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />Once again, I simply do not know what people are talking about when they describe the film as a difficult one.  The accents are not hard to decipher at all, with the exception of Brad Pitt's character.  In those instances where the dialogue does fall off, it seems utterly intentional on Ritchie's part and adds to the character development in the film.  Secondly, the movie's multiple storylines are spliced rather well and I do not think that the average film viewer will have trouble piecing together the plot.  As has been stated, the plot is not complicated in the least-it is simply how Ritchie spices up an old, well-traveled story.<br /><br />If you want to have a good time watching a British gangster film, give _Snatch_ a look.  You will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Snatch" is a British crime-fiction film which contains a multi-layered story featuring several characters.<br /><br />As has become a trademark with Guy Ritchie works there is interaction amongst all the protagonists which shapes the narrative, and this at times is presented overtly and subtly.<br /><br />The casting of Jason Statham (as Turkish) and Brad Pitt (plays Mickey O'Neil) was masterful and both provide tremendous resonance to the story.<br /><br />It is a lively movie with plenty of surprises as the narrative unfolds and reaches a dramatic ending.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

Anybody who has ever met a gypsie knows that they have their own 'for all intents and porposes' language that they only understand... <p>That then is the juice of 'Snatch' in that the other characters all make bets and buy things from the gypsies without really knowing what they are buying or betting on, and, they are too embarrased to ask ... Meanwhile, the gypsies don't take any notice, since they understand everyone perfectly, and just wonder why everyone around them is so stupid and practiccally begging to be taken advantage of .... <p>Tyrone, played by Ade, the getaway driver that is bigger than the car and can't drive was so hllarious I could barely get off the floor laughing .... <p>On the technical side the disc has been flawlessly produced and has been cut as a dual-layer-disc allowing the viewer to see this film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:85:1 ... <p>This movie will rekindle your faith in Hollywood filmaking even though it was mostly filmed in the UK .....</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>I love a solid crime caper movie any day. &quot;Snatch&quot; happens to fit that bill nicely. To explain the whole plot would just waste time. There are two reasons this film works: the soundtrack and the cast. The music for this movie runs the gamut, from such bands as Massive Attack and pop icons like Madonna (hey, who's she married to again? I'm kidding.). The cast is great, with some shockingly funny performances by Brad Pitt (the subtitles for him specifically on the DVD shed some light on his dialogue), Benicio Del Toro (good for the time he's in this), Vinnie Jones (thoroughly smooth), and many, many others. There are some great scenes, inlcuding a botched heist (apparently inspired by many crimes caught on tape), a seemingly unkillable nemesis that refuses to stay dead, and a few thoroughly horrible deaths. If you are easily offended, this movie's probably not for you. For the rest of you, it's worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>With the recent glut of similar cockney gangster movies that followed in the wake of 'Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels', Guy Ritchie is back to prove that he really is the master of this genre.  Okay so the plot involving a diamond heist and a boxing ring may not exactly be world-class but it's milked for all it's worth with several fantastic characters.  Maybe it's Ritchie's management of an ensemble cast that should really be applauded here.<p>'Snatch' is obviously geared more towards the American market than his previous movie, with the addition of Brad Pitt and a relatively small role for Benicio Del Toro.  The rest of the cast consists of various British actors, and there's even an appearance from jungle artist Goldie.  However, it is Brad Pitt that really steals the film in his best performance to date as an incomprehensible Irish gypsy.  Of course Vinnie Jones pops up again in yet another of his stereotypical roles, but he's still very funny so who's complaining?  It's depiction of hard gangsters and wannabe gangsters also fits in surprisingly well with the movie's artier tendences.  For instance, slow motion is used to great effect and the camera work for the fight scenes is genuinely inspired.<p>Finally though, 'Snatch' is absolutely hilarious with its quickfire conversation that doesn't patronise its audience.  Ritchie sure doesn't pull any punches.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE "BLU RAY" VERSION ***<br /><br />Watching "Snatch" again - but this time on BLU RAY - I'm left reeling - I really am. It's clever, it's ballsy and it's just so ludicrously entertaining. But most of all - it's easily the funniest film I've seen in years. I mean when you're not laughing out loud (for all the wrong reasons of course), you're sat there giggling like a fool most of the time.<br /><br />Writing wise too - "Snatch" is kicking like a mule, it's confident and beautifully constructed. It feels like a sort of updated modern-day Ealing Comedy - so good and so irresistibly English. I'm reminded a lot of the 1969 original of "The Italian Job" - another gem on BLU RAY (see review) that works its way into your heart and stays there. This is seriously impressive stuff - and especially as it was only Guy Ritchie's second movie.<br /><br />But the really great news for fans and newcomers alike is the PRINT; it's RESTORED - and for about 95% of the time it looks immaculate in every frame. Very occasionally there's some blurring, maybe a few lines, but that's just the rough and tumble way it was filmed I suspect - and those shots as I say are very, very few indeed. Most of the time, it's looks fantastic and the clean up also seems to have brought the film so much more to life...it's a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The extras are there too, which is great - and it's very reasonably priced.<br /><br />You also forget about the sheer size and quality of the cast - Benicio Del Toro as the mumbling gambler Frankie Four-Fingers - Alan Ford as the fantastically crass and violent Brick Top - Rade Shelbedgia as the unkillable Russian Boris The Blade - Vinnie Jones as the man hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony - Dennis Farina as the Jewish American Diamond broker Avi, Mike Reid as his English equivalent Doug The Head - the gormless trio of Post Office robbers, Lennie James, Robbie Gee and Ade - Stephen Graham as the hapless sidekick Tommy who thinks too much about dairy products and what they do to the digestive system - and of course, the movie's trump cards - the pairing of Jason Stratham as Turkish and Brad Pitt as Mickey the bare-knuckle Irish boxing champion. Great stuff. Throw in hip music, choppy editing, apt locations and a dictionary of slang to work out what everyone is saying - and it's as chipper as a bulldog who's just swallowed a squeaky toy...<br /><br />Having recently seen "Sherlock Holmes" at the cinema (and been seriously impressed too), I can feel the need for a Guy Ritchie spending purge coming on...<br /><br />"Snatch" on BLU RAY is brilliant fun - a winner to look at - and reasonably priced too.<br /><br />Way to go guys.  Recommended - big time.<br /><br />PS: see also my review for "Rock n Rolla" on BLU RAY...</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is a film that is not only going to keep you gasping for your breath from laughter, but will also keep you wonder what can possibly happen next. The cast should speak for itself. If you have never seen this movie or "Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels", you need to get off line and rent or buy them now. I could not possibly begin to describe the quality of this film. Vinny Jones and Brad Pitt have a couple of the funniest lines that I have ever heard in any film. There are two many great actors and small stories that lead into one grand finish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>If you are a fan of Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or other crime-caper comedies, get this movie.  It is hilarious, it is entertaining, it is awesome.  All the performances are good, from Brad Pitt's accent, to Denis Farina being himself, to Vinnie Jones' tough guy.  This movie is good from start to finish.  This is a solid DVD as well.  I listened to the Dolby Digital track and the sound was near perfect.  The picture is very, very clear.  And the second disc is loaded with special features, including some interesting deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>"Cause he dodges bullets" Avi.. Other Memorable parts: "Oh that's my jam"! I can do without Del Toro And Pitt. Goldie makes a Cameo. Pretty funny .. Pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I really wish that I could give half-star ratings, because I think this movie deserves 3 and a half stars instead of 4, but since I can't, I'll be generous and round up.<br /><br />This movie is (I think) Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels; it involves some of the same cast members and themes.  The movie follows the intersecting storylines of three main groups of people.  Criminals and boxing "promoters" Turkish (Jason Statham), his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham), and their prospects Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), who is a Pikey or a gypsy.  Then there are the jewel thieves Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), and their getaway driver Tyrone (Ade).  Also, there are the Denovitz cousins Avi (Dennis Farina) and Doug "The Head" (Mike Reid), their courrier "Four-Finger" Frankie (Benicio Del Toro), and their muscle "Bullet Tooth" Tony (Vinnie Jones).  Also, there are two characters who transcend the groups.  There is "Brick Top" Polford (Alan Ford) and Boris "The Blade" or Boris "The Bullet-Dodger" (Rade Serbedzija).  It would be very hard to condense the intertwining stories to fit into this review, so basically, there's this 86 carat diamond that the Denovitz brothers and Boris are both hunting down.  It falls into various characters hands throughout the film, as each character finds a need for it (besides the astronomical value of it).  For example, the jewel thieves need it to pay of Brick Top because they stole from him.<br /><br />The writing and acting for this movie were pretty good.  I mean, the story wasn't anything totally original, but Ritchie kept things interesting.  On the acting, yes, the actors did a good job, but due to thick British accents, I could barely hear a word they were saying.  As for Brad Pitt's character, the joke was that we nor the characters in the film were supposed to understand him.<br /><br />This film is definitely not for everyone.  While I don't see it as pure British humor, in order to enjoy it, one does need to at least be able to tolerate some British humor.  Also, not everyone will be able to follow the intersecting storylines.  But don't let me discourage you, this is a very funny movie.  I think it's one of those films where you either like it or you hate it.  So, enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>What an off the wall, strange thing this movie was!  A lot like Fight Club (which I'd rate with 5 stars) ... funny, low grade British comedy with an unusually good Brad Pitt -- and thank goodness his role is small!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The acme of Guy Ritchie's creativity (and likely his career), Snatch is well-written, clever, and unending fun; the intentionally convoluted screenplay folds back upon itself ingeniously and ends on a perfect note for this almost perfect crime film.</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>This movie was incredibly cool. I watched it 2 times in one day I loved it so much. It is a great movie to watch if you liked lock stock &amp; 2 smoking barrels. Jason Stratham &amp; Brad Pitt make this movie rock. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GET TO THE STORE &amp; PURCHASE THIS TITLE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>I was irritated with the first half hour or so of this movie, as it looked like yet another attempt to rip-off Quentin Tarantino.  This is not always bad, since it would be nice if Tarantino released a movie once in awhile.  But this one started off to me as a blatant imitation, with it's low-life gangsters with fancy nicknames spouting off intricate dialog.  And that's when you can understand a word they are saying, especially Brad Pitt.<p>But once the plot gets established and the cast is able to gel, I enjoyed watching it, and was wondering how certain situations were going to be resolved.  The movie is still Tarantino-ish, in that every character is a crook.  The two major capers here involve the theft of a diamond that could choke a buffalo.  The people interested in this rock are also involved in an underground fight game, ironically involving Brad Pitt, who still has his physique from the orgininal "Fight Game".<p>Now the fights themselves are an interesting situation.  They seem to be popular, and of course have a lot of betting action on them.  But they all also seem to be fixed, which you would think would keep serious bettors away once the word gets out.  But when the fix doesn't always work, then those putting money on it would have to be betting if the fix was "legit" or not.  <p>Which is why it gets interesting after awhile.  Brad Pitt enters the fight game after pulling a scam to sell a mobile home to some of the fight flunkies, one of which is a star fighter.  When the scam is discovered, the fighter takes on Pitt, and Pitt immediately cleans the guy's clock. <p> Faced with needing a fighter or literally getting fed to pigs ala "Hannibal", they recruit Pitt to take his place, under the condition that he has to take a dive in the fourth round.  When Pitt's ego/stupidity results in another easy win, it sinks the surrounding mob guys into further pig doo doo.  <p>I am not giving anything away here because the setup of the movie is that for the NEXT fight, Pitt is instructed to dump again.  Whether he does or not I will leave to your viewing, as they leave it unclear until the very end whether Pitt is going to play ball this time or not, and what will be the aftermath depending on that decision.  I thought all of this was very well handled.  <p>Throughout all of this is intertwined the caper of "diamond, diamond, who's got the diamond".  This all involves Benicio del Toro as the guy unfortunate enough to have it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, a psycopathic Russian to whom the handcuffs are not a barrier, Dennis Farina who comes in from America, and three bumbling characters who don't seem to know what to do with it when they have it.  If one considers this all fun, then this is one fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Guy Ritchie's follow-up to the hugely entertaining gangster caper &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; does not break new ground.  <p>This impressively packaged two disc release includes a great-looking widescreen transfer of the complex and violent gem heist that's peopled with a bunch of heavy-accented oddballs including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones.  Brad Pitt is a bare-knuckle Gypsy boxing champ who apparently speaks a hybrid Welsh-English, but in a funny and completely indecipherable dialect.  <p>In fact, the entire film needs the optional English subtitles, but I think that's intentional.  The point of the movie is that it's all about the comic-book images and the sounds -- not words.  Disc 1 includes full frame and widescreen versions with a funny director and producer commentary.  Disc 2 includes a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, storyboards, photos, trailers and web links.  <p>It all adds up to way too much info for a less than significant film.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  Guy Ritchie's first film was the energetic "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" with its kinetic film editing and highly creative direction.  Much like Quentin Tarantino's first film "Reservoir Dogs" Guy Ritchie's first film was not as polished as their respective follow-up films.  For Quentin Tarantino his next creation was the landmark film "Pulp Fiction" which improved on every aspect of his first endeavor but with a more complicated storyline and more streamlined direction.  The same can be said of Guy Ritchie's second film, "Snatch."  His first film was fun and often exhilarating with its stylshly shot gun fights and elegant camera work.  But with "Snatch" the end result is more fluid, the interwoven plot-lines loaded with interesting characters and snappy British slang and wit (some of which may be a bit difficult to pick up on for first-time viewers).  "Snatch" also has a fine cast of international actors, easily the most notable being Brad Pitt (a bare-kuckle boxing champion gypsy) who steals every scene he is in.  No other character is as memorable as his, but all have their moments.  The actual filmmaking in "Snatch" is superb, with all the kinetic editing techniques used in "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" taken to a whole new level with additional freeze-framing, fantastic slow-motion photography, and some great sound-editing that hook scenes together.  Just watch the final bare-knuckle boxing match near the end of the film if you want to see how stylish Guy Ritchie's direction can be.  This is an entertaining gangster film with great characters and inspired direction from Guy Ritchie.  This is the British equivalent to Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction."  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XFZN4MWNKK4.html">A35XFZN4MWNKK4</a><br/><p>Highly talented writer/director Guy Ritchie delivers another masterpiece with Snatch, that equals the sheer quality and genius of his other masterpiece, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrells. Once again the film is edgy with vast undertones of dark, gritty realism centering on the underworld but refreshingly encapsulates a darkly humorous side to it making the film have an even balance and therefore making it more enjoyable and entertaining in the process. The film has a host of subplots all shrewdly linked to the main storyline and a wealth of characters including a couple of likeley Cockney lads who are two novice unlicensed boxing promotors, Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), fellow boxing promotor Brick Top (Alan Ford), Mickey O'Neil played by Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy who gets roped into the boxing match where his opposition is rigged to win, Avi (Dennis Farina) as the man due to deliver a stolen 86 carat diamond and Bullet Tooth Villain (Vinnie Jones) who Avi hires to trace the diamond after he is robbed. The characters and performances are superb and vastly convincing, the host of plots are well-structured and the attutude-laced dialogue rides along like a roller coaster. Snatch on the whole is an utterly compelling film that will grip your attention and not let it go until the film is completed. Essential viewing and the extra features on this DVD are an added bonus. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Okay, I'll admit that Brad Pitt was amusing and I liked the fact that the Dvd had subtitles just for him. The story was all over the place and the accents made the dialogue very hard to follow. I liked some of the editing and humor, but as a whole I wasn't that impressed. I'm sure glad I saw this one for free.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I thought from the title that this was a XXX porno flick. Silly me. Brad Pitt still spends the entire movie talking like he's got a tampon stuffed in each cheek (sort of like the cotton wads Marlon Brando used in The Godfather). Is this the way these people really talk? And I thought I had a speech impediment. I should start auditioning for parts in movies about Irish gypsies. Still, this was a pretty good flick and I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could. Big Bubba says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>This may be a good movie.  We couldn't tell and gave up about 45 minutes into it.  We've had to do this on some other films from the UK too as we simply cannot understand most of what is being said.  This is because the film is using British working class accents (I don't know what else to call them) which we can't decipher.  I am writing this &quot;review&quot; simply to warn other viewers that if they have the same problem that we do, this film may be a bad choice for them.  I cannot review the other aspects of the movie since I have no idea of what was going on in a movie where I can't hear what they are saying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>Critics of this movie get usually harp on its similarity to "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" -- director Guy Ritchie's first feature film. Both have a flashy, gimmicky, rock-video style, Martin-Scorsese-after too much espresso camera tricks and machine-gun editing that often leaves you as dazed as if Muhammad Ali just let you have it with a six-punch combination to the head. They also point out the British fixation on Quentin Tarantino and how both films seem to ape that combination of quirky dialogue, humorously bloody violence, and out-of-sync storytelling that seems to make no sense until the very end, when everything ties up.<p>These criticisms are all accurate and they are also the reason why most critics are fools. They just can't enjoy a movie for its own sake. You could make a number of 'legitimate' criticisms of "Snatch" -- but why waste your time? This movie absolutely rocks. Everything about it from the cast to the dialogue to the soundtrack fits as perfectly as the well-oiled parts of a brand-new pistol. Not a replica pistol either -- a Desert Eagle .50, to be exact. <p>I'll skip the plot. Other reviewers nailed it. It revolves simultaneously around a stolen diamond and a bare-knuckles boxing match, but the plot is really just a vehicle for A) mayhem and B) Ritchie's terrific cast of characters to do their thing. I am here to tell you they did it. Tip....top.<p>Jason Statham is spot-on as Turkish, the gruff and unflappable boxing promoter whose withering, double-barreled sarcasm is a far more effective weapon than any gun. Dennis Farina and Vinny Jones are also excellent as a vitriolic diamond dealer named Avi and his sword-wielding, Jaguar-driving, Guinness-drinking thug-for-hire named Bullet Tooth Tony, respectively. Alan Ford gives an Oscar-caliber performance (or what would be an Oscar-caliber performance, if the Oscars ever went to the right bloke)as Brick Top, a local crime lord who wallows in his own villainy like the Lanastershire pigs he keeps to eat the bodies of his numerous victims. But the brass ring goes to Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neil, an unwashed bare-knuckle boxing champ who speaks largely incomprehensible gibberish and comes off as a punch-drunk<br />half-wit, but ends up being the smartest guy in the film. Actually everybody in the cast delivers the goods and then some, but my Tam O'Shanter is especially off to Pitt, who destroys any remnants of the pretty-boy image that might have survived "Fight Club."<br /><br />The dialogue just crackles. Americans may be defeated by some of the slang, but for the most part Ritchie's characters achieve the very impressive goal of both spitting out tremendously funny, profanity-laden dialogue and always staying in character, something that Tarantino's bad guys never seem capable of doing. Nor is this movie hamstrung by the long, boring, listen-to-my dialogue-isn't-it-quirky-and-original intervals that plagued "Pulp Fiction." But comparisons between the two are largely facile. "Snatch" is not a better-faster-more version of any other movie: it is its own crazy, crooked, wild ride. But who cares anyway? Another Commonwealth boy, Angus Young, once said about AC/DC's music: "People always say, 'Those blokes made another album and it sounds just like the last one.' Well, give me more of the same, any time."</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>English film made by the director of &quot;Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells&quot;. Lock Stock was a classic and did well in most countries but America. <p>Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements. It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists. <p>The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one. It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond. Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches. <p>The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function. Even Brad Pitt is good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Snatch is one of my all time favorite films.  He took the brilliant creativity and character development of Lock Stock and used a huge budget to make a dazzling film.  Too bad his magic was lost on subsequent films.  That notwithstanding, the Blu Ray is great.  Its a strong, but not huge, improvement over the original.  The video quality is very good, but much of Snatch was filmed in such a manner that aspects of the Blu Ray quality are unattainable (gritty scenes, overcast scenes (it is Britain), etc.).  However, I am impressed.  I would recommend, though, that you be a fairly devoted Snatch fan to justify upgrading your copy to Blu Ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>This is what Tarantino (and probably someone before him) dubbed a 'hangout' movie - it's not about the plot, or even the humor in the dialogue, but about the characters. Watching Snatch for the first time is to be jerked around (and hopefully entertained somewhat) by its elaborate but ultimately meaningless plot. To the watch it for the second or third time is to hang out with your old pals Turkish and Bullet-Tooth Tony, and to notice the little details of their performances which make their characters so vivid and endearing. Maybe not everyone will fall in love with this cast of thieves and murderers, but I think the reason for the comedic nature of the movie, whether Richie intended it or not, is to make it easier to relate to and sympathize with the characters. Someone else, hearing me describe the film, wondered if _any_ of the characters could be sympathetic, but in the end I think that all of them are. Even Brick Top. As Richie relates in the 'making of' documentary: 'I wanted him to be a character that people genuinely disliked...and I thought What do people really hate, and the first thing that came to mind was paedophiles. But my Brazilian cameraman pointed out to me...In England, molesting children is one thing, and torturing dogs is another. So I decided to have him torture dogs. And it was supposed to make the audience dislike him, but I found it had rather the opposite effect.' Indeed, seeing Brick Top's cheerful, earnest grin as he pokes a sharp stick between the bars of a dog's cage makes it awfully hard to dislike him. He loves his work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>I had no idea what I was in for when I decided to watch "Snatch," but am I ever glad I took the time to watch this movie.  Let me say this: this has to be THE BEST CRIME CAPER MOVIE I have ever seen!  Wow, this is such a great movie...I don't know what else to say.<p>Just imagine a caper movie where everything that could possibly go wrong does.  Imagine a movie where different conflicts and interests drags all of these characters together in a unpredictible situation.  Imagine.....a dog that can swallow an entire squeeze toy ball??  Very possible in this movie, in fact, that's all I can tell you.  I don't want to give anything away.<p>Performances in this movie: very top knotch.  Brad Pitt once again shows how talented of an actor he is (and you can't even understand what the hell he's saying!!!!).  The writing is very original and clever, bringing tons of twists, crazy characters, and the most ridiculous scenarios to the tablle; with the end result being a very ingenious movie where everything all comes together and makes sense.  Brilliant directing, as well.  I like the slow-motion sequences; very clever and well-structured.<p>The DVD is very high quality as well.  Lots of special features, concidering this is a two disk set.  Haven't gotten through all of them, yet, but I liked what I saw.  The picture quality is very good and the sound quality is off the hook.  I was amazed by how good this movie sounded.  I'll have to get the soundtrack if I get the chance.<p>Despite what critics may think, this is a very clever and hillarious crime caper that will have you laughing like you would never believe.  This is one I will be sure to watch over and over again.  I am sorry if I couldn't get into too much detail about the story, but that would ruin the movie.  The best part of the movie is that it catches you off guard, showing you something you would never expect.  I went into seeing this movie without knowing a thing about it, except that is was a caper movie.  I am glad I didn't read any reviews that would give away the story.  All in all, "Snatch" is an amazing film that pulls no punches.  See this one as soon as possible!  I loved every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Folowing on from the very enjoyable and original low budget Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this could almost be considered Lock, Stock part II as it reunites most of the cast and crew and it's another gangster movie set in London. However, although the stories are similar there are enough differences and new twists to allow this movie to be considered as a good and original movie in its own right.<p>Snatch starts with some jocular credits, and the robbery of an Antwerp diamond merchant's office by four thieves disguised as Hasidic Jews. Initially appear in black and white on a succession of CCTV screens, then when they reach their target, they're in colour as they grab the guns concealed on the chest of their leader. Seizing an 86-carat, size of your fist, diamond the robbers head to London to sell the stone and of course this is where the fun starts as all types of cockney and foreign misfits then become involved in the theft and counter-theft and attempted sale of said diamond. <p>Among the colourful array of characters on parade this time are jewish jewellers (Mike Reid and Dennis Farina), cockney hardman Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), a truly disgusting underground fight promoter by the unlikely name of Brick Top (Alan Ford), a Russian hitman - Boris the blade (Rade Serbedzija), a fight manager - Turkish (Jason Statham), and Irish traveller Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Ultimately the surprisingly excellent Brad Pitt steals the movie as the boxing `yardy' nobody can understand but veteran British actor Alan Ford as the disgusting `Brick Top' runs him close for best performance kudos.<p>Like its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch is full of twists and turns and plenty of black humour but unlike its predecessor it's a bit more violent and the language is even stronger. It will probably still be unfairly compared to Tarantino but its still a clever and fun movie. My only criticism of Guy Ritchie would be that he needs to learn that less is sometimes more; the movie doesn't need as many twists and it doesn't need so many alternative showy camera angles and film styles. Don't get me wrong, they're good, just a couple too many. This is a four star movie that could have been five. <p>Pretty much the whole world knows Guy Ritchie's name now. Sadly most people rather insultingly and condescendingly know him as Mr Madonna but just like her first husband cruelly christened Mr Madonna, Sean Penn, Guy Ritchie is a great talent in his own right. However, the acid test of Guy Ritchie's talent will come with his next movie starring `er indoors (as they say in cockney vernacular), the so far allergic to anything resembling believable acting Madonna. If he can get a decent performance out of Mrs Ritchie he truly will be hailed as a genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes.<br /><br />So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so? Well, because I usually enjoy "stylish" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.<br /><br />This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.<br /><br />Something wacky is going on every few minutes in this film. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being "Bricktop" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.<br /><br />The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham ("The Transporter") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.<br /><br />This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the clich? that "this is not for all tastes" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Guy Ritchie's "Snatch" repeats the basic blueprint of his previous film "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."  The genre is the same, the setting is the same, the tone is the same, and some of the actors are the same.  Yet "Snatch" still manages to stand on its own by being a smoother and slicker production that its predecessor.  And having Brad Pitt on board this time around certainly helps the film carve out its own identity.<p>Once again mayhem and mishaps help to mar a criminal scheme.  Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) steals a diamond which attracts the attention of Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia) and Avi (Dennis Farina) who each want the diamond for himself.  In the meantime, a gypsy (Pitt) who excels in the bare knuckle boxing department, but who is somewhat less refined in his verbal skills is recruited for a fight.  Through a series of twists and turns, the fate of the diamond hunters and the gypsy boxer become intertwined and story twists ensue that would have been right at home in a screwball comedy - if not for the high body count.  <p>What separates Ritchie's gangster flicks from those of his contemporaries is the combination of sassy wit and energy embodied in both his characters and the situations they find themselves in.  Oftentimes "Snatch" strays perilously close to being too outrageous for its own good but it always manages to not cross the line into satire.  Pitt gives one of his more underappreciated performances of the last few years and makes you realize just how useful the subtitle function is for DVD films.  His gypsy boxer is a pure manifestation of all the zaniness that this film contains.  Here's hoping that Ritchie can expand into other types of film genres in the future instead of continuing to compose variations on a theme.  For the time being though, if you find yourself in the mood for an off-kilter crime caper, then "Snatch" is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Of all the film genres, action and action comedies are where films by foreign directors have reached the quality of films by US directors.  It used to be that the best action movies and action comedies had names like Lucas, Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola attached to it.  No more.  Now the top action and action-comedies are often made by Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson and other non-US directors.  This is probably most epitomized in the field of crime-action-comedy.  American films of this class has degenerated into rehashes of franchises such as Die Hard, Terminator, and Bad Boys, with over-the-top special effects, forgettable soundtracks, and bad dialogue.  England, on the other hand, is producing 1 or 2 great urban crime comedies annually.  It all started with this production from the pairing of Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, Snatch.  Taking a look at the criminal underworld of the UK, we see splices from the world of gambling, money laundering, illegal fights, pawnshops, and the black market trade in jewels.  The movie populates this world with a collection of characters of varying dryness and sarcasm, all trying to outwit the other while staying alive.  Yes there are gunfights, but they are few and far between, and like real gunfights, and unlike those featured in US-made movies; almost everyone gets hit.  What carries the movie is the dialogue, and seeing how the different characters talk down, or up, or to each other; profanity or no profanity.  This ranges from Brad Pitt's take of a Irish vagrant to a Jason Statham's personification of an exasperated middleman caught between a rock and a hard place.  All of it is well-crafted and speaks to the script-writing underlying this movie.  Overall, well worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>What a follow-up to "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels!" It's the closest thing to a sequel without being one. Some say that "Snatch" is a poor follow up of Ritchie's first film, I say that this is an improvement on his signature style, an aggressive and a supercharged 21-gun salute to Britain film/filmmakers. The deftness displayed in this writer/director's pacing and editing is at times electrifying and sometimes simply beautiful. The soundtrack is not only superb and includes one of my personal favorite bands, Oasis, and is used to great comic effect as an poignant accompaniment to certain scenes.<br /><br /> In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element, revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would give his right arm for. (And in one case, I mean that literally.)After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and multi-crosses, Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem -- and how will they get it? Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost his bark.<br /><br />And every one of these stories is hilarious.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who chills his prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) is caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina, a stressed jeweler who can never catch a break; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their roles. In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still buff from Fight Club, as a slur-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages to get one step ahead of the crowd.<br /><br />"Snatch" is great. There are some funny lines, and some of the violence is quite inventive. Several times in this movie I was reminded of the "strange occurrences" theme seen in Magnolia. I wholeheartedly recommend this film if you haven't already snatch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>I can watch this film over and over again. Alot the characters are lovable and some you just want to feed to the PIGS! It contains thieves, boxing promoters, pawn shop owners, trailer park trash, bookies, and the mafia all doing their own business when a small object of desire will bring them all together into one fusion of death, fire, and fury! If you like Lock, Stock than you should see this one cause you will like it just as much. About time you can understand what Brad Pitt is saying with the 'Pikey' option so only when he talks on the film a yellow caption in the bottom tells you every single word he is saying except the time when he explains to the boxing promoter what he exactly wants in his new trailer if he wins a big up and coming bet! Good movie!</p></br></body></html>

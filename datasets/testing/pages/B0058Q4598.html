It is not compatible with Sony's PSP or Microsoft's Zune.<br /><br />The access code is set to expire on April 6, 2011,<br /><br />THE 1951 RELEASE DISK<br />---------------------<br />Has the complete 1951 B&W edition on a Blu-ray (NOT a DVD) disk with 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />THE MOVIE CRITIQUE<br />------------------<br />While I agree that this is a pretty close remake of the 1951 original, it's interesting to note how the driver behind the aliens decision to exterminate humanity changed in very much the same way the UN's claims over individual states' sovereignty changed in the 50+ years since the first movie's release. The 1951 aliens declared they had the right to intervene not because earthlings were slaughtering each other - that was none of the aliens business according to Klaatu - but because Earth was about to become a threat to intergalactic peace. It was the equivalent of these days' preemptive wars of choice where a nation such as Iraq was declared guilty and deserving of bombardment, invasion and occupation for being a future threat to peace on Earth. The aliens of the current release were taking action because they disagreed with the way humans were endangering life on Earth. Having proclaimed themselves the defenders of 'complex life' anywhere in the Universe, these aliens were assuming themselves the right to exterminate the species they found to be a threat to... 'complex life' and were doing it simply because they could - might makes right. This would be the equivalent of the after-the-fact justification of the Iraq intervention as a holy mission to spread human rights, women rights, religious tolerance, democracy, diversity and a free market culture to the occupied country.<br /><br />To the extent that we accept that the motives behind the aliens intervention and the process they followed to decide the fate of humans were well... alien and somewhat hard to comprehend, the new version is not overly-preachy or badly directed or acted. We are spared of any debate over carbon footprints, climate change or the fate of specific species and, instead, all we see is the story of a concerned scientist - Jennifer Connely - and her cute stepson to change the mind of the all-powerful and alien Klaatu and persuade him that humanity should be spared complete extermination, at least temporarily, so that we could prove ourselves worthy of living. There is no point to debate with Klaatu the aliens' right to intervene. They have the ability to do what they please with us because they can so the choice is to either die with dignity or beg for mercy. Jennifer Connely's character begs for mercy and there is no preachiness in that.<br /><br />I have no issues with the acting, by the way. Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for an alien. He projects aloofness, seemingly unphased by his setting in motion a process that would result in the deaths of billions. Jennifer Connely does not overact either but, as the one determined to save our species, she is believable in her quiet desperation. The cute boy - Jaden Smith - did not bother me too much. I can accept that the sight of a woman taking care of a cute and bratty boy not her son might have contributed to Klaatu's change of mind. The GORT, a CGI creation and not an actor, was in many ways superior to the 1951 version but that's to be expected. Kathy Bates disappoints a little in her depiction of a US Secy of Defense - too open-minded. John Cleese not convincing as a super-bright scientist but his is a secondary part.<br /><br />RATING<br />------<br />It's an enthusiastic 5 stars for the Blu-ray 3-disk edition and somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for the movie itself.<br /><br />I am grateful for the inclusion of the 1951 original, I loved the quality of the picture and found the DTS-HD MA soundtrack to be exceptional. I found some of the special features to be worth watching. The movie itself, while the premise was somewhat dubious - but CAN we possibly understand the aliens' minds before we've met one? - the acting and the special effects were good.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5, rounded up to 4 stars should be well deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>A gigantic flying object is headed straight for Central Park at speeds guaranteed to destroy all life on Earth.  There's only a slim chance of stopping it, so what does the American military industrial complex do?  Gather all of the world's best scientists and put them in a helicopter hovering right next to the predicted site of impact, so they can cross their fingers and pray, hoping for the object to slow down.<br /><br />The opening scene of this silly science fiction affair -- where Keanu Reeves in an apparently fake beard with clear skin and no signs of having weathered anything wanders through an obviously fake Antarctic blizzard -- made it clear that this wouldn't best the original through convincing realism or special effects.  This impression was confirmed later as a poorly animated CGI snake wiggled (it couldn't manage a slither) its way towards a shining globe.<br /><br />The story didn't fare any better as American military bluster and incompetence (channeled by the odd choice of Kathy Bates as a paranoid US secretary of defense) met with vague and unemotional incomprehension and disappointment on the part of Reeves as Klaatu.  The screenplay includes some pretty bizarre elements, that could almost pass for surreal if the film didn't seem to want to be taken so seriously.<br /><br />Some have complained about the acting - but as far as I can tell the actors did the best they could with a plodding and silly script.  Keanu Reeves was doing a slightly more wooden version of the wooden actor he plays in almost everything he's ever been in apart from his finer moments (in, of course, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ6N">Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a>) - but that's what the script called for.  Jennifer Connolly did the best you can do with horribly written part - the beautiful astrobiologist who is also a struggling single mother to a stepson played by Will Smith's kid.  Will Smith's kid, Jaden, did as well as he could with an enormously overwritten and unnecessary role for which it's pretty clear his dad called in a favor with the producer.  The kid's got a decent screen presence but only a modest emotional range - he doesn't yet have anything like the acting chops of other young screen stars like Dakota Fanning.  (So why, on the brink of global disaster and with the clock ticking did the main characters have to spend several important minutes working through this kid's emotional rollercoaster hangups?  Why were the ostensibly tender reconciliatory moments between a woman and her stepson, that were supposed to convince Klaatu that humanity was worth saving, written so full of cliches and so completely unmoving?)<br /><br />The CGI work was only a notch up from the really bad B-movies that are increasingly showing up on cable.  For a hint at how to do this kind of disaster movie right check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO02">Knowing</a>.  It had a lot of goofy elements thrown in there as well, and was downright silly in a number of spots, but the atmosphere was creepy, the script was, well, much smarter than this one, and in spite of everything it was a lot of fun to watch, and not quite so heavyhanded with its message.  I'm sorry, but this one was just painful and boring.  Do yourself a favor and rent the much more enjoyable original film instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>While I understand why people find this movie inferior to the 1951 original, I think it has been given a bit of a bad rap. Sure, the plot is as full of holes as a swiss cheese, but when I watch a sci-fi action movie I'm not really looking for deep analysis of the human condition. This movie gets right on with the action and doesn't stop till the end of the film. It's not a good script, but things happen and keep on happening. Don't watch it to elevate your mind or gain new insights; watch it to see some amazing special effects, good camera work and non-stop action. On those terms, it's a three-star movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I know a lot of people loyal to the original would be more than happy to downplay this version.  I haven't seen the original to make an accurate comparison, but I though this was a well filmed movie.  I am impressed by the screenplay and the pacing.  We already see Dr. Benson's life get interrupted by the urgency of something that is a threat to national security.  The reactions to the whole situation are very realistic.  Connelly and Reeves do an excellent job carrying the story.<br /><br />What really makes the film convey the drama is the reactions to the situations which builds the suspense of the movie.<br /><br />Of course, there is nothing like the original, but this movie holds its own for entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>It is a sequence of scenes, some have good CGI's, other do not.  But it does not add up to a story, or a good movie. My consolation is that I only spend a single $1 rental fee.<br />What a shame!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>Im not sure of the message in this movie only that man was at the brink of world destruction. Was it war, famine or the dreaded global warming? I was enjoying the film until the propaganda began (first 20 min. or so was cool). I was truly expecting Al Gore to be the scientist that helped the alien decide how to show mankind his power. Once again hollywood shows not only how it is incapable at creation but can also destroy a classic with its frail attempt at remakes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>The latest in a line of unnecessary remakes of classic films, TDTEST as I'll call it, is sure to disappoint fans of the original and unlikely to spawn a new generation of fans.<br /><br />Even with ingredients like top-shelf star power (Reeves, Connelly, Bates, Cleese among others), the proven success of the central narrative, and access to state of the art special effects, the film makers still managed to ruin the souffle. The main mistake is the heavy reliance on FX which, while quite nice, overpowers everything else.<br /><br />Neo, I mean Klaatu, arrives on Earth in a glowing sphere that appears to be filled with swirling clouds. The US military responds as it always does in the movies, by shooting first and then shooting the corpse again later. Connelly, part of a team of scientists, is dismayed to learn that her advisory role precludes anyone in the government from taking her advice. Naturally, she does what any widow with an emotionally troubled 8 year old step-son would do, she helps Klaatu escape and takes the boy along for the ride.<br /><br />By the time we are told why Klaatu came to Earth - Good news: it doesn't involve rectal probes, Bad News: He's going to destroy the earth - the movie is about 3/4s of the way through. That leaves just enough time for Connelly to convince Klaatu that humans can change, as well as to find a tidy resolution to her ongoing domestic problems with her step-son.<br /><br />TDTEST can keep you entertained for a few hours, but even with the nifty effects it is not a remake that does justice to the original. The lackluster dialogue, unfocused narrative, and meager performance by Reeves will keep this one in the bargain bin and far from the shelf reserved for "classics".</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A mysterious being comes from outer space. SecDef Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), Wants to squish it like a bug before it does the same to us with her philosophy of do unto others before they do unto you. Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) wants to set it free as she thinks it is cute and harmless. Jacob Benson son of Helen Benson is a lying cheating sneak who finds this poor alien something to practice on. But why has this alien being, Klaatu come? He claims it is to save the Earth.<br /><br />This is one of those films less than crank out in seven days. Throwing out everything except for the names of the original story, and replacing the story with a thinly veiled not well thought out "go green" theme. Computer graphics replaced the acting. This version of the story lost all of its original charm and the aw and wondering of what could be out there. An innocent boy is replaced by a snotty -brat. A quasi-scientific politically correct female replaces a hard-working secretary. Keanu Reeves does as well as one can with the neo-Klaatu character. Jennifer Connelly relies on her eternal cuteness to carry her through the unbelievable character. Kathy Bates is just as scary as ever (good job Kathy.)<br /><br />Blu-ray cannot save this dog that cannot hunt.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428360">Little Buddha</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600893163">The Day the Earth Stood Still & Other Sf Classics</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0884110915">Questor Tapes</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>The apocalypse has seldom been so epic as in the 2008 version of The Day The Earth Stood Still, in which an alien envoy to Earth is assaulted by the military before getting a chance to deliver the 'coalition of civilizations''s message to the world, setting in motion a chain of Earth-shaking - and possibly catacylsmic - events.  The 1951 original version (included in this set as a 'bonus disc', which I'll get to in a bit), had as its focus the growing threat of Earth's ballooning military might in the years following the development of the atomic bomb, and the reaction of extraterrestrial life to it.  In the new version, the threat isn't one that the aliens are worried about affecting them directly: they've come on behalf of the planet, which they believe is in imminent danger of total envirornmental breakdown.  Faced with this realization, they have two options - convince the human race to alter its path and thus stave off the disaster; or eliminate the root of the problem (humanity) and manage to save the planet and most of its species.  The aliens's consideration of terminating humanity isn't based on hate or fear of humans, but on an icy logic: if the world falls, humanity dies anyway, and they've saved nothing in the end.  If humanity falls first (and not that much earlier, on a cosmic scale, than it's looking to anyway) then the world and the rest of its lifeforms can still be saved.  Part of the subtext of the movie is that the aliens presumably plan on offering humanity help in transitioning from an envirornmentally dangerous species to a more benign one (likely partly through pointing it in the right directions technologically) but the immediate military attack only re-inforces their earlier fears that humans are inherently violent, and incapable of being reasoned with.<br /><br />  The aliens's emmissary is Klaatu, excellently played by Keanu Reaves - the alien is not initially human but has been converted to human form; Reeves appears to be perceiving both more and less than an ordinary human, owing both to Klaatu's newness to his human body and to his inhuman mindframe, perhaps even to additional senses he's retained while in human form.  Captured by the military and interrogated, he makes his escape from the army facility and ends up aided by a sympathetic scientist (Jennifer Connelly), who knows humanity's potentially facing destruction and hopes to convince the alien that the human race isn't as hopeless as his intial experiences wiith the military would make it seem.  Connelly brings a sensitivity and compassion to the character, that, combined with the child-innocence of her stepson (played great by Jaden Smith) creates an interesting dynamic with the eerily both-human-and-inhuman Klaatu.  The military has more to worry about than its escaped prisoner though.  Its initial attack on Klaatu, in a truly awesome scene, awakens the GORT robot (in the '51 original it was the robot's own name, in this version it's an acronym the military gives it) from Klaatu's vessel, which "activates in the prescence of violence": a towering silver titan capable of stopping the amassed might of the U.S. army in its tracks as easily as a stampeding elephant might knock over a model train set.<br /><br />  Basically, the military is in a race to both contain and try to comprehend the situation, even as Connelly's character is in a race to change the alien's mind.  It's a cerebral, emotional ride through destiny with many touching moments, including one (this one's easy to talk about without giving away any spoilers) in which Klaatu meets with a second alien, one who's been living among humanity silently observing for decades.  Although this second alien agrees with the logic of extinguishing the human race before the whole planet falls (and even ends up nudging Klaatu in that direction as he struggles to make his decision), he nonetheless refuses to vacate Earth when offered a chance: in his decades on Earth he's come to love the human race in spite of all the flaws he sees in it, has even become part of a family; and he prefers to stay and die with humanity if that's the way events have to play out.<br /><br />  The movie truly keeps it up in the air as to how things are going to end up, and with great performances, outstanding special effects, cool concepts and a riveting atmosphere of suspense that starts early and doesn't let up, The Day The Earth Stood Still is a new classic and easily one of the most unjustly maligned films in recent years.<br /><br />  Moving on, we also have the 1951 original in here.  Some may think it's dated, but this broke a lot of ground in its day and still holds up well now, even without tas much of an epic feel or awesome visuals (actually, the relatively few special effects that were in the film were very well done at the time, and certain scenes, including those that capture Klaatu's ship at a distance, hold up uncannily well even today).  For one thing, the remastering job on this was perfect, it looks and sounds great, looks and sounds for the most part like something that was filmed very recently, crystal clear.  It's got a great cerebral vibe to it (although I thought it lacked some of the emotion of the newer version) and the fact that the two movies focus on very different themes (the war threat in '51, the envirornmental theme in '08) is a plus: there's no point remaking a movie - especially a good one - if you're just going to do it scene-for-scene and shot-by-shot; with the two versions here, even though they have the same root of an alien emmissary coming to warn the Earth and being attacked without hesitation on landing, there are a lot of differences too.  Michael Rennie does a fine job as Klaatu, playing the role a bit differently than Reeves did.  The Rennie version seems to adapt to being human with all its idiosyncracies very quickly (some might say too quickly, but perhaps this version of the character was more 'trained' for the mission, or wasn't as vastly different an alien: one gets the impression that Reeves's Klaatu may have originally had a form almost unfathomable to humans) and blends in easily; the Reeves Klaatu goes through a lot of turmoil as he adjusts to the mental and physical differences of having transformed into another species, of another culture.  Both actors played their respective takes on the Klaatu character very well.  In places, the '51 version seems a bit stiff and subdued, but the points it loses it makes right back in innovation and effective undercurrents.  Overall, with both versions in the same release you can't go wrong: two very different (but both good) takes on an excellent idea.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>The plot of this film is well know: Aliens descend to earth to destroy humanity because they see that humans are demolishing the planet. If the aliens rid earth of humans, earth will continue to exist and a new civilization could grow and inhabit it. Since the plot is so well known, I won't discuss it. I will point out that this film touches on so many subjects in provoking manners that it could be the basis for a semester college course discussing subjects such as the following:<br /><br />* From the point of view of literature, what are the similarities and differences with H. G. Well's The War of the Worlds.<br />* What is the significance of one of the aliens' statement, a being who had lived on earth for decades: "There is no way to change them. But there is another side, I love them. I consider myself lucky to have lived (as a human)." What is he referring to?<br />* Why do humans riot and steal when a calamity strikes?<br />* Do humans lack the will to change as the aliens claim? Is it a lack of ability rather than will?<br />* Or, is it true that when people are on the brink of destruction they find the will to change? Is there any example of this ever having happened?<br />* Compare the white woman's black son's difficulty in identifying with her and the humans' difficulty in dealing with the aliens.<br />* Do you think that what saved humanity in this film was the alien's understanding of humanity or his attraction to the beautiful human female or both? Do you see anything in the film that proves that humanity is worth saving?<br />* What does the film say about the lack of leadership generally and the inability of leaders to control people specifically?<br />* Is this a morality tale? What is a morality tale and what does it try to accomplish?<br />* What do you think about the alien's statement "Nothing in the universe dies; everything is transformed"?<br />* Is this film more than a delightful, exiting, well-acted drama?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Whew, I've been on a reviewing tear lately. It's only because I've had the misfortune of watching some really awful movies over the past few weeks. So bad in fact, I feel compelled to warn others, even though these movies have been out and reviewed for some time. Oh well, if I can save even one person a couple of dollars of their money from purchasing dreck like The Day The Earth Stood Still remake, (and only the remake, the original is a great sci fi flick) then I've done my job.<br /><br />The great thing about reviewing movies a year or two, or more after they've been out is one not need delve into the plot, since you can guarantee it's been covered countless times in other reviews. So in keeping with that tradition, no discussion about the plot, only what made this movie such a turkey (just in time for Thanksgiving!). Keanu Reeves looks bored, and tired in this movie. He's also starting to show his age, which isn't a bad thing, since I'm only four years younger than he is. But as wealthy as Keanu is, he doesn't need to star in dreck like this. One read through of the script should have been enough to convince him it was poorly written. Keanu has the luxury of being super picky, and why he thought staring in TDTESS was a good career movie is quite bewildering. I also generally enjoy Jennifer Connelly's work, and she too could have afforded to thumb her nose at this script, but no, she also thought it would be a good career move. They don't need the money, they don't need the exposure, why?<br /><br />TDTESS is a B movie of the caliber of Ed Wood films, that kind of bad. The dialog is a joke, a really bad joke! The military again is attacked by ultra liberal Hollywood types who rather denigrate the military than to actually ever serve themselves. So, the military in this movie are portrayed like a bunch of trigger happy buffoons without a brain in their heads. Just par for the course, and maybe only slightly less insulting than the military portrayal in Avatar. US government employee's, including the President, are also portrayed as a bunch of morons, and frankly I have to agree with that characterization! Especially true if we're talking about the current administration or the one prior. And that's as political as I'll get in this review. Lastly it all comes down to a woman, and an African American boy who become the hero's and save the day, ah, how politically correct!!!<br /><br />Speaking of that boy, wow is he annoying. Will Smith if you're reading this, I'm sorry, but your kid is quite possibly one of the most annoying, obnoxious child actors I've ever seen. It was like nails on a chalk board whenever he opened his mouth. He made a bad movie even worse. Jennifer Connelly gets all teary eyed in plenty of scenes, and continually tells the alien Keanu, "we can change," while never once in the entire movie offering an action plan for how that will happen. That's not a plot hole, it's just extremely lazy film making. It's much easier to say "we can change" than to actually offer up details for exactly how we are going to change. Even more unbelievable, is with the exception of Jennifer's character, the alien is shown not an ounce of compassion from a single human being in the film, yet somehow develops a soft spot in his heart for the woman and her bratty kid in the end? I won't tell you how the soft spot alters the course of the movie if you still insist on seeing it, but it's highly unbelievable it would have played out like that were such an event to happen.<br /><br />The special effects, yeah, they were there and they did their jobs, but nothing special, nothing you wouldn't expect in a sci fi flick made in the past five years. Definitely not the effects bonanza of Avatar, but enough to get the job done. In the words of Forrest Gump, "And that's all I have to say about that."<br /><br />So, what he have is a quasi environmental flick that offers absolutely zero ideas for how us dumb humans will change our destructive behaviors It's preachy and condescending, and says absolutely nothing new. Of course the original Earth had nothing to do with environmental issues, but I guess the filmmakers felt they needed to make it relevant for this day and age. That would be okay if it were a good movie, but it's not. I get the feeling there were lots of script re-writes, as the movie has one of the most abrupt endings in recent memory. You could just tell everyone involved with the film knew they had a turkey on their hands and said to the heck with this, let's get it over with already! The movie offers no payoff, and thus is a waste of an hour and 45 minutes of your time. An empty, hollow movie, with bad dialog, sleep walking actors (Connelly looks almost as bored as Keanu throughout), run of the mill special effects, insulting portrayal of our military, and lots of condemnation with absolutely no solutions or fresh ideas. Sounds like a great sci fi flick, doesn't it?!<br /><br />Lastly, the cameo by John Cleese was strange and out of left field. Either he really needs a paycheck, or owed someone a favor, a big favor at that!</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I kept waiting for the Earth to stand still for day, like in the original when the alien immobilizes all the technology for a day, and it never happened!  So, there really wasn't a "day" when everything stands still in this movie, but to me that's the least of it's problems.<br /><br />Warning, spoilers ahead!<br /><br />In this remake (more like a re-imagining) of the venerable 50's sci-fi classic, an alien character so wooden that he made me long for an Al Gore lecture arrives on Earth to tell the United Nations that we are all going to be irradicated so that the planet can be saved.<br /><br />Why tell us at all then?  Did this organization of alien civilizations just want us to know why we are all going to die before they kill us? No chance to change here; you threaten the planet and you're dead!  It's obvious to me that these alien civilizations had already advanced thousands of years beyond us technology while preserving their own planets, so why not just give us a few clues and help us out a bit?<br /><br />Nope, these aliens -- who have already arrived in their technology advanced eco-utopias -- just look at humanity as an object of contempt and decide they want us elimnated before another planet killing day goes by.  They are supposedly our moral superiors, yet they would commit genocide without any qualms whatsoever.<br /><br />Thankfully, the sleepwalking "Al Gore from space" sees the love of a mother for a child and decides to give us an alternative to annihilation (one I suppose he never would have thought of after observing humanity for seventy years).  He decides we have to change our lifestyle.  Never heard that one before!<br /><br />Rather than being turned to dust, we get to lose all our electricity and machines.  We get to go back to those wonderful times before the industrial revolution where the average life span was somewhere in the forties and half of all our children died as we were trying to raise them, and most of us worked from sun up 'till sundown on the farm.  But at least the planet was safe!<br /><br />This movie at least gives us a future with no more movies, and if all they're going to be are propaganda pieces that take their names from the classics, it can't be all that bad.<br /><br />Buy why stop here?  How about a reimagined Forbidden Planet where the Krell all died from global warming?  How about a remiagined Metropolis where it's not humanity that's being exploited; it's the planet!  How about a movie where a group of super rich Hollywood elites make a movie that does nothing more but to fill us with hopelessness and self-loathing and presents the only solution as the roll back of civilization to the dark ages?  This must be how rich liberals assuage their guilt.<br /><br />So, two stars from me, but one is just for Jennifer Connelly, who reminds me of a time when all I wanted in life was to snag a really attractive and smart brunette.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>It's humorous to find these reviews as polarized as the human dilemna showcased in "The Day The Earth Stood Still".Yes, it is a remake (some will say are worse than sequels). The story has been altered to "modernize" it. Some roles were mis-cast. The basic story remains, however, and it is this that I review here.<br /><br />Comparisons between the 1951 original and this new incarnation are valid, because well hey, they used the title, right? Inevitably we look to Michael Rennie and Keanu Reeves. Mr. Rennie's performance was excellent for the times (I remember thinking so at the time). Rennie's "Klaatu" was an extremely informed EBE with knowledge of our habits, languages and technology, but THAT'S where things unravel just a bit. He seems to know everything about us, yet has conceptual difficulties on the simplest of human traits.<br /><br />So does Mr. Reeves' "Klaatu". For this new rendering, however, we get to see his "birth", and the synaptic difficulties he has with this new body. It's really not a stretch at this point to say that "he" actually has to experience being human to be able to make an "informed" decision regarding our fate (Reeves' conversation with James Hong's character confirms this). Reeves' "Klaatu" was a flat, very nearly monotone, dull and more than just a little forgettable kind of "person". How better to be, if you happen to be the one thing on Earth that Governments will kill to obtain.<br /><br />I LIKED GORT. In both films. Strong silent type you can't beat up, doesn't like violence and doesn't take crap from anyone (where can I get one?). In the 1951 original, GORT was just a somewhat minor character next to Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal.<br />In this new film, GORT gets to show off more of his race's capabilities that were only touched upon, in the 1951 original. The uneasiness of just being around Artificial Intelligence is effectively conveyed.<br /> Now we come to the heart of the matter. We all gonna die unless we shape up! In the 1951 original, it was goverments knocking off the wars and nukes, to save the Earth, and with it, ourselves. In the new film, we get an environmental message. Quit pooping where you eat, quit killing all the animals and quit polluting this rarest of worlds in the universe. Respect the Earth, and we save ourselves. They are both prime examples of their respective times. Still, the message remains the same.<br /><br />The lack of restraint and foresight on the part of us humans, upon Klaatu's arrival in both films underscores just how primitive we still are. Still, the preaching was uncomfortable, and that's how it was meant to be taken.<br /><br />I still find this rendering of "The Day The Earth Stood Still" a good one. the message is relevant to our times, and some would dislike this film because of it. This is NOT a political issue. It's a human one. If present methods don't seem to be doing much, reach a wider audience. What's wrong with that?</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>I am a sucker for sci-fi movies and, having loved the 1951 Robert Wise classic of the same name, starring Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu, I was ready to see what Keanu Reeves would do in that same role of intergalactic messenger. The answer is: apparently nothing. It was just Keanu being Keanu.<br /><br />Robert Wise did more in 1951 with what he had to work with than Scott Derrickson had in 2008, which goes to show you that special effects alone do not make a film.  Although it gets off to a promising start and the special effects are excellent, after the first half hour of the film it is strictly downhill.<br /><br />The storyline is simple. Klaatu, an extraterrestrial, comes to Earth with his assistant on a mission. It appears that Earthlings have been observed by a superior species and found wanting. In the original 1951 film, the mission was clear. Klaatu lets the earthlings know that they need to clean up their act or they will be destroyed.  In the 2008 remake, Klaatu's message is that he has actually come to destroy Earthlings, because we have been found wanting.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, in the role of Dr. Helen Bensen, a supposed top-notch scientist, gets all weepy with Klaatu, begging for another chance. Moreover, the constant interjection of the cute kid, played by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett's son, is really annoying and adds very little to this muddle of a film. It probably would have been a better film, if the whole subplot involving this child were removed, as it only weakened the film with all its sentimental claptrap.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Klaatu is left to ponder that age old question: just what is an Alien to do when confronted by a beautiful Earthling whose beautiful eyes well up with tears every time the Alien mentions killing off all of humanity? By now, everyone watching this film knows the answer, but Klaatu's last minute epiphany just does not ring true.<br /><br />This film is an example of science fiction overlaid with a lot of sentimental hogwash. It ends up being much ado about nothing. Still, sci-fi fans, such as myself, will probably want to see for themselves what all the fuss is about.  So, rent it before thinking of buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>My all-time favorite film, regardless of genre, has always been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a> (1951). Director Robert Wise -- RIP -- was one of the few directors of his time who could pull off such a controversial film. Wise wasn't known for pulling any punches, regardless of the climate we were in. Examples of his stellar work can be seen all over his resume: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008972S">West Side Story</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04OM">The Sound of Music</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305077487">The Andromeda Strain</a>, just to drop the names of a few of his more highly acclaimed films. I own just about every one of his films, including all the versions of The Day The Earth Stood Still (from Betamax to Laserdisc and now the Blu-Ray DVD release). I usually watch it a couple times a year, just to remind myself of just how good a film it was. The lighting. The clarity of the spaceship. The incredible challenge the story presented in a time when the threat of nuclear war loomed large. This is what great film making is all about.<br /><br />So when I heard they were remaking my favorite flick, I screamed and my eyes went red. Can't Hollywood leave well-enough alone?! How could they possibly improve or even come close to the original? How do you improve or capture perfection when it's already sitting there staring you in the face? I refused to see it in the theater. And when film critics began pelting it with subpar reviews, I can't say I was surprised.<br /><br />What did surprise me, however, was that when I saw it sitting on my local video store rental shelf, I actually picked it up and brought it home ...where it promptly sat for several days, staring at me, daring me to slide it into my DVD player. Fine. I did it.<br /><br />What surprised me now was that I actually semi-enjoyed it. Not because it comes close to my beloved 1951 classic (it in no way does); but because it doesn't try to mirror the original completely and gives it a more modern spin, this time shifting from nuclear annihilation to environmental disaster.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOKJF4">A Scanner Darkly</a>) as Klaatu was probably not the worst choice for the role since he can play the flat affect pretty well. But his "dude" voice still came through to me on occasion and it grated. Jennifer Connelly (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N0WCLC">Blood Diamond</a>) as Helen was another mediocre choice, not really engaging nor too put off-ish. Jaden Smith as Jacob would definitely not have been my first choice. He seemed over-the-top in his line delivery and I just couldn't picture him as the naive kid (Billy Gray did a much more believable job in the original 1951 film). Although I really liked Jaden in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6U0EC">The Pursuit of Happyness</a> (along with his father, Will Smith), I don't think he's quite ready to play such a role as this. He might get there someday, though.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty darned nice, though, and it was a major boon for the production that Weta Digital Effects was involved. Nice visuals. The tough -- and now organic -- robot Gort was impressive and completely CGI'd. The menace that he portrays was equally good in comparison to the original, too.<br /><br />So now the big question I ask myself is, "Should I have seen it on the big screen?" Hmm. Pondering that question now, I still have to say, "No." The original is the original is the original, in my book. It'll never be replaced, nor should it be. Trying to redo it doesn't diminish what the 1951 film was, but it's a shame that the higher ups at 20th Century Fox thought they could remake it and do anything remotely close to justice of the original. It just can't be done. But, as a stand alone film, this remake isn't too horrible. I've definitely seen much worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Having been on earth for just more than six decades, I feel qualified in saying that the remake of this Sci-Fi classic is definitely the day the movie theatres stood still.  I was 2...that's right, 2, when the 1951 classic TDTESS was released starring Michael Dennie and Patricia Neal...in black and white (of course).  The 2008 remake stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly, a handsome and beautiful duo that have earned Academy recognition through the years.  Stick to the 1951 classic.  This one has all the millennium effects, sound and dull script, but it would have been much better if it had been condensed to a 60-minute remake on cable (like Masters of Horror).  This was a yawner...had its moments...and the only saving grace was the beautiful countenance of Jennifer...she is just filled with natural beauty but she is much better cast in other films.  I have to give 3 stars because of the casting and special effects.  Cut this baby to 60 minutes and you have a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />This sci-fi movie is a "reimagining" or a loose remake of the original classic 1951 film of the same name.  There are two extras with this movie, the most interesting and unexpected one being the original black and white classic on a second disc.<br /><br />For those that don't know, this movie (and the original) are about a space alien (and his robot) who comes to Earth with an important message.<br /><br />In this movie, the alien Klatuu (Keanu Reeves) is aided mainly by astrobiologist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her stepson (Jaden Smith) with some help from genius Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese).<br /><br />This movie has a promising beginning but then settles into a story that alternates between Klatuu & Benson and the army trying to secure Klatuu's robot (eventually named GORT by humans).  This movie is full of respectable references to the original movie.<br /><br />We don't really learn about why Klatuu has come to Earth until about an hour into the movie.  This movie tries to evoke action in the last thirty minutes but by that time it's difficult to save it.<br /><br />This movie is heavy on special effects but is without a coherent story at its base.  In other words, I had a difficult time following this movie.  This movie takes it plot so seriously that the plot stands still with it.<br /><br />I had no problem with Reeves and Connelly in their roles.  My problem came with having John Cleese (of Monty Python fame) playing genius Professor Barnhardt.  I'm afraid he just doesn't look like a genius.  (Compare him with Sam Jaffe who played the professor in the original.)  And the little boy played by Jaden Smith was just annoying.  (Compare him with Billy Gray who played the little boy in the original.)<br /><br />By the way, why and how does the Earth stand still in this movie?  This is the movie's last scene.  I have subsequently read a summary of this movie and now know why the Earth stood still but the reason is not apparent when watching the movie.<br /><br />The background musical score in this movie was not all that impressive.  (Compare it with the eerie space-like score of the original.)<br /><br />I'm not going to review the original movie here.  You're going to have to see for yourself why it is "one of the classics of the sci-fi genre."  The original is easily a 5-star movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  As well, the DVD of the original movie has been cleaned up.  It probably has better picture and sound quality than when it was first released!!  Be sure to listen for the following famous robot command in the original movie:<br /><br />"Gort, Klatuu barada nikto"<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is a disappointing reimagining of a sci-fi classic.<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />(2008/1951;  1 hr, 45 min/1 hr, 30 min;  wide screen/full screen; 28 scenes/24 scenes;  color/black and white; 2 discs)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>At times The Day the Earth Stood Still is an interesting sci-fi, and at other times it's like shaving yourself with a cheese grater. The story is an after-thought at best, the action is few and far between, and the by the end I did not find myself attached to any of the characters, except for the fact that I liked the actors themselves i.e. Jon Hamm. But wait, SPOILER WARNING -- Jon Hamm dies for no particular reason -- SPOILERS ENDED!<br /><br />However, by far the worst element of the film is the sheer annoyingness of Kathy Bates and Jaden Smith's characters. These characters darn near ruined the film with their sheer unbelievability, irrationality, and especially in the case of the kid, the endless whining! URRGHHH! Keanu Reeves is good, but he's playing an emotionless character... Take that comment how you like.<br /><br />What do I blame this poor quality on? The lack of experience of the director/writer, whose only credits are The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Last Castle. WTH? The studio heads entrusted such a huge movie to a director with little prior experience, and no real foreseeable talent? The result is a movie that's best reduced down to the trailer, because the movie is mostly a time waster. Why does it get two stars? Gort's the best part of the movie, and pretty darn cool... Even though he sets the end of the world in motion...<br /><br />Did I also mention that the reason humanity apparently deserves this fate in the eyes of the aliens is because we didn't take care of the environment, and the only reason we're spared is based on the promise that we'll change? Yeah, it's pretty bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>OK, listen to it.<br /><br />This movie should not be compared to the original 1951 version since much of its purpose and message is different.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />I don't think the negative reviews this film have been receiving are totally fair but at the same time there is much, much room for improvement.  But dammit, the US Army made up a name for the robot and it's an acronym: G.O.R.T.!  I could'a cried!!  But I digress:<br /><br />1928 India, we see a human in a snow storm, assume the Himalayas.  Hey, it's Klaatu.  Or at least  a man.  And this guy gets a piece of himself sucked into the sphere.<br /><br />We jump to 2008 (present day, that is) and here comes the panic.  Jennifer Connelly, terribly miscast, as Dr. Helen Benson, one of several scientists who find out that a space body is coming to the earth at incredible speed.<br /><br />Rather than impact the earth and turn it into powder, the sphere lands in Central Park.  And just like in the original, the military over-reacts and shoots the alien (Reeves).<br /><br />The military throughout this film is hell bent on destruction.<br /><br />The US government is hell bent on keeping everything a secret and creating a cover-up.<br /><br />Helen's boy, the little brat played by Will Smith's son, is very, very bad.  It is not made clear until near the end of the movie where this kid's hatred and insolence comes from.  He is like a microcosm for the planet's woes, really.  Or rather Mankind's attitudes.<br /><br />Kill, kill.  No, let's make a dialogue.  No.  let's kill anyway.  Must destroy.<br /><br />The specialists in the beginning are not played well into the film at all.  In fact, they disappear completely.  They were the voice of reason, then they were shut down in favor of military might.<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />The escape from the military facility was good.  Klaatu pours on the power, takes a guy's suit and makes his move.<br /><br />The metal termite invasion:  Clouds of these things disintegrate all they touch, even humans.<br /><br />The spheres;  taking with them what life remains.<br /><br />Bad:  Gosh, where do I start?<br /><br />I have read critics' view of the film having an environmental message.  Not totally true.  Per Klaatu, there are only a handful of planets that support life.  Man is killing this planet.  It does not belong to Man, Man is the caretaker and he's doing a very poor job.<br /><br />In the original, Man was on the brink of nuclear holocaust.  Frankly, with more countries having the atom bomb today than in 1951, that may still be the case, but I digress.<br /><br />Also in the film, we see riots in the streets and destruction.  Man seems to be doing a pretty good job of wiping himself out without alien interference.<br /><br />Jacob, the kid, is such a prick.  Hard to feel any sympathy for the guy.<br /><br />Self-sacrifice and the motivation to survive in the midst of destruction, these were attempted to be played up and they did fairly well in putting this point across.<br /><br />But Jennifer Connelly, sorry.  "We can change, we can change!"  Klaatu:  "We've hoped you could."<br /><br />Why does the Secretary of Defense have so much power?  Why does she refuse to let Klaatu speak  before the U.N.?<br /><br />Interesting points:<br /><br />Alien spy among us, talks to Klaatu in Chinese at a McDonalds restaurant (wow, the commercial money for that must'a been great).  Alien spy has lived among us for 70 years and though he knows we are a violent destructive race, he loves us and would rather die with us than return to space.<br /><br />This theme of self-destruction and rising from it was a fair point.<br /><br />Just, darn it, not done well enough.  The ending fell flat for me.<br /><br />I felt the Earth was quite still at that point!<br /><br />Better to see:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600893163">The Day the Earth Stood Still & Other Sf Classics</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDK">Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Remember when I mentioned about about 'Eagle Eye', and how I couldn't believe how much time & energy were spent on something so bad? Ditto here, but with even lower results. I'm one of the few that actually likes Keanu Reeves as an actor, and most of the movies. But this is dreadful stuff, and even Jennifer Connelly can't make this redeeming. Oh, and especially annoying was Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son).</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>Whilst not a patch on the original, this film initially showed promise with a rather original take on Klaatu's birth/arrival on Earth and some interesting tinkering with the nature of his implacable companion, Gort. Unfortunately, this promise is squandered and the film swiftly finds itself descending into the usual tedious Bruckheimeresque tropes of big explosions, cars flipping over, the plentiful and largely unconvincing use of CGI, and a complete lack of subtlety.<br /><br />The casting is also a problematic, as let's face it, Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a paper bag at the best of times, Jennifer Connelly retreads her performance from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKC3">Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)</a>, Jaden Smith is merely irritating and John Cleese looks wildly out of place. Whilst it was a pleasure seeing veteran actor James Hong turn up in a small cameo role, his presence, as an elderly diner in a fast-food restaurant who is more than he seems, only serves to deflate the mystique surrounding Klaatu and his intentions - but this is no fault of Hong's, who is splendid as usual.<br /><br />The real problem with this film is not the lack of imagination, but the sense that the crew didn't have the courage of their convictions in re-imagining the central concept. An extra on the DVD exemplifies this when its explained that in pre-production, the crew went through multitudinous re-imaginings of Gort - many of which were far more interesting and totemic than the final model used - only to go with the safe bet and plant the original robot's head on top of an athlete's body for the final film.<br /><br />One to catch on TV. Its not terrible, its not brilliant, its not really anything...</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I have been a fan of the original version ever since I was a small boy and even then, I understood the message of the film. Man has to get past his petty differences with his own species or we are in big trouble.<br /><br />Back in the 50s, this was a timely allegory and I believe that audiences were willing to accept such a message disguised as a sci-fi film.<br /><br />Well, a lot has changed since then. Where do I start?<br /><br />Well, the special effects, just like the original, are quite well-done. The lead actor, Keanu Reeves, can't act his way out of a paper bag, whereas, Michael Rennie of the original was quite a respected talent and was an excellent leading man.<br /><br />Well, in these times, we are all being force-fed this "man is destroying the earth" stuff everytime we turn around. I will keep my personal opinions about that out of this review, but when I go see a movie, I don't want to be preached to. I want to be entertained. And, as it's been happening all too often in Hollywood films, the movie just abruptly ends and you're actually wanting a serious resolution.<br /><br />Well, you won't find it here.<br /><br />I do appreciate how the film makers tried to update this classic film, but they went too far and just had to throw in some politically correct world views to make the film "acceptable".<br /><br />Stuff and nonsense.<br /><br />Skip this and rent (or buy) the original version. You'll be better off.<br /><br />(Thanks a lot, Mr. Gore!)</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>The original THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is not only a classic piece of sci-fi cinema, it's also an all around classic movie.  There are very little special effects in that film and emphasis was placed on the writing and character development.  Over fifty years when it first was released in theatres, the film still holds up and resonates with audiences.  It's a film that was done so well, that no remake should ever have been attempted, yet because it was so well done it was also inevitable that one would be made.<br /><br />In the new THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL Keanu Reeves portrays Klaatu, an alien who comes to Earth in a giant fluid-appearing orb that lands in New York City's Central Park.  Klaatu is an alien, but in order to interact on Earth, he takes the form of a human--a man who came in contact with an orb in the Artic wilderness nearly a century ago.  The government wants to know whatever it is that Klaatu knows and if it becomes clear that he is a threat, they want him eradicated.  Enter Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly).  Dr. Benson is part of a group of scientists who were put together when government officials thought Klaatu's "craft" was an asteroid on a collision course with New York and she was the first person to make "contact".  Klaatu has a mission and he gets Benson, and her adoptive son, Jacob (Jaden Smith), to help him all the while trying to convince him to save humanity instead of destroying it.<br /><br />Even though I didn't think the movie should have been remade, I was looking forward to seeing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  I had some apprehension about the movie, but the previews were full of suspense and action and I thought that Reeves would be perfect as newer Klaatu.  I also enjoy watching most anything Jennifer Connelly performs in.  With Kathy Bates, John Cleese, Jaden Smith, and Kyle Chandler rounding out the supporting cast, the movie appeared to have a great group of high-caliber well-known actors who would make up for any weaknesses in the script.  And after the opening sequence, which was extremely well done, I thought my misgivings and apprehensions about the movie were misplaced.  But, they weren't.  After the opening sequence, everything went downhill.  The cast really did a great job of acting but their talents were hampered and thrown to waste in an ill-conceived script awash with terrible dialogue that is basically just a device for a special-effects showcase and propaganda pitching machine.  Not only that, but one of the most memorable characters from the original film, Gort, has been reduced to an acronym that, instead of having the power to save the world and resurrect life, only exists to destroy it.<br /><br />Too bad someone didn't tell the filmmakers to "klaatu barada nikto" before they started.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Ive never seen the b&w original so I wont compare the two. Yes some of the scenes w/ the special fx are good, but overall I thought the movie was just too rushed and there was no character development. The story felt kind of empty. Disappointed</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is the worst picture I have seen all year.  I didn't have high hopes for this one after hearing some reviews, but even then this falls so far below bad.  Keanu I guess has an ideal role.  He plays an alien without emotions.  That is tailor made for Reeves who seems to have the same facial expression for glad, mad, sad in every wooden performance.  Jennifer is completely wasted in her role.  Jaden Smith is so annoying, I was hoping for the end of the world just to shut him up.  The original is a classic and really didn't need a remaking, especially a politically correct version that incorporates the be kind to the environment or else thought process.  Okay special effects, but the film is just boring.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>This is easily one of the worst remakes ever. It's an insulting updating of the splendid 1951 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>, which, though low tech, has a storyline that still sings to the human heart.<br /><br />Michael Rennie's Klaatu was erudite, gentlemanly, and pacifistic. Keanu Reeves (who would seem to have been a perfect match for the role) starts out very strong, but degenerates into an muttering intergalactic bully.<br /><br />Rennie's Klaatu brings a message of world peace and human amity. Reeves' Klaatu seems set on pointlessly exterminating the human race in order to protect the planet's biosphere.<br /><br />Rennie's Klaatu sees the best side of human nature even after being shot and killed. Reeves' Klaatu despises the human race for it's destructive qualities, deciding that we aren't worth a fig. He then unleashes a reign of planetary destruction. Does anyone besides me see the irony here?<br /><br />Both Rennie's and Reeves' Klaatus come to Earth and ask (Rennie) or demand (Reeves) to see humanity's leadership. Reeves admittedly gets the worse of it. He gets stuck with a particularly cranky Kathy Bates as the U.S. Secretary of Defense, a mindless bureaucrat who can't figure out whether to kill Klaatu outright or have him dissected.<br /><br />This character is not worthy of Kathy Bates, an otherwise fine actress. To be honest, none of the roles add anything to Keanu Reeves', Jennifer Connelly's, or anybody else's careers. Was the money that good that these people endorsed this wreck of a movie regardless of the script? I can't imagine any other reason for signing on to appear in this. Can somebody refund me the two hours of my life I spent watching this hoping it would get better?<br /><br />I'm frankly surprised Keanu Reeves, a practicing Buddhist, took this role, which, unlike Rennie's, has nothing to recommend it. Yeah, this version is flashier, but who cares?<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly wastes the Patricia Neal role by intoning, "But we can change" every time Klaatu decides that the entire human race is expendable. She never argues with him or makes a case for saving the seven billion human souls on this planet. She just whines.<br /><br />Connelly is saddled with her politically correct Hollywood standard-issue African-American stepson, a dreadlock wearing little waste of protoplasm played by Jaden Smith, who does nothing but b*tch and moan, kick Connelly in the shins, call the cops on Klaatu, yell, "if my (dead) Dad was here he'd kill you!" and make the viewer miserable. Frankly, Klaatu could do a lot to improve humanity by just killing the kid. Smith would be the perfect prom date for Dakota Fanning in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTI">War of the Worlds</a>, another worthless remake.<br /><br />The irony is Klaatu doesn't kill the kid, he saves him. Letting the little whatnot live is probably a worse punishment for humanity after all, and that seems to be Klaatu's main mission in this ragged movie, punishing humanity.<br /><br />Forget about the momentary plot bump of addressing the United Nations. Forget about asking Earth to join with other planets in a peace league. Forget the fail-safe order "Klaatu barada nicto." Forget anything positive.<br /><br />Just unleash a bunch of special effects mass destruction all over the place, turn Gort into a homicidal maniac on the scale of Genghis Khan, and make Klaatu a hateful, selfish, gleeful executioner.<br /><br />In other words, bore the viewer to death with negativity, negativity, negativity.<br /><br />Comparing the 2008 version with the 1951 version is truly frightening. We seemed so much more optimistic with the threat of atomic war hanging over us in the Post-WWII Cold War Era than we do now. That speaks volumes. Hollywood's got to get over this apocalyptic trash. Films reflect their era. This movie mopes about our capacity to change. Okay, then, let's see change on celluloid. Let's see a director with the intelligence to buck the tide of misery. Let's see a remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL worthy of being watched. And may this film disappear into the nether world where it belongs.<br /><br />I rarely use colorful language in reviews, but be warned: This movie sucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Obviously, a lot of people have been harshing on this movie, a remake of the 1950s sci-fi classic, "The Day The Earth Stood Still."  Some of the reviews and comments are well-thought out, although many seem to come mostly out of people who either A) loved the original and consider any adaptation to be sacrilege  B) see an opportunity to appear clever by trashing something mainstream and big-budget Hollywood or C) just want to make fun of Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Now, on the face of things, I would be a perfect candidate for any of these criteria. In general, I loathe Keanu's career and I can be as altie and retro-purist as anyone. However, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected to.  I think they did an excellent job updating the material and the film's core message for the 21st Century. In addition to criticizing the human propensity towards violence, they also introduce environmental concerns, and yet they do so with a relatively light touch. The special effects are generaly quite good, and are used in the service of the story, not as an end in and of themselves. Most surprisingly, Reeves is pretty good in the role of Klaatu, the stiff-lipped emissary of an intergalactic federation with its eye on the human race.<br /><br />I liked it. A couple of things kept me from giving this film a full five stars rating, though... Although the first two-thirds hummed along at a nice clip, the ending seemed abrupt and vaguely unsatisfying... In part this lack of emotional connection may come, not from Reeves, but from his costar, child actor Jaden Smith, who is uniquely irritating and uninvolving. He's a really bad, flat actor, and the emotional work that his character is supposed to pull -- convincing a skeptical, superpowered alien that the human race is worth saving -- largely falls into a vacuum. Nonetheless, viewers can still figure out what the filmmakers are trying to say, and the more charitable among us can easily overlook a major casting error in favor of the enjoying the bigger picture.<br /><br />Take the flaming reviews with a grain of salt: this isn't the best sci-fi movie ever, but it's certainly worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Watching the first half and second half of this film is like watching two entirely different movies. How could this be? As a huge follower of the science fiction, and in particular, alien, genre, I am constantly looking for new and re-released media that focuses on those subjects, and this remake seemed like a perfectly noble idea (especially since no one in our current generation seems to have watched the original).<br /><br />The first thirty minutes of the film are undoubtedly the best. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as always, and the initial contact between alien spacecraft and civilians is beautifully captured. Keanu Reeves 'mind controlling' his questioner was intriguing as well, and everything seems to follow a dark, stark directorial style, until the director seems to suddenly lose it and gets all emotional. You will seriously not believe that a film that starts with such promise could dissolve into such blissfully idiotic stupidity.<br /><br />Thats when this film becomes half of what it could have been. In between touching 'familial' scenes and endless mother-son hugs, and Jennifer's plea to the Alien to 'give us earthlings another chance to prove us wrong', everything towards the end feels rushed and does not make any sense. The basic premise being that the Alien was sent to warn mankind that since Earthlings are doing such a horrible job of looking after Earth, Aliens would soon colonize the planet. But then Jennifer manages to convince the alien that human beings are full of love and compassion and as cuddly as koala bears, and he believes her (not a very intelligent alien, is my guess).<br /><br />The climax, if you can call it that, is laughable. The alien (played by Reeves), rushes towards his spaceship and 'takes off' (even this is not shown properly). Thats it. He leaves. I couldn't believe this was the end to this movie. It isn't just disappointing, its insulting, especially because it actually started off like a serious commentary on interplanetary relations. And then they ruined it. The filmmakers should really be ashamed of what they've done here, and how they have absolutely belittled the source material.<br /><br />Three Stars.<br /><br />Also, Keanu Reeves playing a dull, emotionless alien was no stretch at all. He basically shows up playing himself. This wasn't even like an 'inside joke'. It was mostly just plain bad casting. The only character worth liking in this film was the Gigantic Protector 'Gort', who displays enormous character, fortitude and devotion to his cause, despite the fact that he wears a mask and doesn't display his emotions easily.<br /><br />For a better film on alien invasions, try watching "Body Snatchers" from the early 1990s (starring Gabrielle Anwar) and "The Invasion" from 2007 (starring Nicole Kidman). Also, getting the only series of "Invasion" (TV show starring Eddie Cibrian) isn't such a bad idea, considering its the best alien invasion show ever created.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Horribly casted remake of 50's B-Movie "classic", this has got to be one of the most missed opportunities to remake a film that could have been improved by today's technology. But where 50's classics like The Fly, The Thing, The Blob, and most recently War Of The Worlds all benefited from the redo, this one just sucks the life out of the original story. Not that the original was all that great to begin with (admit it, all you really remember about it is that prehistoric Cylon known as Gort), but for a story about the forced alien extinction of mankind to save the planet Earth itself, all I could help thinking was I hope the aliens DO get to hit our restart button. And as for that cast, Reeves is even more wooden than usual, Smith Jr. needs a few seasons on Nickelodeon first, and Connelly should rip up that paycheck she knows is the only reason she showed up for this. And about the main event Gort, how can a movie almost 60 years older have a robot on-screen look more realistic?!!? Honestly it deserved to bomb like a fallen blue marble outta the sky for no reason and further shows sometimes you just can't rewrite history. Someone please split my atoms to a better movie now....<br />(RedSabbath Rating:4.0/10).</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>First off, I LIKE Keanu Reeves movies. (Especially Constantine). And I really looked forward to this dvd. Keanu as Klaatu The Alien holding the power to wipe out mankind? Cool. I wanted to see what he would bring to the Michael Rennie's original character. So after 80 minutes or so, figuring they were taking their time to develop the characters, and NOW I was going to see the frantic saving of mankind, and...BOOM...the movie's over! What????? From a plot crisis point to credits in like 15 seconds!!!!!!<br /><br />(Spoiler): Since when do the tears of one mucho attitude child (Jaden Smith) divert the mission of an alien sent to cleanse the Earth of its human plague? And then Keanu just disappears without a goodbye or kiss my alien butt? PUHLEASE!<br /><br />(Spoiler): And where the hell did Gort-the robot go off to? The coolest part of the ORIGINAL was the interaction of Gort and Patricia Neal saving Klaatu. AND in the original, Klaatu really has no power at all. He is there as an observer. It is Gort, the robot, who is the sheriff of the galaxy, created by Klaatu's race.<br /><br />(Spoiler): And with the wrath of Gort unleashed upon the hapless Earth in the form of METAL HOUSEFLIES (supposed to be a reference to the biblical plague of locusts????) we get only an 18-wheeler eaten up, as well as a road sign, and a swirling cloud infringing on a city. Where was the rampant destruction that would teach the upstart humans a lesson? I felt cheated that whole cities weren't wiped out.<br /><br />Best characters in the film? David Wong as Mr. Wu. Wu is an alien planted on our world 50 years prior, to observe and sum up our species. I just like David Wong, ever since Big Trouble In Little China. AND, Kathy Bates did her part. She played her character well enough to irritate the living hell out of me with her `politico-military' tunnel vision. Jennifer Connolly was totally miscast as the astro-biologist who tries to hide Klaatu. In fact, the script didn't give her one line of scientific reference (or background), so she come off as some woman who happens to wear a white lab coat. More time wsa spent on showing her switch truth serum for saline than developing her character.<br /><br />And the script? A Scooby-Do movie has better dialogue when it comes to asking the important questions! There was no penetrating discussion between Reeves and John Cleese (who plays Jennifer Connolly's mentor). The best moment between the two is their jointly reworking a blackboard formula (a scene designed to show their simpatico). Meeting Cleese would have been the perfect scene to show us more about Klaatu's civilization, and Gort' background. SOME was disclosed, but the opportunity to reveal was missed.<br /><br />I am going to watch this movie again, just to make sure I didn't miss the `dazzling' special FX the film touted. I can do the same light-sourcing on my laptop, and there was nothing `dazzling' about the miniatures and CG.<br /><br />Unless you are a Keanu fan, like myself, I really have to tell you not to bother. You may end up screaming "the original 1951 version was WAY better!" at the screen. Remakes aren't supposed to copy the originals. They are supposed to add something and give more/different perspective. This script DEDUCTED frm the original. I am sure the actors already know they were sabotaged by a horrible script....</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / BD+ / High Profile 4.1<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />Running time: 1:43:35<br />Movie size: 28,19 GB<br />Disc size: 42,70 GB<br />Total bit rate: 36.29 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 26.60 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4032 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 4032 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  448 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  448 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 28<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#3 Deleted Scenes (HD - 1m:56s)<br />#Re-imagining The Day Documentary (HD - 30m:06s)<br />#Unleashing Gort (HD - 13m:52s)<br />#Watching the Skies: In Search of Extraterrestrial Life (HD - 23m:08s)<br />#The Day the Earth was Green (HD - 14m:04s)<br />#Still Galleries<br />#Theatrical Trailer (HD - 1m:48s)<br />#Picture in Picture Bonusview: Klaatu's Unseen Artifacts<br />#Build your own Gort Interactive Experience<br />#DBox enabled<br />#Original 1951 Movie - (Blu-ray - BD-25/1.37:1/1080p/23.976fps)<br />#DVD Digital Copy</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>So it's not enough to have political correctness run amuck in our own culture; now we have extraterrestrial morality police?  And if we don't take care of our planet the way "They" think we should, they're going to beam a few galaxies over and zap us?  And, to be spared, all we as a human race need is a tearful Jennifer Connelly to plead, "We can change!  Trust us!"  If all of the above floats your ecco-friendly boat, then by all means pull up a chair and watch this hapless remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.<br /><br />Now they did get the lead role right; no other actor can bring a blank, disinterested, often clueless expression to a gig like Keanu Reeves.  But after awhile not even Reeves's sophomoric ambivalence can salvage a story spinning steadfastly into a cosmic black hole of utter nonsense.  From the silly antics of Gort the Indestructible Robot to a Kathy Bates-led military obsessed with blowing everything up to a swarm of metallic termites (no, I haven't been drinking, but this film sure tempts me) gobbling up matter like freshmen around a keg, this is a (forgettable) film screaming to be ignored.<br /><br />The special effects?  Eh.  Okay.  Pretty good.  But even a supermodel needs substance; at least, every once in awhile.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL lacks substance, and tries to overcompensate with lots of nonsense.

He escapes from the military and is faced with Jennifer Connely, who tries to convince him to give humans another chance by showing him human's good side. Jennifer was human's only hope left, since their technology was far behind that of the aliens.<br /><br />I really liked the movie. Really well directed and has a quite interesting story. There is actually some meaning and purpose behind the story, unlike other alien movies that depicts aliens as evil creatures that want to destroy humans just for the fun of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>I have seen both the original and this remake. I much prefer this remake as it looks much better (and more modern) than the original. Still I don't much like either version. It isn't that good of a sci-fi plot. I guess its claim to fame is that it was one of the first.</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>Boy, has this film been pummeled.  Generally speaking, most people and most professional reviewers really disliked this remake.  Heck, I usually dislike remakes of popular films as well, so this movie already had one foot in the grave.  There are numerous reasons why people hated it and I'll give just a few examples here:<br /><br />1.  Does not follow the original movie to a tee (cold war and potential violent escalation into space in the original vs. mainly ecological reasons -- a very unpopular topic these days -- in the remake).<br />2.  The little boy was a nice kid in the original vs an unlikeable brat in the remake (but since the boy lost his father and is being raised by a woman he feels is an outsider, I understood this behavior).<br />3.  Klaatu (Michael Rennie) ended up addressing a small crowd of scientists and gave them a warning in the original, while the remake did not do this.  Both movies did stop all electrical and mechanical devices throughout the world (thus the film's title).  The original showed this early in the film, while the remake did this toward the end of the film (giving the remake some added punch as well as an additional plot hole).<br />4.  Michael Rennie's Klaatu seemed to be more accessible, more understanding and more human and humane, especially toward the boy (he smiled a lot), while Keanu Reeves' Klaatu was cold as ice (but one can also see a slow hint of confusion and conflict in his mind, as the film moves forward).<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't a great fan of the original (although I certainly liked it at the time).  The problem is, it has been at least 35 years ago that I last seen it, but when I viewed it again (this dvd set provides both movies, which is a nice plus), I suddenly realized how completely dated the original movie now seems.  While justly rewarded at the time of its release (and it grew in stature for many years -- it was pretty sophisticated for that time period), the original now seems ignorant ... or far too innocent ... and just not believable by today's standards.  Face it folks, we've changed (or matured) drastically since the 50's, and so have our children.<br /><br />In the remake we don't find the alien Klaatu enjoying human interactions at all, including the boy.  What we find is an uncaring alien that doesn't want to be here, but was sent to give the ultimate warning ... change immediately to save the Earth from ecological disaster ... or die.  When unable to address the world leaders, and finding no compelling reason not to go ahead with his mission, he sets loose the havoc that will destroy all life.<br /><br />Personally, I found this concept to be much more believable (although perhaps a bit trigger-happy).  I also liked the concept of the Ark ships (saving as many species as possible, other than those nasty humans).  Add to that some excellent special effects and I found the movie quite captivating.  Oh, it has its own set of plot holes (it's tied to the original script, after all), but by and large I thought it was a much needed and solid remake.  Could it have been better?  Absolutely (there is some pretty stilted dialogue in certain scenes).  Between 1 and 10, I give this movie a 7 (or a marginal 4-star rating ... actually, 3.5 stars), and I'm glad I have added it to my dvd collection (Too bad I bought this before I got my blu-ray player).</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Don't listen to the people saying that this was a bad movie. It was a really good movie. Yeah, the plot isn't "multi-layered" and engrossing but, if you like Scifi, then I think that you will like this.  It's a fun movie to watch on a Friday night. Period. Oh, I almost forgot.....the special effects are good too!</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I never saw the 1951 classic, so I won't compare this film to that one. As other reviewers have noted, this version has good special effects. However, the plot seemed empty. The movie is nominally about an alien who wants to destroy the human race because we haven't taken care of it (presumably because of deforestation, global warming, etc). Yet, the film mostly tracks the story of Jennifer Connelly (an astrobiologist) and Keanu Reeves (Klaatu the alien). For a film supposedly about humanity, this seems a rather narrow focus and neither actor is powerful enough to carry humanity on his or her own. It would have been better to develop a plot that incorporated a wide range of actors to make it more about humanity and less about Jennifer Connelly. Granted, the film has entertainment value, but it's mere sci-fi adventure whereas the concept has much more potential. I'm just thankful there was no inter-galactic love connection between Connelly and Reeves' characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I usually will vote at least a 4 and usually a 5 on most of what I take the time to review on Amazon.  In this case, it would be disingenous of me to do so.  Here is a movie with a great plot, interesting message potential and really great effects, falling very short of a great film or even a good one.<br /><br />We have the movie well acted by Reeves, Connolly and Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son and great child actor in Pursuit of Happyness).  Yet with all the potential, the seeming sending of multiple messages makes the movies somewhat mushy as far as getting to anything meaningful.  As you have seen in the trailers, Reeves asks:"Your planet...?" when he is speaking with the US Secretary of Defense.  You are lead to think, okay, whose planet is he insinuating it is?  Does it belong to the animals, the universe, or to the invaders?<br /><br />I think it would have been a stronger message if they would have had the world leaders vying for what is important to them and lets say scientists who have a different world view.  Even if the message was a little slanted, at least it was an attempt at clarity.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />5 for special effects<br />3 for story line<br />4 for overall acting<br />3 for tempo<br />3 for message<br /><br />Maybe there is an opportunity for a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>WARNING: A COUPLE OF SPOILERS<br /><br />The negative reviews far outweigh the positives for the 2008 remake.  However, after viewing the newer version, I think it's a decent "revisit" to territory that, of course, was better done in the 1951 classic.<br /><br />The updated version - complete with state-of-the-art-CGI - has Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu, immortalized in the first film by the distinguished Michael Rennie.  Yes, Reeves plays it rather emotionless, but that's pretty much how Reeves tackles almost every role.  However, it seems to fit the part in the way it is written in this take; he should have no feelings because his intent is to wipe out all of humanity.  It is only through his encounter with Jennifer Connelly (as "Helen Benson," a nod to the character wonderfully played by Patricia Neal in the original) that the alien understands what it's like to be human.<br /><br />Jaden Smith, son of Will, is a bit annoying but the filmmakers wanted him to be that way, as he, by the film's end, realizes that stepmom Connelly really loves him and is the best thing that the young lad has going for him.<br /><br />Kathy Bates as the U.S. Secretary of State adds her Oscar-winning status in a rather weakly-drawn part, but she makes the best of it.  Kyle Chandler plays another one of his patented "cad" film roles [Thank God he's noble on TV's "Friday Night Lights"!] as a government official who realizes a little too late what "Gort" is capable of doing. John Cleese is on hand in a role similar to the one handled by Sam Jaffe in Robert Wise's original.<br /><br />And, of course, the fourth star of the original - behind Rennie, Neal, and "Gort," of course - was Bernard Herrmann's landmark and inventive score. Tyler Bates' music to the remake is adequate, at best.<br /><br />Speaking of "Gort."  In the new version, he is a 20-foot-tall CGI creation that pales in comparision to the man-in-a-silver-costume.  Lock Martin was much more menacing when he came down the ramp in Rennie's ship.<br /><br />Oh, as to the title of this review.  Veteran character great James Hong has a small but pivotal role as a compatriot of Klaatu.  Hong, like he did in "Kung Fu Panda" and innumerable films and television shows, brightens up every role and does no less in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The new version of this movie is at best a three star sci fi flick with todays emphasis on more action but it has decent acting and is not a one star movie. It's a not a classic movie like the original movie which is also here on blu ray!.<br />So this is a five star package because you get both movies. Studios need to go back and put more older movies on blu ray in double packs etc. This is a good idea. The blu ray of the original movie does not have the extras that the seperate version<br />of 'day the earth stood still' blu ray does though.  I have that edition, the film is the same but the many extras are not there. Interviews and other features which should have been on this edition.

Kudos, Klaatu. Unfortunately, this film is just too much of a target for the naysayers with him portraying a demi-robot. It's almost as if he were asking for all the tired, hack journalists and haters to come back to life from whatever crypt they've crawled into since they were all laid off from their newspaper jobs, to give the knee-jerk reaction without giving the movie a full viewing and a fair shot.<br /><br />From some of the comments and reviews, I doubt a lot of people who gave this film a thumbs down even saw it from beginning to end. Having looked at several of the one-star reviews, I searched through the reviewer's cache to find the bulk of them gave 5 stars to Brendan Frasier's appalling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOY5U">Journey to the Center of the Earth </a>. The gripe about that film was the overuse of CG, but some of the same reviewers that gave it a thumbs up, gave this a thumbs down for the same reason. What bombast.<br /><br />I found TDTESS, not a great film, but not bad either. The thematic elements and the overall story weren't  too overdone, nor was it too preachy. Matter of fact, they could've gone a bit further than they did. They used the CG GORT to intimate several things about our destruction through example rather than just telling the viewer outright, which is a step-up for filmmaking and an intelligent way to spin a yarn.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film wasn't the CG or Keanu or the theme, but the overly-annoying acting by the child ward in the care of Jennifer Connelly. I felt that this thread in the story dragged this film into the sewer and beyond, wrecking an otherwise smart and well done premise. After the Nth subterfuge by the brat-in-tow, I was ready to give up on this as it was losing itself between a sci-fi version of Finding Forrester and something more intelligent like M. Knights <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016CP2O0">Signs</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men</a>. Man's destruction from his own foolishness.<br /><br />Keanu's Chinese wasn't bad either. My wife, who is Chinese, said his pronunciation and cadence were pretty good for a Westerner, but that a lot of people would say it wasn't `perfect', which is what many expect when speaking it. One of the better scenes in this is the surprise appearance of James Hong (Chew from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner</a>) and the conversation that they have in the diner, which really sums this movie up well. Keanu would be wise to partner himself up with more veteran actors like this as he shines in these moments.<br /><br />I watched this on Blu-Ray and found that while the picture was amazing and the muted tones were interesting, you may want to skip the Blu-Ray version as the heavy amount of CG does begin to show in the image processing on the screen and several times the obvious nature of the dreaded green-screen was obvious. `Less picture' definitely helps this movie.<br /><br />Also this would be considered a movie and not a film. I doubt this will ever show up in AFI's top 100 or on the IMDb top 250.<br /><br />This also has the older film attached on a separate disk and is interesting to see how political ideology has changed since the original first premiered.<br /><br />... ...</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Jennifer Connelly and young Jaden Smith are the only reasons to watch this dreck.

This film had little in common with the original movie except for the names of a few key characters and the general premise of the story.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the way that premise was revealed in this new film, the ending of the original was far more moving.  I was hoping I would be able to say that I enjoyed this movie almost as much as the original and was only unhappy with the special effects.  However, the remake had disappointing special effects and a very disappointing ending.  Remakes of films are often disappointing, even for those fans among us who are rooting for them.<br /><br />I still enjoy Keanu Reeves and feel the script was at fault with this poor remake. By the way, the special effects reminded me of those used in the remake of the mummy just looking for a new home. I did not especially like the very human form that GORT took in the remake and was amazed at how much more effective an oversized foam rubber costume looked in the original than modern CGI in the remake. The very pretty CGI looked like art work or anime and not believable or anything to be afraid of. I did like the idea of the nanobots used to "end the world".</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>My rating:  3.5 out of 5<br /><br />Premise<br />*A loose remake of the 1951 film; a UFO lands in Manhattan and an alien named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) appears, who is promptly shot by the military.  One thing leads to another, and Klaatu determines that humans must be destroyed in order to save the Earth.<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality is perfect.<br />*Includes a commentary, some picture-in-picture features, some feaurettes, deleted scenes, trailers, a feature that lets you build your own robot, a digital copy, and a bare-bones version of the 1951 film in high-definition (which in itself is like a 4.5 out of 5 star movie).<br />*The movie has some extremely excellent special effects and some cool action scenes.<br />*Photography is excellent.  The visual style is good.<br />*Production design (props, costumes, sets, etc) is excellent.<br />*The movie bears some resemblances to the original; many of the same locales (like Arlington Cemetary) are used, GORT looks the same (only bigger, and made of nanites), similar characters, and so on.  This film also expands on certain areas; Klaatu has more omnipotent powers, there's much more military involvement, etc.<br />*Characters are not bad, for the most part.  Acting is good (even though Keanu Reeves is rather monotonous, it fits his character.  Only the little boy irritated me).<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*I hated the kid's character; he acted irrationally and hatefully, and I found it hard to understand him.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The story is not bad in general, but the second half of the movie does become predictable and contrived.  I didn't mind myself, but others may be severely dissapointed.<br />*The story's message is different from the original film, gearing towards environmentalism.  some folks seem to hate it, citing it as too obvious or contrived, or too weak compared to the original film, but I didn't mind.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to be dinged for posting a positive review on a movie that everybody seems to hate.  But frankly, I don't think this movie is all THAT bad; it just sucks when compared to the original, which had better writing, stronger themes, and classier photography.  But ultimately, it was a product of the 1950s, whereas this remake is the product of the late 2000s; both are representative of their eras.  The old version was simple, classy, and intelligent; the new one is loaded with style and action.  I found it quite entertaining, and a bit worthwhile on its own merits.  But, most people would disagree.  If you're really really interested, perhaps you should rent it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Simply put, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH (aka Father God), etc. as well as the numerous Biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague or swarm, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. That itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.<br /><br />Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to SPOILERS):<br /><br />- The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, and overly-simplistic child-race. His sudden change into "maturity" represents how abruptly humanity needs to "grow-up." This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a very dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange and powerful antics helped feed this negative mindset in the boy. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands?<br /><br />- Judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an 'Asian' scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment, UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh, final judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn the judgment. Also, although Klaatu was clearly the primary alien agent, who says he was alone? Gort was there and he was only partially robotic in nature, as well as the older 'Asian' man. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another, collecting animals, etc.<br /><br />- The military attacks because their modus operandi is the defense of the nation, not to mention the sad nature of humanity in general, i.e. destructive.<br /><br />- When Bate's character, i.e. the government, finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was their proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own countries and hides.<br /><br />- The "sphere" was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.<br /><br />- The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the governmental installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms (high winds, etc.) so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.<br /><br />Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and thus their intrinsic bent toward death and destruction. The way he put it was like this: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.<br /><br />- The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. Haven't they been monitoring the planet for centuries? Didn't they even have at least one agent live with humanity for 70 years. Their decision was carefully and patiently considered and decided.<br /><br />To sum-up humanity's evil and destructive bent as "minor-league carelessness" is shallow and un-enlightened, not to mention wholly inaccurate.<br /><br />The aliens' actions had nothing to do with "might makes right" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would totally destroy it (people) if they failed to act, decisively. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.<br /><br />- Some say there's nothing to like. I love the film from beginning to end and have seen it three times. Really, the only "detestable characters" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold, uncaring colossal machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of great beauty, reverence, wisdom and spirituality. John Cleese as the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is extremely unlikable for most of the picture because she represents the government and comes off as a cold, arrogant machine-like witch with a capital 'B'. But, after she's completely humbled, she changes her tune, making her a likable character. As for the kid, he's only 9 years old and had lost both of this biological parents, his father recently. Needless to say, cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune, so to speak, by the end and is extremely likable (by then). Klaatu actually takes on the role of his spiritual father. Remember Jacob falling on his face at his dad's grave? How could you NOT feel for him at that point?<br /><br />CONCLUSION: As you can see, none of these common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy, pure and simple. I'm convinced that if people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile to ponder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I went into this film expecting the worst, but I thought it was an interesting remake if not all that great. The FX have been upgraded and the story expanded, but that does not make for a better movie. I appreciate that fact that film isn't an exact remake as I really don't see the point of that at all. If you look at some of the best remakes like Carpenter's 'The Thing', Jackson's 'King Kong' and Cronenberg's 'The Fly' who all made remakes with stories more complex than the originals even if not necessarily better. This film just doesn't reach that status as a great remake that rivals the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This effects heavy galactic gasbomb is one of the worst science fiction films you could insert into your DVD player in this decade. With only one year left in said decade, I feel safe in saying that. I also feel safe in saying that carved wooden puppets could have done a better acting job and a group of kids with handi-cams could have done a better job making sense out of this mess. Keanu Reeves plays the life or death deciding Klaatu with all the emotional oomph of Neo, Jennifer Connelly tries really hard to act disinterested and Jaden Smith takes the position of hyper-annoying kid.<br /><br />What you're left with is a visual feast that makes all the sense of the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JYLT">Muppets from Space</a>. The Giant robot Gort somehow changes into man-eating bugs before Klaatu starts singing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SR2H">"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft."</a> Well, not really, but at least it might have made this interesting. The plot is some muddle of a consortium of universal species needs to save the Earth from us piggish humans, and only Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly) can make Klaatu stop the destruction. But that pesky kid keeps meddling and might even bring on the destruction single handedly...or will his cuteness make the aliens swoon and the plague stop?<br /><br />The movie is as clunky as that plot description, wasting the talents of Kathy Bates as the creepy government emissary who spouts off dopey dialogue meant to be political allegory, and John Cleese, who should have skipped this movie and gone back to being "Q" in the hapless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLIEG">Quantum of Solace</a>. There's an environmental message buried in the muck and cuteness, but it was a point better made in the highly original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E.</a> Watch that superior movie first.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I almost didn't even rent this movie because of the critics. Let's face it there are pretty much two camps of thought. Those that saw the original years ago and set their SciFi intellectual standard by it. Then there are those that may or may not have seen the original, but even if they did, to them it's an old B&W movie that is to brainy or quaint. I have been a long time fan of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>. I thought no way Keenu Reeves as Klaatu, let alone it being a remake could it be as good. I have to say that it is a good try. The original may have a slight edge because of the masterful Thermin music composed by Bernard Herrmann, a lot more common people had dialogue with Klaatu, and he had more time with the scientist. That all said they did a very impressive job on the remake and the whole cast did a great job. Michael Rennie was not exactly an animated actor either so Reeves does a good job in the part of Klaatu. Furthermore we should not expect this to be a carbon copy of the original.<br /><br />I prefer when remakes follow a different path. That's why I enjoyed the remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016Q2D5M">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>. In this version, on purpose or not, Klaatu is colder. Actually perhaps a more realistic attitude considering what he is here to do. Consider the fact this is 2009 and not 1951, and the way military and government personnel will react, is NOT going to be the same. So if you wanted this movie to be a cc of the first one you WILL be disappointed. I didn't want that and I didn't get that and I'm grateful. Gort is as scary as he was in the first movie as well, and that took some doing considering how impressive special effects have become over the last fifty years. They made him much larger and of more of a biological composition this time. Overall I have every intention of buying this good SciFi movie because it far exceeded my expectations thanks to the critics. It may not be as cerebral as the orginal, but it makes up for quite a bit in the woman and kid interaction with Klaatu, the conversation with the scientist (nicely played by John Cleese), the conversation with a fellow alien (emotionally played by James Hong), and the special effects.<br /><br />Good quality DVD with decent replayability. I think it will grow on most people after it has been out for awhile. I give it three and a half stars. I will grant you had they cut back on the effects a little and extended the conversations with Cleese and Hong it would have made me happier, but probably not the F/X fans. My only complaint about this three disc set is they did not include extras for the original movie. It comes with plenty of extras for the new Blu ray version and even a digital copy you can put on your PC. The third disc is the Blu ray of the original movie and it is extremely sharp and clear, but I had hoped to get all the extras I got with the special edition I bought a few years ago including a documentary with Robert Wise. It doesn't even include the trailer. It is a bare bones play, scenes, setup version.

The depiction of an overboard military, political and scientific response to the invading Christmas tree ornaments was laughable. Script and acting were high school acting sophomoric. The science/technology was so absurd that any decent high school science student could poke innumerable holes in this movie. Producers do not want to hire science advisors because a dumbed down product makes more money. One example demonstrates the whole movie: To convey the emotional/informational impact of the moment the director does nothing more than a prolonged camera close up of a pretty face as the FIRST person to approach the alien space ship. That time worn shot is as creative as they can be? And, why a microbiologist (of all people) would be allowed to walk up and touch it is beyond comprehension. CSI crime scenes show more intelligence.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Regina Jackson: I want to apologize to you; it seems we got off to a bad start.<br />Klaatu: It seems we did.<br /><br />In fact, if the Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) and Klaatu the alien (Keanu Reeves) were referring to this movie in the above conversation; I'd have to disagree and say that it got off to a rather good start, but then blasted itself to smithereens with its overwhelming emphasis on special effects.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Government hastily gathers group of eggheads and gives them just over an hour to deal with an unknown object which is hurtling through space at unbelievable speed and is just about ready to touch down in Manhattan.<br />2. Instead of telling the almost certainly destructive force to take a number, due to the long waiting list of aliens, creatures and other movies impatiently awaiting their turn to destroy the city of New York, the eggheads put on funny suits and take a walk in the Park.<br />3. A close encounter with an alien in a fat suit and a big ole robot named GORT follows.<br />4. Given the acting in this movie, the audience may have a hard time figuring out which of the emotionless beings is the alien Klaatu.<br />5. Keanu may actually have been better off being casted as GORT.<br />6. Apparently, the aliens have their plan well worked out in advance, and have the balls to prove it.<br />7.

This pretty much has the same plot, but it's done in a very different way. I didn't like that the flying saucer was a gigantic glowing ball, but it was cool. I loved that Gort was 100 feet tall in this one and looked more scary. Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job as Klaatu, who warns that if the people of Earth that if they don't stop the violence, the humans of Earth will be destroyed. I wasn't a big fan of Helen Benson' step-son being black and hated Klaatu, because in the original, her son was white and became friends with him. (I'm not racist.) My dad might have been a little disappointed because he thought it wasn't as good as the original. I did like the awesome night scenes and when it rained. If you are a fan of the original classic, you might like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>In "The Day the Earth Stood Still" Keanu Reeves has four acting emotions: serious, more serious, almost comatose, and unconscious. He and other aliens have come to Earth to wipe out all human beings because they are destroying the planet. The human beings think it belongs to them. Well, it doesn't! In reality it belongs to the galaxy, and human beings don't have a right to desecrate it. Are they ever going to learn? These alien beings, morally and intellectually superior to Earth people, are on a serious mission.<br /> On his visit Alien Keanu discovers that humans can be loving and compassionate. Gracious! They (We) aren't completely hopeless after all.<br /> The special effects are none too special or eye-catching and seem to be recycled from other movies. The kid in this movie is really annoying. More of a brat.<br /> A movie with this title was originally made in 1951, and it was a landmark sci-fi flick, a critical success. This one is barely a footnote in sci-fi history.<br /> Kathy Bates is a determined and proactive U.S. Secretary of Defense. She's on serious pills too. It is not one of her better roles, and she could do this one in her sleep; in fact, I think she does doze off at times in this one.<br /> Army officers order everything but the kitchen sink fired at the alien ships. The "nuke `em" scenes seem to be taken out of the latest Hulk movie. These cookie-cutter scenes seem to migrate from one film to another. After you see this movie, you may start rooting for the aliens.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>It's amazing movie and i liked so much.

I do have to acknowledge that sometimes, a remake may be necessary to cater to a new generation. It has been some years ago since last I saw Robert Wise's 1951 original and I have to admit I didn't re-watch it before exposing myself to this 2008 remake helmed by Scott Derrickson. Many have considered the 1951 original film to be a true masterpiece, and belongs in the ranks of the most celebrated motion pictures ever made with "The Godfather", "Citizen Kane" and "2001: A Space Odyssey". Such masterpieces shouldn't be tainted by a mediocre remake, the original "The Day the Earth Stood Still" came at the right time, when the world was under the shadow of the cold war and feared nuclear holocaust. Let's admit it, Wise's cold war analogy is a little dated due to current events, any revisit to the material would prove unnecessary (or is it?). This 2008 remake is NOT as engaging and compelling as Wise's original film, and will not attain "classic" status but thankfully it doesn't hurt the original's legacy and its message may also be significant.<br /><br />An alien object is detected in a collision course to Earth--impact point; Manhattan. Fearing that this event would trigger a great disaster, the U.S. government enlists the services of scientists to help with the aftermath. Astro-biologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) is among them although she doesn't really deal with this type of matters. However, rather than the object causing destruction, a strange sphere simply lands in Central Park and a mysterious figure emerges, who is then shot by a trigger happy soldier. Spirited away by the military, the figure slowly metamorphoses into a human being or at least something that resembles one. Calling himself "Klatau", this alien being presents himself as a harbinger of destruction. What can the human race do to avoid extinction when all the United States military power is powerless against Klaatu and his gigantic robot?<br /><br />The Earth is one of the few planets that can support complex life forms according to Klaatu and humans are slowly killing it. The film has strong elements of social commentary, ecological misconduct, human flaws that may lead to our destruction. The screenplay by David Scarpa replaces Wise's cold war analogy with something more related to our present time; humanity's arrogance in the way we see ourselves that we own this planet. The film does express a lot of thought-provoking ideas and a few collective truths as it possibly could. I rather thought that the U.S. being portrayed as the sole super-power and appoints itself as the representative of humanity as nicely executed, especially in the persona of the Defense secretary played by Kathy Bates. You see other leaders expressing their displeasure on this action and the fact that Klaatu was refused an audience with the U.N., it gives exposition that dialogue is sometimes the best solution and not the "fist-first approach". Unfortunately, the film seems to stop short in this exposition and settles for some perfunctory elements to take hold such as love, change and compassion that it almost wallowed with overused sentimentality. People change when in the brink of destruction would be the film's main theme; and Klaatu is here to save this planet, which means bad news to the humanity. "If the Earth dies, you die. If the Earth survives, you die". I know it's not supposed to be a "message" film, but it was obviously trying to provoke a reaction from the viewer. Sadly the way it got this message across isn't as engaging or enthralling in its narrative--that it felt like a simple device.<br /><br />The direction by Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is decent and allows certain mind-boggling ideas to surface while not really holding back on the action. The film does feature a grand display of America's military might and once Klaatu escapes the clutches of the military, we become privy to a display of CGI effects, that revolves around another chase film. The special effects are quite good; as we witness landscapes and architecture decimated. The giant robot is a welcome change from the rubber-suited one in the original. The "GORT" (Genetically Organized Robotic Technology) metallic robot stands 50 feet tall and looks very menacing. The giant orbs looked impressive as seen in its trailers. The menace of the metallic insects feel a little forced, and we have seen this gimmick many times before.<br /><br />Much of the film's burden would fall on Jennifer Connelly and I thought she performed admirably, then again, I've always been a sucker for her eyes. Helen's step-child is just so annoying and his character should have been left out. Kathy Bates' character has that bomb `em, "shoot first ask questions later attitude" and her character is knotty. I thought she should have been played more than as a simple plot device to set up the perfunctory obstacles. Keanu Reeves is his usual emotionless self, but this time this role suits him as the single-minded "Klaatu". I think Reeves is more a physical actor than an emotional one, well, this role is tailor-made for his "robotic" acting.<br />I think it would be unfair to compare it to the original but it does feel somewhat unnecessary for Hollywood to step into this "hallowed" area of the original. It is a very commercial film and Derrickson's direction played it a little too safe, I guess to avoid angering the audience with its supposed commentary. It opts for a grand display of special effects than a plot that would really get under the skin of its audience. It missed some real thought-provoking potential by not exploring the concept of meeting a being from another planet. The original was a benchmark in filmmaking, and even promoted international understanding. This version won't even make a dent on its legacy but it is entertaining enough. It was better than I expected, but it just couldn't connect emotionally and will disappoint a lot of folks.<br /><br />"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a pseudo sci-fi action flick that offers nothing special but it would have been worse if another director was at its helm. I do give this dvd release a weak recommendation given that you can get the original film with its 2-disc release (if you don't already own it) but this 2008 version gets a "Rent it" verdict. [3- Stars]</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I never saw the original version of this movie, but when I saw the trailers for this release it promised to be a neat science fiction story.  Reeves is a so-so actor but I've seen decent performances from him in the past, so I decided to take my chances.  What a mistake!<br /><br />Aside from the uninspired acting from Reeves, Bates and, well, pretty much everyone else, and aside from some major league smarm with the cutesy and precocious little kid, the most prominent feature of this movie was the left-wing propaganda.  This film was fairly dripping with political correctness.  Just to make it clear, this would be equally objectionable if the movie was full of right-wing propaganda.  Can't we just get a good old-fashioned story anymore?<br /><br />Why Why Why?  Why do moviemakers lately seem to insist on making ill-advised and poorly disguised political statements, particularly in sci fi and horror movies (e.g. Shyamalan)?  This story is nothing but more of the same -- bashing the military and religion, while painting earth-friendly academics as the true saviors.  "We can change!  Give us a chance to save the earth!"  Gag me.  Stop the madness!  Just tell the story without all the half-baked moralizing.<br /><br />On a final note, I gave it the second star ONLY because the production was visually appealing and was replete with well-done special effects.  That, sadly, was the film's only redeeming quality.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The aliens come, decide that the people of Earth are more of a nuisance than we're worth, and let us know that no Earth people at all would be an improvement - unless we clean up our act. That, a guy named Klaatu, and a robot named Gort (or G.O.R.T.) are about all this twenty-first century effects-fest has in common with that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">Cold War classic</a>.<br /><br />Both movies tap into the big concerns of the time. Back then, the big threat was nuclear war - the aliens just didn't want to deal with that kind of neighbor. Today, ecological collapse seems a much more likely form of self-inflicted extinction. Again, the aliens are quite content to see humankind gone, but not if we take other species with us. Interestingly, a human family takes an interest in the alien in each version, but the 1950s ideal of family and the 2008 vision differ dramatically.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves does an outstanding job representing the alien, for all the same reasons he does so poorly at representing humans. Klaatu, the alien, had no native understanding of human emotion, so Reeves's chronically flattened affect worked out for the best. The effects really made this movie, though - especially the big dramatic scene at the end. Outside of that, it's pretty forgettable. The 1951 original has nothing to fear from the new version.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The original movie version of The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of my father's all time favorite movies.  A science fiction classic that permanently embedded the catch phrase "klaatu barada nikto" into the geek lexicon, the first film was a parable about the Cold War.  Both the producer and director were criticized for the liberal themes of the film, which promoted world peace and a draw down of military hostilities. The "standing still" of the world was a reference to all electrical systems on Earth freezing for a half hour, with the exception of critical systems. In short, the movie's message was thought provoking, intended to begin a discussion about American policies.<br /><br />The remake is no different (spoiler alerts abound).  This new version features a hostile military led by Regina Jackson (the stalwart Kathy Bates), the monotone human-like alien (Keanu Reeves as Klaatu), an aggrieved scientist widow (the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) and her angry son (played by Jaden Smith).  This new version pokes viewers with a stick: the Benson patriarch died in Iraq; the president's response to an alien invasion is openly hostile; and the Message is no longer about the Cold War but Global Warming.  In other words: the movie's message is thought provoking, intended to begin a discussion about American policies.<br /><br />But is it a good movie?  Overall, the film bulks up special effects, smoothes over some of the rough edges from the original, and does its best to translate the original to modern sensibilities. GORT now stands for Genetically Organized Robot Technology, is a giant nanotechnology war machine, and the descending globes of light are arks to save the Earth.  The computer graphics are outstanding.<br /><br />The acting, not so much.  Reeves sleepwalks through his role, which, while not inappropriate, doesn't stretch his acting chops either.  Klaatu is suitably creepy as a blank-faced drone, but difficult to sympathize with as he becomes more human. Connelly has little to do besides plead at the camera with her eyes.  Smith comes off as recalcitrant and unlikable, a weakness in the child actor who represents the sum of humanity's relationship. The sole stand out is John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt, projecting a level of warmth and kindness that's we rarely see on screen.  If I had to pick a person to argue for humanity's survival, Cleese would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />The ending feels sloppy.  GORT transforms from a giant robot (scary!) to a hissing swarm of metal locusts (biblical, but not as scary).  The biblical parallels continue with Klaatu's birth and sacrifice, but the film seems conflicted as to how to wrap things up.  The movie concludes with the Earth standing still, permanently - hospital machines and airplanes be damned.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with the movie's tenets is moot.  If you're nodding your head or rolling your eyes then this version, like the original before it, did its job. But in comparison, the original has better acting and a tighter plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>DIRECTOR: OK, so I'm officially out of ideas.

No.<br />Was there a big, uplifting speech about universal brotherhood/world peace at the end? Nope.<br />Did stuff blow up real good? Yep.<br />Was there a "Crazy Killer Robot" in the film? Yes!<br />Was Reeves' performance as exciting as one would think? YES.<br /><br />This film does nothing with the original idea, it simply re-tells the same story while blowing things up along the way. What a sad waste of time. I give an extra half star because it was'nt offensive and bad, like Hancock for example.<br /><br />One more thing: 2 Disks? Really? There's barely enough material for one disk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>In 2008 a re-make of The Day The Earth Stood Still was released to theaters.<br /><br />While the original was a warning against nuclear war, this re-make starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, serves as a warning against global warming/ecology disruption.<br /><br />This giant sphere comes to New York and Klaatu emerges only to be shot by a lone military man.<br /><br />While under the knife, Klaatu befriends a scientist played by Jennifer Connelly who believes these aliens are friendly.<br /><br />Fat chance. They are here to collect a few specimens and then wipe out mankind.<br /><br />This updated version doesn't have the punch of the original. When you cast Keanu Reeves as your lead, you should know what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />And GORT, the huge guardian alien has been changed altogether.<br /><br />If you must, just rent this thing for a day.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>A bland alien messenger Klaatu comes to earth intent on assessing humanity's worthiness. He is met with a stubborn group of American officials and a sympathetic scientist. He perceives humanity to be too aggressive/destructive to allow to continue, and thus, after reaching this judgment initiates a countdown to doomsday and begins to evacuate the animals in large spheroid arks.<br /><br />The film purports to have an environmental/pacifistic message, but I'm not clear exactly clear what Klaatu's issues really are.  The film doesn't go into detail about why we are bad. It seems mankind is too industrial? Too inclined to violence? At any rate, the aliens want us to 'change or die.'  Nice and enlightened. Tyranny, for a good cause is still tyranny. Guess the aliens haven't evolved as much as they like to think. Or maybe they just want to colonize our planet and decide to give us a good scolding first to let us know why.<br /><br />The film's sermony message about how bad we all are, how violent, how destructive was conveniently one-sided. The alien, assuming it is a trained observer gets an F in my book for its sense of observation.<br /><br />I DID liked Jaden Smith as the main protagonist's stepson.  I also thought Bates was good as the government official. Reeves did his usual wooden doll act, which for this film was fine.<br /><br />The film's special effects were good but the script was banal and lacking in complexity or depth. For this reason, I detracted a star and give it 2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>First and foremost, this is one of Keanu Reeves' best performances.  The reason of course is that he hardly speaks.  He somberly zombie-walks through his scenes with near lifelessness, and delivers his lines as Klaatu, premiere representative of an alien race, with the zeal of a log.  In fact, I've long said that Keanu Reeves could be replaced in nearly any of his roles by a log, and the movie would not suffer as a result.  Similar to the casting gods of Rocky IV shining down fortune on Dolph Lundgren for his role as Ivan Drago, a muscular, dim-witted, abject villain whose rigid performance is topped only by his ability to engender support from the audience for his enemies, Log pulls off the same performance, but without the muscles.<br /><br />Klaatu travels to Earth with the purpose of all alien races in movies: destroying the human race, and thereby ensuring Log doesn't make another movie.  Naturally, some idiot on Earth shoots at the alien representative - a probe called GORT that looks like a massive pewter version of the Academy Award that will forever evade Log.  According to Klaatu, the planet is in peril, and the only way to save its position as one of the few life-bearing planets in the universe is to exterminate human life as we know it.<br /><br />The brilliance of this premise is that Klaatu's own race once was in the same position, on the brink of destruction, only to change their ways for the better.  Until he has a discussion with a scholar named Prof. Barnhardt (John Cleese), the idea completely evades Klaatu that the human race could make the exact same reversal.  It's no real stretch to imagine an actual discussion between Cleese and Log ending in the same way, with Cleese completely exposing him as a simpleton.  Much like the Architect in the Matrix, Log gets outsmarted yet again.<br /><br />The bright spots in this movie are the female variety.  Kathy Bates is fairly convincing in her role as a somewhat despotic politician in the spotlight during trying times, and Jennifer Connelly plays Dr. Helen Benson, the sole person willing to be in Klaatu's presence long enough to deliver him to the truth (i.e. Prof. Barnhardt intellectual beat down).<br /><br />Remaking of a classic is usually a bad idea.  Including one of the worst actors available, adding unnecessary messages regarding contemporary ecologic and military situations, filling the screen with ridiculous special effects, and topping it all off with enough plot holes and incongruity to make Ghostbusters seem plausible is another thing entirely.<br /><br />I only recommend this movie for insomniacs, masochists, and the hundred or so delusional fans Log has across the country.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>The original for its time was interesting and just a great little sci-fi. Eons have passed as it pertains to a remake so I can not really make a fair comparison between the two films. I will judge this film on its own merits.#1. Had this not been a remake you would not see an alien that looks like Gort in a modern film. #2. Somebody watched the 80s film Starman too many times(which was very good). Think about this and you will see multiple liftings. #3. Kathy Bates was at her worst and detracted from the film as did the step child who could not act period. #4. The alien spacecraft was I guess cool looking but very disappointing. A floating orb that shows up like Glendas descent in the Wizard of Oz (minus the advancement)didnt require much thought and left me cluless as  to alien travel.. #5. Could these beings have been studying us all this time and deside to suddenly visit us to only realize that,"we are at our best when at a precipice?" #6. Keanu Reeves was good but didnt have enough screen time to elaborate on the cosmos, science, etc. #7. The film was fun to watch and had some good moments that unfotunately left you wondering why more alien concepts were not explored. #8. The scenes from the interogation to the lie detector were great. #9. Jennifer Connely was excellent. Her and Reeves were a good choice for this type of film. Their scenes held the film together. #10. One scene of Gort walking was not enough.  Besides desolving into a destructive metal parasite I wanted to see shear brute force against the puny Earthlings.#11. Overall, not solid. It is good to see a good old Earth vs. them film though.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Renowned scientist Dr. Helen Benson finds herself face to face with an alien called Klaatu, who travels across the universe to warn of an impending global crisis. When forces beyond Helen's control treat the extraterrestrial as a hostile and deny his request to address the world's leaders, she and her estranged stepson Jacob quickly discover the deadly ramifications of Klaatu's claim that he is "a friend to the Earth. Fans of the original version will have lots of fun seeing how that story was used in interesting new ways, especially the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>overall, its a successful remake. much of the story is changed as it should in any good update. Keanu Reeves is standard here, Jennifer Connelly shines and the film brings up some extremely interesting moral points which helps amplify the great sci-fi aspects. the film rushed its final act, which is a shame since the rest of the film is really quite exceptional. this film is no disaster like many people say, give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I never expected to like a remake so much better than the original, especially as here, where the original from 1951 was one of my special favorites. But this one takes the story to a whole new level, and not just because special effects have come so far in the last 50+ years. Apparently so have the scriptwriters, which gives me hope for the future.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu in this one, and the entire sequence under which he contacts the humans is far more elaborate. A few things have not changed; a trigger-happy soldier wounds him, and he prevents GORT from harming anyone. (Interestingly, in this one it is the US Military that names Gort, using an acronym like they inevitably do.) And they do take him to a hospital from which he escapes, and there is a woman and a little boy who help him. And she does take Klaatu to visit a professor friend, who makes friends with Klaatu over a formula on a chalk board.<br /><br />But that about sums up the similarities. Amazingly, virtually all the differences are improvements. And if you think I'm going to spoil a wonderful movie like this by telling you what the differences are, you don't know me. However, one significant difference happens early on: The mother and son have been replaced by a step-mother and son, the boy of a mixed race and cute as can be; the mother quite white. Father died just about a year ago, and was in the military, which I believe is the same as the original. But of course it is a completely different war this time. So we have the additional human interest story of the tensions between the child and his step-mother, including a point where he shouts that he's not her son, he's just a kid that was dumped on her.<br /><br />I can't honestly assess whether it ended well or not, except that the earth was not destroyed. There was some damage, yes; but it was not destroyed. And that's really all I'm going to tell you. You really have to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" is a loosely-based remake of the popular 1951 film, one of the first films that brought the concept of science fiction and aliens to the big screen.<br /><br />Where the original film had a deep theme of the time in regards to the Cold War and the use of nuclear missiles, the theme for the 2008 remake is about the environment and the damage that people are putting on the planet.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" DVD is presented in widescreen with a 2:35:1 aspect ratio. Most of the video is captured during the night and during grey skies.<br /><br />The film is slick and utilizes state-of-the-art special effects and for the DVD release, you get a good amount of booms and gunshots and just a multitude of sounds from the various action segments in the film ranging from piercing audio from Klaatu's guardian, helicopter and jet planes galore and just overall destruction and blasts.  There is a good amount of that and so on DVD, the audio was well-done.<br /><br />And I have no doubt in my mind that on Blu-ray and in High Definition, this film's presentation and audio would be top notch.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" comes in two different versions on DVD.  One is a 3-Disc release (which comes with the original 1951 movie and a digital copy) and the other is a standard release.  Some retailers are offering a free 5' GORT figure with purchase of the 3-Disc version.  I am reviewing the standard release which has the following special features:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - There are three deleted/extended scenes which last nearly two minutes long for all.  "Equipment is Issued to the Scientists", "Helen and Granier Discuss the Shot" and "Extended Version of Klaatu Being Wheeled Down Hallway".<br />  * Re-Imagining "The Day" Featurette - This is a 30 minute special feature about how the remake of the film came about.  The challenges for both Director Scott Derrickson ("The Exorcism of Emily Rose") and screenwriter David Scarpa had in trying to do a different film from the 1951 film since so much has changed culturally but trying to capture that same type of feel of the original.  Different but trying to keep things similar.  Featuring interviews with Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith and many more.<br />  * Unleashing Gort Featurette - A near 14-minute feature featuring Director Scott Derrickson, Character Designer Aaron Simms, Producer Erwin Stoff, Visual Director Jeffrey A. Okun, Senior VFX Supervisor/WETA DIGITAL's Joe Letteri talking about  trying to create the iconic alien GORT and how he can tie in a visual sense of how he and Klaatu are tied together.  Various 3D concepts of GORT.  Originally, GORT was almost like a spider-like alien character but fortunately they changed GORT similar to its 1950's look.  GORT has undergone many designs and it was among the challenges the filmmakers had for the making of the film.<br />  * Watching The Skies: In Search Of Extraterrestrial Life Featurette - A 23-minute special feature on extraterrestrial life with interviews with Seth Shostak (Senior Astronomer for the SETI Institute) and other scientists who talk about how its possible to have living life in other planets and why the SETI does what it can to find and communicate with extraterrestrial life.  Also, explaining that plantes with certain chemical compounds can create life.  The certain technology available now for the search of other life and also a counter argument from skeptics such as Dr. Michael Shermer (publisher of "Skeptic Magazine").<br />  * The Day The Earth Was "Green" Featurette - A 14-minute featurette is about the film promoting "Green" concepts and that we are doing irreprepable harm to the planet and the planet has a "green" message.  Newscorp which owns 20th Century Fox is going carbon neutral by 2010 and thus, it was important for the film which was promoting "green" to also work with the environment in time.  How to get people of all departments for the making of the film, many of those who have worked a certain way in the industry to change their whole concept towards a "green" concept and how to make a change and how everyone was accepting it.  One of the mandates from FOX was to use 20% biodiesel fuel in the generators, an idle mandate to drivers turn off their engine, disposing waste ecologically and more.<br />  * Commentary By Writer David Scarpa - You learn a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the making of the film.  Especially the many changes the film has went through (such as the opening segment which was supposed to feature the space shuttle discovering the spheres) to reasoning why John Cleese was hired and how Jaden Smith had the support from his father (Will) who went to visit him before the emotional scene and much more.<br />  * Still Galleries - Still images from the film<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - The original 1:48 film trailer<br />  * Gort Art Contest Winners - Those who participated in the online contest, their artwork for Gort is featured.  Using your remote to cycle through each photo.<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" was a film that features a lot of special effects and a good amount of action but as for the plot, I feel that Director Scott Derrickson and screenwriter David Scarpa focused too much on being a different film than the original, not doing a remake but trying to find ways where the 2008 film would embrace a message similar to the 1951 film.<br /><br />Where the 1951 film worked was because people were really not exposed to science fiction on the big screen or an aliens coming to the planet to wipe out humans because of the nuclear arms race and the Cold War.  There is a moral message in the film.<br /><br />In 2008, the moral message is that humans are destroying the planet and if we want humanity to survive, changes would have to be made now.<br /><br />But the storyline seems to have things that were cut out and thus there are some pacing issues that unfortunately makes the flow of the film quite pale.<br /><br />We try to feel some connection with Dr. Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her son Jacob (Jaden Smith) but instead of trying to develop these characters and their problematic relationship after the death of her husband and his father, both characters are automatically thrusted to help the alien that the relationship between stepmother and son rarely feels natural.<br /><br />Then you ask yourself, so a sphere touches down on Central Park but why have the scientists there in the front line?  In fact, why bother introducing the scientists in the beginning when they play no significant role in the film.  In fact, why is Dr. Benson even there.  Is she that great of a scientist that she needed to be called?  And why is she the kind of scientist that is given quite a bit of leeway?  In other words, why is she important?<br /><br />As for Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), he manages to escape but during this time of national chaos, knowing the streets are jammed, Dr. Benson somehow gets home quickly and for him, he's observing humanity through a train station and he collapses.  And then all of a sudden, he manages to make a phone call to Dr. Benson for her to pick him up and immediately, she's there to pick him up despite the terrible traffic.<br /><br />As for the American military just so gung-ho to attack, may it be Godzilla or King Kong, there is always provocation to an attack, but Gort only acts on self defense.  So, you see a message of pre-Iraq, "let's go to war" mentality but with a "kill now, answers later" military campaign.  I would hope that if the Earth is about to be obliterated, determination of extinction is not based on a train station melee and a problematic relationship between a step mother and her son.<br /><br />In a way, I was hoping for something along the lines of "Independence Day" but in the end, we get something like "Godzilla".  A film with a lot of action and special effects but no substance behind the overall plot.<br /><br />If anything, It's April and that means "Earth Day" is coming and with the release of plenty of environment or "Green" based DVD's, "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" definitely has that message of keeping the Earth safe and changing your ways before its too late, and fortunately, that message does come clear.  Also, another positive is GORT, I actually dig the mighty defender of Klaatu.<br /><br />Despite my feelings about the overall storyline, "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" is an entertaining film and the constant amount of action and special effects is definitely worth checking out, otherwise the film is a mere rental not a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Day the Earth Stood Still (Blu-Ray) / B001SMC9IK<br /><br />"The Day the Earth Stood Still" is easily one of the strangest movies I've seen lately. On the surface, this is rather standard science fiction fare - a strange alien from beyond the stars comes to visit us, is treated poorly by evil earth bureaucrats, and uses his strange and amazing powers to exact well-deserved vengeance on an uncaring populous. And, to a certain extent, that surface plot is beautifully polished to a high shine - Reeves works very well here as a dispassionate alien, and the special effects (though highly amusing from a scientific standpoint) are wonderfully done.<br /><br />The sub-plot - that aliens are trying to save the earth, a rare and precious resource, from the ravages of humans - is an interesting twist on the `benevolent aliens' genre, which is to say, it's a nice change of pace to see humanity threatened with extinction from a "nice" species instead of from the usual slavering carnivores. Strangely, though, the plot kind of breaks down at this point - Reeves has been sent to earth with a very simple message: Stop mucking up the earth, or our superior technology will destroy you. Oddly, though, he never seems very interested in divulging his simple message. When rebuffed at his initial request to speak to the U.N., he clams up for much of the rest of the movie, and - in the end - only the love interest has heard from his mouth how, precisely, to prevent future attacks on the planet. Not the best way to disseminate an important message.<br /><br />For that matter, why discuss this with this world leaders at all? The aliens seem to be at least slightly aware that governments and leaders can be corrupt, so why not go straight to the plebes with, I don't know, a gigantic space billboard? I would think that any species capable of hacking our space satellites could use that technology to decipher our language and spell out a nice warning, viewable from space, set to translate into a different earth language every hour or so. But I guess stopping every watch (and pacemakers?) on earth for a day might do the trick just as well, if only you told people WHY you were doing it. Ah well.<br /><br />Apart from the Fridge Logic above, I did think this was a decent movie, although I will admit to not having seen the original classic, which probably colors my judgment somewhat. Reeves does very well here, as an emotionless alien, and the overall message is an interesting one, even if the delivery is a bit wonky. I really could have done with a lot less of the "cute" 'I-hate-my-stepmom' kid, even if the Wangst portrayal was probably fairly accurately done.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>This is a profound story about human arrogance.

The story is absolutely TERRIFIC!<br /><br />Aliens coming to Earth and taking over the planet because according to the aliens, the people living here aren't properly taking care of the planet and letting it fall apart.  The aliens have come back to Earth to preserve its natural beauty and save it from a horrible and unfortunate death by the humans.<br /><br />Interesting the alien that played the lead character (who wasn't dressed in a costume, haha, he was really just a normal person pretending to be an alien for storyline purposes) could speak really good English.  He even had amazing special powers that he'd use to control the human race.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like a tacky storyline going by my description, but believe me, for a science fiction story, it was delivered in a way that was satisfying to me personally because I could *understand* what was going on the entire time, in addition to making it somewhat believable.  Not that I think something like THIS could ever happen, what with aliens coming back to Earth and reclaiming their planet, but well.... you never know!<br /><br />There were some really neat special effects, especially with the swarms of bugs that appeared near the end of the film.  One scene even showed them swarming over a football stadium and making it disappear very quickly as they chewed it away.  GREAT scene.<br /><br />Even scarier was a scene showing the environment turn dark and intimidating as the bugs from way up above in the atmosphere got closer and closer to land.<br /><br />Kathy Bates absolutely RULES in her role (because I love her as an actress so I tend to pay exceptionally close attention to any role she appears in!)<br /><br />My FAVORITE part of the movie was that gigantic creature that came out of the spaceship.  His first appearance was absolutely fantastic in words I can't even describe.  All the cops and special agents around the area were already nervous because a spaceship just landed and these mysterious alien creatures were visiting, and then THIS huge mechanical thing with an orange-colored light shining from his mouth section suddenly appears through the mist, and scans over the entire area with the ability to shut off lights, vehicles, and electronics.<br /><br />I was like "Oh man, what's this huge machine going to do NEXT?? and when he first appeared I was in total shock!"  I loved every appearance with this gigantic robotic creature.  We find out later what the purpose of this thing was, something that caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Supposedly one of the creatures in the film is called Klaatu, but that's like the greatest, most underrated band from the late 70's and I don't recall seeing them perform! (Kidding)<br /><br />Overall, the negative reviews can be angry and hateful all they want- I know what I just enjoyed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>This is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.

Sure, it does contain all the usual Hollywood stereotypes: "ma'm, we nuked the cloud, but it's only getting bigger". Yet, I think the stereotypes worked quite well this time.<br /><br />I also liked the philosophical message.<br /><br />The cosmic Green warrior Klaatu is on a mission to exterminate humanity (while saving animals and plants) in order to make room for a new and hopefully more intelligent race. However, he eventually realizes that humanity is contradictory and perhaps worth another chance, after all. What turns him is the music of Bach, the love and sorrow of ordinary humans, and an exchange with a philosophical scientist (starred by John Cleese, of all people). "We change once we reach the precipice". Well, let's hope you are right, John!<br /><br />My only problem is the end of the movie, where all electricity and gasoline mysteriously disappears. Unfortunately, I don't think 7 billion people are going to change reaching *that* kind of precipice. Mass starvation and cannibalism on an unprecedented scale are more likely. While technology isn't going to save us, all by itself, it sure as hell is part of the solution. (Klaatu's own people have high tech, including cybernetics, interstellar travel and nanoprobes.)<br /><br />Is this the best movie around? Hardly. However, it works well as late Friday night entertainment. In fact, I assumed it would be worse, reading all the negative reviews!

However, my sweet-heart decided to surprise me (it's the thought that counts) and we sat down and watched the DVD together.<br /><br />Here is the short version,<br />People are bad.<br />People are self destructive.<br />People need to be destroyed.<br /><br />People made classical music.<br />People love.<br />People can learn.<br />People need to be saved.<br /><br />So overall, political diatribe aside, it wasn't terrible all the way through, just really terrible in parts, and the rest was watch-able, but the bad parts are really and truly bad.<br /><br />On the plus side the CGI was quite good, but again the script was atrocious.<br /><br />2*</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL reimaged or remade is pretty much an effects-driven film with stereotypes, whereas the original film was a character-driven story with a plot. Granted, this new film has an ecological agenda compared to the anti-nuclear war theme of the old film. However, it still didn't bring anything new to the sci-fi genre. It felt rehashed and cliched. One of the highlights of the original film is the relationship between Klaatu/Mr. Carpenter & Bobby (Michael Rennie & Billy Gray respectively). In this film, the relationship is strained. Jayden Smith's character ("Jacob" instead of "Bobby") was trite and annoying. In the original, Michael Rennie's Klaatu/Mr. Carpenter (a Christ-like analogy) was humane and compassionate, but Keanu Reeve's Klaatu ( the "Mr. Carpenter" alias is not used in the film) is a typical cold "take-me-to-your-leader" comicbook alien. The rest of the cast from Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, & Kyle Chandler all play typical "scientists", "government officials", and military types". The surprise here is John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe in the original) who plays it straight and dramatic instead of comedic, adding some integrity to the story. However, his part is short-lived and pretty much a homage than an integral part to the story. Lastly, the Gort/robot character is completely wasted and not fully explained (and the classic line "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto" isn't used to operate him either). Instead, a mass of alien locusts is unleased to destroy mankind (They went from a Christ analogy to a Moses analogy...go figure?). There are some good sci-fi special effects moments here, but ultimately the execution fails (especially the vague ending). This new film makes a somewhat nice companion piece (not a replacement) because it is only good to compare it to Robert Wise's original classic film and realise how inferior it is to the original despite the modern special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>In all honesty, as remake crazy as Hollywood seems to be these days, I was surprised that a remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still had not been made before.  Well, it has, and after watching this update of Robert Wise's classic 1951 film, one has to wonder why it was remade in the first place.  That's not to say that it's a bad film per se, which it isn't, it just really doesn't amount to a whole lot in the end.  The biggest problem that The Day the Earth Stood Still has lies in its actors.  Keanu Reeves' cardboard persona strangely fits into playing Klaatu, but the rest of the cast, including Jennifer Connelly, Jaden "son of Will" Smith, Kathy Bates, Mad Men's Jon Hamm, Friday Night Lights' Kyle Chandler, John Cleese, and Prison Break's Robert Knepper, are either wasted in their roles or just sleepwalk in them.  The CGI effects of destruction however are wonderfully done however, and worth seeing the film for alone, as it is capably directed by Scott Derrickson, features a great score from Tyler Bates, and is frequently compelling.  Despite all that though, the film never reaches its potential, and it certainly doesn't come anywhere close to the original either.  All in all, The Day the Earth Stood Still remake isn't a terrible film, but it certainly isn't anything to celebrate either.  Still, if CGI sequences of destruction are your thing, give this a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>I'm sure, special effects-wise, this modern DVD version will look spectacular.<br />However, if it's a good story with a point you want, this is Not the one to watch.<br /><br />I saw this 2008 version on television and was very disappointed.<br /><br />On later reflections, I thought it could have been better in ways not yet mentioned here, such as: if it were Helen's touch to the sphere that is Earth's savior, because, as is usually the case in real life, it's the Women who have to stop the violence and who must clean up afterward.<br /><br />Also there are inconsistancies here that are baffling, notably the speed of Humanity's destruction by the sweeping swarm - in the blink of an eye; yet when the boy Jacob becomes 'infected', the scene takes long enough for Klaatu to save him.<br />This 2008 version wraps up and ends too quickly too, without resolving anything.<br /><br />I like Keanu Reeves, but here he is so stone-faced as to evoke little in response to him. In contrast, Michael Rennie [1951 version] was much more effective.<br />The same goes for the young boy, much better done by the boy in the 1951 version.<br /><br />> get the 1951 Version instead.</p></br></body></html>

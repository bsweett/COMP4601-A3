But this movie is a classic , and any pinhead who reviews this as less than that doesn't know horror movies or their history.  Some movies are classics and remain so even thirty years later.  This was made in a different environment to todays movie scene. It was radical for it's day and it changed things. IT was also a hit at the cinemas. Audiences went to it in droves. That's the truth. NOw there are three versions of this one. the first is called 'zombie' the europeon cut of this one, then the long directors cut which is on a double sided dvd and it was one of the first dvd's ever put out! The other is the theaterical cut which is on the blu ray. Which looks great by the way. It has little in the way of extras though.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Dawn Of The Dead (1978) is one of the great zombie movies ever made.  Now I'm talking about the original, of course.  George Romero once again delivers a great zombie movie.  It stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross, and Tom Savini.<br /><br />Basically the movie is about some unknown pandemic that causes flesh-eating zombies to emerge.  This phenomena spreads throughout the U.S.  Four survivors hide in a shopping mall and find themselves fighting the zombies.  The movie is extremely gorey.  Extremely bloody.  It has great special gore effects by special effects guru Tom Savini, who also appears in the movie.  You'll see blood splatter everywhere.  Lots of gunfire.  Lots of violence.<br /><br />The zombies are very basic looking.  The vast majority of them just have their faces painted with grey or blueish-grey makeup.  Since the movie had a budget of only about $650,000 and there were SO MANY zombies, this basic makeup had to do.  Besides that, there was no such thing as CGI back in 1978.  Had there been CGI, the zombies would have looked more realistic, but I'm not a fan of CGI for the most part.<br /><br />This DVD has some good special features.  It's in widescreen format and is remastered in 5.1 DTS & Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  It also has audio commentary from writer and director George Romero, assistant director Chris Romero, special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and is moderated by Perry Martin.  Also included are the theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, poster and advertising gallery, a bio on George Romero, and a comic book preview.<br /><br />If you like extremely violent zombie movies, then this George Romero classic should entertain you.  It's not a Halloween-ish kind of zombie movie, but it's highly entertaining nevertheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>George A. Romero's original "Dawn of the Dead" is as haunting and creepy as the remake. Despite its low budget, there are tons of blood and gore and violence all around. There's some black humor, also. The actors are believable as their characters are memorable. The zombies (not as fast as the ones in the remake) are just downright scary; the blood and guts are not for squeamish. Truly a must-see for all zombie lovers from all across the globe.<br /><br />Movie: A-<br />DVD: C+<br />I should've seen the Ultimate Edition rather than the Divimax. But oh, well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Even though George Romero is credited with the<br />birth of the modern-day zombie in 1968, it's real debut<br />can go all the way back to 1932 with White Zombie<br />featuring Bela Lugosi. But I think what Romero<br />introduced that got him the credit was the zombie's<br />cannibalistic need of living parts, be it flesh or brains<br />along with the disease factor of if you get bitten alive<br />you'll end up walking dead like them. It also didn't<br />hurt to be one of the first films to have a multi-racial<br />cast featuring an African-American as group leader<br />which of course in '68 was pretty rare indeed. Yeah,<br />Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if<br />technically it isn't quite true.<br /><br />But it wasn't until almost ten years later Romero<br />really put the zombie in pop-culture with the much<br />heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. This film took<br />the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by<br />putting in the more modern day setting of a typical<br />American pleasure, the indoor shopping mall. DOTD,<br />while offering pretty much the same living character<br />design, this time made the zombies more in number,<br />appearance, and graphic actions. It was this film with<br />instead of it's shades of gray now bursting in bloody<br />color that put the Zombies on the map permanently.<br />It's a great film that not only fleshes out the characters<br />at a good pace (though at times it does seem a little<br />too detailed in that department), but truly shown that<br />zombism has no cultural bounds. Not only did the Americans<br />just eat up this new genre, but on the opposite side of the world, Europeans did so even more, especially the film-making members of Italy.<br /><br />When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there,<br />he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to<br />re-edit it for Italian audiences. Argento slimed down bits<br />of comedy & slower dialouge, gave it a faster soundtrack, and<br />changed it's name to Zombi. This may have been one of the<br />most important effects this film ever could of have. Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas, but it inspired many<br />Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started. Before<br />Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead, Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial (yet honored by Romero himself) sequel called Zombi 2. This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall. But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps & bounds. It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980's. Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier, they once again did it but with our Zombies. What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero's then two classics, but new ways of defining the genre. Unfortunately by '85 with Day Of The Dead, Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day's lackluster audience response (though over time, it in itself has become the classic it deserves). But all of this couldn't of happened without Romero & his original update of Dawn Of The Dead. It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead.<br /><br />...And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release:<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received, and it's completely deserved. The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day, gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it's history and formations. With this set you get THREE different versions of the film: the US theatrical, the extended Directors Cut, and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi. Each version has it's own merit and differences that never, ever feels like release overkill. All has been fully remastered to the hilt, with different commentaries for each equally entertaining (though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut). No lack of movie presentation here, you get it all.<br /><br />Extras? Wow, you got them! Documentaries, commercials, trailers, stills, photos, home movies, easter eggs, Jeez this thing is packed! In fact, I couldn't even think of what it's missing. All enclosed in a great box-set with wonderful artwork and an errie front cover to boot. C'mon, it even comes with a comic book, for cryin' out loud! Now I know Anchor Bay/Starz is known for double-dipping their audience, but it has never been as necessary as this one. If you own any of their previous releases, sell them and add it to the pot to get this. Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise, not a single film release, so you can tell just how impressive this set is. So if you're a fan of any level to the original Dawn Of The Dead, or the genre of Zombies itself, your collection is NOT complete till you own this. I personally have never given a DVD release a full 10 before, and I feel once you get this you might do the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Romero's ghastly sequel to his legendary "Night of the Living Dead" is equally brilliant and perhaps even more unsettling than the first installment. It is also spine-chillingly funny, making blunt comparisons between the dead-eyed, gore-loving zombies and vapid American consumers. (Next time you're at a mall, the impression will be hard to shake.) But for all its satirical wit, "Dead" also features riveting action sequences, culminating in the final showdown involving soldiers, bikers, and endless waves of the undead. Tom Savani's ghoulish effects are not for the faint of heart, so be sure you're in the mood for explicit slaughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and it still affects me the same today as it did back then.<br />If not for Romero, Horror movies would not be what they are today.<br />"Night of the Living Dead" was the true grounbreaker in horror,<br />but "Dawn" actually paved the way for today's horror flick.<br />It was the blood and guts and gore, and all in wonderful technicolor!!!!<br />True enough, there are cheesy looking things in the movie, like the blood in some scenes looks UNMISTAKENLY like red paint,<br />But if you focus on the STORY and not it's minor defects, It is one hell of a movie!<br /><br />To me there is nothing scarier than the walking dead! I also loved the idea (and still do today) of the survivors living upstairs in this HUGE mall,in very nice living quarters, and everything they could possibly want or need in the mall below, right at thier fingertips!<br />  then the irony that without a civilization of people, all these material things, and money are......useless !!<br /><br />"Dawn of the Dead" is just a great horror flick, with a GREAT storyline, and in my opinion, the acting was good, too.<br />The movie surely is not boring as some have suggested, in fact, quite the contrary. It held my attention RAPTLY for the entire film. I only wish they would have made a part 2 to this with the same characters!<br />It would have been nice to see what became of Fran and Peter,Fran's baby...They could have easily did a part 2, The possibilities were endless!<br />Perhaps the NEW version of "Dawn" they will make a part 2...I REALLY wasn't satisfied with THAT ending!!!<br />Anyway, I am getting way off track here, I give "Dawn" 10 stars!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Set after the events of "Night of the Living Dead", the nation is still in chaos with the dead rising from their graves and attacking the living. A group of surviving humans( Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, Scott H. Reiniger and David Emge) hide out in a shopping mall for shelter armed with weapons, try to radio someone for help and battle out with the undead as they must try to survive as well as trying to fight out some biker thugs.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and an awesome sequel to George Romero's 1968 masterpiece "Night of the Living Dead"! what makes this movie work besides the classic gore and make-up by Tom Savini or the music by Dario Argento & Goblin is the interesting social satire in this movie that it presents. The acting can be amateruish but there is plenty of action and violent scenes in this movie that also helps out in making this one of the greatest horror movies ever made, often imitated ( mostly by Europeans) but never eqauled.<br /><br />This 4-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD set is just as awesome as the movie itself with excellent Divamax digital picture & sound remastering, audio commentaries, trailers, TV Spots, radio spots, Poster and Still galleries, easter eggs, interviews, featurettes, documentarys, and three versions: Original theatrical version, Director's Cut and Euro cut.<br /><br />This is a must have for every horror aficonado's DVD library, highly recommended if you want to see the ultimate in zombie horror.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Day of the Dead", "Evil Dead", "Zombie" ( a.k.a.

You can see really see the blood sweat and tears that went through this dvd by looking at the cover. This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief. The packaging is amazing as well, you get an actual Dawn of the dead Comic book along with a good solid insert on all 4 discs. Overall one of the best movies and dvd packages of all time from Anchor Bay. A must buy!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Picking up three weeks after the events in "Night Of The Living Dead," the sequel "Dawn Of The Dead" has the undead now overpopulating normal civilization. The military has ran out of ideas and every man seems to have a different idea about what to do and where to go. Throughout all this chaos, two S.W.A.T. team members (played by Scott H. Reiniger and the great Ken Foree) meet up with two television station employees (Gaylen Ross and David Emgee) and take shelter in a nearby shopping mall. Despite an incredible amount of the undead population flocking to the mall at an alarming rate, the foursome find salvation in a top-level storage space, and turn what was originally supposed to be a resting stop, into a long-term stay. However, like all societies sooner or later, the one created above the mall full of zombies begins to crumble piece by piece as the movie forges on. All four actors play their roles perfectly, and the characters conflict and compliment each other very well. Director George Romero ("Night Of The Living Dead") is very subtle and lets the story play out naturally. Although his message of anti-consumerism is a bit dated, he still manages to make the movie and the story timeless. Despite the undead being very slow, there is still a thick amount of dread and suspense piled on. There is a reason why Romero is the grandfather of zombie flicks. The zombies aren't the scary part of this movie. What is scary are the people, and how they react to the situation they are faced with, and how quickly society begins to crumble. But it doesn't hurt that special effects master Tom Savini (who, incidentally directed the remake of "Night Of The Living Dead") piles on healthy servings of gore at all the right moments (also, look out for him as the leader of the gang that breaks into the mall). The original "Dawn Of The Dead" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, and is the rare case of a sequel being just as good as the original. It also works so that if you haven't seen "N.O.T.L.D." you can still watch this and know what's going on. The remake is good, but nothing will ever top this one. This is a movie that will stay in your head for days, and will never ever leave your subconcious. If you're looking for an intelligent and brave horror flick, go to the mall. "Dawn Of The Dead" is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD follows the story that began in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.<br /><br />Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>The ultimate gross-out good time, "Dawn of the Dead" is still one of the best zombiefests ever made. Everyone who has ever fantasized about being locked in a shopping mall overnight will find something else to dream about - or hope they will. Bon appetit!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>The reviews previous to this are pretty much accurate.  Romero's follow is probably one of the 10 best Horror movies of the 1970's.  However, while other (such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) trys to grab you by pushing the  limits with shock, Georgie boy goes the other way by getting you to think  just a touch.<p>This movie is not really a sequel to Night of the Living  Dead (one of the top 10 of the 1960's), but can be seen as related (set 1~2  years after).  Man is in dire danger, as the dead have come back to life.  Civilization is breaking down and choas is helping the Zombie's win.  Four  survivors take off in a helicopter and are forced to land on the roof of a  shopping mall, surrounded by Zombies.  <p>The movie paints broad strokes,  the characters are just not really developed enough.  The movie is about  materialism and greed, and how our current society is based more on  emptiness (using the shopping mall as a mecca as an example) rather than  any sound foundation.  <p>The DVD is bare, with a few features (the  funniest being an advertisement for the mall, where the movie was shot).  There is no audio commentary and the soundtrack was in Mono.  However, if  you like horror movies to be alittle less about T&amp;A and Gore, try out  the Dawn of the Dead.....Before there is no more room in hell....Rating: B.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>George Romero has been given credit for inventing zombies. For the record, there were zombie movies before Romero came along. Now moving along. A very original movie, and original concept. I am sure most of you already know it is about a group of people trapped in a mall while a world of zombies wonders around outside, eventually making their way inside the mall. I think the acting is high schoolish, as was the acting in the follow up &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot;. Some of the zombie make up looks  like amateurs dressing up for Halloween. But I do agree this is a classic. I would not agree this is the greatest horror film ever made as been said by many reviewers. I still prefer &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot; over this film. Some people think Romero can do no wrong, and I like some of his work, but I simply do not believe the zombie concept  belongs to him, as so many people seem to think. I also wish everyone would stop comparing every &quot;walking dead&quot; film to Romero's work.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a true horror epic classic if ever there was one. Horror genre fanatics and detrators know of the obvious artistic defects and omissions always inherantly found in 95 percent of all  horror offerings.  Yet, when George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead  became an unimaginable horror movie milestone back in 1969. Heads began to  roll both in awe and in complete disgust of this overwhelmingly bleak black  and white cheaply made account of a zombie apocalypse taking place in rural  Pennslyvania. The film's low budget in fact enhanced the film dreary  surrealistic intensity which re-defined the horror genre the same way  Hitchcock's Psycho had done nine years earlier.  Dawn of the Dead was  Romero's official sequal to that movie masterpiece, and he did have some  very large expectations to live up to.  Filmed in 1978, the film takes  the anxieties and paranoia about human transgressions, materialism,  self-preservation, and greed and builds upon these fine foundations. Then  Romero craftily created an awe inspiring cinematic orgy of gore, gunfire,  entrails, decapitations, body explosions galore, make-up special effects,  human disenbowelment, and an un-godly display of stage blood to create the  70's ultimate movie gore fest, and now Romero was filming his canvas in  color!  Suprisingly beyond this seemingly intolerable barage of gore,  Romero had create a tour de force presentation of how brutal huanity is  willing to extend itself for self-preservation.  The un-believable reality  that Romero had fabricated such a remarkable amount of intelligent critical  analysis upon the the American Commercial or Materialstic culture through  the forum of a horror movie is the greatest shock of them all.  If you  can handle this unbelieveable gore attack upon your senses you will find an  unapprecated horror film masterpiece that deserves to be cherished. Dawn's  philosophical, religious, and moral implicatons  are just as thrillingly  enjoyable as all the film's other more obvious contents. Dawn of the Dead  is the ultimate artistic intellectual horror film that mightbe more real  than you can handle. P.S. Watch through thecredits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Zombie movies.  Lots of "serious" types look down on them.  That's a shame, because some of them are really first-rate films.  Dawn of the Dead, the middle film of George Romero's "dead" trilogy, is a case in point.  You want zombies, we got your zombies RIGHT HERE!  You want blood?  Guts?  Flesh eating?  Oh boy, does Dawn of the Dead ever deliver!<p>And then it does something really unique - it also delivers drama, engaging characters with realistic delimmas, a smartly crafted story, and a heavy dose of dead-on social satire.  And did I mention that it's just flat-out scary as hell, too?<p>There is one scene in particular, toward the beginning, that still haunts me - twenty some-odd years after I first saw it.  The National Guard has been called in to clear a tenament building.  In the basement, they find a cage where the dead have been locked away.  The simple, unsettling music of Goblin rises on the soundtrack, underscored by a heartbeat-like bass drum.  There are the zombies, many in death shrouds, feasting on body parts.  Guardsman Peter Washington (Ken Foree) steps into the nightmare with a pistol to dispatch the zombies with bullets to their heads.  The whole thing takes on a surreal, hellish texture, like a Bosch painting.  Foree's performance is striking - he is truly IN THE MOMENT, as they say, without a hint of the winking self-awareness we see in other genre flicks.  If the dead really started coming back to feed on the living, this is exactly what it be like.  This is the toll it would exact on people trying to grapple with the situation.<p>Yet, in a way, Dawn of the Dead IS self-aware.  It knows when to step back, too, and admit that it's playing with you.  Another scene, of this sort, occurs when we see a group of rednecks hunting the shambling corpses as though they were deer.  They sip coffee from thermoses, pass sandwiches around, and banter about their accuracy with their rifles.  It's a very funny bit, in part because it's so deadpan.  <p>Those are just two favorite examples.  There is much, much more to this film, and almost all of it works beautifully.  Even the sometimes obviously low budget and gleeful use of library stock music doesn't hurt.  Romero turns these limitations to his advantage, by making them serve as searing comments on mass media, consumerism, and pop culture.  <p>Performances by David Emge, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross are worthy of mention, too.  They play real people in an extraordinary situation, rather than two-dimensional horror-movie characters.<p>Dawn of the Dead schlock as high art - complex, funny, scary, and engaging.  And thank goodness it's coming back to DVD, because it's one worth watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>"Shop 'til you drop" takes on literal form in "Dawn of the Dead", Splattermeister George Romero's 1978 magnum opus of the flesh-eating Living Dead. "Dawn" rightly deserves its title as the 'Mount Everest of Zombie Movies'.<br /><br />The Zombie Apocalypse is all George Romero's fault! And if Grandmaster Romero let the Walking Dead out of their tombs with the groundbreaking "Night of the Living Dead", he gave the zombies the keys to the kingdom in this flick, which laid down all the rules for a Zombie Apocalypse and how to survive It---and, interestingly, managed to break many of them.<br /><br />Rule #1: AIM FOR THE HEAD!: When "Dawn" opens up, Philadelphia is in its death throes, though the city doesn't know it yet.<br /><br />The plague of flesh-eating monsters rising from their graves to devour the living has spread from the countryside to the big cities like a firestorm. The slightest scratch or bite causes infection, the infected die horribly, and then return to Life, hungry for the flesh of the living, a mindless Zombie.<br /><br />Rule #2: THE CAVALRY AIN'T COMING. Things go down and go down hard in the housing project: faster than you can say "tastes like Chicken", SWAT troopers Peter (the great Ken Foree) and Roger (the underrated Scott Reiniger) get outta Dodge with traffic reporter/helicopter pilot Stephen (David Emge, hereafter known as "Flyboy") and Flyboy's girlfriend, Fran (Gaylen Ross).<br /><br />When the Going gets Tough, the Tough go Shopping.<br /><br />Rule #3:HE WHO GOES "YEEHAWW" HAS A HALF-LIFE MEASURED IN NANOSECONDS. Romero moves at a taut, brisk pace, letting the feeling of impending doom sink in, the sense of increasing wrongness, all underscored by the brooding, thudding, unearthly pulsing of the Goblin soundtrack.<br /><br />What's interesting about "Dawn of the Dead" is just how much of a collaborative effort it really was: "Dawn" reprised the team that had helmed "Martin": Mike Gornick on the camera, Romero calling the shots, John Amplas (who played the young vampire Martin) running casting (and who gets gunned down as a rooftop gangsta in a quick cameo), and special spatter effects guru Tom Savini finally strutting his stuff (and getting in some quality screen time with a machete, to boot).<br /><br />Some have criticized Romero & Crew for lacking artistry in their cinematography, but think about it: "Dawn" was still a low-budget family affair, and Romero's best work has always had an edgy, guerilla feel. But the new print is gorgeous, and clear up any questions about Romero's genius: there is some beautiful stuff here.<br /><br />Take the scene with the helicopter lifting off against a dying Philadelphia skyline---with the lights in the floors of one skyscraper winking off, bottom to top, floor by floor. Or the nerve-jangling cat & mouse game between Flyboy and a zombie in a darkened engineering room. Or the sere beauty of a Mall parking lot overrun with the Dead hankering for that Blue-light special on human flesh, Aisle 9---all of this lends a brooding, sick, rotten atmosphere to "Dawn". It works in spades, and it's gorgeous, too.<br /><br />Rule #4: THEY'RE DEAD, THEY'RE ALL MESSED UP. Yes, Romero laid down the "Rules" of the Zombie apocalypse. They move at a lumbering crawl, you put `em down with a blow or bullet to the head, they don't use tools, they're deadly but stupid, they can't learn. Purists judge a remake, or any Zombie flick, according to the rules of the Romero canon.<br /><br />But take a look at "Dawn" and you'll find something interesting: Romero proceeds to violate---or toy with---nearly every rule about the Living Dead he put forth. You think turbo-zombies first showed up in "28 Days Later"? Not so: zombie kids in an abandoned airport charthouse charge at Ken Foree like they've got a Delorean in their tushses. Zombies can't use tools? Seems one of them finds a wrench very handy in breaking a truck window to take a chomp at Roger.<br /><br />Rule #5: NO GUTS, NO GLORY. If you love "Dawn of the Dead", you *must* pick up Anchor Bay's lovingly assembled "Ultimate Edition". First off, the print is gloriously restored: the colors are so intense and the picture so clear that "Dawn" looks like it could have been shot yesterday---long gone are the days of cheapo full-screen VHS copies that made early versions of "Dawn" look like porn.<br /><br />There are four DVDs, tricked out in red and black and handsomely mounted in a glossy package crammed with goodies (including the shot-for-shot comic---nothing special in itself, but a nice addition). You get commentaries with everyone, the original 'Making of' Documentary, a brand-new documentary made especially for this edition, even a creepy commercial for the Monroeville Mall.<br /><br />The real treasure trove here is the ability to watch all three versions of the movie: the original US theatrical cut (the best, in terms of pacing and atmosphere), the Extended version (featuring a tense and effective stand-off at the Phillie docks), and the shorter European version. It's intriguing to compare how editing and music can radically alter a film: in the Euro version, we have much more of Goblin's soundtrack---but everything feels off, not nearly packing as much punch.<br /><br />Rule #6:DON'T GET TRAPPED IN THE BASEMENT. Time has been kind to "Dawn of the Dead" and George Romero; justly so. "Dawn" is a deliciously wicked little jewel of a movie, one I can watch over and over again. The consumerist angle, done to death my movie critics, is a little much: Romero filmed the flick in the Monroeville Mall because it was cheap, not because he was making a scathing commentary about American consumerism.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is a movie about the extremes of Consumerism: the Zombies have risen again as the ultimate consumers, after all.<br /><br />They now consume our Flesh.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>George Romero's 1978 horror film features 4 people trapped<br />in a shopping mall fighting hungry zombies.

Not for the faint at heart or those easily grossed out. Lots of blood,and exposed intestines. Ken Foree was great in this. He is one of 4 survivors trapped in a mall with zombies. They fly to the mall after a drug bust in an apartment where zombies are on the loose. They escape via chopper to a mall. The mall is filled with zombies. Tom Savini leads a gang of bikers who want the mall for themselves and go after Ken & co. (all GREAT performances) and you actually feel bad for the zombies who are getting attacked by Savini & his bikers. Cool twists, cool flick,great acting, & SPFX the best Zombie film if you ask me. The best version of this on DVD is the ultimate edition from Anchor Bay which has 3 versions of the movie(including Dario Argento's version)..</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I doubt most of todays audience will appreciate this as much as those that saw it at the theater, but it still has a cult following for good reason. George A. Romero was the master at Zombie movies. Sure the makeup job on this could have been better but considering his budget for his B movies, he did remarkably well. This is one of my favorites with the shopping mall as their hideout from the dead. The remake is pretty good too, but you have to see this original to fully appreciate it. Good quality DVD with extras.

This movie was made during a time when shopping malls weren't as widespread as they are today. Zombies showing up at shopping malls, trained consumers. This movie sets the standard for horror films and it is stunning in every way. The story is great, the acting above average for a horror flick and the special effects incredible. This is a movie that influenced a lot of people and has one of the largest cult followings of any movie. A timeless movie, important in what it has to say, the precedent it set for the horror genre and one of the best movies that intertwines comedy and horror effectively. 5 Stars for the second of George Romero's zombie films.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD is a classic in the HORROR genre and I just had to watch<br />this again last night.  I love this movie true the zombies look fake<br />especially when compared to Fulci's classic ZOMBIE but WHO CARES!!!<br />We have a story with characters that I found myself caring about<br />a great script and find directing. Sir Romero has always been great at<br />adding humor to his HORROR and D.O.T.D. is no exception from the beginning<br />we have chaos for the entire United States is being plagued by zombies<br />and the few humans that are alive must leave but to where???<br />Our four heroes steal a helicopter and find a abandon shopping mall.<br />We are already 20 min. into the movie but this is where it starts for<br />me for this is where I found myself caring about the four stars and hoping they all make it alive(which is unusual for your buddy Clint<br />for normally I say LET THEM DIE!) When two of our heroes GET IT<br />so to speak I was angry!  The way this movie builds up and ends<br />was funtastic(sic) and I am truly glad to have in my HORROR COLL.<br />If you are not big on GORE(shame on you) than please stay away<br />however if you can handle heads chopped off by helicopter,limbs<br />being eaten and children being blown away by a machine gun than<br />by all means watch DAWN of the DEAD for it is ONE of our greatest<br />HORROR films especially for 78(the awesome HALLOWEEN and INVASION of the<br />BODY SNATCHERS also came out this year) the ultimate edition is the<br />only way to go on this flick for it has in depth views on the making<br />and of course all three versions of the film(I prefer the extended<br />version myself Romero's dir.cut is 2nd and you can have the awful<br />Dario Argento cut LOVE YA DARIO STILL) anyway if you love HORROR<br />DAWN of the DEAD is a must!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD is a classic horror film although only a short time has passed since it was released. With a remake in the works it's important to go back and take a look at the original. And it's a horror film that loses nothing with time.<br /><br />The story picks up where the original left off, a world where flesh eating zombies are roaming the countryside in search of fresh kill. This plague, which is never explained as to how it began, has multiplied and now the ratio of zombies to live humans is about equal.<br /><br />Enter a pair of S.W.A.T. members (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) who have tired of hunting down these zombies. Reiniger plans on escaping the city with a friend and his girlfriend (David Emgee and Gaylen Ross), a pilot and a producer for the local TV station.<br />They four set off to find a safe haven and discover a world gone mad along the way, with order destroyed and hunting parties roaming the countryside.<br /><br />As they fly, they come across an abandoned mall and land on the roof. Noticing the obvious pluses of taking the mall over, blocking the entranceways and staying put, they make their play. But taking out a mall filled with these creatures is not an easy task.<br /><br />Blocking the doors with trucks from a nearby freight company and then dispensing of the zombies within, the four find it a home away from home. One casualty in their conquest leaves the other three enjoying the spoils of war and soon finding themselves bored.<br /><br />The three reinvigorate their will to live, as Ross learns to fly the helicopter and they monitor the radio in the hopes that there are other survivors. When a call comes in they almost invite the callers, but then discover that it's only a band of marauding bikers on the move, raiding any and everything in their path. A battle ensues in which not only the bikers but the zombies reinvade the mall as well.<br /><br />What has been most talked about with this film is the fact that it is more than a straight on piece of gore filled horror. Director George Romero has used the mall and the creatures as a metaphor for the mindless zombie like shoppers seen everywhere in this country, evident in today's malls as much as it was in 1978 when this film was made.  Go to any mall in the land today and walk around looking at the shoppers after seeing this flick and you will be sure to see one or more characters come to life before your eyes.<br /><br />While a horror movie doesn't have to rely on gore, this movie was one of the first to utilize it, garnering it an X rating had it actually been submitted. Relegated to midnight showing across the country and no newspaper advertising, it still gathered a cult following that included the likes of Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel.<br /><br />The movie takes the day to day spots that we all go to each week and turns them into the most horrific of locations. With this in mind, we are put upon not in a castle or haunted house, but a shopping center that contains all that we feel we need or want. It is a well lit and mundane location, a spot where we are offered muzak and water fountains, only to have it tainted by the horrors of these creatures.<br />We are taken into a world filled with fear of the unknown, of a future that may not exist. And we are given a chance to look at ourselves in a different light. And at the same time, we scared to death by both what we may be and by what may happen.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>There are a lot of things I love about this movie. I love the dialogue about the zombies including "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth." I love all the gore scenes; like toward the end there is an awesome gore scene where the zombies are ripping some guy apart and showing his guts. It even has the classic look of the 70's! Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide. They soon take refuge in a huge mall and make themselves at home. Soon, more zombies get inside the mall and they must fight for their lives. I highly recommend DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Picking up after the events of "Night of the Living Dead," in which unknown forces caused the bodies of the recently deceased to return to life in search of live, human prey, "Dawn of the Dead" instantly slams us into a world crumbling in confusion, panic, and desperate violence. As people break their ties and scatter to survive, one band of four, a helicopter pilot, his pregnant girlfriend, and two swat team members, take refuge in a shopping mall surrounded by the flesh-eating dead. Perhaps they can take control of the already infested mall, but what then?<br /><br />In 1968, George A. Romero shocked the world with his apocalyptic vision, "Night of the Living Dead." The black and white, low-budget film became a phenomenon that spawned remakes, countless copycats, and 3 excellent sequels, the first of which came eleven years later. That first sequel was "Dawn of the Dead," and it would seem that most zombie fans consider it to be the best film of its kind. Loaded with satire and comic-book violence, some, Romero himself for example, do not even consider it a true "horror" film. Its extreme action and over-the-top look and style make it far more fun than scary to many, but I'd count myself among those who feel that there are definitely some genuinely horrific moments and themes throughout. But, whether you're watching it for fun or fright, this is a movie that is more than it seems, and the original "Dawn of the Dead" definitely deserves a place among the greatest films ever made. If you're a zombie fan, you know this is a must own. If you're not, and especially if you haven't even experienced the genre, make sure you give this one a look before committing yourself against it. Be prepared for some wild and gory stuff, yes, but try to look beyond it as well.<br /><br />Dawn was followed in 1985 by a sequel that is good as part of the series, but far less enjoyable (in my opinion), "Day of the Dead." Day was followed by the most recent sequel, "Land of the Dead," in 2005. Land was an excellent installment in the series. One year before that, a remake of Dawn was released without the involvement of Romero. It's an excellent film in its own right, but definitely tailored to modern sensibilities. All action and very little substance, and I'm not a fan of its fast-moving, purely disease-infected zombies. With the new wave of zombie and zombie-like films that have been coming out recently, the original "Dawn of the Dead" has yet to be topped. Though, I have to give special points to "Shaun of the Dead." It comes highly recommended as well.<br /><br />There is truly no better way to own "Dawn of the Dead" than in the 4-disc "Ultimate Edition" from Anchor Bay. You get three beautiful, widescreen versions of the film, each on its own disc with a different commentary track and extras, and a disc full of documentaries as well. Disc One is Romero's true cut, the U.S. Theatrical version, along with a great commentary by Director George Romero, the legendary make-up/effects man Tom Savini, and Assistant Director Chris Romero (George's wife). Also on Disc One are TV Spots and Theatrical Trailers, Radio Spots, a Poster and Advertising Gallery, a George Romero bio, and a comic book preview. Disc Two offers up the Extended Version. This is coupled with an audio commentary by Producer Richard P. Rubinstein. Most interesting is the very dated Monroeville Mall commercial which is also included along with a Behind-the-Scenes photo gallery, a memorabilia gallery, and production stills. Disc Three presents the European Version of the film. This is a more straightforward horror cut of the film from the hands of Dario Argento. Disc Three also includes one of those always fun cast commentaries, and we are lucky enough to get all four of the brilliant lead actors together here for this one! We also get a Dario Argento bio, a home video and soundtrack art gallery, an international poster and advertising gallery, an international pressbook gallery, U.K. TV Spots, international theatrical trailers, and an international lobby card gallery. Disc Four is where the documentaries are at, and here we are treated to: The Dead Will Walk, a great new documentary including interviews with just about everyone you'd hope to hear from; Roy Frumkes' Documentary of the Dead, a fascinating documentary actually filmed during the making of the film; On-Set Home Movies from a most appreciated zombie extra, Robert Langer; And a great tour of the Monroeville Mall with one of the stars, Ken Foree. There's also a bizarre little Easter Egg on the disc. At least, I think it was on Disc Four. After watching so much material on 4 different discs, it can be hard to keep track!<br /><br />The DVD set comes in sturdy, fold-open cardboard packaging with a slip case, DVD guide with mall map, and a neat little comic book teaser that illustrates the first part of the film (ending right when they arrive at the mall). It's a fantastic collection and a must own for any true fan!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Ah, Dawn of the Dead, so much to thank for when it comes to my favorite horror flicks Resident Evil: Extinction and 28 Weeks Later. This horror film most certainly revered as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and why would anyone challenge this? The zombies look really cheesy, but the gore is what makes this movie so good in its zombie themes. The storyline is basically about four people who go to stay at a mall during the zombie invasion to stay alive. The storyline is vague unfortunately(there's no more room in hell so zombies walk the earth). The action is still solid to this day, the gore is still awesome, the characters are still awesome, and the creepy vibe is still there.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>George Romero can rest assured that his zombie classic will not become dated over time, despite advances in special effects, cinematography, and makeup because Dawn of the Dead is in a league of its own in terms of story, characterization, themes, and overall ambience.<br /><br />The success of Romero's "Dead" films lies in an often duplicated trait of horror films: isolation.  It's something that Romero has mastered to a tee.  While seemingly simple, the concept of keeping the characters in an abandoned shopping mall with a bunch of zombies creates a slight fear among its viewers, whether your watching it at home or in a theater.  It's been repeated time and again, but Romero's ability to isolate his characters is a hallmark of his films.<br /><br />Romero's characters are also more complex than those in a basic horror film.  While traditional horror films have characters suffer from pure stupidity, Romero is more interested in human instincts and characters succumbing to their own vices or even their own primal urges.  This is found in the way the survivors decide to not only explore, but get more than they need in the shopping mall.<br /><br />Besides being a wonderful horror film, however, it's so much more, as other viewers have noted.  I think no other horror film addresses the concept of consumerism, down to the point of comparing shoppers to zombies.  The film's finale is riddled with irony - and you might even be granted a smirk here and there.<br /><br />As for its timelessness, beyond the film's themes, Romero has created a film that, even if effects don't date well (and they actually do pretty well, especially for the time, gotta love Savini),  feels terrifying.  I think being trapped in a store is one of those nightmares everyone has.  This film may be the reason why.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>In this sequel to "Night of the Living Dead", it's a few weeks later after the events of "Night". The situation is getting worse, so two reporters, along with two SWAT team members, decide to steal a helicopter to find a place where they can hide from flesh eating zombies. They find a secluded mall and decide to stop there for the night in order to get some sleep. They decide to stay in the mall, and they barricade themselves in a small room while periodically going downstairs to get things they need, while defending themselves against the zombies and a biker gang in the meantime.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>Im not big into zombie movies but this was REALLY GOOD. Im sure it was a classic for its time. It is one of the most grusome movies Ive seen and ive seen many horror movies. The director is an amazing filmmaker. I dont get shocked or scared easy but this one shocked me. I wasnt really scared by it but when the zombies start eating people it shocked me , it was so realistic. The plot is good to. I recomend this for zombie fans or just horror fans in general like me. I dont like most zombie movies and this one I enjoyed. The only part i wish wouldve been diffrent were the ending, it couldve been better. The actors were pretty good and the zombies great. The makeup work, the violence IS A++++ the best. Highly recomended. Classic. Id say in general its a 4 star movie but among horror films a 4.5.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead is a extraordinarily odd movie, which has very little in common with the earlier film, Night of the Living Dead.  However, simply recreating the oppressive atmosphere and dread of the original would likely have been near impossible and a bit redundant even if he had succeeded, so it's good that he moved it in a new direction.  Fortunately, despite the many differences, NotLD and DotD are similarly excellent.<p>Although they are very different, the basic plots to the first 2 films of Romero's trilogy are more or less the same: there's a zombie apocalypse, which forces small group of survivors to hideout in and barricade a building in hopes of simply waiting it out.  Now, however, the small farmhouse is replaced with a huge mall, and we are given an even smaller group of 4 survivors.  Overall the acting is pretty good, especially considering the budget it had.  The characters are generally fairly appealing, so long as they are intended to be, and they have a realistic ordinariness to them, much like they did in NotLD.  Despite the emphasis on violence and action through out the film they're some fairly powerful scenes just between the main characters.  There's a great scene of them hanging out in their nicely furnished apartment, listening to some sad Spanish/classical sounding guitar while they kill time by gambling with their worthless money.  It gives a great sense of desolation.  There's also an even somewhat touching scene involving the one character visiting someone's grave.(In fact, I think pretty much all the scenes involving that characters death are very effective, though I won't go into that so as not to give too much away.)  It's effective, as are pretty much all the best conventionally dramatic scenes in the film, because it's so simple and un-theatrical.<p>In my review of NotLD I urged new viewers to discard their expectations form modern horror films.  This is perhaps even more necessary for Dawn of the Dead.  Frankly, it mainly classifies as a horror film out of convenience, as it blends and shifts from horror to action to adventure to satire to straight drama.(It's rather reminiscent of the much newer and equally excellent 28 Days Later in this way.)  As for the classic complaint to all horror films, "It's not scary." well, this one isn't even trying to be scary, for the most part. (And if you doubt this assertion, just listen to the commentary.  Romero pretty much says this is the case.) Still, it does have a few remarkably powerful and eerie scenes.  The raid on the projects is genuinely horrific, (if not scary in the conventional sense), particularly the slow extermination of the zombies in the basement.  There are some good scenes in the mall too, particularly when the guys go off to clear it out, and one zombie just stares at Fran through the glass and later, when the mall has been cleared out, but they all still hear the zombies rubbing and scratching against the glass, trying to get in.  These scenes are particularly effective as they come towards the middle, where it becomes more action/adventure/satire oriented, so they provide good contrast.<p>Much is made of the violence in this film,(done by gore legend Tom Savini) and not without good reason.  Despite the fact that it was released about 25 years ago, the sheer volume of gore shown in this film outdoes anything I've seen released by a major studio up to this day.(Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the only one that comes close that I've seen) Admittedly most of it is fairly dated, largely because of the blood (which is too orange and the texture doesn't seem right) but it still has a pretty strong impact a lot of the time.  There are something like 70 graphically portrayed gunshot wounds in the film along with plenty of melee violence and the requisite cannibalism.  The scenes of flesh eating are always pretty gross, particularly the zombie-man taking chunks out of his still living wife and the montage of mutilation and gut-eating towards the end.  It's also got a very nice and very sudden shotgun-induced head explosion. (If you really want gore, though, you need to check out the sequel, Day of the Dead. Actually, you should check that out either way)<br />Obviously, if you are disturbed or offended by graphic violence you oughta pass this up, though you probably already knew that.<p>Much is made of the satire in humor in this film, and while it is pretty effective, it isn't the emphasis of the film the some people would like to pretend it is.  That is to say, the film isn't simply a vehicle for Romero's thoughts on modern society and consumerism and whatnot.  That element certainly is there, but as a whole he mostly wanted to make an enjoyable film. (Once again, if you doubt this listen to Romero in the commentary.) Still, the satire is very important in that it provides a great contrast to the other elements of the picture.  This matters because these bizarre tone changes are one of the main things that make the film so good.<p>There seem to be some conflicting opinions about the conclusion where the film kinda tears apart, with an invasion of weird bikers and particularly graphic violence mixed with some odd physical comedy.  Personally, I think it works, and the humor and violence aren't just mixed randomly; it starts out more weird and lighthearted and steadily becomes more dark and gruesome. <p>This is a pretty bare-bones DVD, but it looks and sounds excellent.  Apparently there's gonna be a special addition later this year with a different cut (which is NOT a directors cut, by the way, just an earlier, formative one.) as well, and it'll presumably have more extra features.  So if you care about that sort of stuff you oughta hold off til then.(I think it's coming out in October.)  If you haven't seen it, check this version out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead (George Romero, 1979)<p>I can't believe I haven't already written a review of this, given the number of times I've seen it. But I watched it again last night since the remake is coming out soon, so...<p>Dawn of the Dead begins an unspecified time after the closing of Night of the Living Dead. The zombies have reached at least as far east as Philadelphia, where two workers at a TV station decide to steal the weather chopper and head for Canada. They're taking a friend along with them, who brings another guy. The four of them are the core of the movie, aborting the Canada idea when they run out of fuel, stopping on the outskirts of Pittsburgh to take up residence in a shopping mall.<p>There are simply not enough good things to be said about this movie. While it didn't completely redefine the genre the way Night of the Living Dead did, Romero pushed the American envelope (as he is so fond of doing), incorporating giallo-style violence that Americans were completely unfamiliar with at the time while all the while pursuing the same sociopolitical commentary that makes Night of the Living Dead so rewatchable even thirty-five years later. Romero is a master at getting his point across without being too preachy about it; ninety-nine percent of the movie's hundred twenty-eight minutes (in the American version) keeps the commentary below the radar (all save one brief scene that's a little on the heavy-handed side).<p>For an ultra-low-budget flick, the acting is tremendous. All four main characters do their jobs capably, and they're surrounded with a supporting cast whose lack of acting resumes since is criminal. Special note should be given to Richard France, a member of the Romero "inner circle" since There's Always Vanilla, as an overly pragmatic television commentator who's just a joy to watch every time he comes onscreen.<p>The pacing is excellent, the effects not completely overdone (though, honestly, they did get better in Day of the Dead), the mix of humor and disgust perfect. There is very little to be said wrong about this brilliant movie. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to enjoy yourself tremendously. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Whether the upcoming remake is any good or not doesn't matter; George Romero's 1979 follow up to the legendary Night of the Living Dead can still dish out the chills nearly 25 years after it's initial release.  We all know the story by now: four people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall while hordes of the undead hungrily try to claw their way inside.  Dawn of the Dead is nothing short of epic with great, taut performances and Tom Savini's landmark gut ripping gore effects, plus the satirical stab at consumer culture that made the film a hit with critics.  The film still manages to be shocking to this day, and it has aged quite gracefully.  Anchor Bay finally decided to re-release Dawn of the Dead on DVD, and it features a fantastic commentary by Romero, Savini, and crew.  Other than that, the extras are a bit lacking, even though a deluxe edition is supposedly due out later this year.  All in all, if you've ever called yourself a horror fan, than Dawn of the Dead deserves a place in your film library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>It was great timing to re-release the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; before the &quot;new&quot; version comes out in theaters.  Before purchasing this DVD, I hadn't seen the original in nearly 20 years.  &quot;DOTD&quot; is as disturbing as any horror film ever made.  It mixes black humor in horror in such a way that many other films have attempted to copy with little success.  The acting may be a bit stlited at times, and the storytelling might be a tad rough around the edges, but horror films don't get much more realistic (or brutal) than this.  It also appears (at least from the previews) that the new theatrical version is going to be a far different movie from this one.<p>The DVD, however, is a bit of disappointment in one repsect.  Other than commentary from Director George Romero, there isn't much in the way of special features.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>One thing about George Romero, he's not shy about milking his creations for all their worth.  God knows how many editions of Night of the Living Dead there are available in various collections or editions.<br /><br />First, lets just call it as it is.  Dawn of the Dead..the original is the greatest Zombie movie ever and one of the scariest movies ever.  Picking up after NOTLD, by now the Zombies have run rampant and people are fleeing wherever they can.<br /><br />A small group of four including two SWAT team members a TV reporter, and her helicopter pilot boyfriend flee the city, finally setting down on the roof of a large, suburban shopping mall.<br /><br />The soon realize that the mall has everything they need to sustain them including shelter, food, water, even a bank loaded with cash just in case man survives.  But first, they must clean the mall of hundreds of zombies who roam the halls because the mall was an important place in their life.<br /><br />The four go on a hunt and destroy mission to first seal the doors to the mall and block them with large semi-trucks.  Then they kill off all the zombies in the mall and our living a life of relative ease when a rogue group of bikers led by make-up guru Tom Savini comes storming into the mall to loot it.<br /><br />With the mall now filled with zombies again the four have to fight off the zombies and bikers.<br /><br />Savini is at the top of his game giving us incredible and incredibly gory effects like the face exploding from the shotgun, the top of a zombie head being sheared off by a chopper blade, and various scenes of entrails being torn out from still living victims and eaten by the zombies.<br /><br />To some extent, now 25 years later or so the effect look a bit dated.  The blood in parts looks more like red paint but still this is one great movie and the one which all other zombie movies must compare to.<br /><br />It is far better than the recent remake and superior to the sequel "Day of the Dead".

The story is set 3 weeks after the outbreak and will be on an island.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>This DVD marks the 186th release of DOTD on home video. But seriously, it's THE one you cannot be without, a fan of the movie or not.<br /><br />George A. Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple, but scary, idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet. The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape. Resistance is futile. A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way. Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven. Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization.<br /><br />After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles. Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world.<br /><br />While not as scary as the remake, this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell. I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery (every other review here does) but it is quite intelligent (if a bit dated in the present day). There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies.<br /><br />There characters (especially Ken Foree) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic. It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization (if not the end of the world...just humans) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach.<br /><br />The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split. I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original/remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time.<br /><br />Each film has their weaknesses and strengths. The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening. While in the remake they'd be on you, ripping your throat out before you can even say 'What the..?' And the actual 'DAWN' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake. Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it.<br /><br />This release features 3 different versions of the film. The 126 minute American cut, the 117 minute European Cut and the Extended 139 minute version. The German 156 cut does not get a mention. Extra features are plentiful and, for once, they're for a film where extras make sense, not the fluff we get usually. Two big documentaries 'The Dead Will Walk' and 'Document of the Dead' are included as well as loads of commentaries, interviews, clips, trailers etc. Even a mini version of the first issue of the DOTD comic book. The American and European versions are Divimax which means an excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 6.1/DTS sound. The extended cut is plain old anamorphic and Mono.<br /><br />This is definitely a horror classic, far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs. True greatness and not only an important film but a true labor of love. Everyone involved made it because they love the genre and were not just trying to pay this weeks rent cheque. An important element missing from 99.99% of horror films made these days. Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini (who is always the highlight of any movie) as Blade an remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy...'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>A four disc edition? Who can ask for more? Obviously we saw it coming... the remake was there... the Divimax edition early this year... everybody was saying a big multi-disc edition was coming... and here it is!<p>To start analyzing this film we must take a look at NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. This film was a landmark as it introduced the zombies as we know today. Now, DAWN OF THE DEAD set a new landmark. In it, the zombies were a mature (sub)genre in modern cinema.<p>What makes this film so important? Everything! First it is the brilliant screenplay. The story... you already know: as the zombie population increases more and more, four people barricate themselves inside a big shopping mall, where they endulge themselves with all consumering desires they can think of.<p>Sounds simple? It is, but there is more than meets the eye: as the zombies try to get in (you'll have to wonder why) the four heroes inside discover their paradise makes them more empty than they would have thought it would... and slowly, life start making no sense.<p>DAWN OF THE DEAD is the kind of film that has been changing as the decades pass. Its violence seems to have softened if we think of all the action and horror films who came in the decades that followed (just like it happened with other horror landmarks like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). Its makeup is not comparable to the vast majority of horror films that came after (who had bigger makeup budgets)... but on the other hand, elements like tension, drama, character development and social critique have all grown more powerful then in all of the films that followed.<p>In other words, audiences who see this film today, many times discover the fact that its weight is changing fields... from graphic horror to social horror. And this kind of horror is no less potent and much more rare.<p>Mr. Romero is one of those rare horror screenwriter/directors who do have a strong critic point of view (and we can see it as he continues to deliver so in his later third zombie film - the sadly underated gem - DAY OF THE DEAD).<p>Clearly, this is a multi-layered film that demands multiple levels of reading. You must be aware of all the issues put inside this film. Otherwise, if you're in just for the cheap thrills, gore and violence, you'll probably be disappointed.<p>As a product of the late seventies, this is a production triumph because it manages to deliver a lot with minimum budget. The remake released early this year made a great update on this basic premisse. <p>I loved them both.<p>This edition seems to be more than we've all asked for (now that the simpler Divimax edition made all the money it could...). Here, you'll find all the versions and lots of extras.<p>But again... DAWN OF THE DEAD is a film that I am sure will be seen and celebrated for years to come. See it with an open mind and you too will discover why.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>One of the greatest horror films of all time, director George A. Romero's masterpiece gets the high def treatment.  Anchor bay has given the film every other kind of treatment as well, maybe not as much as the Evil dead series though.  For a film like this I really don't mind double dipping.  If your looking for extra features I'd go with the Ultimate edition which contains the U.S theatrical version, extended version, European version, and a ton of extras.  If you want the most pristine transfer go with this blu ray version.  I'd suggest both, and this blu ray title is reasonably priced when compared to other titles.<br />Another thing I've found with blu ray titles is to buy them online via Amazon or other sites, the prices in the store are even more ridiculous.<br />Most are familiar with the story's plot, zombies are taking over and we follow four survivors in there helicopter to the mall where they try to adapt and make a life for themselves.  Besides being a freaky horror film with real scares and gore it's writer/director George A. Romero using satire to make a statement in 1978 about American consumerism, people die , turn into zombies and are drawn to the mall to subconsciously walk with there zombie strut with their blank facial expressions, ready to "consume".</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD...it just oozes with fright and serious zombie innovation. This sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD really lives up to its predecessor in ways that most horror film sequels do not. The best part, that there are true hints of comedy thrown into the mix of gore, terror, scares, and what is the most blatant poke at 'consumerism'.<br /><br />'DAWN' picks up apparently where the first 'DEAD' left off, with a band of survivors trying to escape the wrath of the all the mindless zombies that have infested the country (and probably the rest of the world). They head to a shopping mall where, to their dismay, they find more flesh-eating zombies waiting for them. In the beginning of the movie, there is a segment that will make you cringe as some officials reach the basement level of a complex and find a horde of zombies feasting on flesh. The survivors inside the mall find they must now band together what they need and rely on each other to survive, and unfortunately not all of them do survive, but this is where the blatant poke at 'consumerism' really comes into full effect. It's very funny, very obvious, but also a thread in the spool of the movie. It's an integral part of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but so are the horde of zombies. My favorite part is the segment where a zombie comes walking towards Roger while he gases up the helicopter, and instead of actually making it that far, his head gets cut off by the copter blades because he walks way too close to them. That is a comical moment, but also a scary reminder that there aren't enough bullets in the world to kill off all the zombies.<br /><br />DAWN OF THE DEAD is another masterpiece from the wicked mind of George A. Romero, and while DAY OF THE DEAD would follow a slightly different path, DAWN OF THE DEAD is another reminder that horror really had plenty of genius left in its twisted little world. (Make sure you get the rare but find-able 137 minute unrated director's cut of this version, you'll be glad you did)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right; I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero.  1968's Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films, in my opinion, featuring a virtually perfect ending.  1979's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, is another true classic, featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under 17 could be admitted to theaters to see it.  By today's standards, the film is hardly shocking at all, but Romero's up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer.  The level of violence in this film is delightfully high; sure, it all looks pretty fake now, but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and guts.<p>I don't, as a general rule, care for zombies or zombie movies.  Zombies are ugly and stupid - they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner, only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking (and eating).  That's about all they do here, as well, but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic.  We don't know what started the trouble; as the movie opens, the world is already in a heap of a mess.  There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens, but it's obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucket.  <p>TV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner, demanding people leave their self-barricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations.  Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) flies his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and friend Stephen Andrews (David Emge) out of town in a helicopter - Stephen's sharp-shooting buddy Peter Washington (Ken Foree) also comes along for the ride.  Low on gas and unsure of what they should do, the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while.  Isolating themselves upstairs, our would-be survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies.  The place is crawling with pasty-faced zombies, so they put together a plan that will, or so they hope, keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site; once that is done, it's just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside.  Of course, as we all know, people are stupid, so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers.  Along the way, countless numbers of zombies are shot, bludgeoned, and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy.  Never fear, there is some zombie feeding as well, although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten (zombies are supposed to eat brains - that's my personal zombie philosophy).  One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film: how will it end?  The world has basically come to an end, making for some long odds for our heroes' survival.  While the ending is not completely satisfying, I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classics.<p>Let me speak to the violence portrayed here.  However shocking it was upon the movie's release, it really isn't shocking at all in this day and age; the quantity of violence, though still impresses.  Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus, but few of the &quot;deaths&quot; are what I would call gory.  In many cases, a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down; in some cases there is blood, especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding, but you certainly won't see anybody lying in a pool of blood.  In many cases, a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all - certainly, the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesn't exist here.  The blood, I might also mention, doesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.<p>In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made.  It cemented George Romero's name in the hallowed shrines of horror; it crossed the Rubicon (or perhaps I should say the river Styx) and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave.  There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on (I personally think it's something of a stretch to classify four desperate, would-be survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly).  However you want to interpret it, Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best, up close and in your face.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Having just seen the new version and this one again back to back, I have to say it; Romero emerges as #1, 20+ years after the fact. This has to be one of the grisliest (true gore, not over the top ridiculousness) yet humorous and intelligent horror films of the last two decades. But I also agree with what another reviewer said; try to get an unedited version; that's the only way to really get into this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>Why have dvd so collectible than blu-ray ? this edition have a comic book. it's have four disc. So i buy it and prices it's make sense. Maybe someday i think to buy blu-ray edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>George A. Romero achieved a cinematic feat by making Dawn of the Dead by telling a truly grotesque tale of flesh eating zombies.  The story in itself really is a suspenseful gore fanatic's dream where humor and entertainment jump out when least expected.  It is within the unexpected where Romero succeeds in generating a horror film that does not only frighten, but also creates much room for contemplation and reflection.  The combination of fear and existential philosophy develops an interesting opportunity for the audience to look at themselves in the mirror while light satire emerges through the reflection of American society.<br /><br />In Philadelphia exhausted employees of a TV station feebly try to convey what is happening on the streets.  An invited expert unveils the truth, but the interviewer deems it implausible that the streets are full of zombies devouring human flesh.  Despite the interviewer's doubtfulness he continues to question the expert while several employees begin to leave their posts.  In the middle of this chaos Francine (Gaylen Ross) tries to do her best in helping, but when her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge) arrives he tells her to meet him on the roof at 9PM.  She realizes it is high time to get out of the city before it is too late.<br /><br />At a different location in the city the police force has joined up with the National Guard in order to get control of the problem, but without much luck.  In one of the poor housing projects Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) bumps into Peter (Ken Foree).  They are two likeminded characters and realize that they might need each other in order to survive.  Roger invites Peter to come along, as his friend Stephen has a helicopter and they are leaving tonight.  Peter takes his chance with Roger and they leave the city of Philadelphia to its destiny with the living dead, as four of them fly out of the city.<br /><br />During their flight they stop for fuel and encounter more zombies, which forces them to reconsider their plan.  When they by chance fly by a shopping mall they take their chance to check out the place and if they can get some food.  After some exploration of the mall they realize that they have stumbled on what they think is heaven on earth.  Sure, they are fortunate, but it comes with a price, a very costly price.  At the same time, an interesting allegorical perspective of the societal values appear with death everywhere around them.  The value of items seems futile when they find out that Francine is pregnant, which makes them think about the future.  Those who have read Everyman can draw parallels between the Medieval morality play and the film.  For example, there is a scene where they find an abundance of money, but what is money when death is knocking on the door?  Riches do not matter, beauty does not matter, friends are about to run out, no kin exists, and the only thing that is left is the action they take and how they could affect the future - a possible hope.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect in the film is how they barrier themselves from zombies, but also possible visitors.  Here Romero touches on the basic idea of a government building, which is built on the idea of protecting one's territory.  This provides strong suggestions that humans are territorial, which is true when studying a world map.  The simplicity in which Romero applies this notion into an intriguing situation where fear is the constant that keeps them alive and what they have could help keep them alive for the time being.<br /><br />The film has some years on its neck, which means that the special effects are not up to the standards of 2005.  However, it still has its desired effect, and nothing of the story is lost due to the technical aspects of the film.  Besides the technical aspects Romero intendeds this film to be a sequel to his Night of the Living Dead (1968) and he surpasses the initial film by light years in both horror and wisdom.  The conclusive verdict of the film is that Dawn of the Dead offers a truly remarkable cinematic experience that offers high level suspense in an insightful horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this movie when I was only 9 years<br /><br />old. Back when I was young, I didn't view this as a<br /><br />scary movie at all. I'd actually would go outside<br /><br />and pretend I was the leading role guy Ken Fortee<br /><br />killing the zombies. Now, I have a different view<br /><br />and realize just what it would be like for some<br /><br />thing like this to really happen. The acting is<br /><br />really realistic and more natural which could<br /><br />almost make you forget that this can't happen.<br /><br />The music comes in at the right times that help<br /><br />pull you into the movie. It's high in gore, but<br /><br />no over the top that it isn't believeable. The<br /><br />zombies look alot outdated... ESP the clothes<br /><br />they wear. But hey, it was 26 years ago and what<br /><br />can you really expect? I do think the movie drags<br /><br />alittle bit at a latter part of the movie, but<br /><br />that doesn't pull the movie down overall.<br /><br />The characters bring different things to the table...<br /><br />Ken is is the take charge kind of guy that is the<br /><br />toughest... Scott is kind of cocky and at times<br /><br />forgets the seriousness of the situation and also<br /><br />sometimes borders on being insane... Flyboy is the<br /><br />guy that handles the planes and is probably the<br /><br />smartest of the four. Gaylen brings most of the<br /><br />emotional feelings that the other 3 don't provide<br /><br />very often.<br /><br />My favorite character is Ken because he is strong,<br /><br />aware, and has most of the common sense. He's just<br /><br />the type you want to lead your team. The one I dis-<br /><br />liked most was Flyboy... He just seems out of place<br /><br />at some spots and is sort of on the soft side and<br /><br />he really lacked charisma . But in a way, his death<br /><br />seemed to effect me more than the others.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies<br /><br />to come out. If you are picky about movies that look<br /><br />dated this might turn you off. But if you are open<br /><br />minded and like horror/zombie movies you are most<br /><br />likely going to like this movie.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />My favorite parts are when they are at the hangers,<br /><br />Ken and Scott first going down into the mall, watching<br /><br />them get all the weapons and the ending. I think people<br /><br />misunderstood.... The ending is supposed to make you<br /><br />wonder if they made it. When Gaylen Ross mentions how<br /><br />low they are on gas that leaves me to under if they<br /><br />"Made it" as the movie was ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>best Horror box out there, amazing stuff! go get this one now!</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Anchor Bay have outdone themselves with this one.  This has to be the most complete package they've ever assembled.  It's only for the hardcore Romero fan though, so I'd stick with the theatrical dvd that came out a few months back if you're just a casual fan.  4 discs on this baby:  The first one is the theatrical version we've all seen many times.  The second is the extended version which some of us have seen.  It's about 10+ minutes longer and includes some extra dialogue, extra gore, more biker footage and more shopping footage and newsroom footage as well.  It also has a scene that explains how the "Have you got any cigarettes?" cop appears out of nowhere.  Disc 3 is Dario Argento's European cut.  This is interesting.  It runs about ten minutes shorter than the theatrical version  yet contains snippets-usually a few seconds-of footage not seen in either the theatrical or extended versions!  You're probably asking why bother including a third disc?  Why not take the "new" footage from Argento's version and put it in the Extended version to make one long cut of the film?  Well, in Argento's version, there are some snippets removed from the film as well.  This kinda takes from the humor and character development, but Argento's interested in pacing here.  He edits these scenes and rearranges the music on the soundtrack so the "action" music plays in totally different scenes, making the movie move at a totally different pace.  In fact, the first half hour just zooms by in this version.  They're at the mall 30 minutes into it which isn't the case with the other versions.  It slows down when necessary, but Argento keeps the movie going.  In fact, he edits it so it looks like a Dario Argento film.  Whether you love his version or hate it is up to your personal taste.  It's not better or worse, just different.  A huge hit in Europe as well.  Disc 4 is the extra goodies.  It has a retrospective 75 minute documentary that talks to all the stars in front and behind the camera.  Very cool.  It also has Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead, a hour and a half documentary made while Romero was filming Dawn.  I saw this years ago and it's very fun to watch.  There's also a tour of the mall with Ken Foree and other cast memebers, as well as other documentary footage.  All four discs come with the trailers and still galleries as you'd expect.  The first three discs all have commentaries by different people.  Basically this set will keep you busy for awhile.  If you're a huge fan of this film, I'm sure you know this set is out now, and I can tell you that it's worth every penny, so snatch it as soon as you can.  Fantastic movie(all 3).  There's only one Dawn Of The Dead.....You hear that Zack Snyder???  Only one!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I was raised on this movie, much to my mothers chagrin. Every single weekend I had to rent it. I loved Night of the Living dead so much, that when saw this one at my local video store I went nuts. George Romero is a genius; even my 9 year old mind could see that. The whole plotline where the dead suddenly rise and want to eat the living and a group of survivor's hole up in a mall couldn't have made me happier, a whole entire mall as your house? what? YES! The makeup and special effects were sub par, blue tint and Hare Krishna's, but I still wouldn't have wanted them near me. I understand now as an adult the social commentary Romero was making, but beyond all of that his movies are just plain fun. No one has ever been able to touch his writing ability, his characters, his locations, and his zombies. No One. I even picked up the soundtrack featuring The Goblins, I still hum the music when I go to the mall. My favorite Zombie in this movie has to be the Nurse, she actually was spoken to by Romero for being "too over the top" with her flailing and facial expressions, just watching her Zomb-out cracks me up. My favorite character is "Fly Boy" the pilot, in his suave jacket, slick hair. Throughout the movie he is just a wimp, he cannot shoot, he isnt reliable to his pregnant girlfriend, he does the wrong thing at every turn BUT when he finally is eaten in the elevator he turns into the biggest badest nastiest zombie who has retained important knowledge and who is given the best makeup treatment to boost the importance of his change. Fly-zombie twitches, and bends his neck, and lurches around gathering the other clueless corpses upward and onwards to the secret hiding place of his hopeful buffet, the ending is classic romero and everyone who loves him will know what i mean. I only watch this maybe once a month now, I will pop it in when I am cleaning , or when I am home sick and need comforting. I realize that my warped mind has now equalized zombies to chicken soup but I give no apologies for it. SO buy this movie, relish it, eat it up, forgive it for being outdated a bit and cheesy at times, see it for what it is, THE single greatest zombie movie of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Before discussing the film, as though I need to waste time outlining the plot and meaning of such an epochal horror film as "Dawn of the Dead," I would like to make a few comments about the DVDs. Personally, I have watched this film several times over the years and by this point have little idea of which versions I have seen or enjoyed the most. I am a viewer who always likes to see the uncut, unedited version of any movie because I do not enjoy the idea of someone else deciding what I can or cannot see. How many versions of this film exist? At least four, I think, although I'm sure there are more.  O.K., censors will do what censors do and we can do little about it except shake our heads and look for an uncut foreign version. But let's acknowledge something important about the numerous versions of this film and the movie's central theme. Romero used this installment of his zombie franchise to critique the rampant consumerism in American society, right? Isn't it more than a bit ironic there are so many versions of this film? In other words, a movie excoriating uncontrolled materialism requires fans to continually go out and buy the latest updated version. I'd laugh if it weren't so ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyway, here we go. The mysterious plague, event, or whatever it is that caused the dead to rise in the first film has now become global in its implications. Mass chaos breaks out across the United States and presumably the world. Television stations broadcast emergency information that usually results in more harm than help, and the police and military services fight a losing battle in areas loaded with the shambling dead. A tense series of showdowns in an infested apartment complex show the seriousness of the problem. Not only do you have flesh-seeking zombies to worry about, citizens going nuts and shooting at the cops become a real problem as well. It's obvious civilization teeters on the brink of utter collapse, so media personality Fran (Gayleen Ross), her boyfriend and chopper pilot Stephen (David Emge), and two police officers involved in the failed raid on the apartment building, Roger (Scott Reinger) and Peter (Ken Foree), decide to fly the friendly skies to anywhere but the city. They run into a few problems along the way, such as a pitched battle with a bunch of zombies near a refueling depot out in the countryside, but the quartet eventually achieves some sense of safety when they hole up in a huge shopping mall out in the sticks.<br /><br />As the four set up shop in the mall, they have to go about a series of housecleaning chores. Romero treats us to lengthy scenes of Scott and Peter loping around the mall making sure the place is safe. We see the two cops running through stores, avoiding zombies all the way, to gather supplies. They discover a storage room tucked away in the rear of the mall and work to turn it into a base of operations. Scott and Peter even risk life and limb (pun intended) to drive huge big rigs up to the doors of the mall, thus effectively blocking the shambling dead from entering the building. Then the bloodletting begins as the group raids a gun shop and promptly exterminates every flesh eater in the mall. These scenes, while lengthy and seemingly mundane in the context of the larger picture, actually serve an important purpose. By showing our heroes setting up shop in the mall, Romero helps give the film a sense of civilization attempting to rebuild itself. And with the resumption of civilization, apparently, comes the greedy materialism inherent in modern life. Fran, Stephen, Scott, and Peter soon spend most of their time shopping and enjoying the exquisite goods available in the various shops. By the time a motley motorcycle gang appears on the scene to plunder the mall (led by Tom Savini!), a three way battle erupts between our heroes, the thugs, and the zombies now allowed to once again roam through the mall.<br /><br />Romero's second installment of his famed Dead Trilogy is such a wonder to behold due to several important factors. The materialism theme steals most of the attention because, frankly, it's great to see someone add such depth to a nihilistic horror film. I appreciated the gore that, although infrequent, really makes an impact when it pops up. You've got zombies munching on victuals in gluey close up, a grotesque tete a tete (heh!) with helicopter blades, lots of exploding heads, and a bunch of motorcycle pirates coming apart at the seams. Even more amazing is the black humor infusing this fantastic film. For instance, have you ever seen a pie fight involving reanimated, decaying corpses? You will here. "Dawn of the Dead" can't get any better, right? Wrong. That's Goblin you hear performing the score for the film. Yep, Romero got the group responsible for so many of Dario Argento's creepy film scores to do the soundtrack for "Dawn of the Dead." In fact, Dario helped out with this film. Simply amazing. Fans couldn't put together a dream lineup like this if they tried.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention extras except to say each of the different versions contains different stuff. I see there is now an "Ultimate Edition" set that contains so many extras as to boggle the mind. I'm wondering if I should just buy the ultimate collection and be done with it because I've avoided buying any version. Frankly, I don't appreciate the greed involved in the distribution of this film. Romero followed this film up with the awesomely gory "Day of the Dead," another must see classic in the horror canon. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD is George Romero's sequel to his horror classic NGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and it is just as good as the first film. This time, we follow three men and a pregnant woman who lock themselves up inside an abandoned shopping mall to get away from the living dead that have risen from there graves and taken over half the world population. We all know that you can kill one of the living dead by shooting it in the head or chopping the head off, and if a human is bitten by one of the living dead they will eventually turn into the living dead. The survivors in the shopping mall are able to take what they need (food, clothing, personal items, etc.) in order to make it for as long as they can without going outside of the mall. Soon, a gang of bikers and rebels find out that some people are hiding out in the mall and they decide to break in and take what they can't get. Now, the living dead find there way into the mall and a showdown takes place between the survivors, the bikers and rebels, and the living dead. This film has horror, drama, suspense, and some humor thrown in for good measure!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>The world population has been infected by a disease that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Four humans have decided to escape the plague by escaping in a helicopter. They end up landing at a zombie infested shopping  mall and its up to them to use the proper survival tatics to stay alive.  This is actually a horror movie with  a plot, not just some gore loaded  splatter movie. Even if your not a horror movie fan, this one might  actually appeal to you, because it has a dramatic mood to it. Its actually  horror mixed with adventure and drama. Written and Directed by George A.  Romero (Night of the Living Dead).</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>The dead are still rising! It's been ten years since "Night Of The Living Dead", when things seemed to be under control. Nope, the dead have continued their rampage, killing and eating us normal folks like so many zombie-treats! Our major cities are under marshall law. The military is fighting a losing battle against the flesh-eating hordes, while the media debates the issue. Meanwhile, two cops and two media personel pile into a helicopter to escape to... where?? They have no real idea. Flying over the countryside, they witness the great "hillbilly zombie hunt" below, as bands of good ol' boys drink beer, shoot zombies, drink more beer, shoot more zombies, etc. Later, our heroes land to gas up the helicopter, where they encounter a handful of shambling dead. The dead are of course, easily dispatched by blows / shots to the noggin, but they prove to be dangerous nonetheless! Even two kid-zombies are relentless in their pursuit of warm human flesh! Our four survivors get fueled up and take off again. Then, in the distance, like an oasis of safety, is a gigantic shopping mall! The helicopter lands on the roof, and our small group enters through a sky-light. Upon checking things out, they find the mall to be a veritable fortress, even though slow-moving zombies roam around both inside and out. The four soon create their own home-away-from-home, killing as many dead-heads as possible along the way. They get pretty comfy in their newfound kingdom of the living. Along comes a caravan of bikers to spice things up! They break into the mall, shooting and smacking zombies with sledgehammers, and basically causing mayhem. Our four heroes must lay low until the bikers get tired of playing around. Oh no! One of the four, named Steve, can't take it, and simply must defend "his" mall! He shoots at the marauding bikers, and things get ugly from there! See, no one's noticed that the zombies have been flooding in and now out-number the bikers by about ten to one. In their subtle, creeping way, they sneek right up and take over. ATTENTION SHOPPERS! IT'S BIKER-GANG GUTS DAY AT THE MALL! Can our four heroes endure to the end? I won't give away the climax. DOTD belongs on every horror shelf! A bloody, entrail-filled masterpiece...</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This movie is a man's worst nightmare.

I actually saw the remake first, which I liked. And, of course, I've seen the terrifying Night of the Living Dead many, many times and will probably see it again this Halloween. So going in, Dawn of the Dead was a little behind the eight ball, so to speak. But considering the large number of preconceived notions I had regarding the film, I did enjoy it and would recommend it. A con and a pro:<br /><br />CON: I truly believe that the greatest horror films are black and white. Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Diabolique, Psycho and, of course, Night of the Living Dead, to me, are masterpieces that just wouldn't be the same if shot in color. The shadows are darker, deeper and more sinister. Danger and menace seem to lurk around every corner. And night seems to fall over the proceedings like a shroud, waiting to swallow up everything. Perhaps it was part of director George Romero's satire of the consumer culture that prompted him to shoot the film in bright colors. However, I kept thinking of the spooky quality of the grainy black and white photography of the first film and Dawn of the Dead suffered a little bit in comparison. The color was especially jarring when blood was shown. Romero wanted a bright, unrealistic quality to the blood -- sort of like a comic book. However, the effect of this is to make the blood look like a spilled raspberry smoothie. The film is very scary, but might have been more so had Romero shot it in black and white.<br /><br />However, Romero wisely stuck to the philosophy of the original when it came to casting. Probably because of budgetary constraints, he cast unknowns from the Pittsburgh area in the film. The remake of Dawn of the Dead released in 2003 was good, but it was a big studio film with recognizable actors like Ving Rhames. When the actors are people the audience knows, there is a separation that takes place. I thought several times during the remake, for example, that there was no way Ving Rhames could be killed off early in the film as he was the most recognizable star (I was right). Part of what made Night of the Living Dead so terrifying was that we didn't know the actors. Anyone could be killed at any time. Nothing was sacred (Johnny gets killed off immediately, Tom and Judy burn to death and become zombie food, Karen dies and kills her mother, etc.). Romero continues this tradition in Dawn of the Dead. We have no history with these actors, so it becomes easier to think of them as their characters. Most of us have no safety net of knowing the actors from previous work, so we have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die. It adds a level to the horror that is missing in the remake.<br /><br />Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a worthy follow-up to Night of the Living Dead. Like most sequels, it doesn't quite match up, but unlike most sequels, the drop-off isn't that much. Romero has jazzed up the formula with satire and dark humor, but he still manages to scare the hell out of the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>I can't help but feel there is too much hype over this N.O.T.L.D. sequel. The F/X were not all that great and the zombies just looked, well...blue. I stayed up late to watch the directors cut on BBC 2 and towards the end I  was getting tired of it. I was going to buy DAWN OF THE DEAD in the shops  but I won't bother now I've seen it and I found it boring. (Sorry to all  the fans out there.) The follow up, DAY OF THE DEAD, was much better and  had dark humour and better F/X and characters.<p>Notice a cameo buy the  actor who plays Rhodes in Day of the dead, appear briefly at the beginning  of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>There may have been arguments over watching this movie and I lost miserably. I'd already seen the remake, didn't particularly care that much about seeing the original, but seemed like an appropriate movie to watch in the dark with plenty of alcohol. (And I still needed more) I wanted to watch The Mummy Returns, but I just watched it when I got home. I managed most of this movie, I did close my eyes a couple of times, cos it was really getting that boring. (A trick I perfected during Evil Dead 2, except I kept my eyes closed longer)<br /><br />What didn't I like about this movie? Two main things that spring to mind. The "zombies" for one. Almost every "zombie" movie portrays them as almost robotic. Some imagination could be used. Sure, they're the undead, but they're all pretty similar. It's not like Beetlejuice, where this person drowned, or this person got cut in half, or this person smoked too much. The "zombies" are just splattered with random bits of blood. I'd rather something like Beetlejuice, or where they seem normal until the very last minute. That would be more original.<br /><br />My second problem was the characters. I'm sorry but I did not feel any sympathy for them! Unless you're a very special birthday boy, or Mekhi Phifer, then you don't get any sympathy from me. Sorry characters.<br /><br />The special effects were quite good, considering this was made in the seventies. (Another thing, I rarely like seventies movies apart from Grease, and a couple of others. Give me Halloween and I'll throw it baack in your face) The blood looked slightly dodgy at times, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I've noticed reading a few of the other reviews, they're done by men. I'm female (I can give you someone who can vouch for that). Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much?<br /><br />Watch the remake or Shaun of the Dead. Much, much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Well, For some Gore counts as Horror, Especially Canablism Cheap Gore and Zombies to round off this so-called classic, nothing impressive, except body parts falling.Not what I would describe horror but much more Shock value and what generally is wrong with people.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>this is an enGROSSing , absorbing , gripping , unique , scary , intelligent , fun pre CGI horror picture . others will go on at great length about its' attributes . they're right . i really haven't anything additional to add but my vote . they make lots of great film now . this is how they did it circa 78' on a relatively modest budget (that's an enormous understatement) . GEORGE ROMERO is a genius .</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>There's something about "Dawn of the Dead" that makes it so captivating. Sure, there are plenty of great zombie movies out there, but this classic is one not to be missed. In case you're unfamiliar with it, it's kind of like a non-sequential continuation of "Night of the Living Dead". Set in Philadelphia, this tells of four SWAT-team members that hide out in a mall from the living dead, while taking advantage of the mall and getting kicks outta it, too.<br />That alone should let you know that this movie is awesome. Imagine what it would be like to shoot down the flesh-eating undead in a massive mall! This movie has everything from the zombie horror of blood-splattering and flesh-eating to thrilling action to slapstick comedy. The movie goes from scary to funny to sociopolitical all in its two-hour run.<br />"Dawn of the Dead" is, in case I didn't state it enough, an extraordinary movie. What other zombie flick offers shooting zombies down in an open field at the break of dawn, a blue-skinned Hare Krsna zombie and makeup artist legend Tom Savini in a leather-clad biker gang riding their motorcycles in the dead of night?<br />Yep, this movie goes from the slaying of the undead to genuinely ironically funny moments, such as slapping a whipped cream pie in a zombie's face, or the scene where two of the guys take the money from a register and smile for the security camera (that one's a good laugh!).<br />And just to prove that this zombie movie doesn't disappoint, there's plenty of the red stuff getting splattered from zombies and victims alike, alongside their consumption of flesh! And yeah, I'm sure you're aware of the social commentaries on the buyer's consumption at the mall. George A. Romero's good at the double-entendres in the plot like that, he's quite an intelligent film-maker.<br />"Dawn of the Dead" is definitely a special movie, and isn't necessarily one of those movies that you'd pop in every week or so. It's an experiece, and a stunning one at that, both visually and at times intellectually. So kudos to Mr. Romero, who knew what he was doing and never sold out, you made a great movie! All fans of zombie films MUST watch this classic! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Well, every person who's in for cinema knows that "Dawn of the Dead" is a milestone picture. So it's obvious that you'd like to buy this one. And I won't tell about film itself - just a couple of words about this edition. I'd call it "All You Ever Wanted To Know About 'Dawn...'". Because here you have everything you could possibly desire. Commentaries, documentaries, galleries, trailers etc. EVERYTHING on 4 discs. The edition has three versions of the film - U.S. theatrical, extended and European. Extended is rather longer and has some bonus scenes but U.S. theatrical is what was prefered by George Romero himself so it's the one what this film was supposed to be from the very beginning. The European one was edited by Dario Argento and is slightly shorter than the others but it's not because Argento just shortened it - he cut out some footage but he inserted some more - some gory stuff. So it's not like this version is cut, don't be confused, it has some footage not available in other versions so it's interesting to watch anyway. They say there is some German version which is the extended plus Argento's footage but it was not possible to edit all this in potable way so this version is a total mess and is not necessary to watch. Anyway you have all that's needed here.<br />I don't think there will ever be some edition to top this one so buy it without any doubts. It is definately worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD is the second entry in George Romero's &quot;DEAD&quot; trilogy, though it isn't as scary or as groundbreaking as his first, the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968).  Still, for a low-budget sequel, it is an interesting and entertaining film, an unusual mix of action, drama, comedy, and horror that actually functions on two levels: One, it is a stomach-churning study of the depths to which people will sink in order to ensure their survival; and two, it is a dark satire that takes several pokes at Western consumerism.<p>The plot of DAWN OF THE DEAD builds on the premise of its predecessor.  The world is now becoming overrun with the flesh-eating zombies, and in the United States, martial law has been declared and all survivors are required to go to state-run &quot;rescue stations&quot; for shelter and protection.  The manager of a TV station and her helicopter-pilot boyfriend decide to defy authorities and seek out their own save haven, and two police officers--friends of the helicopter pilot--decide to abandon their duties and go along with the couple.  The group eventually arrives at an abandoned shopping mall, and when they realize that the stores within contain all they need to survive--food, clothing, and weapons &amp; ammunition--they seal off the building, dispose of most of the zombies inside, and take up residence.  But when their claim on the mall and its goods is challenged by a band of motorcycle-riding marauders, the quartet is soon fighting for survival against not only the zombies, but also against their own kind.<p>Although the audience has been made to sympathize with the film's four protagonists, there is no true heroism in this world of Romero's making.  Instead, there are only different levels of self-interest and narcissism.  After the four move into their new home and start living off the &quot;fat of the mall,&quot; they quickly develop a sort of bourgeois attitude towards the comforts they now enjoy.  Of course, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods.  And when the group's right to possession is violently challenged by outsiders, Romero clearly demonstrates just how tenuous a security based on personal possessions really is.<p>Romero is a master storyteller who knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience.  In this film, he creates a relentless sense of unease by juxtaposing the repulsive and grotesque with the lighthearted and humorous.  For example, when the quartet of protagonists first occupies the mall, they turn on the mall-wide Muzak system to mask from the zombies the noises they make while looting the stores.  So for several scenes there is this macabre contrast between bloody, pasty-faced zombies and syrupy instrumental music.  Uncomfortably comical and humorously disturbing.<p>Creepy, bloody (FX by Tom Savini), boisterous, and constantly full of surprises, DAWN OF THE DEAD is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever made.  True, it does have an underlying anti-materialism message that is none too subtle, but that doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment of being playfully spooked and repulsed by all the zombie grotesquerie.  All in all, horror fans will have a good time watching this minor Romero masterpiece.<p>The Divimax Edition DVD from Anchor Bay offers an excellent digital transfer of the U.S. theatrical cut (often considered superior even to the director's cut), and there are lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which is a feature commentary with writer/director Romero and FX man Savini.  A worthy addition to the film collections of serious horror fans, and well worth amazon.com's very reasonable asking price.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" has had a few previous released on DVD, all of which are now extremely rare, so it comes as a blessing that Anchor Bay has released a new version, just in time to coincide with the remake hitting theatres (with Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, no less). While the movie itself and the extras are fantastic, this may not be the best edition to buy, read on to find out why.... <p>The movie itself needs no introduction to any horror fan, as this is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies ever made, and by far the best zombie picture. I will skip right to the qualities of the DVD itself, to save boredom for anyone who already knows the plot (which I imagine is everybody reading this). The most notable feature on the Divimax DVD is the commentary from George Romero and Tom Savini, with Perry Martin doing the moderating. Similar to the commentary on "Day of the Dead", both Savini and Romero are lively and enthusiastic about this movie, which is surprising considering that the movie is more than 25 years old. The anecdotes and back stories will definitely give fans some insight, as well as plenty of trivia knowledge. This is probably the best Romero commentary so far. The only other extras are an extensive photo gallery (with some great shots), and some promotional material that most people have seen already. If the extras seem sparse, there is a reason for that: rumor has it that Anchor Bay is planning a larger, more extensive Special Edition later in 2004. Like the "Lord of the Rings" DVDs, the first release might be just a taster. <p>Before moving onto the less positive aspects, it should be noted that this is perhaps the video transfer released so far. While previous editions were fragmented, grainy, and muddy looking, this one is clear, having scrubbed 25 years worth of wear and tear on the master. This beats all previous editions, hands down.<p>My gripes with the new "Dawn of the Dead" DVD are nothing to do with what was included, but what was not included. This version runs 127 minutes, while as any fan knows, the original prints ran 142 minutes. The previous "Director's Cut" released on DVD was 137 minutes long (the only time I have seen the full 142 released was on an import laserdisc), so why couldn't they have included the longer cut here? For fans waiting for a new release, this is a bit of a letdown. Also noticeable is the lack of any documentaries or other supplements beyond the commentary. This is understandable if this release is only a taster, however, so I will be waiting in hopes that the new edition solves this problem.<p>Overall, horror fans could not ask for a better movie to have on DVD, even if completists like me are unhappy with the shorter cut. The remastering alone makes this worth the price tag alone, while the commentary is a welcome addition to the movie.</p></br></body></html>

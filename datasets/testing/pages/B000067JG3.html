I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to "Come with us." Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.<br /><br />Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's na?ve yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions.<br /><br />I found the DVD extras of this edition to be quite enjoying, memorable and rewarding. The sentimental discussion between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer gave a lot of insight to what was happening on the set and in particular gave Plummer's candid feelings about being upstaged by children and insight how he viewed the handling of his professional career at that point in time. Plummer was really an actor caught in the death throws of what the Hollywood system had previously established for stardom and he seems to have been affected by that obsolete criteria that really was no longer in effect. The DVD also brought together the entire Von Trappe children's cast and it was good to hear their vignettes and recollections of their experiences. In all this is a valuable and rewarding DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>This is a definite all time classic.I think what realy makes this movie the classic that it is,is the very good script and fine acting by all the characters.I'm going to hate to say it but the music in this movie,isnt all my cup of tea.While its kind of ok,some of it never realy hit the spot with me.I enjoy watching the actual movie,and they just happen to be in a bad place when war is breaking out.It must have been awful for so many peoples dreams to be destroyed by war.They are in the thick of it as they try to escape the wrath of the German army.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The Sound of Music, as far as I am concerned, is a most perfectly-written, acted, scored and crafted film of all time. It is a gem, a jewel, a diadem in the crown of musical cinema.<br /><br />This wonderful movie, beloved and familiar to so many, comes with a series of extra features that deepen one's appreciation for this excellent film. The making of TSOM is told through interviews with the film's stars, its director Robert Wise, and others intimate with the film's development. It was fun watching these Hollywood pros dance around the evident awfulness of the stage version of the movie; fascinating to see how Christopher Plummer brought humanity to the otherwise uni-dimensional role of Captain von Trapp; horrifying to imagine the misplacement of songs in the stage play ("Raindrops on Roses" sung by Mother Superior?) and heavenly to realize their perfect placement in the film. The very 1960s filmlet, starring Charmian Carr (Liesl) as a young ing&eacute;nue in Strausburg, was eye-rollingly innocent and a neat behind-the-scenes view of the filming.<br /><br />TSOM is cloyingly sweet and schmaltzy to some, and a deliriously joyful extravaganza to others. To those who love it for its spirit, for its exuberant and uplifting music or for its cinematic excellence, this DVD will provide many happy viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>There's definitely not much that hasn't already been said about Robert Wise's haunting classic musical epic, &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; With its unforgettable musical numbers, Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins) shining perfectly in the zenith of her virginal appeal, Christopher Plummer playing an engaging love interest, a fantastically optimistic and engaging Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) screenplay that produced sympathetic character stereotypes (note the Von Trapp children roles), an inspirational rendition of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein songs, and knowledgeable direction by seasoned film maker Robert Wise (The Haunting, Sand Pebbles). The Sound of Music survives as one of the most beloved Hollywood musicals of the 20th century, but due to its many dated 60's characteristics, does the Sound of Music continue to deserve the immense attention and fanfare that it has received since its 1965 release?<p>Looking previously at the film's long lasting legacy as the cinematic pinnacle of human decency and morality, the Sound of Music entertains countless new generations despite of it's lack of developed performances, adherence to predictable relationships, reliance on routine plot developments, spontaneous transitions into inane songs, and an overabundant sentimentality that oozes sometimes over excessively onto the screen.  However in spite of its obvious shortcomings, the Sound of Music is an overwhelmingly dazzling display of the musical at its most entertaining and inspirational. This film is a testament to the Hollywood's gift of providing magically poignant entertainment to masses.  <p>I for one detest the musical's trust in positive conclusions, silly choruses, and predictable romantic stories. Yet the Sound of Music remains an awesome remainder that greatness can still come out of the most unlikely of places.<p>Sidenote: 20th Century Fox's Five Star Collector's edition of the Sound of Music is a bravura achievement in providing a magnificent anamorphic widescreen presentation, a fascinating Robert Wise commentary track coupled with the musical tracks of the classic songs without verbal dialogue, a commemorative documentary, the theatrical trailers, and much much more. A Must-Buy for any lover of musicals of sixties cinema.<p>Interesting Facts: The Sound of Music won several Academy Awards in 1965 including: Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Wise), and Best Musical Score.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I resisted watching "The Sound of Music" for many years.  The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me.  Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie.  I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should.<br /><br />This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles.  Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria.  Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality.  The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows.  The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess.<br /><br />We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian.  We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world.  However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting.<br /><br />In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany.  Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss.  World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp.  The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical.<br /><br />Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat.  Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards.  Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs.  The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy.  Among these songs are "Edelweiss," "The Lonely Goatherd," "My Favorite Things," "Do-Re-Mi" and the title song.<br /><br />Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents.  Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste.  The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting.  Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities.  Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain.<br /><br />I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture.  I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50" television with stereo speakers.  I do not have surround sound connected.  The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer).  I have a bigger issue with picture quality.  The color keeps shifting between scenes.  In some scenes the color is excellent.  In other scenes, the color seems off.  At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself.  The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying.  I hope future releases have this problem fixed.<br /><br />This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should.  This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better.  I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before.  You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a delight from beginning to end, and the DVD adds exceptional features and content that really round out the filmgoing experience.<p>What review of this film would be complete without the requisite gushing praise for the opening sequence? It's justifiably famous, and gives an epic feel to a film that, at its heart, is a simple family story. <p>Director Robert Wise lives up to his surname...he wisely takes a very effective minimalist approach with the story. Where a lesser director would have 'pumped up' the song sequences with flashier camera moves, Wise lets the songs speak for themselves and instead concentrates on getting the texture and feel of the scenes just right. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is simply but beautifully shot.<p>Julie Andrews is a delight as the plucky Maria, who starts as an erstwhile nun, becomes a governess, and earns the affections of the children of the steely Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer, all poise and polish), not to mention the captain himself. The children are all properly cute and talented, and the supporting performances by Richard Haydn (the charming sponge Max Detweiler) and Eleanor Parker (Captain Von Trapp's would-be society fiancee) hit all the right notes.<p>If the film has a weakness, it's length; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; weighs in at almost three hours, which is quite a stretch by today's standards. But in the original theatrical version, there was an intermission, which was common practice for long films in those days.<p>There are also times that Wise plays it a bit too minimalistically, and the big finish should have more emotional punch than it does, but overall this film is an unqualified smash.<p>It's worth noting that at the time of its release, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was wildly popular; in fact, adjusted for inflation, it's the third highest grossing film in history, behind only &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;.<p>Not bad company for this classic film. And the second DVD disc included with this set - packed with production notes, interviews and extra information - just makes this a better deal.<p>Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>There's alot more detailed reviews of this classic film on blu ray on amazon. Still I had to express how great this blu ray version is. So many movies like the 'horsesoldiers' or 'kelly's heroes'are just thrown out on blu ray; unrestored with dirt on the prints even! it's so bad that you would only pray that each new blu release is going to be done better. NO worries here , this is remastered and looks fantastic! the sound is fantastic, the movie is one of the beloved musicals ever! Julie andrews is perfection in this movie and the songs are beyond classic mostly. Even christopher plummer is awesome and he is not known for musicals! He's still at it in movies too, making great roles as usual.  But this blu ray has set a high standard for what older movies SHOULD look like on blu ray. Buy this one and watch it with someone you love, it's restored and hassongs that will appeal to any age group.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>After appearing as the lead in "Mary Poppins" Julie Andrews solidified herself in pop culture and the American consciousness as the nanny and Nun Maria in "The Sound of Music". Ask any film buff what one of their favorite films are and this one always comes near the top. Winning multiple Oscars including Best Picture of 1965 "The Sound of Music" is one of the best movie musicals of all-time. Featuring Canadian-born Christopher Plummer in the role of a naval commander who is the widowed father of seven children, the film is equally known for its beautiful soundtrack and memorable songs. Based on the stage play of the same name, "The Sound of Music" is one of those rare films that has grossed over a billion dollars since it debut at the boxoffice. This particular DVD set comes with a slew of bonuses including behind the scenes featurettes and a splendid audio commentary by Julie Andrews herself. Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer recall the shooting of the film together and perhaps the greatest part about the bonuses is the beautiful reunion of all seven kids now adults discussing their memories on "The Sound of Music". It is wonderful that all seven actors still remain friends to this day. Lastly, there is an old screen test of a very young Mia Farrow who tried out for the part of the oldest child. Simply, you will enjoy the many multiple viewings you will have when buying this film. A film for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>In the 1960's Julie Andrews played a part in two of the most definitive musicals of the 20th Century. Disney's Mary Poppins and Rodgers & Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, both gave someone a clean cut fun and heart warming experience that had many people humming the songs for decades. Out of the two I would say The Sound of Music is the better and has left me with a huge level of admiration for Dame Julie Andrews. She has an amazing singing voice, and a class and grace unmatched by any fellow actress.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young clumsy nun named Maria who is considered a nuisance by most of her fellow sisters in the convent. One day she is sent out to the Von Trapp family as the house led by Captain Von Trapp is after a new governess to take care of his 7 children. The Von Trapp household is led like one of his old navy ships, where he commands his children with the blow of a whistle forcing them to march and work, but there is no play. Maria becomes determined to teach the captain and the children what it's like to have fun, and one time whilst he's away to Vienna she takes her chance to let the children have fun and teach them to sing. This leads to a heart warming story which allows the children to sing and represent their home country of Austria.<br /><br />In my personal view this film hasn't aged a bit, I haven't seen it for a few years and actually think the last time I watched this was when I was 10 years old (I'm 22 now). Watching it again today, unlike most films from my childhood, my opinion of this has not changed one bit, I still love it as much as I remember doing so all them years ago. The intro actually gave me chills as I began reminiscing of this film and how good it actually was.<br /><br />The music of course is the main focus of the film, it has some of possibly the most catchy and memorable songs that could have you embarrassingly singing along at the top of your voice. Health Warning: You could end up with a sore throat after trying to sing-a-long. The kids are amazing with their music pieces as the general harmony of them is shocking, even considering their age with the youngest being 5. Of course Dame Julie was on top form and served as the delightful support for the child choir.<br /><br />The setting of the film in 1930's Austria actually gives this film a beautiful look, which gives you the understanding just as to why the character of Maria is such a happy person. If I were certainly living in such a beautiful country I have no doubt I would be the same. The film was primarily shot on location with very little need for purpose built sets or cardboard backgrounds. Because of the beautiful environments if done right it will look even more spectacular on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I don't think this classic is really for a new audience as most young viewers wouldn't really appreciate the light hearted attitude and general good feel of it all. It wouldn't fit in with todays standard of films, it doesn't have violence, it doesn't have crude language and it doesn't have a smidgen of nudity. It's a wholesome film for the entire family, it doesn't need parental guidance or anyone to explain the film. I would say that although it's unlikely to captivate any new or young audiences, it's a film that will certainly convey a good and hearty message of love and positivity.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>THE SOUND OF MUSIC is incredibly entertaining and incredibly effective despite the fact that it is incredibly hokey. THE SOUND OF MUSIC may actually be the source of all known hokeyness in the universe. Still, despite it all, this film leaves nuclear waste long-haul truckers and oil-rig wildcatters singing, "How do you solve a problem like Maria?" with a smile on their grizzled faces.<br /><br />There's a lovely innocence to this film that touches everyone who sees it. Julie Andrews as Maria essentially reprises her MARY POPPINS role as the magical governess who brings happiness to a houseful of lonely children being raised by an overly stern but loving father.<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is more or less the true story of the singing von Trapp family who fled anschluss Austria to escape the overwhelming shadow of Nazism. Christopher Plummer plays Naval Captain Georg von Trapp, a rather benevolent despot of a parent who is mismanaging his children with brisk military efficiency when Maria appears. The new Nanny is a reluctant Novice at the local convent, sent out into the world by the Reverend Mother to measure her devotion to the cloister. She soon falls in love with the children and they with her. As Maria and the children bond, the Captain and Maria are drawn to one another. They eventually marry, and as the Germans occupy their country, they flee over the mountains to Switzerland.<br /><br />Most of the musical numbers in THE SOUND OF MUSIC have become true standards, including, "The Sound of Music," "Sixteen on Seventeen," "Do-Re-Mi" (AKA "Doe a Deer"), "A Few of My Favorite Things," and "Edelweiss" (which is NOT the national anthem of Austria). Rodgers and Hammerstein contributed their best and last to the libretto. Musically, the 1965 movie varies somewhat from the 1959 stage play, but this only means there are more classics to be had in enjoying them both.<br /><br />Certain scenes have become classics in and of themselves: The opening scene of Julie Andrews flinging her arms and pirouetting joyfully on the slopes of the Unterberg is instantly recognizable. The chorus of smiling nuns is equally recognizable. The gazebo scene and gentle dance between the eldest daughter, Liesl and her boyfriend Rolf, still leaves the viewer with wet eyes. Plummer and Andrews' wistful last scene on stage in Salzbug is moving.<br /><br />Affection for this staid but singular film has led to it being often parodied (i.e., "The Sound of Murder") and picked on (viz., "The Sound of Mucous"), and it is awfully easy to goof on the dialogue and songs, but nevertheless, we keep coming back to it.<br /><br />When released, THE SOUND OF MUSIC became the top-grossing film of all time, and, inflation adjusted, it still stands in the top ten. The continuing popularity of this film is amazing, especially considering that four decades later the movie musical is all but dead. There are no dramatic special effects, no car chases, no explosions, no T & A, and not a foul word in this film. No doubt, this combination of elements accounts for its success. The political yahoos who grow fat on trumpeting "Family Values" could do more good by encouraging people to watch this film than by all the other anti-whatever they hypocritically babble about. Of course, that assumes they really believe what they're saying in the first place.<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is true G-Rated quality family entertainment, an artifact of a gentler age.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>The best example of Hollywood getting it right. Broadway could never begin to recreate the Austrian Alps like this! The magic of great cinematography. Director Robert Wise wowed film goers with great opening shots of New York skyscrapers in "West Side Story," but went one step further in "The Sound of Music" with its lush mountain beauty. Julie Andrews spinning on top of a mountain peak singing the title song makes for great moments in filmdom.<br /><br />One of the most family friendly movies of all-time, each viewing takes us back to a time of innocence in our lives. Who doesn't fight back the tears of seeing a harsh Christopher Plummer, playing the widowed father of the Von Trapp clan, allowing his affections to once again break through towards his 7 children, as he joins them in song. Or one of my favorite moments, the "So Long, Farewell" sung by the children at the  gathering of adult guests. I find myself wanting to wave goodnight to them as well. Sweet and tender, this film melts the heart of even the most "manly of men." So pop it into the DVD player, and gather the family around for some old fashioned bonding.<br /><br />1965 Academy Award winner for Best Picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>Could you believe anyone may have seen "The Sound of Music" for the first time forty years after it came out? Well, that was me, today. I had seen bits and pieces, of course, and had obviously heard the classic songs (who hadn't, right?). But I just finished watching the movie in its entirety (it lasts close to three hours) for the first time ever, and it truly is as magnificent as everyone said it was.<br /><br />The story is simple, yet powerful: a story of search, love and struggle, starring Julie Andrews playing Maria, a woman who leaves an Austrian convent to assist Captain Georg von Trapp (Michael Plummer), a widower Navy officer with the upbringing of his seven children. The acting of the adults and the children actors is impeccable and the music is so ingrained into the story that one is impossible to conceive without the other, yet it hardly feels like a musical.<br /><br />"The Sound of Music" has got to be without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in my life and a story I will hold dear to my heart.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>After years and years and years of watching The Sound of Music on VHS and DVD, I thought I knew every blade of grass and every gust of wind visible in the movie.  How wrong I was! You don't realize how much picture is lost with standard 480p releases until a monumental blu ray transfer like this comes along and provides a home viewing experience that literally feels like seeing the movie for the first time.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is the best blu ray I own - and not just because The Sound of Music is probably the greatest movie ever made, but because the picture quality is truly that beautiful. And that makes sense, considering the movie was filmed in 70mm and could contain so much more data than ordinary 35mm.  Also, from what I understand, the restoration process was taken extremely seriously and done with the highest technology possible. There's a reason why so many artists are pushing blu ray, and it's because for the first time people can experience their creativity and attention to detail, as it was meant to be seen.  There is SO much detail in this movie.  Seriously, if you loved this movie before you will have your mouth dropped open the entire time you sit through it in high definition.<br /><br />And the Audio quality! I didn't even know it was possible to make ancient audio files sound brand new, but it clearly is.  Every song sounds 1000000x better than my old CD soundtracks.  Add in surround sound... heavenly.<br /><br />OVERALL: I don't care how many VHS or DVD copies you have of this movie sitting around, you NEED this blu ray.  It's not just a restoration, it's a transformation.  You cannot have truly experienced The Sound of Music at home until seeing it in 1080p.  Not to mention it's cram packed with amazing extras that are actually watchable.  In case you can't tell, this BD just makes me so happy.  If you appreciate the movie (or bless you, never seen it before) you MUST experience it on BD!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"The Sound of Music", the 1965 20th Century Fox musical which would capture the world with its memorable music and it's touching storyline and continues to have thrived through various generations and will continue to thrive for many generations hereafter.<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of a popular Broadway play which is based on the memoir "The Story of the Trapp Family Singers" written by Maria von Trapp.  The von Trapp family are known for escaping from the Nazis in Austria after the Anschluss (the annexation and occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938).<br /><br />The original musical based on the book featured music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (both Rodgers and Hammerstein were known for their music for "Oklahoma!", "Carousel", "State Fair", "South Pacific", "The King and I" to name a few) which led to the book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse.  The Broadway production began in 1959 starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel and would later inspire a film adaptation in 1965 which was loosely based on the Broadway production and memoir.<br /><br />The film would become an ultimate success as director Robert Wise (known for "West Side Story" and "The Haunting") would win five Academy Awards for Best Director, William Reynolds for Best Film Editing, Irwin Kostal for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment, Best Picture and Best Sound.<br /><br />The film would be best known for its wonderful location of Salzburg, Austria (which has inspired an actual "Sound of Music" tour which has been functional for the last 30-years) but most of all, known for its music which include "The Sound of Music", "Edelweiss", "My Favorite Things", "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" and "Do-Re-Mi".<br /><br />The film which was budgeted at $8.2 million would go on to gross $163 million worldwide.  The film would break the record held by "Gone with the Wind" for box office revenue and would also be a film that would be in circulation in theaters for three straight years.<br /><br />"The Sound of Music" would also continue to become a hit on video as it was released as a five star DVD release in 2000 to celebrate the film's 35th Anniversary, released in 2005 to celebrate the film's 40th Anniversary and now in 2010 on Blu-ray, a limited edition box set and a digital iTunes release to celebrate the film's 45th Anniversary.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:20:1), AVC@22 MBPS.  This is where "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" literally looks amazing.  For those who have owned previous versions of the film on DVD, back in 2005, the film went through restoration using a backup negative of the original 70 mm print.  At the time, the original 70mm 6-Track print was so damaged, there was no way to even use the original negative at that time and most of us who watched the 40th Anniversary Edition felt that the film looked absolutely beautiful compared to it's earlier 2000 DVD release.<br /><br />With that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary.  The damaged original 70 mm print that couldn't be used in the restoration of the film in 2005 can now be used for the film with new hardware and software and is now receiving 8K digital scanning by 20th Century Fox for perfect restoration.<br /><br />No longer is the film hazy, no longer is the film more on the pinkish side.  "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" is vibrant.  The grass...you can see the various grains of grass, the strands in green, yellow and detail of the mountains over looking Salzburg.  I was amazed!  Another example, Maria splashing the water before she heads to the von Trapps, you can see the water droplets flying in the air, another one is the von Trapp's uncle and his coat, you can see the wool in his jacket.  There is so much detail in this latest version of "The Sound of Music", it's incredible!  I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!<br /><br />And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu-ray, the cinematography... may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of "The Sound of Music" than ever before.  Absolutely breathtaking!<br /><br />Once again, the crew who restored this film...I give your crew a standing ovation...what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu-ray is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  Because the film was shot with a 6-track and because they were provided with the audio without the dialogue, for this 2010 edition, they were able to remove all noise but also making sure to utilize a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and as mentioned, I've owned several versions of this film and I even own the soundtrack to this film.<br /><br />The way this music was handled through the surround channels was amazing.  The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done.  The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing "Maria" to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing.  Also, they were able to isolate the sound of Salzburg up the hills, the sound of wind, the birds... I was in awe with the lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />I absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it.  If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home.  Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.<br /><br />Similar to the video restoration, the audio restoration for this 45th anniversary is fantastic!  And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" comes with the following special features from the 35th and 40th Anniversary DVD versions of the film but also newer special features that just literally packs this 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Your Favorite Things: An Interactive Celebration - A new way to watch "The Sound of Music".

Audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish. Also, included is a slip-over cover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I literally grew up in a household where "The Sound of Music" played and to tell you the truth, when I was younger, I really couldn't stand the musical as my mother would sing the songs over and over again.  But as I got older and I began watching more classic films, I found myself watching "The Sound of Music" around 1990 or so and I ended up purchasing the soundtrack for the film on cassette.  When I visited my mother, I ended up playing the cassette and in a very long time, I heard her sing the songs once again.<br /><br />When I got married, I was amazed that my wife knew the lyrics also by heart and by the birth of our son, to help calm him, she would sing "My Favorite Things".  Needless to say, the music of "The Sound of Music" has been part of me during my childhood and I have no doubt that with my wife and son, it will continue on to the next generation.<br /><br />As for the film, I have watched and owned various incarnations of this film on video and I have purchased the five star edition of the movie on DVD in 2000 and I clearly felt that the 40th Anniversary 2005 release was just unprecedented.  I felt that it was the ultimate release and I figured, if it was on Blu-ray, it would be an HD version of the film and the same special features.  But I was wrong.  Twentieth Century Fox has given fans of the film the ultimate release with "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition".<br /><br />Not only do we get another restoration of the film using the original 70 mm negative and now presented in 1080p High Definition, we get a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack which sounds incredible!  Just the fact that the film looks and sounds better is significant.  The colors just pop!  It's hard to describe of how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray compared to previous video releases.  In the past, there was always this dreamy, hazy look to the film.  Though it was colorful, I have always thought that was how the film was shot.  And the opening scene with Julie Andrews on top of the hill spinning around, I always thought that was a beautiful shot... that was until I saw this 45th Anniversary Edition and everything that I have thought about the look of the film has went out the window because this presentation is just amazing!  I felt the old colors always had a greenish/pinkish tinge but now, the colors look accurate.  Blue skies look vibrantly blue and no pinkish haze on the background.  Grass and hills are still green but now we can see the strands of grass quite clearly, more than ever before.<br /><br />The blues of Julie Andrews and Charmian Carr's eyes just captures your attention, the detail of Captain von Trapp's home or the clothing is detail that is much more cleaner and more evident than ever before.  Only one time in the film is where things do look a bit faux is when the Captain, the Baroness and Uncle Max are driving and of course, you see the usual fake background and that scene, you're not going to get much realism but for the most part, the film looks amazing.<br /><br />And as mentioned, the sound...I've listened to this soundtrack so many times but to hear it in 7.1 and hear of how the instruments were carefully selected for various channels, for those who have a 7.1 setup, you can't help but be happy of how nice this soundtrack comes in DTS-HD!  Again, awesome!<br /><br />And just when you think that was it, there are literally hours and hours of special features included in this release of "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition".  It took me two days or so just to go through everything and watch everything and once again, I thought the 40th Anniversary Edition was significant, but this 45th Anniversary edition just blows it out of the water.  Various documentaries, commentary, various featuretttes, audio interviews and more!  And I can't even imagine what 20th Century Fox will do for the 50th Anniversary Edition but I do have one request and that would be to record the live sing-along for the film and give people a chance to select it as an optional soundtrack to watch the film and sing-along with those thousands of people (like the 18,000 or so that showed up to the Hollywood Bowl).  That would be awesome!<br /><br />And I need to go back to the restoration and to say that if Twentieth Century Fox now has the technology in 2010 to take damaged negatives and are able to repair it to the point where they can re-use the film for a master in a Blu-ray release, that literally makes me extremely giddy and happy because that means a lot of those wonderful classic films in their catalog can receive a wonderful Blu-ray release using this technology.  I'm very impressed with this release and I look forward to the potential of what this can mean for classic films on Blu-ray from Twentieth Century Fox.<br /><br />With that being said, for the very hardcore fans of "The Sound of Music", for this 45th Anniversary release, you also have the opportunity to get the Limited Collector's set packaged in a keepsake box and features a 100-page "My Favorite Things" scrapbook, a 45th Anniversary Soundtrack, a reproduction of the original 1965 souvenir program, an exclusive handpainted "My Favorite Things" music box and more.  And for those people who prefer all things digital, on November 2nd will also include a digital release on iTunes of "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" which includes a sing-along version of the movie and 180-minutes of behind-the-scenes material.<br /><br />Once again, I was shocked when I watched this release because I had no idea how much went into the restoration of the film for this 45th Anniversary edition because they just did one for the 40th Anniversary.  But the fact that they have the technology and that they were given a chance to do give this film a new restoration using the latest technology was impressive.  The addition of all this bonus material for the Blu-ray release is magnificent and the fact that this entire Blu-ray release of "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" just raises the bar of what a studio can accomplish for a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic release of "The Sound of Music" and if you are a big fan, whether you get this version or the Limited Edition version, all I can say is that this is the definitive version to own that just stands out from its previous video releases in quality and quantity.  Great music, great story, musical performances, cinematography and just a wonderful family film.  Sure, it may be a bit too saccharine sweet for today's audience (or too long) but for those who have never watched this film ever, please give it a try.<br /><br />This is a perfect release in every category and easily deserving of five stars!  "The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition" is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>This Rodgers and Hammerstein show has been lambasted for years for being a sugary, wafer-thin confection, as opposed to some of their other, darker works -- Carousel chief among them.  However, taken on its own terms, how  can anyone resist the spectacular, melody-soaked movie, which is MUCH  better than the stage play?  Julie Andrews is so engaging you wish she was  your friend, if not your nanny.  The children are wooden at times, but the  score soars above nearly everyone's heads, and set in the stunning Swiss  Alps, and in Salzburg, Austria, which has to be one of the most picturesque  towns in the world, each musical number transports the viewer to a place of  joy -- maybe even nirvana.  The opening sequence, often satirized, remains  one of the most technically sophisticated and creative series of shots ever  put on film.  Each time I see this movie, the first shots of snow, with  whistling wind, stir an age-old excitement deep in my soul, and then --  woosh! -- you are on the expertly crafted emotional ride that is The Sound  of Music.  Christopher Plummer deserves special mention -- he is the one  performer in this movie who delivers a subtle, heartbreakingly real  performance, and he is without a doubt the most dashing Capt. Von Trapp  ever.  Angela Cartwright would later star in Lost In Space, though the rest  of the kids have been kind of missing in action. I think I have seen this  movie 30 times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Maria Rainer (Julie Andrews), a candidate to become a nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Austria, is a bit of a problem for the nuns. So to help her determine if she's truly ready to become a nun she's sent to be the governess for the stern Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children, who've driven away all of their former governess's. Soon they warm up to Maria, though, as does the Captain, and together they change the way the von Trapp household is run.<br /><br />Based on the true story of the von Trapp Family Singers, The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein as Oscar Hammerstein II died of cancer in 1960. Originally conceived as a Broadway musical that opened up in 1959, the rights changed hands several times before the film was eventually made. Since then The Sound of Music has become the third highest grossing movie of all time when it's grosses are adjusted for inflation (just behind Gone With the Wind and Star Wars respectively) and saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after the flop of 1963's Cleopatra.<br /><br />Surprisingly, considering I'm not typically a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions, I actually have to say that I did enjoy The Sound of Music. Of course, this has less to do with the music than the fact that the characterizations are full and complete, allowing you to lose yourself in the characters and feel for their plights and passions. The plotting is also quite taut for a film that's almost three hours long, keeping you on the edge of your toes with the character's personal crises as well as with the outward crises that lands in Austria with the Nazis in the latter parts of the film.<br /><br />The acting is very well done, as that's what really gets you invested in the characters. At the time The Sound of Music went into production Julie Andrews was largely unknown as Mary Poppins hadn't been released, but she nails the part of the innocent and free spirited Maria. Christopher Plummer, who famously didn't enjoy working on the film (later referring to it as The Sound of Mucus) doesn't let on on screen his displeasure with the film, and still you feel the characters distaste for the Nazi regime and his love for Maria as well as his transformation from stern father figure to hands on patriarch.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Sound of Music is that its a little too sweet, dripping with saccharine. This also means that some of the musical sequences can come off a bit to extremely cheesy, but even through that the film still feels genuine. And while I understand the need to make changes to a real life story in a film, every once in a while a filmmakers choices of change can be a little insulting to the subject of the film. The real Captain von Trapp, as stated by his children and his wife Maria, was not a stern man, and did not run his family like a military platoon as depicted in the film. Despite the pleadings of Maria and his children, the filmmakers decided to keep the characterization in the movie, which seems to me a little insulting to his memory.<br /><br />Overall, though, I do have to say that I enjoyed this movie. It gives an interesting depiction, especially towards the end of what Austrian citizens had to go through after the Nazi invasion. If you like musicals, or want to be transported to a more innocent time I highly recommend this movie. Just be careful after watching the movie or you could find yourself humming Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs for the next several weeks!<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>"The Sound of Music" is rightly a perpetual favorite among movie fans.  It took home five Academy Awards after its 1965 release, and continues to thrill audiences today with its superb musical performances, its touching story, and its fabulous location shooting in Austria.  This 40th anniversary two-disk edition offers a sharp, beautiful digitally remastered presentation, and loads of extras.<br /><br />The story is familiar to fans.  Once upon a time (in 1938), in the City of Salzberg deep in the Austrian Alps, a spirited young postulate named Maria is sent from her covent to be governess to the seven unruly children of a widowed and very strict Captain Von Trapp. Through pluck, compassion, and her ability to share her music, she captures the hearts of the children and enables them to re-capture the heart of their father.<br /><br />The movie has two climaxes.  The first comes when Maria and Captain Von Trapp must confront their unexpected feelings for each other.  The second comes when the Nazi take-over of Austria puts the Von Trapp family at risk.  In a thrilling conclusion, the family must dodge a Nazi dragnet and flee for their lives.<br /><br />The extras for this edition are quite remarkable, including the usual "making of" features that detail the lengthy backstory of the movie and the musical stage production that preceded it.  Co-stars Jule Andrews (Maria) and Christopher Plummer (Captain Von Trapp) provide delightful commentary.  Perhaps most interesting to this reviewer was the reunion of the actors who played the seven Von Trapp children.  They have some interesting stories about the long production of the movie in California and Austria.  Rehearsals and filming ran for months, during which the two boys grew several inches, two of the younger girls shed teeth, and all contributed to pranks and gaffs on and off set.<br /><br />"The Sound of Music" is very highly recommended as superb family entertainment that has stood the test of time and is even better in this refurbished edition.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>This beloved 1965 classic--one of the world's favorite things-- has all the elements of an Academy Award winner: Exquisite scenery, a compelling story, children, religion, romance, characters serving as comic relief,a memorable musical score, and one family's ultimate triumph over evil.<br />  Based on the true story of former Naval Captain Georg Von Trapp and his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, the film greets us with a serene and panoramic view of the Austrian landscape on a lovely spring day.<br />  High on a green hilltop, momentarily escaping from her convent, is the bobbed haired, pinner-clad novice, Maria( the formidable Julie Andrews) initiating the Rodgers and Hammerstein score by singing the title song, which could not express the communion of music and escaping to nature to find  joy and solace more perfectly.<br /> As urgent as the call of the natural world feels to Maria, the urgent call of the  chapel bell soon  compels her return to the spiritual world of Nonnberg Abbey, where the are nuns gathering for Mass to which Maria will be quite characteristically late.<br />  Peggy Wood's Mother Abbess is a patient woman regarding Maria's shenanigans, but this is not the case with her assistant, Sister Berthe( Portia Nelson). Along with Sisters Margaretta, Sophia, and Bernice,( Anna Lee, Marni Nixon,and Evandne Baker),she ponders her dilemma regarding the renegade novice.<br />  For the Mother Abbess, the answer seems to be to send Maria out into the world as a governess to the seven children of a retired and widowered sea captain.<br /> Little does Maria realize she is being called to bring a somber household back to life.<br />  Reluctantly, she begins her journey, filled with trepidation. Slowly building herself up with her "pep song", "I Have Confidence", her feelings of assertiveness wane as she approaches the estate. Greeted rather coldly by the family's butler, Franz(Gil Stuart)upon her arrival, she wanders into the sealed-off ballroom, genuflecting and wondering how she should present herself to the nobleman who is her new boss.<br /> But the gruff captain( a cooly elegant Christopher Plummer) encounters her at the ballroom's entrance. Once they meet, their relationship is a bit antagonistic. But soon, the captain blows his whistle and six of Maria's new charges march downstairs clad in sailor suits to greet her. These include the eldest, 16-year-old Liesl(Charmain Carr), 14-year-old Frederich(Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa(Heather Menzies),11-year-old Kurt(Duane Chase), 7-year-old Marta(Debbie Turner), and pug tressed,5-year-old Gretl(Kym Karath). Displaying the same penchant Maria has for tardiness, 10-year-old Brigitta(Angela Cartwright), distracted by another matter, arrives on the scene later.<br /> Maria withstands the pranks of the children to psyche them out at the dinnertable, from which Liesl excuses herself upon learning that her young swain Rolfe(Daniel Truhitte) is close at hand.<br /> The budding romance of the teenagers gives an enchanting moment as the two get caught in the rain.<br /> Housekeeper Frau Schmidt( Norma Varden) helps Maria settle in. Soon, despite Captain Von Trapp's rules about the strict observance of bedtime,  Maria finds herself consoling the youngsters by making them think of their favorite things during the thunderstorm,and proving her worth to the initially skeptical Liesl as well.The captain arrives to express his displeasure. But Maria has plans of her own.<br /> While enduring one of the Captain's many absences, Maria makes the children some play clothes from old bedroom drapes, takes them on outings, and teaches them to sing in multipart harmony as an alternative to playing pranks to get their father's attention.<br /> As the musical education of the Von Trapp children gets underway amid the fabulous urban and rural scenes of Salzburg, their father returns with a couple of very interesting and influential guests, namely, Baroness Ilsa Schroeder(Eleanor Parker), and a chaperoning concert promoter, Max Detweiler(Richard Haydn). As the three gather on the terrace, Rolfe, hoping to contact Liesl, and deliver another relevant message, proves to be a nuisance, hiding behind membership in the HitlerJugend when confronted by the captain.<br /> Soon the captain and his guests are greeted by the joyous band of Maria and the children as they fall from a boat and into the lake at the edge of the terrace.When reprimanded by the captain, Maria defends herself, and openly criticizes his inattentiveness to his children almost at the expense of her job.But the childrens' song for the Baroness and the Captain's joining them in song at the last moment breaks down a long-standing barrier between a grief-stricken man and his children. Maria is allowed to stay.<br /> The second half of the story finds the family in sunnier circumstances, expressing their love of music (as is typically Austrian) through a colorful puppet show, and by the childrens' urging their father to recite a song he hasn't sung in years, accompanied by Liesl.<br /> But Baroness Schroeder begins to see Maria as a rival for the Captain's affections, and her plotting to marry him begins in earnest. Convincing Georg to host a ball to introduce her to his friends, Ilsa acts as a gracious hostess, accompanied by Max and Georg.<br /> Georg's intercessions of Maria's teaching Kurt the Landler causes the Baroness to step up her scheming against Maria, and Max steps up his scheming to have the children in the Salzburg Music Festival after the children charm guests with their good-night song.<br /> A meeting between the two women results in Maria's sudden return to Nonnberg Abbey, leaving behind the heartbroken children, who may end up with an uncaring stepmother.There is evidence during Ilsa's unenthusiastic ball game with the children that Liesl suspects the truth.<br /> A visit to the Abbey, during which the children are turned away from seeing Maria sets the course of more favorable events in motion. The young novice soon has a glad reunion with her charges when ordered to return to the family. The Baroness concedes defeat, acknowledging her incompatability with Georg's family, clearing the way for a beautiful and stately wedding between the captain and Maria in what are truly the Last Golden Days of the Thirties.<br /> The couple return from their honeymoon amid the Anschluss, during which Herr Zeller(Ben Wright) once a guest in the Von Trapp Home, has been named the Gauleiter of Salzburg and shadowy events that were only peripheral during much of the story become central. Rolfe's relationship with Liesl changes.<br /> Georg is soon ordered to fill a postion in the German Navy, and in an act of true moral courage, this truly noble family leave their beloved Austria behind amid moments of poignancy and solidarity with fellow Austrians, the distress of pursuit by those who would compromise them, and the benediction of the Benedictine nuns(two of whom tip the balance in their favor). We leave them en route to a new life elsewhere in one of the most triumphant moments in cinematic history.<br /> The film takes liberties with some aspects of the story while remaining true to others. But in writing this tribute on the 45th anniversary of this film's release, it is considered opinion that the film's message of the triumph of virtue, and the soaring spirit of this enduring classic will continue through the ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>When it comes to family-oriented entertainment and especially musicals, it's hard to do better than "The Sound of Music".  Not only is the plot very compelling and believable but the songs are simply inspired classics and standards that will continue to be sung many many years from now.  This represents Rodgers and Hammerstein at the top of their creative powers and this together with "Oklahoma" represent my favourite musicals of all time.<br /><br />This dvd version is the full-screen one and after viewing this a couple of times I can't help but feel that I should have gotten the widescreen version instead although as far as full-screen versions go, this is not bad.  The picture quality is well restored although not perfect as not every frame is without some form of minor defect but this is not enough to detract from your viewing enjoyment.  The sound quality is very good though coming in Dolby Digital 4.1 Surround format.  There are no Bonus features of note such as documentaries etc which is disappointing but here's hoping the upcoming Blu-ray version improves upon the picture, sound and bonus features aspects enough for us to shout about.<br /><br />As far as standard full-screen version dvds go though, this version suffices as a must have in any musical fan's dvd library although you may want to wait for the Blu-ray version if you are intending to upgrade any time soon.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>If "West Side Story" was the best musical film of the sixties, then "The Sound of Music," adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular...<br /><br />With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)--and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, "The Sound of Music" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones...<br /><br />The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley... It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...<br /><br />There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo... Maria's music lesson to the children, "Do-Re-Mi," is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry... And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, "Edelweiss," with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein...<br /><br />Another of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the "adorable" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Maria (Julie Andrews) is an apprentice nun.  She truly wants to devote her life to God, but struggles with the rules.  When the Mother Abbess sends her to take care of Captain von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, she gets more then she bargained for.  The children are in desperate need of love, and she and the captain begin to fall in love as well.  Meanwhile, Austria is in danger from the advancing Nazi threat.<p>"The Sound of Music" is one of those feel good films.  I smile the entire way through it.  In my mind, it's Rogers and Hammerstein's best musical.  All the songs are easily singable and memorable.  Who doesn't know "My Favorite Things," "Do-Re-Mi," or even the title song?  Yet these songs are set into a fun love story against an interesting back drop.  The movie does loose a little steam in the second act, but my only real disappointment is the cutting of two songs from the play.  "How Can Love Survive?" and "No Way to Stop It" add some fun and help flesh out the character of the Baroness.  In spite of these things, I still love the movie version, however.<p>The two disc set is a wonderful way to own this classic movie.  The picture and sound are wonderful, and the disc is packed with information.  I especially enjoyed the documentary on the second disc because it includes information on the real von Trapps.<p>If you haven't seen this classic piece of American cinema, don't hesitate.  If you're looking for the perfect disc to own, this is it.  It may be harder to track down the two disc edition, but in my mind, it's well worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>This lovely new 40th Anniversary 2-disc edition of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a real treat.  But, for those in a quandry about buying yet another DVD release of the film (following the "Five Star" 2-disc edition), I say, buy this version but keep the old one too, because it has some great extras that were not ported onto this new edition (more about that later).<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is of course based on the long-running 1959 hit Broadway musical that originally starred Mary Martin.  The musical was inspired by a Geman film called "Die Trapp Famile", based on the book by Maria Augusta Trapp.  The story is as well-known as those hills that truly did come alive with the sound of music:  Maria (Julie Andrews) is a postulant nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg circa 1938.  The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) becomes well-aware that the spirited Maria is hardly suited to the cloistered life of a nun.  So Maria is assigned as governess to the seven children of an autocratic widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).  Like a breath of fresh mountain air, Maria transforms the children and eventually steals the Captain's heart away from a worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker).  But the Nazi Anschluss is coming, and the family's safety is under threat...<br /><br />This new DVD contains a wealth of new bonus material including :<br />"Audio Commentary" - brand new commentary track with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, choreographer Dee Dee Wood and Charmian Carr amongst others.  The Robert Wise director commentary (from the "5 Star" release) is also included.<br /><br />"A Few of My Favourite Things" - Julie Andrews hosts this generous-length documentary which features new interviews with key cast and production team members, some rare photos, footage from behind the scenes and more.<br /><br />"Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence" - Julie and Chris sit down and share their memories from the film.<br /><br />"From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion" - This is something truly special.  This segment reunites all seven von Trapp children to share their own memories and talk about the film.  With Charmian Carr (Liesl), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Heather Menzies (Louisa), Duane Chase (Kurt), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta), Debbie Turner (Marta) and Kym Karath (Gretl).<br /><br />"On Location with The Sound of Music" - Charmian Carr takes us on a personally-guided tour of Salzburg, taking in the historical sites as well as the locations featured in the film.  This is a cute update on "Salzburg Sights and Sounds", which Carr made as a featurette during production of SOM in 1965 (and which can be found on the "5 Star" release).<br /><br />"When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon" - This takes a look behind the scenes during the 40th Anniversary "Sing-Along a-Sound of Music" screening held at the Hollywood Bowl with an audience of over 18,00 people.  The "Sing Along" version of the film has taken off all over the world, and this featurette gives you a definite flavour of one.<br /><br />"The von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord" - This is the fantastic `Biography' episode which takes an in-depth look at the real von Trapp clan.  We learn that the real Maria was a far more flawed and fallible human being than we ever saw in "Sound of Music", and also the shocking fact that infamous Himmler took over the von Trapp villa shortly after their exit from Salzburg.  Featuring interviews with several of the real von Trapp children.<br /><br />"Mia Farrow screen test" - A fascinating look at the girl who might have played Liesl if Charmian Carr was never cast in the role.  Farrow sings a brief section of "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" in a blonde wig.  Lesley Ann Warren also auditioned for the role (she appeared in the title role of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" instead), but it might have been nice to have had Lesley's screen test also.  Oh well...<br /><br />"Restoration comparison" - Compares a 1993 print of the film with the new 40th Anniversary restored print.<br /><br />There are also copious trailers and galleries to watch and explore.<br /><br />The "Five Star" double disc set also included the fabulous doco "From Fact to Phenomenon", and that is the main reason why I'll keep my old DVD alongside this new version.  I recommend that all fans purchase this new edition, if only for the reunion featurette.  For those who have yet to buy SOM in digital format, this release is a no-brainer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movie musicals of all time. It tells the true story of novice nun Maria, who is sent to be a nanny for a retired captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The captain is still sad over the loss of his wife, and distances himself from the kids. He becomes engaged to a snooty baroness (Eleanor Parker), who dislikes children and is especially jealous of the pretty, young novice. Maria is quite the singer, and in no time she has the kids, and their father, singing Austrian folksongs all over the countryside, and soon, she and the captain marry. The story takes a serious turn as Germany annexes Austria, and the captain is ordered to report for duty in Hitler's forces. <p>Julie Andrews radiates confidence and joy in song after song, many of which have become familiar to everyone, especially Edelweiss, Doe, A Deer, and My Favorite Things. Her voice is pitch perfect and she looks great with Christopher Plummer. Salzburg is so beautiful, no wonder they sang all the time. This is a charming, romantic, and exciting musical the whole family will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Now WHAT can I say about this movie that a thousand others haven't said? That despite the fact that it is sappy and a bit obvious, it's also witty, funny, touching, and endearing. You will want to BE Maria!<p>Maria is a high-spirited young nun who is always late, always skipping and singing and sprinting around, and she's driving the solemner nuns up the wall. The Mother Superior knows that her place is not a convent, and so sends her for a time to be the governess to the Baron Von Trapp's seven kids.<p>Baron Von Trapp (played to perfection by Christopher Plummer) is a widower, who has emotionally closed himself off, and treats his bouncy bunch of kids like military ship crew: They have to march, line up for inspection, and respond INSTANTLY, no matter where they are, to the blast of a whistle. Maria is shocked by this, and quickly tries to give the kids love and affection and FUN. The kids respond to this new treatment by becoming fiercely attached to Maria, despite their father's attachment to the beautiful, blond, completely uninteresting Baroness Schraeder. <p>Naturally, that isn't all of the plot. There are love stories and stories about runaways, and the Nazis loom over all of it.<p>The kids are amazing, from energetic teen Liesl to amazingly (but not cloyingly) cute Gretl. All of the kids are perfectly normal: Gretl announcing that she got her finger caught &quot;in Friedrich's teeth&quot;; Liesl's attraction to a young Nazi; Friedrich's musings on what grass tastes like. Liesl has been my favorite for a very long time.<p>Plummer is excellent, he's alternately tender (with hardly a word said) and strict, loving and cold. But what shines through all the time is Von Trapp's moral sense, and determination not to help the Nazis. Julie Andrews is bright and effervescent, turning from a grown-up girl into a woman before our eyes. <p>And the actress playing Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) is a very low-key note--you hate her whenever you see her, with her smooth manners and speech and appearance. Her talk with Maria made me gag. Then, in her last scene, she surprises everyone.<p>This is a beautiful musical tale with roots in reality, a must-see for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>What more can one say about one of the more, perhaps the most beloved, of American family films?<br /><br />It's hard to believe this is the 45th Anniversary Edition, now in Blu-ray, and it has never looked or sounded better.<br /><br />What makes this a perfect film is that it is a journey of a real-life family who only wanted to add harmony to a world facing a real evil.  And the other thing that works so well is that even though it might be labeled a "musical," all the music is internally derived from performances within the story by a family whose job it is to sing.  Not bad for those who hate contrived singing and dancing!<br /><br />On top of all this, besides the perfect story, casting and direction (Robert Wise at the peak of his powers), it includes a love story (really a double love story) and a harrowing journey over the Alps - a glimpse of heaven? - on their journey to freedom.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is almost incandescent as Maria, the spirited young woman who brings love and music to the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children.<br /><br />Rodgers & Hammerstein must be spinning -- with delight -- in their graves.  Whopping extras abound.  This is one for the library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>It&#65533;s become fashionable to make fun of this musical, but the truth is that it&#65533;s still a great movie, great music, and uplifting message. Maria, the young woman who just couldn&#65533;t make it within the confines of a nunnery, leaves the convent and becomes nanny for a widow with a bazillion cute kids. In his grief and ineptitude, he has been trying to run the household along military lines, and it falls to Maria to add warmth, sunshine, music and love back into their lives. The movie is set in Salzburg during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Austria and is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps &#65533; and joy. Who could ask for more from a film?<br />And then there&#65533;s the music, the Rogers and Hammerstein score from the Broadway play, which has given us such timeless tunes as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long &#65533; Farewell, etc.<br />With Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Baron von Trapp, it&#65533;s a winner for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have never been a fan of musicals. This was the first time I ever watched this film. I have seen small pieces of it, but never cared to watch it. I have the 2 disc set and I was amazed at the transfer and sound. This is the way musicals should be done. The songs are memorable and there is a good story with dialogue! I watched "The King and I" which I really liked and then "Oklahoma" which bored me to death! If your not a musical fan "The Sound of Music is the place to start. The story will hold your interest, the kids are charming and Julie Andrews is a very talented captivating beauty! It's a 3 hour movie, but it did move along at a fairly quick pace.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This musical is a total joy to watch; I would not even try to count the number of times I've seen it but it always remains beautiful and lovely to watch and hear. This particular version is well planned and presented and seems to nicely capture the special nature of the 45th Anniversary of this fine work.<br /><br />It will need a special place on your shelf as it is not intended to simply fit in with all of your other discs; it is, however, worthy of the honor as it is beautifully executed and includes all of the special extras that come with the Blu-ray disc that make it truly a collectors choice.<br /><br />First of all, the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself is excellent; the video and the audio both are as close to perfect as I could imagine. There is absolutely nothing there that gets in between the viewer and the performance; Salzburg has never looked lovelier nor has Julie Andrews. In addition to the feature film there is a second Blu-ray disc devoted to additional special features. The fact that they are presented in Blu-ray is somewhat unusual as this kind of disc is often in a DVD format. There is a full version including special features in the DVD format on the third disc and a fourth disc which is a stereo CD of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There is a protective sleeve which shows the box to be part of a Limited Edition and gives the number assigned to your particular set. The inside box slips out of the sleeve and has a hinged top which opens upward to reveal a "Letter of Authenticity" from Twentieth Century Fox. On top is a large hardback book in full color called "A Few of our Favorite Things" which first tells the real story of the Von Trapp family in a section called "The Von Trapp Family: Separating Fact from Fiction." It has many photographs of the real family and tells the actual story of their lives and adventures. One quickly discovers that considerable "artistic license" was taken as the script was written for the movie.<br /><br />The second section of the book is called "The origins of The Sound of Music" and describes the steps that eventually led to the movie version. It is the longest part of the book and covers the original book written in 1949 by Maria von Trapp, "The Story of the Trapp Family Singers," it's progression to Broadway and its final progression to the screen. It is filled with interesting insights about the people and the process that made it all possible.<br /><br />Section 3 of the book is called "Salzburg: The City of Music" and along with some lovely pictures gives more information about the city, its history, and the locations where the movie was shot. The final short section of the book is called "The Legacy of The Sound of Music" and tells the story of the movie after its original release. All told, the book is a treasure and a worthy addition to the set; it will not be available for individual sale according to the inside back cover.<br /><br />Under the discs are two items, a reprint of the 1965 booklet which was available for sale at the 1965 rerelease of the movie, and a set of color photos of scenes from Salzburg. In addition there is a small hand painted music box which plays "My Favorite Things;" the box is curiously heavy and has a feel of quality.<br /><br />The bottom line on all of this is one has here a remarkable collector's item for any who appreciates this memorable musical; the excellent video and audio, the book, music box, photos and the booklet all combine to create a very special opportunity to enjoy again the wonders of this production.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>This DVD is pretty much a duplicate of the 30th Anniversary laserdisc edition made in '95 which contained an extensive supplement section.  Considering the laserdisc cost $120, this DVD is an extremely good  deal.<p>The movie is in widescreen format only.  Some of the extras include  an audio track carrying director's commentary alternating with  &quot;karaoke&quot; style music-only, no-singing track, the 1965 promo  documentary &quot;Salzburg Sights and Sound&quot; that runs 14 minutes, NOT  36 minutes as printed on the back of the DVD case, the 1995 re-release  promo documentary &quot;From Facts to Phenomenon&quot; that runs 86  minutes, and the extensive &quot;Gallery&quot; still-frame section that  details the making of the movie, including first-hand info such as  production memos, letters, telegrams written by the filmmakers themselves.  On nagging problem is that most of the still photos in the still-frame  section look too bright as if they were overexposed during development;  this problem didn't exist in the aforementioned laserdisc.<p>The chapter  listing printed on the included booklet has most of the chapter numbers  printed incorrectly -- chapter 8 is misprinted as chapter 7, chapter 9 as  chapter 8, and so on throughout the entire chapter listing.  I use the  chapter menu on the disc more often than the printed chapter listing, so  this is not a big problem for me.<p>DVD-ROM features include web links,  wallpapers, and a simple game where you guess the musical notes in a song.  Nothing groundbreaking here.<p>This DVD is great for family viewing,  naturally.  And it's loaded with so much extra material that it will also  satisfy hardcore movie fans  who want to know more about the movie's  background, history, anecdotes, and so on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>The Sound of Music earned spot #55 on the AFI top listing, a list only a few musicals got into. How did this movie get onto a list with Gone with the Wind and The African Queen?<br /><br />Yes, the plot is a little simplistic. Evil nasty Nazis are threatening smiling beautiful children, and the family has to make a run for it. The children are not only photogenic but also have the voices of angels. Some of the lyrics are a little silly as well.<br /><br />Still, these are minor complaints in a moving story based on a real life adventure. The captain really did fall in love with his governess, the children really did have musical talent, and the threat of the Germans drove them to flee. It's great to see this true world tale brought to the big screen with such beauty.<br /><br />The scenes in Austria are just beautiful, from the elegant dances to the gorgeous landscapes. The movie really was filmed in Salzburg, Austria, and the exterior of the convent is the actual one the real Maria stayed in. You're getting an authentic world of the world these characters inhabited, although the house shown was not their real house.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is phenomenal. From her pure voice to the glow in her cheeks as she falls in love, she is an ideal heroine.<br /><br />Even more unusual, this movie actually passes the Bechdel test! The Mother Superior at the convent talks about how each of us has to follow our dreams, take on the challenges our life presents to us. Yes, in part it was about the captain, but it was about life in general, and she was talking about herself as much as Julie.<br /><br />A great movie well worth watching and rewatching for the pure joy of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>You simply can't go wrong with this movie. Mind you, this is not an accurate biography of the Von Trapp family - the real Maria was nowhere near as lovely or sweet as Julie Andrews, but this movie is a entertaining story nonetheless with some pretty awesome musical numbers.<br /><br />Julie Andrews really shines in her role as young Maria as she goes to become a governess for the Von Trapps. Her sweet asnd steadfast personality allow her to remain cool under the pranks that the Von Trapp children play jokes on her (they even feel bad for it!) and how she eventually gets through to the patriarch of the Von Trapps himself. Set amidst pre World-War Europe (namely Austria), this is a lovely if somewhat fictionalized account of the Von Trapps. The music and dancing numbers themselves make this movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless, film.

Director: Robert Wise.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Oscar-winning producer/director Robert Wise is dead at 91.  He lived a full and wonderful life, and his cinematic legacy covers all genres.  Check out this partial lineup from just the 1960s-WEST SIDE STORY, TWO FOR THE SEESAW, THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND PEBBLES, and STAR!  Wise started out as an editor at RKO.  He edited CITIZEN KANE and (re)edited THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS for Orson Welles in the early 1940s, then directed one of the scariest of the Val Lewton psychological chillers:  THE BODY SNATCHER (1945) and a great boxing drama called THE SET-UP (1947).<br /><br />Wise's most famous film is probably the Oscar-winning Best Picture and Director winner, THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965, Fox).  It and WEST SIDE STORY were what came to my mind first when I heard he was dead.  I was going to single out a less well-known Wise film for review here until I took an informal poll and found that a startling number of friends and business associates on my e-mail distribution list had never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC uncut and non-commercial anywhere-theater or home video--, just parts of it butchered and with commercials on NBC or ABC.  So I recommend watching a studio print of THE SOUND OF MUSIC on deluxe double DVD to salute a great and incredibly versatile filmmaker.<br /><br />MUSIC was first a real-life drama, then a 1950's play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse with Mary Martin and songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, then an enormously popular Best Picture Oscar winner in the mid-1960's.  It is about the courageous Von Trapp family trying to live with the Nazi occupation of Austria in 1938 Salzburg, then later attempting to flee the country as professional singers.  Christopher Plummer plays the widowed Captain with seven children; Julie Andrews got an Oscar nomination (one year after winning the award for MARY POPPINS) as nun Maria who is much too independent to ever be whatever comes next for a nun.  During a night storm, she teaches the kids "Raindrops On Roses"-until she is interrupted by a drenched Liesl (Charmian Carr), oldest of the children, who has been in the moonlit yard gazebo singing "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" with young Nazi messenger Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte).<br /><br />MUSIC was filmed all over Salzburg.  Bike riding around the town in olive and white window curtain clothes, climaxes with "Do Re Mi" on top of a beautiful mountain.  Shortly thereafter, the Captain is furious to learn that his kids have been wandering all over the town in bedsheets, albeit having a wonderful time.  But his anger is calmed when his fiancee, Baroness Eleanor Parker, finds the kids charming.  Meanwhile, Maria is slowly falling in love with the Captain, and he with her.  There is a fun puppet show, which is often cut for time on TV.  The kids and the Captain all sing the lovely  "Edelweiss" to the Baroness and show biz manager Max (Richard Haydn).  But during a lavish party, Maria leaves the mansion with a goodbye note for the Captain.  Intermission.  We are about 100 minutes into a 174 minute movie that has restored roadshow music and intermission on DVD.<br /><br />I have seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC on stage, and it just dies, despite the wonderful songs and competent actors, because of painted backdrops for the town and Alpine mountain meadows.  By contrast, this Robert Wise movie (scripted by Ernest Lehman) is a masterpiece with dream casting to match the incomparable songs.  After the intermission, Maria returns and the unhappy kids come to life again.  The Baroness realizes that the Captain is in love with Maria and fades into the background; Parker is wonderful in this role.  The Captain and Maria have a romantic duet "I Must Have Done Something Good" in the moonlit gazebo; so do Liesl and Rolfe, which is tricky because an Austrian girl is romancing a Nazi, who becomes a villain in the last half hour.<br /><br />The Von Trapp family and Maria have to flee a country plagued by insidious Nazis.  But first the Captain and Maria get married, in a cathedral with grand music.  Maria got permission from the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood), who gets to do "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" for Maria in her church office.  The big climax to the movie is a performance of "So Long, Farewell" and "Edelweiss" for a packed audience in a theater that has Nazis taking up the entire first row and guarding the exits.  But you know this movie has a happy ending, or else it would get booed!  A gripping night graveyard scene leads to an enthralling finale that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  The movie won five Oscars and was nominated for several more.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC, again, runs 174 minutes and is usually cut to 145 minutes for showing on commercial TV.  Trust me, this show needs to run a full three hours.  It does NOT have half an hour of dead material!  You can buy a bonus-free studio print DVD for $10, or the super-duper Five Star Collection for about $30.  (It looks like this one is on temporary moratorium so that Fox can bring out a 40th Anniversary edition soon.)  The more expensive edition belongs in every family.  Among its exhausting bonuses are audio commentary by producer-director Wise (who wisely keeps quiet during the songs), an extensive 87 minute filmmaking documentary, Charmian Carr's home movies as Liesl, a congratulations telegram from Dan Truhitte (Rolfe), a 36 minute 1965 documentary on the beauty of Salzburg, audio comments by writer Ernest Lehman and Julie Andrews, and what seems like someone's uncut dissertation.  It ran several hours (!) for me and is self-generated with arrows you push at your own speed, documenting the history of the Von Trapp family, the creation and production of the 1950's play, pre-production through post-production almost day by day for the movie, and what the family has been up to since the movie.<br /><br />This is one stupendous DVD, which also gives you a THX-mastered soundtrack and the original widescreen aspect ratio (so you can see all of the children and all of the outdoor scenery at once).  Man, I love this immortal screen classic!  I find it unimaginable that people exist on planet Earth who have never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC in a theater or uncut and non-commercial somewhere else somehow.  For Heaven's sake, treat yourselves, on a birthday or anniversary-or Robert Wise's death, to one of Hollywood's greatest musicals with the Five Star Collection of the movie on DVD. Or the upcoming edition.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>For me, this film remains as one of the greatest musicals of all time.  It has warm, self deprecating humor, drama, and beautiful, beautiful music.<br /><br />It's hard to beat the opening scene with Maria (Julie Andrews), the young woman in training to become a nun. spinning with youthful exuberance, on a stunningly gorgeous green hill in Austria.  Then, the beautiful words, "The hills are alive with the sound of music...."  For me, only Julie Andrews could capture the wit, the whimsy and the spirit of Maria.  Though, Mary Martin was wonderful in the staged production, Julie added her own touch of class, mischief and flamboyance to the role, along with that gorgeous, gorgeous soprano voice.<br /><br />This wonderful, delightful and poignant story of the young Maria, who has too much spirit to stay within the confines of the convent, is sent out into the world to be a governess for a widower and his seven children, remains timeless, irresistable and very entertaining.  Amazing to imagine that it is now forty years old!!! The young actors and actresses, cast as Baron Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, dance and act wonderfully.  Also, even though I have heard stories that Christopher Plummer refers to this musical as  THE SOUND OF MUCOUS, he managed to pull of his role as the gruff Baron, whose heart melts after coming to know the irresistable Maria, with class.  (Though, I swear , there are some scenes where I swear he is trying to keep from sneering, and doesn't always succeed!)<br /><br />This film is filled with some of the most well known tunes from musical theatre repertoire ("Edelweiss," "Do Re Mi," "Climb Every Mountain," and "My Favorite Things," among others).  Also, the cinematography is gorgeous.  You feel like you are in the Alps with Maria and the children, and can almost smell the dew in the grass.  Perfect for the family, and essential for every film buff.  Even if you aren't a fan of musicals, I think almost everyone can find something to love about this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Rodgers & Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF MUSIC had 1443 performances between 11/16/59 and 6/15/1963.

I know that this is a classic, but I'm sorry.  In all of my thirty plus years none of the clips I've seen of this movie even hinted to me that I might like this movie.  None.  And I do like some of Julie Andrews work: Mary Poppins, Victor/Victoria are two that comes to mind.  But a woman whirling around on a mountain top--not so much.  Then for some reason that I don't remember now, I sat down and watch it.  AND I LOOOOOOVVVVE IT.  What fun!  The music, the optimism and the theme of the importance of family. Beautiful.  I was smiling and singing as I watched this movie. I even found the ending suspenseful.  I now have to buy this soundtrack.  Just gotta.  High Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>I can't say enough of the quality of this film.  The acting, music, directing...all genius.  It is timeless and a great family film.  Julie Andrews has a beautiful voice, as does Christopher Plummer.  I have read books on the real Von Trapp family, and certainly, Hollywood took some liberties, however, because it's such a wonderful film, we can forgive them!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>"The Sound of Music" was a monster hit when it came out in 1965.  It was a wildly loved by millions.  Children then and children now take to it and love watching it again and again.  The songs are wonderful, instantly memorable, and people love to sing them.  Even today, if you were to start singing almost any of these tunes many people could easily join in.  At the time of its release it became the biggest box office winner of all time and even passed "Gone With the Wind".<br /><br />The story is adapted from the stage show which came from an autobiographical book of the real life story of Maria von Trapp.  The Trapp family that is very much intact, large, and a keeper of the memory.  However, if you hear the comments about this film from self-anointed sophisticates, they drip with condescension and even contempt.  You would think the film to be unimportant commercial drivel.  Certainly, commercial success is no credential of artistic achievement, but neither is it a disqualifier.<br /><br />So, what is it about this delightful and beautifully done musical that upsets so many people (even as it brings joy to many many more)?  My own view is that there was a change in what a portion of the culture wanted in their art.  They wanted things more ironic, detached, and darker.  This movie is none of that.  While there were still musicals made after the huge success of "The Sound of Music", it was definitely a turning point that led to a decline to the present all but extinction of the form (unless you can relate "Moulin Rouge" to this film).<br /><br />However, this film continues to bring happiness to its millions of fans and this is a good DVD of it (although I wish the print could be digitally remastered and the color more even).  The commentary by Richard Wise, the director, is very interesting and informative.  He tells us about the actors, the shooting of the film, the way the actors got along, and he even presents the songs in the film as just orchestra.  It is very interesting to hear what is actually going on underneath the voices.<br /><br />There is a lot more subtlety in the film than I ever saw as a kid.  Sure, there is that abolished emotion we used to call tenderness, but it does not deserve the accusation of treacle or saccharine that are used to simply dismiss it.<br /><br />Well done.  Enjoy it and forget the pain junkies who need to be flogged by their entertainments.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>"You have brought music back into my home".  This is a story about a man, who lost his wife, suffered loneliness, realized the value of his family and embraces his family once again in music and drama, and falls in love with a woman of great culture and life.<br /><br />Tensions are high between Germany and Austria.  Nazi Germany threats to occuppy Austria, raping the country of his sovereignty and independance.  The Van Trap family represents the Austrian culture, naval might, and defiance of their conquerors.<br /><br />The Sound of Music withstands the test of time: scenery, key landmarks, picture quality alp mountains, and religous moral ideals. Julie Andrews represents the spirit of independant woman, the virtueous ideals of Mary, the zest for experience and excitement and life, and the moral courage to stand up against evil.

The daisy-fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs--"Do Re Mi," "Climb Every Mountain," and "My Favorite Things"--have become part of our cultural heritage. Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible. The hills are still alive--and your singing pipes will be too--with the wondrous "Sound of Music."</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>I was only six but I still remember when my mother took us kids to the movies to see 'The Sound of Music'. A memory permantly ingrained as is this film. From the most amazing opening shot ever filmed this classic film never lets go of yor senses. It's fun, thrilling and holds up extremely well. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are exquisite. Sure some of the lyrics are corny and simple but it all works and I'm not even a fan of musicals.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>Excellent movie musical with Julie Andrews as the headliner. I first saw this movie when it premiered in "Cineramascope" on the cinerama sceen, and it is the most memorable movie of that fad era, because that is the way it was meant to be viewed, and should be watched. I am so glad home theater sceens are accomodating those vibrant additives to give todays audience a chance to see how some of these movies worked. It was absolutely incredible to recall the giant size visions of the convent interiors, and deluxe "mountainous" scenery. The sights of seeing our beloved Julie dance, hop, skip, and jump throughout the movie with seven, (yes, seven), children next to her heels is a must see. I am not much of a complainer for intricate drivel or criticism, as long as the general feel of the movie produced is well worth the size of entertainment it gives in no uncertain terms. (This includes low-budget theater).<br />On another note, the available soundtrack to The Sound Of Music is pretty much a necessity if one is to grasp the stereo scope of the music output. It gives another dimension to relate to the magnificence of this feature. And the cover photo of this product says it all!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>This musical details the life of a novice nun named Maria. There are people in the Nonburg Abbey in Salzburg that do not like her so the Reverend Mother sends her to take care of the seven children of a Widower Captain Georg Von Trapp.<br /><br />When Maria gets to the house of the Von Trapp she and Georg do not get along. However soon Georg can tell that she and the children really care for eachother and he starts falling in love with her, and eventually she falls in love with him.

Unfortunitly once they get back from their honeymoon they are confronted by the Nazis and that night after singing in the Salzburg film festival they excape Austria climbing into the Alps to America.<br /><br />While not the factual story of the Von Trapps-it is a very good movie with great songs that stay with you for a long time!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Magical<br />This movie transports me to a special place everytime I watch it.

Certainly the children are at times hard to take (especially Charmian Carr, who seems simultaneously vixenish--&quot;tooooooo wriiiiiiiite onnnnnnn&quot;--and wholesome, as if she were a mutant hybrid of Ann-Margret and Doris Day). But the film is extremely visually inventive, especially in its contrasts of the cramped spaces of the Captain's villa and the beautiful open exteriors of Salzburg and the surrounding Alps. And most critics have overlooked that the film's scenarists have worked in an audience surrogate to sneer at Maria's goody-goodyness in the person of the Countess. Memorably played by Eleanor Parker, the Countess is given to all kinds of snide comments when things get too sugary (&quot;My dear, is there anything you *don't* do?&quot;).<p>Best of all, the film has at its center the amazing Julie Andrews, who makes the best Maria imaginable. She really does make you believe in Maria's kindness and simplicity, and her love of the outdoors. In her two most iconic moments--spinning on the moutaintop during the title number, and leading the children at top speed through a footbridge during &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;-- her arms are characteristically spread wide, accepting the entirety of the beautiful world around her. And has anybody who has seen her ever forgotten how she closes &quot;Do Re Mi,&quot; hitting that perfect &quot;fa&quot; as she leaps up the steps? This performance alone forever cements Andrews's status as an icon in world cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>This is one, of my favorite movies I saw it when I was, little and it's  still one of my favorites, the songs are great, eventhough it's old it's  still good........It's worth watching you'll love it for the intire,  family! :-)</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>THE SOUND OF MUSIC is 1 one those few films that stands the test of time. It is simply the very best musical produced in the 20th century. And Julie  Andrews? A gift from the heavens. Enough said.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>Following the success of the 1964 film "Mary Poppins", Julie Andrews starred in another sensational film only one year later, "The Sound of Music".  Directed by Robert Wise (who also directed "The Andromeda Strain" in 1971, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" in 1951 and "West Side Story" in 1961), the film was derived from the Broadway musical created by Richard Rogers & Oscar Hammerstein II, in corroboration with writers Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse).  It was based upon the true story of the van Trapp family immediately prior to World War II.<p>Taking place in Salzburg, Austria in 1938, the film begins with a cinematically beautiful display of the Alps and Julie Andrews singing the title song.  Julie Andrews plays Maria, a young woman studying to become a nun; but Reverend Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) along with nuns Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), Sister Bertha (Portia Nelson), Sister Sophia (Marni Nixon) and Sister Bernice (Evadne Baker) aren't sure whether Maria is suitable nun material.  Mother Abbess decides to send Maria on a mission to be a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a decorated hero of the Austrian Navy.  Captain von Trapp has had great difficulty finding a proper governess for his children, who frequently discourage any governess from remaining by using various pranks.  Initially, the children intend to treat Maria as any previous governess, but they quickly take a liking to her.  Upon discovering that the children have never sung before, Maria teaches them how to sing, to the unintended delight of Captain von Trapp's friend, Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), who is searching for fresh musical talent.  However, Captain von Trapp does not intend to allow Max to exploit his children's previously unknown musical abilities.  Further, unexpected feelings develop between Captain von Trapp and Maria.<p>Complicating matters for Maria and the von Trapp family is the political atmosphere in 1938 Austria.  Some Austrians enthusiastically embrace the idea of Anschluss (political annexation) between Austria and Nazi Germany, but most (including Captain von Trapp) are totally opposed.  As history records, Nazi Germany takes control of Austria in 1938, and Germany's naval command wants Captain von Trapp to take command of one of its naval vessels.  Captain von Trapp instead decides to take his family to the safety of Switzerland.<p>Acting and singing in "The Sound of Music" are superb. Not only the abilities Julie Andrews (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress) eloquently showcased, but also those of Christopher Plummer and Peggy Wood (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress).  The young actors & actresses portraying Captain von Trapp's children are also very talented: Leisl (Charmian Carr), Louisa (Heather Menzies, who played Jessica in the 1977 TV series "Logun's Run"), Friedrich (Nicholas Hammand, who acted in many TV series including "The Amazing Spider-Man" as Spider-Man in 1978), Kurt (Duane Chase), Brigitta (Angela Cartwright, who also played Penny in the 1965 TV series "Lost in Space"), Marta (Debbie Turner) and Gretl (Kym Karath. who also played Maggie in the 1963 film "The Thrill Of It All").  Also putting in wonderful performances are Eleanor Parker as the Baroness, Ben Wright as Herr Zeller and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe.<p>Songs from the film include:<br />* "The Sound of Music" (5+/5, Julie Andrews). Overlooking the Alps.<br />* "Preludium (Dixit Dominus)" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  At the abbey.<br />* "Morning Hymn/Alleluia" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).

While that wish partially came true, I must alert buyers that this DVD, while no doubt excellent, is not the classic that its being touted as. I, for one, am waiting for a more definitive version of the DVD to come out.<p>The main problem with this is that the movie here is available ONLY on widescreen. While this is much preferred to certain audiences, I would much rather have the option of watching it on full-screen. I found myself squinting at the screen on occasion (and I have a large television, mind you) just to catch the details. Disc One was a complete letdown due to this. Also, and I'm not the first to say this, the color transfer is wretched. One would think that for this price you'd get an impeccable transfer, and this version leaves much to be desired.<p>Disc Two is the real scene stealer. The easily navigable and user friendly format is appreciated, as is the 87 minute long documentary. Luckily the documentary has some scenes of the movie presented in full-screen, so that was a relief.<p>All in all, this version of the DVD is not entirely satisfactory. In fact, after watching the movie on widescreen, I actually wondered if I should have bought this on VHS. And that really speaks volumes for the qaulity of this Disc. I fail to understand the multitude of reviewers who have heaped praise upon these two discs. To love the movie is one thing, but I do not believe that they love the way its been reproduced here. Highly disappointing, and not really recommended to DVD lovers who know their digital discs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I have been waiting for this for a long time. If you remember the 70mm 6  channel version w/intermission, don't expect that.  If you have an AC-3  system all you will get is 4 channel stereo and that's not all that good.  Also for some strange reason FOX doesn't seem to have any showmanship when  transferring this to DVD. What are the purpose of the &quot;still&quot;  during the entrance music to Act 2 ????  I was extremely disappointed by  the transfer. Of course the picture quality and of course the film itself  is outstanding. But for you sound buffs,,,,,,sorrrrry,,it's terrible.

Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness.  I think that movie falls someone in between.  The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a na?ve charm.  Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron.  The film is a tad long, but the film is perfect for family entertainment where kids will enjoy and most parents will also like it as well.  The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities.  The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise.</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>The breathtaking Alps, lakes and grassy slopes welcome you into the charming land of Austria. The wide open spaces give an instant sense of freedom. The scenes are set in Salzburg, Austria in the 30's.  Suddenly you will see a grassy slope and Maria (Julie Andrews) bursts onto the screen with her childlike joy and sweet innocent nature. Her soul lives to be free, her arms stretch out (as in the cover picture) as she swirls around singing as only a person who is a child at heart can. Suddenly she realizes she has wandered far, far away from the Abbey.  The nun's know Maria all too well and start a discussion about why they love her so much. "She's always late for everything except for every meal."  Maria seems to be fighting her innermost desire to be free and it is very apparent she is not well suited for the calling. Her Mother Superior sets her free to follow her heart by helping her to see the need to accept a position of Governess to "seven" children.<br /><br />"You have to live the life you were born to live." --Mother Superior<br /><br />Soon the children have learned to sing, frolic with life and completely exasperate their father who discourages any sign of fun. Once he leaves for a visit in Vienna, the children get to go on picnics, bike rides, train rides and other fun adventures. Laughter is in every scene and singing is the focus.<br /><br />When their father, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a lonely widower tries to introduce a haughty Baroness to them, they are not at all impressed. So the stage is set for humor, love, happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, deceit, romance and adventure. The chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reaches its height in a beautiful Austrian folk dance. The tension mounts and the Baroness appears.  She has truly evil intentions for Maria and the children, who she would just as well send off to boarding school.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie, life is pleasant and follows an upbeat theme. In the second half, you will have trouble not crying all the way to the end. Happiness can sometimes make you cry as well. You can literally feel the invincible human spirit rising in you as you celebrate the family's daring flight from Nazi rule. Only a true story could be this inspirational. I truly cannot watch this movie without wanting to sing along with at least half the songs. Julie Andrews voice is magical. If you appreciate impeccable acting, breathtaking scenery, and a feeling of true romance....call me sentimental, but you will love this movie. The only thing which saddens me is that some people are truly too jaded to appreciate the beauty in this movie. I guess I still have the child in me that wants to believe in a fairy tale, yet this was based on a true story, and perhaps real life is the best story of all.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This movie combined a very captivating and multi dimensional story . Indeed , this movie is much more than a simple love story , but it is much more than a sad chapter in the middle of the war . This film reached and developed its own profile due precisely its kinetic flexibility and brilliant engaging charm , keeping in mind several fundamental factors.<br /><br />Obviously the personal charisma of Julie Andrews who somehow was the british answer of the lovely Audrey Hepburn . Andrews owned her own charm : radiance , sweetness and beauty in the purest british mood .<br /><br />The absorbing and magnetic presence of Christopher Plummer , a very gifted actor who actually is giving a towering and recognized performance in Broadway .<br /><br />The rest of the cast was a goldness triumph . Who can forget those lovely kids ?<br /><br />The admirable direction and the spectacular landscapes were too undeniable elements who added its contribution for this eternal picture .<br /><br />A film to enjoy over and over again!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>There was really no need for another release, and I hope I'm not the only one who's getting sick of stupid re-releases of DVDs already out, with just one extra bit on them. It's not necessary. Apart from this, I've already seen a 15th anniversary edition of Pretty Woman, fabulous, unless you already own the 10th anniversary edition.<br /><br />Much as I love this film, if you already own the previous DVD, then there's no point buying this. If you haven't seen the film, or haven't bought the DVD already, maybe thinking about buying it for a member of your family, for Christmas, then sure, go for it.<br /><br />OK, there's a few more extras on this, than the previous release. On this one, you have: commentaries by director Robert Wise, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp; introduction by Julie Andrews on both discs; separate chapter list for songs only with Play All feature; English, French, and Spanish sing-a-long subtitles; A Few of My Favorite Things: A retrospective documentary; Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence; Charmian Carr on location with The Sound of Music from Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion; When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon; Biography: The Von Trapp Family--Harmony and Discord; Restoration comparison; storyboard gallery; behind-the-scenes stills; lobby cards and one-sheets; screen test: Mia Farrow; and Trailers and TV spots: Theatrical teaser, Theatrical trailer, 1st Anniversary trailer, Academy Award trailer, 1973 reissue trailer, testimonial trailer, TV trailer.<br /><br />On the old edition you have: Original 1965 documentary Salzburg Sight and Sound (14 minutes); making of documentary The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon with cast interviews, rare music outtakes, photos and more! (87 minutes); audio supplement by Ernest Lehman; audio Interviews with Julie Andrews and Robert Wise; DVD-ROM games and links to fan site; storyboards, sketches, production stills and theatrical trailers, radio and TV spots.<br /><br />OK, so there's more on the new release, but do you really want to pay for it, when you're probably not that interested in watching the extras? I wouldn't. And as for the singalong bit, with the words going across the bottom of the screen, if you've seen the film enough times, then you'll already know the words off by heart! Or is that just me!<br /><br />I suggest you only buy this if you haven't already got the DVD. If you have, there's really no point.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Unlike most people, I don't have lovely memories from my childhood related to The Sound of Music. My childhood was not filled with live-action musicals (only Disney animated ones) and I just recently discovered true gems like Mary Poppins, Singin' in the Rain, My Fair Lady, The Wizard of Oz and of course this film. I saw The Sound of Music a couple of years ago and while I love the music it did not resonate as much as for example Poppins did. A friend lent his copy and after the first time, I like it but I was not overly impressed with it. Repeat viewing increased my love for the film and while its not perfect (which film is?)is so a joy to watch that now is one of my all-time favorite musicals. R&H songs are one of the many highlights and after watching the film you can't help but sing the catchy wonderful songs from it. My personal favorites are "The Sound of Music", "Maria", "My Favorite Things", "Do-Re-Mi" and "The Lonely Goatherd". I just love the songs and the scenes in which they are played. Another highlight is the beautiful scenary of the entire film. From the beginning, your spirit is uplifted with wonderful shots of European mountains, the gorgeous city of Salzburg and more. It's pure joy!! Julie Andrews of course is the power that helps the film being as wonderful as it is. Just like in Mary Poppins, Andrews is perfect for the role and does it in a way that does not feel a stereotype. Maria is a full-fledged chararacter that we all can identify with.<br /><br />Add this an array of outstading supporting characters and you have a great film. Many have blamed the film of being too sugary but I think it perfectly balances all the elements and I think we have to thank that to the actors and director Robert Wise.<br /><br />As I said before, I had a borrowed copy of the film and just when I was about to buy the 40th anniversary edition DVD, I found out that Fox is releasing a new 45th edition and in Blu-Ray!! Of course that was the way to go.<br /><br />The Sound of Music comes to hi-def looking absolutely amazing. Fox must be and should be proud of the restoration efforts. The picture looks incredibly detailed and the colors are so vibrant that you can feel the rich European scenaries. All classic films should be restored this way because it looks absolutely fantastic. Likewise, the sound has a lavish new 7.1 DTS-HD sound that's completely gorgeous. You'll just experience the film like never before. Dialogue is cristal clear, the score is great and of course the songs are amazing. Impressive sound with impressive picture, What else can you ask?<br /><br />Well, if want more, Fox has designed a new "interactive" experience called "Your favorite things" where you can see the movie with PiP content, a karaoke track and a trivia quiz. Also you have the audio-commentaries form previous editions.<br /><br />In disc two, the bonus features are divided in "Musical Stages", "A City of Song", "Vintage Programs", "Rare Treasures" and "Publicity". The first two are completely new in HD and deal with the creation of the songs,R&H partnership, the restoraton of the film, the real Von Trapp family, the Broadway Musical, The producton of the film and the locations that were used in it. The others are carried overs form previous editions but that is great becuase we have a lot of documentaries, trailers, reminiscences and much, much more. I tell you, you will need a lot of time to dive into all this material but everything is fun, informative and make you appreciate the importance of the film.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this can be easily called THE definitive edition of The Sound of Music.<br /><br />The Sound of Music is one of the best musicals in the world, and one of the most (if not the most) beloved one. It's certainly one of my favorite things. With impressive picture and sound, and a wealth of excellent bonus material, Fox has created a edition that does the film justice. If you like TSOM, there is no reason why you should not get this edition. Absolutely recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>It's very hard to know where to begin when praising both this movie as well as the double "digi-pack" DVD of it. Julie Andrews gives a very strong performance as Maria, a misfit nun who is turned out into the world by the Reverand Mother to see if she really wants to be a nun. Her singing range of  4 octaves is beautifully displayed at the end of the song "Do-Re-Mi." Christopher Plummer is well cast as the Captain von Trapp who is not too likeable--yet is charmed into being a man again be Maria's infectious inner and outer beauty. The rest of the cast is well chosen and the viewer is treated to a rare screen performance by Marni Nixon; Marni dubbed vocals for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and she did dubbing for My Fair Lady and South Pacific as well. The second disc contains two fantastic documentaries about Salzburg, the city in Austria where many scenes were filmed, as well as the production and history of the film. The history of the real-life von Trapp family on whom the story is based is well laid out with revealing interviews from family members themselves. In addition, the cinematography is superlative. Very honestly, I cried at the end of the film and I NEVER cry--it's THAT touching! This is NOT a film to be sneered at as being sugary sweet. It's a classic tale of good triumphing over evil as the von Trapp family flees Austria to escape the Nazis.(...)</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>Why anyone would want to view this classic in full frame is beyond me.  Shot in Panavision 70, the glorious vistas of the Alps and Austrian countryside are breathtakingly captured.  And then, of course, there's Julie Andrews.  From her introduction, twirling about the tip of a hillside, to her whimsical "My Favorite Things" Ms. Andrews is one of the cinema's  great guilty pleasures, a wholesome, smart and funloving girl next door that anyone would be happy to have as either their mother or girlfriend - depending on one's age.<br />Fox previously issued this film as a "Five Star Edition".  Here, you don't get the fabulous extras, including a wonderful documentary on the history of the film and the Von Trapps.  But no matter which version you get, you can't escape the fact that this transfer, although better than the laserdisc or VHS versions previously issued, still has a long way to go to live up to the very best DVD transfers.  There is considerable digital noise in the backgrounds, some color smearing and a bit of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering to contend with.  Though it doesn't necessarily distract, it is present throughout and does draw attention to itself, particularly if you are viewing the film on a screen 32 inches or greater.  The soundtrack has been nicely restored though at moments it can have a strident sonic characteristic that is slightly grating. Overall, Fox needs to revisit this title with a new transfer.  Still, no one can deny that the hills will continue to be alive with the sounds of music for many, many years to come.</p></br></body></html>

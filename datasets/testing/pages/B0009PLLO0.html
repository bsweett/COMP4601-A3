The scenery is pretty and I was impressed by how many stars were used in filming.  My two biggest disappointments were: 1) the choppy nature of the film.  They tried to cram a LOT of information into a short time span.  The continual scene changes back and forth through history added to the choppyness.  And, 2) the directors failure to create a lead character (Alexander) that I could symphasize with.  I didn't actually like the character of Alexander and was unmoved when bad things happened to him.<br /><br />Taste is a difficult thing to get a handle on.  Another person might watch this film and want to add it to their collection, but it just didn't move me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone took on some Greek drama of his own when he made an epic on the life of Alexander the Great. Many Greeks I knew were annoyed at the historical inaccuracies. Nonetheless, Alexander was an icon in his time, and strategist supreme whose ability to win battles leading armies at a tender age were legend. It was as if the Greek God of War, Ares himself, had designated Alexander for a life of military glory. Much has been written on the Greek warrior and Stone does a decent job bringing a legend to life. Colin Farrell kind of pulls it off because he is close to Alexander's age during the time period of his best battles. Only Farrell, with his utter lack of discipline in real life, can't quite step into Alexander's shoes. Angelina Jolie is a riveting mother who seems to succeed only in fostering some subtle Oedipal complex in her son. And as for Alexander's father, he was never blind.<br /><br />There must be something to the age 26. Eva Peron likened herself to Alexander, and became the most powerful women in patriarchal Argentina at 26 only to also die at 33. A life lived like a fast fire who burned out rather than faded away.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned Alexander and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD.

Grady Harp, April 12</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone was not kidding when he mentioned that Alexander The Great's life might be too complicated for dramatization, which explains why it has taken the controversial director three seperate cuts to finally settle on a version of his "Alexander" that he claims he's comfortable with. "Alexander" still stands as one of the most curious flops of recent years. Its release was preceded by a whole year of hype and anticipation as Stone, the director of brilliant, engaging films like "JFK" and "Platoon," was setting his sights on ancient history, many suspected his decision to tackle Alexander's life and invasion of the East as a sort of statement on Bush's current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The production itself was an epic struggle, just read historian Robin Lane Fox's book "The Making Of Alexander" (Fox was also the film's historical consultant). When the film premiered in November 2004, it was immediately bashed and ridiculed as a bizarre, muddled homoerotic swords and sandles flick (although it was a hit overseas). Now after two DVD releases, including a Director's Cut that was shorter than the original, comes "Alexander Revisited," which is Stone's attempt at taking the movie and molding it into something more akin to the grand epics of old Hollywood, with modern sex and gore. The result is indeed a more focused, less confusing storyline on a grander scale. Stone has literally re-edited the movie, different takes are used, and certain scenes mixed around. Shots of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy speaking that were originally at the end of the movie are now at the beginning, and this time the movie skips over Alexander's youth at the beginning and uses the epic battle of Gaugamela as a springboard into the character's life. Some expanded material is a lot of fun to watch, especially the scene where Alexander (Colin Farrell) first sees the Bactrian princess Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dancing during a feast, here the scene is longer, with some great choreography. And yes, there is more sex and violence. The battle scenes include some wicked moments of gore, consider the battle in India where now we have a shot of an elephant's foot crashing down on a doomed Greek skull. Alexander's homosexual side is more evident here as well with new material between him and the Persian eunuch Bogoas. The film does still have some merits, especially the beautiful cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Babel, Frida), the music by Vangelis (Blade Runner), and some stunning production design and costume design credits. But no matter how much Stone slices and dices his movie, there some problems editing simply cannot fix, like performances. Colin Farrell is simply a bad Alexander, he does not have the drive, the brilliant madness, or captivating air for a Greek philosopher king who conquered the known world and spread Hellenism, and his balance of Alexander's strong warrior angle with his more tender, feminine character is unbalanced and makes for a performance that is sometimes puzzling, most times weird. Angelina Jolie is a good Olympias, she manages to bring fierce energy to her scenes with Farrell while Val Kilmer does a great King Philip (Alexander's father), Anthony Hopkins as always is notable eventhough he just walks around and narrates. But the movie still suffers from a confusion of what it wants to say, or WHAT it wants to say. Most of the story is still told through voice-over work, and we never get a good look or sense of what exactly Alexander was doing or achieving as he raided all these countries. We know he spread Hellenism and Greek culture, because we read it during history class in high school, but Stone never SHOWS it, instead we get scenes of argument and dialogue that can lead nowhere. The movie can chug along at moments, and great characters like Roxane are wasted and never used as they should. Jared Leto is also a terrible Hephaiston and his over-done use of eye-liner is peculiar. In the end, "Alexander Revisited" is an interesting study in the re-editing and assembly of a feature film, but it also shows that there are certain things you simply cannot fix in the editing lab.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Few films have garnered the criticism as the theatrical release of the much maligned ALEXANDER and that fact always stirs the curiosity cauldron - in this case, so much so that Oliver Stone decided to re-edit and re-compose the original version into this Director's Cut DVD.

Warner Brothers had assembled some of my favorite actors and actresses to star in this biographical epic, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, not to mention my growing fondness for Rosario Dawson, Colin Farrell and Jared Leto. Add to that the fact that Oliver Stone was the director really peaked my interest. You see, I'm a big fan of Oliver Stones' work in 'The Doors' film and I was hoping he would develop the storyline of 'Alexander' along the same mystical, shamanic stream as he did with Jim Morrison. He didn't.<br /><br />What fascinates me the most about the larger-than-life figure of Alexander the Great was not his great victories in battle, nor his political genius as demonstrated in the consolidation of nations under Greek rule. The Alexander I had hoped to see explored by Oliver Stone was Alexander the 'Divine.' I wanted to witness his triumphful entry into Alexandria and Cairo to the cheering throngs proclaiming him the "Sun God." I longed to enter into the inner recesses of the great pyramid of Cheops with him for his nocturnal vigil in the 'Kings' Chamber' and explore the visions and revelations that unfolded on that historic night.<br /><br />Incredibly none of this was included, his campaign in Egypt received only a brief mention by Anthony Hopkins as part of an intermitent narration of events provided by the director to fill in the blanks. That's some blank as far as I'm concerned! The only mystical aspects included was the occasional appearance of an eagle flying overhead, leading him forward to new lands and new people and it's visit to his Mother in the end announcing his death.<br /><br />We all have our own subjective expectations, this one didn't meet mine. That said, I must admit that I'm probably rating this film - One Star - lower than it actually deserves. I think I'm judging it more by what I wanted to see included and wasn't, than commenting on what was actually in the film. Be that as it may, I guess that's the reviewers perogative.<br /><br />The final and ultimate test for any movie is the 'repeatability factor.' Can I watch it over and over again? With 'Alexander' the answer is unfortunately NO.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>For those who did enjoy Oliver Stone's Alexander (I, for the record was not one of them), be warned that this is probably one of the few times in the history of Director's Cuts that the film is cut down from the Theatrical cut.  Due to what Oliver Stone perceived as America's disinterest in this movie based on the bisexual themes involved, the Director's Cut is devoid of many, if not all, references to this.  If you are a fan of the movie, make sure you know this prior to purchasing.  Personally, I think it's a bit shady of them to release a Director's Cut when the moniker is usually used for movies that had scenes cut from the theatrical version restored.<br /><br />Also, in reference to the two DVD editions.  This edition is on one disc.  For the theatrical cut, I suppose because it's less than 10 minutes longer, is on two discs for the movie itself.<br /><br />About the movie, though.  I guess this movie has been deeply polarizing for audience members.  I'm not sure if its because of the bisexual themes or if its because it just wasn't a good movie.  I notice people defending the film talk about the subtle nuances that Oliver Stone employed in his story.  I noticed these as well, and I applaud some of his use not only of symbolism but also imagery for a concrete reason.  However, subtle nuances and symbolism alone does not a good movie make.  Nor does it make a good epic necessarily.<br /><br />When I saw this movie in the theatre, I noticed a few people leave pretty much as soon as any bisexual themes were hinted at.  The bisexual themes did not bother me in the least.  I want to get that out of the way so that I'm not immediately discounted.  I was completely aware (as I assumed most people were) that it is generally known that Alexander had feelings for his friend Hephastos.  In every single history class from junior high to College had made that pretty clear, either overtly or subtly.  If you are going to make a movie about this situation, however, you have to do it carefully.  Not only because of the apparent tumultous culture we live in today, but also because it can come across as silly.<br /><br />In Alexander, this is exactly what happened.  Instead of seriously examining these issues, which would have made a very interesting to watch character in Alexander, Oliver Stone made a melodrama.  He turned Alexander into an angsty teen who bats his eyes while looking at Hephastos longingly behind locks of silly hair.  There's no emotion there besides soap opera melodrama.  Honestly, if you replaced the fact that Alexander was fawning over a female instead of Hephastos, I would still have this reaction.  It was executed very poorly.  And not only that, but seemed to be tacked on as if to make a comment and nothing more.<br /><br />But its not only this that warrants my bad review.  The silliness did not stop with the love triangle.  First off, casting a woman a year older than Colin Farrel to play his mother is just odd.  Not only that, but to give her such a horribly done slavish/Transylvanian accent just undermined any sort of seriousness.  Then there's everyone else's accents that seem to change as the movie progresses.  For an epic movie, the battles are very important and the battles here were filmed so haphazardly and chaotically that yes it probably was a good representation of war, but as a movie it just doesn't work.  How can you root for the good side when you can't tell who is winning because everyone looks the same?  The movie began on a rocky start (Val Kilmer as the father figure was just as ham-handed as anything else) and only went down hill from there.  I'll admit, the first maybe half of the movie was vaguely intersting if melodramatic.  But when Alexander reaches India, things just spiraled into boredom.  My group was checking their watches, wishing for it to be over.<br /><br />My gripe, then, is a more moderate one.  I don't care what the film is about.  But it was not done well.  It was boring, and for an epic film that is the one thing it shouldn't be.  For a movie to hold your attention for 3 hours or more it has to be exciting.  Alexander failed in this, as it also did in exploring his relationship with Hephastos and his wife.  It seemed hacked on as if for the only reason than a political one to say, hey look Alexander had feelings for his male friend.  In the end, a boring and melodramatic movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>This Director's Cut DVD rates its three stars because Oliver Stone is incapable of being non-controversial, it's an epic view of an epic life, it's a full nine minutes shorter than the original (truly), and because so many wrong-headed reviews have appeared here and elsewhere that it qualifies as victim or  underdog, either of which earns some sympathy. Otherwise, "Alexander" might be starless, not for its askewed history or card-shuffle editing but for the wasted opportunity it represents.<br /><br />Baz Lurhman, the Austrailan director, is planning his own take on Alexander with Leonardo DiCaprio. It can only be better. Last year's "Troy," for that matter, was better, even though it turned the legendary anger of Achilles into petulance and his male lover into a cousin (Stone gets credit for not dodging that issue.)<br /><br />Colin Farrell as Alexander and Angelina Jolie as his scheming mother are pretty but clearly miscast. Val Kilmer fares better as his rabid father but the script undermines him, as it does everyone. Robin Lane Fox, the definitive biographer of Alexander, was a consultant, but Stone must have stoned him. Two combat sequences, one featuring an eagle's overview and the other costumed elephants, are edited so ineptly it's hard to know what's happening, which doesn't much matter because Alexander never lost a battle. Anthony Hopkins' on and off-screen narration throughout helps somewhat.<br /><br />For this two-disc DVD, Stone says he cut some of the "gayness" over which critics and homophobes have chortled. In fact, in his original there was nothing overt, just the suggestion that Alexander was bisexual, as was customary at the time. Even that little was too much for some; others complained it wasn't enough. Unless you show naked people fornicating, filmmakers are accused of avoiding human sexuality. Cameras used to pan away and scenes dissolve after the first kiss. Not any more; today the actors are just getting started.<br /><br />Subtlety is usually a stranger to Stone, but the very idiosyncracies that favor this director go against him here. Farrell and his pals have lilting Irish accents, Jolie utters (there's no other word for her speech) an ersatz Balkan, Kilmer barks Americanese, and everyone else speaks brittle British. When Alexander enters Babylon, you half expect to encounter the Tower of Babel.<br /><br />What could this bold and, yes, exciting director have been thinking to tackle a subject of such complexity and magnitude? Ancient history is far from the contemporary terrain he walks so well ("Wall Street," "JFK," the Vietnam trilogy). Stone is never going to conquer his known world if he spears another spectacular dud like this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This movie bored me and my father to tears. We both love history and movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but this movie was simply weird and boring. Colin Farrel tried his best, but I think most people left the theater (and many left early) without truly appreciating what Alexander accomplished and who he was as a leader. To tell you the truth I enjoyed the three hour HIS channel documentary on Alexander more than this. Like I said in my title, I rarely ever dislike a movie enough to give it only 1 star, but this movie has earned the honor of the worst film of the year in my opinion. I had been looking forward to this film since I first heard of it over a year ago and I even ignored the 100+ negative reviews by critics online, but I still didn't like it one bit. The jerky camera during the only two battles in the film didn't help either. Way too much talking and very little action for a guy who conquered 16 countries and 90% of the known world. Save you $10.00, and don't say I didn't warn you!</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The theatrical version of Alexander is not the total disaster it's been painted, more an interesting failure with moments that aspire to greatness nestled amid others that look too much like a Hallmark miniseries for comfort. Unfortunately, it lacks a particularly good script: indeed, where there's overlap between them, Robert Rossen's somewhat underfunded 1955 film dealt with key events much more dramatically and without recoursing to excessive narration to fill in the gaps. What it lacks even more is a real star as Alexander, a part that requires either great screen presence or a great actor. Sadly the blandly inoffensive Colin Farrell is neither. He tries hard (which is much more than can be said for Clive Owen in King Arthur) and he's almost convincing in the two action scenes, but he never sells you as an extraordinary man people will follow across the known world.<br /><br />And then, of course, there's the supporting cast, Val Kilmer occasionally channelling Robert Newton's Long John Silver, Angelina Jolie coming across like Irene Papas on steroids (not to mention with added collagen) and Anthony Hopkins looking for another bit of scenery to chew on. (On a purely trivial note it's strange to note how much Rory McCann looks like either a young Sean Connery or a middle-aged Victor Argo depending on what angle he's photographed from.) Although there's a method to his madness, it's hard not to think Stone is taking the Mick with all the Celtic accents and at times its surprisingly difficult to decipher what is being said, more because of mumbling and slurred pronunciation than the regional dialect, to be fair.<br /><br />There's intelligence at work here, as witnessed by the cave scene where the terrible price of greatness among the mythological heroes Alexander idolises is outlined, but often more in intent than execution. When it does work, it works well - the bloody battle of Guagamela seen intermittently from an eagle's eye view, the scenes in a gorgeously realized Babylon - but all too often there's too little of what made Alexander great. Indeed, there's too little of everything despite its running time. Relationships aren't convincingly sketched out and the big dramatic scenes are clumsily executed and emotionally uninvolving: his scenes with his mother or the fatal argument with Cleitus just show up the inadequacies of the cast and lack power or focus. Stone's tendency to idealize Alexander doesn't help, even if his script acknowledges the fact. For all his talk of being driven by a dream, it's never really communicated what that dream was beyond a desire for personal glory and a place among the immortals, nor does he deal with the fact that Alexander left no legacy but chaos. As a result, the last hour, when things start to go bad for Al, gets duller than it needs to be. Still, Vangelis' score is excellent<br /><br />It's strange that so many American critics focused on the bisexuality: in truth, it's one of the LEAST gay sword-and-sandals epics, simply avoiding all the euphemisms to deal with it head-on. That said, I could have done without Farrell flittering his eyelids like a little girl ever time he's with Hephaistion.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Everytime an idea hits big, studios race to imitate that concept until they grind that trend into the ground...<br /><br />It seems in the past 2 years there have been a flurry of films trying to reproduce the feel and success of Braveheart and Gladiator.<br /><br />Each have failed and been worse than the one before it.<br /><br />We have had Troy, several other forgettable ones that escape me now and here we have Alexander.<br /><br />This film should ring the deathbell for "Sword and Sandle" movies for awhile.<br /><br />I won't repeat what others have said here, but all I can add is that after watching this for 3 hours with friends.... when it was over we all looked at each other and commented...........<br /><br />"That was painful to watch wasn't it".<br /><br />To which the reply was.... "Oh I thought I was the only one that felt that way, if I knew you guys had the same feeling I would have suggested ejecting the DVD 2 hours ago !"<br /><br />Definatley not a movie that draws you in.<br /><br />When you see a great well done movie, you can almost forget for awhile you are watching a movie with actors playing a part and feel what you are seeing is real............ but with Alexander you FEEL like you are watching Colin Farrell play the part of a historic figure and in fact the whole film feels strained and forced like it just never got itself together.<br /><br />It's obvious alot of work and effort went into this film and for this I feel sorry for alot of the folks in it, because for all that effort it still falls flat and will probably be remembered as a cinematic failure.<br /><br />Unless you are an absolute fan of the historical figure Alexander, steer clear of this film.<br /><br />In fact even if you are a big fan of Alexander the Great, you make wish to steer clear of this film as it tends to highlight his faults, failures and weakneses over his strengths and actually diminishes his historical significance to the point of making him appear irrelevent.<br /><br />Usually in a historical film like this you get MORE interested in the focal character and afterwards want to go out and buy a book or find more information about them........ with Alexander,during the last 45 minutes of the film my wife and I were whispering to each other....... "Die already"<br /><br />Afterwards our friends admitted they were thinking the same thing to themselves.<br /><br />One of my friends who is not very historically knowledgable asked me afterwards.... "Hey Mike, why is he called Alexander the Great anyway ? Unless they skipped over it in this film, he really didn't accomplish much afterall did he except run his people ragged on some warped vision he had ?"<br /><br />Not the effect I imagine the producers and director were going for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>It is too many years since I last read a detailed biography of Alexander for knowledge of the reality (as best we can know it) to have anything to do with my enjoyment of the film. In most cases, it takes pretty much the standard epic biography line, with the addition of the bi-sexuality that C.B. DeMille would never have been permitted to show, much as he would have liked to do so, if it were possible under Hayes Office rules. The Oedipal situation is also given more overt presence than would have passed the censors in the heyday of Biblical (and other historical) epics. On the positive side, the battle scenes were well done cinematically, with the use of elephants being particularly striking. (I believe the disciplined formations of elephants shown in the film is historically inaccurate, the elephant proving to have too unruly in combat to be an effective weapon). I have no complaint about historical inaccuracies when it comes to entertainment vehicles.<br />While the director makes a good faith effort to account for the driving ambition in a man seeking to conquer the known universe (as  portrayed in the film) I could not help but feel that the motivations of so complex a many are nearly impossible to capture in a period more than a millennium past. However, the director does a good job of delineating a motivational base adequate to the needs of the film.<br />Most of the actors filled their roles adequately, historical drama being a notorious burial ground for even the best of actors. The lead showed too little charisma, no personal fault involved,  this being a mostccomplicated man he had to play. Mostly, when an actor failed, it appeared to have been a consequence of the script.<br />So, over-all I did not find this to be a particularly exciting film, but it was interesting. Hopefully, both I and other readers, will be stimulated to learn more about this towering historical figure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>The first time I watched this movie was a few days ago.

There are three versions of this film, and each should have a separate set of reviews. Come on, Amazon. Is it so difficult to do this? This is a review of the Blu-ray "Alexander Revisited".<br /><br />The original cut of "Alexander" was controversial for a single reason... Oliver Stone refused to hide the fact that homosexual behavior was common among the Greeks (usually an older man with a younger). * It's okay to show people having their guts ripped out, but don't you dare show two intimate friends (Alexander and Hephaestion) pledging their life-long loyalty, or a man kissing a eunuch (Bagoas), then having sex with him. And although there are several stories about why Philip was murdered, Stone uses the one in which a young man, a member of his bodyguard and Philip's occasional lover, ** takes revenge when Philip fails to do anything about the young man's rape by other men.<br /><br />There is also a scene in which the young Alexander is told by Aristotle that women aren't worth loving, and that sex between men -- if it is not simply out of lust, but for the purpose of character development -- is a worthy thing. That must have gotten a lot of viewers' whities tightened.<br /><br />The real problems with "Alexander" stem from Stone's desire to present a drama, not just an historical epic. Though ancient writers reported Alexander's personality as a mixture of great ambition, high intelligence, and a sometimes uncontrollable rashness, Stone fails to present these in any coherent fashion. Alexander is portrayed as torn between love for Philip (who alternates between love and a refusal to acknowledge him as heir (whether because he believes the child a bastard, or he didn't want a half-Macedonian heir from Olympias, isnt clear)), and his mother, who's constantly pressing him to Do Great Things.<br /><br />The biggest failing of the script, however, is providing a clear reason for Alexander's heavy drinking and "seduction" by Eastern culture. The result is that a film that's supposed to illuminate one of the most-important people in history leaves us with more questions than we started with.<br /><br />An even bigger failing is Stone's disastrous casting of Colin Farrell -- who badly wanted to play the part -- as Alexander. Whatever one might think of Farrell's thespic skills, he is in totally over his head. (The blonde wig -- why is Alexander always portrayed as blonde? It looks stupid. -- doesn't help.)<br /><br />There is no question about Alexander's charisma. (He would have /had/ to been charismatic to command the loyalty of so many men for so long, especially as he shaved his beard, a no-no among Greek males. ***) Farrell gets this very well. It's the subtle moments that don't come off.<br /><br />Whenever he's disturbed or unhappy or confused, his face takes on the same sappy expression, shaking and twitching to no particular end, other than demonstrating that he can over-emote. The scenes in which he confronts his mother range from incompetent to embarrassing.<br /><br />The scene in which he bids farewell to the dying Hephaestion is particularly bad. It's perfectly fine for Alexander to cry as he tries to comfort the person he best loves, but Farrell shows an unmanly lack of control. And the little speech in which he tells Hephaestion of all the wonderful things that remain to be done, as he looks out to the world, should have been something quite grand, quite stirring, but Farrell doesn't get much further than reading the lines.<br /><br />Farrell is the right physical age for Alexander, but not the right emotional age. I remember a hetero guy in college -- not even 20 -- telling me how, when his best friend had died, he had cried himself to sleep for a month. Colin Farrell has either never experienced anything like this, or if he has, cannot convey it in his acting. He fails to bring those elements that would have at least partly compensated for the script's omissions.<br /><br />Ultimately, an actor's failure can and should be blamed on the director, especially when the director does the casting. For a director such as Oliver Stone, who commands the complexities of such a huge film so effortlessly, this failure is remarkable. How he could have shot himself in the foot is hard to understand.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Alexander Revisited" is worth seeing, especially for the generally good script and fine performances from almost everyone but Farrell. (I had some initial problems with Val Kilmer as Philip, as we usually associate Kilmer with youthful roles, but it's an okay performance.)<br /><br />Visually, "Alexander Revisited" is stunning. I've seen the DVD on a 36" flat-face Sony, and this Blu-ray on a 60" Kuro, and there is no comparison whatever. It's one of those rare films -- such as "Lawrence of Arabia" or "2001" -- that do not come across well on anything less than a large display.<br /><br />* Contrast "Troy", in which Patroclus was turned from Achilles' younger-warrior-lover -- into his cousin! Good grief.<br /><br />** The question of whether Philip had sexual relations with adult men -- uncommon in the Greek world -- is an interesting one. As his bodyguards would presumably have been old enough to be bearded, having sex with one of them would have been considered a bit odd -- though the rest of the Greek world viewed Macedonians as kinda strange, one contemporary writer stating that Macedonian men would freely allow other men to mount them. Stone shows bearded men who are roughly Philip's contemporaries hugging him and wrapping their arms around his shoulders, familiarities it seems odd for a king to permit. I presume Stone's implication is that these are men Philip is or was having sexual relations with.<br /><br />*** Though he supposedly had a scanty beard, this is likely because he wanted to preserve the illusion -- at least for Hephaesition -- that he remained a "beardless youth". This, in turn, suggests other things I won't go into.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Director Oliver Stone's film version of the life of Alexander the Great, came out to dismal reviews and worse box office. There were controversies over its portrayal of the bisexuality of its protagonist, as well as the poor screenplay, stilted dialogue, and many other things.... We get the requisite battles, the CGI armies of huge hordes, but Stone's camera work is not what it was a decade or more ago. There is very little that sets this apart as an Oliver Stone film. It's a generic pseudo-epic that makes the great epics, like Spartacus, or Lawrence Of Arabia, seem that much greater. I guess there's just a simple lack of passion in the whole endeavor. What saves the film from being total trash, however, is Val Kilmer's relationship with Alexander- mostly as a boy (Connor Paolo), but also with the older Farrell. Kilmer's best moment comes when he demands buying a horse at half price if Alexander can tame it. The son, of course, tames it, in generic rite of passage form, but the key that makes this otherwise trite scene work is how Philip will to risk his son's life merely for a bargain. It shows why the two men will bond, but never be truly close.... In short, Alexander fails not for many of the reasons the major critics roasted it (although to be fair, I don't know just how different the filmic and DVD versions are) but because it has too much breadth, and not enough depth. Accordingly- while not terrible, it's not great. Flip a coin over whether it's passable and either way you're probably right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I thought Oliver Stone's "Alexander" went off the tracks when we suddenly cut from Alexander (Collin Farrell) as a young man butting heads with his father, King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), to Alexander as King about to fight the army of the Persian ruler Darius at the Battle of Issus.  I thought this was because since Alexander has the known world to conquerer in the 2 hours and 55 minutes of the director's cut that Stone was simply moving on to the good stuff.  But instead of simply doing a cinematic tour of the highlights of the life of Alexander the Great, Stone develops parallel stories.  In the "present" we have Alexander conquering the world while trying to juggle his relationships with Roxanne (Rosario Dawson), the woman he chooses to marry, and his particular friend Hephaistion (Jared Leto), while in the past Alexander has to grow up with a dominating mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and a disinterested father.  Actually, his mother insists he is the son of Zeus and not Philip, which explains why the king has picked a new queen and ignores Alexander.<br /><br />Stone's purpose clearly seems to be that he wants to explore "why" Alexander did what he did.  The problem is that the film suggests it has something to do with his relationship with his parents, but how their treatment of him resulted in a young man audacious and brilliant enough to conquer the world is not clear.  The pivotal scene in the film becomes when Alexander insists that he can ride the great horse Bucephalus.  The young Alexander succeeds, just as the older one would conquer the world, but the reason for both remains what it was before the film started.  Alexander succeeds because he is Alexander the Great.  The movie is not advancing our understanding of the man the way that it should.  His parents seem to be teaching him valuable lessons only by negation and if Olympias insists Alexander is not the son of Philip, then Philip is even more blind than he usually is if he does not see that Alexander is not like his mother either.  The success of "Alexander" rests entirely on its ability to explain his motivation, and only in too brief scenes involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer), does it get close to the start of something that makes sense to me in that regard.<br /><br />"How" Alexander conquered the world is left mostly to the voice over narration of Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), now the Egyptian Pharaoh, with the exception of film's two battle sequences, the Battle of Issus and the Battle of the Hydaspes River in India.  These two battles represent his greatest victory and greatest, or at least final, defeat.  From a tactical standpoint the latter is the more interesting battle (especially all of the feints and psychological tactics Alexander employed before hand), but Stone only seeks to explain the former.  However, this is problematic because the battle was being fought on a desert plain devoid of physical detail, which makes it hard to appreciate what is going on the way we have in movies detailing battles like Waterloo or Gettysburg.  Of course, if the emphasis in the film is on "why" then the "how" becomes less important, which is why it is dealt with the way it is in this 2004 film.<br /><br />The production design of the film handles the "where" and "when" of Alexander's life quite well, especially in the depiction of Babylon and some of the gorgeous costumes.  I have no problem with the casting, but I think all of the key principles tend to get too emotional too often, which also works against developing an acceptable "why" to Alexander's life.  We do get a sense of Alexander being ahead of his time in terms of how he treats those he has conquered (anticipation the Roman willingness to bring new peoples into their Empire), but by the time we get to the last acts of the film the quest of "why" he did what he did is complicated by trying to also cover why things fell apart, and we have as sketchy an idea of that in the end as we do the other.  There is a suggestion that Alexander overreached his bounds when he crossed into the Indian subcontinent and the film's most noteworthy cinematic moment creates his literal fall.  But then we are left with the simplistic notion that things fell apart because Alexander died, which means "Alexander" the film has not brought us any further understanding of the man than we had before we sat down to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The true story of one of history's most luminous and influential leaders, Alexander the Great-?"a man who had conquered 90% of the known world by the age of twenty-seven. Alexander led his virtually invincible Greek and Macedonian armies through 22,000 miles of sieges and conquests in just eight years, and by the time of his death at the age of thiry-two had forged an empire unlike any the world had ever seen. The story chronicles Alexander's path to becoming a living legend, from a youth fueled by dreams of myth, glory and adventure to his lonely death as a ruler of a vast Empire. Alexander is the incredible story of a life that united the Known World and proved, if nothing else, fortune favors the bold. The most interesting issues in the movie lay with Alexander's personality. Expect some surprises. After all, he was real. And his story lives on.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>No one I know likes this film. With good reason. Colin Farrell as Alexander is a hopelessly miscast neurotic imbecile. Nothing like the vicious and virtuous and God-like ambitious Alexander the Great. $300. Is that what this mess really cost? No, when these types of big budget movies work, like Gladiator, they are great. When they fail, they leave one almighty trail of waste that leaves the viewer thinking - why?<br /><br />Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother! Give us a break - she looks younger than he does in the film.<br /><br />An overblown campfest that leaves a very poor taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I like Oliver Stone's films, and reviews of this film lead me to believe that this film would suck, although some claimed it's actually a good film and is underrated. From what I read on the "Alexander" IMDB boards, more people prefer the director's cut of the movie rather than the theatrical cut (and that's usually the case). Apparently, the DC is somewhat like the TC, except that it's eight minutes shorter, and switches scenes around to "help the story flow better". Hmm. So I thought to myself: "I do like Oliver Stone's films (my favorite being JFK), and he really hasn't let me down yet". IMDB's rating for Alexander is 5.5, but then again, I don't really trust IMDB's ratings, due to the fact that most users either vote a 1 or a 10, which explains how the Lord of the Rings trilogy is on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time list. I read RT, and they give Alexander a 14%, but then again, they allow anyone with a website to comment on movies. I also read that this is one film where you definitely WANT to ignore the critics on.<br /><br />WELL, I finally decided to give this film a chance, and rented this film (the director's cut version) last night. This movie was much better than the reviews I've read and heard said it would be. The action was completely believable. The effects were phenomenal during the battle scenes. As for historical epics, this movie was not as good as Gladiator or Braveheart, of course, but I still enjoyed this film. Overall, probably the most underrated film of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>I must confess at the outset that I am picky with most historical films; being an historian of sorts, it bothers me when the story deviates too far from the historical record.  Given that the character of Ptolemy (played by the always-good Anthony Hopkins) speaks at length in the prologue and epilogue about stripping away the myth and leaving the true tale of the man, this cannot but set up a bit of disappointment.  Ultimately, it wasn't so much disappointment as a lack of satisfaction, on several fronts.<br /><br />Before I go much further, I must say that I found the film to be good on the whole.  I would probably grade it overall a 'B'; the acting for the most part would be a little less than this, and the effects a bit more (particularly the battle scenes, which for computer-generation, were very well done, especially the battle at Gaugamela, and the battle near the Ganges).  The music, done by Vangelis (think 'Chariots of Fire'), was superb.  As entertainment, the film was a good evening's outing, and I didn't find myself squirming in my seat as much as I thought I might at the prospect of a three-hour film.  The computer-generated scenes in Babylon, and the on-location settings of Morocco and Thailand were glorious cinematography.<br /><br />The character of Alexander in history is one of mythology, one that was so powerful that it inspired the Roman leaders from Julius Caesar forward to global conquest (an irony of history is that the Roman Empire, which supposedly covered the 'known world', didn't cover half of Alexander's empire).  Colin Farrell's performance here was not one that is inspiring; his speeches to the troops lack the kind of power that an Olivier or Brannagh might have in a performance of Henry V -- yet this is precisely what was needed.  Alexander is a man who inspired tens of thousands of men to follow him beyond the ends of the known world, but that doesn't quite come across on the film.  We don't get the power of Alexander's personality either at Gaugamela or at the Ganges.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is lovely as ever, but her part as an abused woman who uses quasi-supernatural sorcery to bring about her ends (Alexander's rise to the throne) is melodramatic -- one gets the sense that this might have been the writing or directing as much as it was Jolie's own performance.  As Olympias, Alexander's mother, she seems a bit too young (Jolie is probably better cast as Farrell's love interest, rather than his matron figure).  The other women in Alexander's life are portrayed as rather flat characters too, even the high-spirited Asian tribeswoman he takes as a wife.<br /><br />There's lots of innuendo, but not much sexual content here.  Philip of Macedon, Alexander's father (played by a barely recognisable Val Kilmer), has an almost-rape scene with Olympias, while the boy Alexander watches from behind the bedding; Alexander almost repeats this scene at one point, and has an interesting wedding night with his Asian bride, but nothing ever really seems consummated;  Alexander's affections for many of his male friends is a bit overplayed in some respects, and greatly wanting in others.  Again there is a lack of satisfaction all around.<br /><br />This is a very different film for Oliver Stone.  Perhaps one constant theme (given that Alexander's decision to stop going forward toward the East comes after a terrible battle in which his force loses) Stone seems to work into everything is that there is no way to win a war in Southeast Asia, even back in Alexander's time.  There are hints at a political agenda here as well -- Alexander is constantly praised, and constantly praising himself, for not asking others to do in battle what he himself wouldn't do.  Is this an indirect slap at the current administration?  With Oliver Stone, one never knows.<br /><br />There are a few interesting cameos -- Christopher Plummer plays the philosopher Aristotle, recruited to teach the young Alexander, and who despite being on screen but a few minutes at the beginning of the tale is referred to again and again.  Brian Blessed has an even smaller role, essentially just to walk on and separate two wrestlers, telling the child Alexander that he must win on his own merits.  For this thirty-second scene, Blessed received a primary credit in the film!  Good work if you can get it.<br /><br />Costuming was great, very appropriate to the time, and resisting temptation to add modernisations to all the outfits.  The choreography for the battle scenes, both computer-generated and real-life stunts, were well played.  The battle against the Persian king Darius was in real-life the last battle in which the chariot played a major offensive function, due to tactics developed by Philip and Alexander's Greek armies which are displayed in the goings on here.<br /><br />Thus, this is a hard film to categorise.  Good in parts, and not so hot in others, it is still well worth seeing.  The history doesn't deviate too far from the known path to be too distracting, and the film, while not quite living up to its larger-than-life subject, does provide some entertainment.  Some judicious editing might make it a bit more palatable.  I'd give it three-and-a-half stars, were such permitted.  As it is, I'll round up to four.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone is one of the most controversial filmakers of our time right up there with Martin Scorsesse,making such classics as JFK,the best picture Platoon and Born On The Fourth<br /><br />Of July.But whatever was made up in his mind to do this bitch of<br /><br />a mess god only knows perhaps he was drunk or perhaps he really<br /><br />wanted to try at this story of the Macedon King Alexander who<br /><br />at a young age of only 32 years conqured most of the known world.<br /><br />  First Of all the writing is terrible who the heck came up with some of these lines , there absolutely laughable and not<br /><br />even the slightest bit convincing.When Alexander and his lover<br /><br />Hephieston hug each other alexanders newfound wife who is played<br /><br />by Rosario Dawson says "You Love Heeeeem".In a scene between<br /><br />Alexander and Olympius when Olympius belittles her son and<br /><br />spits in his face she says " What did i ever do to make you hate me so".The acting speaks for itself Colin Farell is somewhat<br /><br />convincing as Alexander but the cheezy wig is not,everyone<br /><br />seem to have an accent of there own Angelina Jolies is the<br /><br />worst who sounds as if she is in transelvania.<br /><br />  Anthony Hopkins as Ptolomey gives a voice to Alexanders life<br /><br />but the film really never mentions much of anything about his life that makes the movie pleasent to watch.In the first two minutes you could care less about any of the chrachters<br /><br />because the acting is so downright awful.Two key battle scenes<br /><br />that Stone gives us Alexanders war against the Persian empire<br /><br />at Gaugamela where fights some 250,000 Persians,a battle that could have topped Return Of The King but didn't even touch it<br /><br />as no war scene in the history of film might ever.And one of<br /><br />Alexanders strangest battles in India where the Indian calvary<br /><br />used Elephants , worst of all is that these war scenes still<br /><br />don't make up for the mess that this movie is.But what destroys<br /><br />Alexanders chrachter is his crying in every scene for a mighty king he seem more<br /><br />of a panzy and less of a ruler of the known world.<br /><br />  It is almost impossible for me to buy that Oliver Stone did this excrutiating dull three hour mess, when compared to early<br /><br />2004's Troy Alexander makes Troy look like an Academy Award<br /><br />winning film and makes Gladiator look like Citizen Kane but he<br /><br />really messed the hole movie up by the editing because the movie<br /><br />just dosent make any sense at all on rotten tomatoes.com the<br /><br />reviews are humorious and laughable and barely anybody gave it<br /><br />a good review folks I think we have our razzie winner for the year because the razzies will eat this film alive and for this mess Oliver Stone deserves any type of review or hedious awards<br /><br />he will get he should be a man and just live with it.The Worst<br /><br />film i've seen of 2004 period laughably pathetic.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>... other than do to homophobia!

Half of the scenes work, half don't, no two people would probably agree on which, and that's not  to say it's unwatchable. It's a $150 millon bloated epic, with passion and philosophy "Troy" and "Gladiator" never attended to. Stone quite clearly aimed for a modern "Lawrence of Arabia." He failed. But it's a worthy error.<br /><br />Alexander The Great, the Macedonian/Greek conquerer, took kingship after the murder of his father Philip, claimed all of Persia at 25, ruled in the hanging gardens of Babylon, and stretched his empire 10,000 milles to India. He never lost a military battle. He was most likely poisoned by some of his closest advisors who had been denied their return home after seven years and 50 small wars. He died at 32.<br /><br />The outline is important because, for one, Stone employs a narrator in Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to tell us these things, and he has to fill in the rest of the blanks and dramatize certain relationships, such as that between the adult Alexander (Colin Ferrell) and his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed her son was not borne of King Philip (Val Kilmer) but Zeus himself. Olympias is presented as a Lady MacBeth with a Russian accent and a inferiority complex; we get the sense, really, that she would have preferred to have been born a man and king herself. Philip is a drunk and a lout, but beloved by his army. Driven by vengeance and bloodlust and not destiny, there is a gulf between he and Alexander, between a professional and a prodigy.<br /><br />In Alexander, Stone creates an arrogant, passionate, insecure man, given to fits and bawling, shows of affection and cruelty, greatness and shame. Stone admits Alexander's pansexualism - he "loved" boyhood friend Hephiaston (Jared Leto), Asian bride Roxanna (Rosario Dawson) and a eunuch - but does not push it. Most of all, Stone insists on Alexander's ambition to explore and push farther from home and the known world, for reasons he never quite reveals, although he is haunted by his mother's taunts, and his father's legacy.<br /><br />Because "Alexander" genuinely means to say something about the commonality of man vs. our tendencies to side with like skin and dialect, it's a very talky, stagelike film - long speeches, a couple roundtable sequences. Stone gives us two battles - the second of which, in India, belongs in any conversation about great war scenes - elephants, natives emerging in the jungle, and a dramatic color shift. The first battle at Gaugamela, for Persia, is confusing, muddled game capture the flag, an ancient "Blitz to Baghdad," if you will. Like our three-week campaign Iraq, this strategy eventually fuels a long-running argument between Alexander and his generals. Alexander alone dreams to trailblaze to the "outer ocean." The rest want their lives, their family, and to enjoy the spoils of their victories.<br /><br />At times Ferrell seems overwhelmed by the role of Alexander; most actors would be, it asks for such a range of emotions. But he does give the conquerer a perspective, a bemused intelligence in quieter moments, a bawling rage in others. In the last hour of "Alexander," the conquerer is quite clearly losing it and Ferrell charts the descent well. Ferrell is an performer, not a method actor, so when he goes for it, he does so with instinct. Recent epic heroes Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") Orlando Bloom ("Kingdom of Heaven") and Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai") have a lot more zen, even machismo, than Alexander.<br /><br />That Ferrell overacts in scenes as son to Olympias and Philip is not entirely his fault. Jolie would rather be seen as impressive than talented; she's an action star so fixated on cool she may never return to the land of subtlety. Her performance is pitched to a junior-high acting class on cartoon accents. I half-expected her to slither or crawl at some point, she's so unhinged. And Kilmer - though simply doing the best he can - is wrong for Philip. His greatness is told, not shown. It does not help that his performance is broken into flashbacks so scattered we can forget what we already know of him.<br /><br />The entire production is scattered, from Stone's fractured structure to the occasional incantation of the Greek gods - it's hard to say whether they matter to Alexander or not - to Dawson's rare and rather pointless appearances as Roxanna. "Alexander" could have been an hour longer and been incomplete; what's odd is that the DVD "Director's Cut" version is actually shorter. The movie may be Stone's rubicon - producers should never trust him with a movie of great scale again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>There aren't too many epic filmakers these days, and just about all of them court controversy at some point in their careers. Oliver Stone is just that kind of a man. From "JFK" to the recent "World Trade Center," he is not afraid to make decisions that will rankle people. Such is the case with his glorious mess, "Alexander." Everything about this movie is so right that the total failure of the film to connect can only lie on Stone's shoulders.<br /><br />Colin Farrell plays Alexander as a troubled Mama's boy. The much debated 'gay content' is limited to googely-eyes shared between Farrell and Jared Leto (the hottest sex scene is when Rosario Dawson and Farrell get it on). Everyone - from Farrell to Val Kilmer, speaks as if Macedonia was Northern Ireland. Except Angelina Jolie, who plays Alexander's mother like she just left a gig doing Natasha voice overs for "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoons. Kilmer, by the way, is nothing short of brilliant as King Phillip. I didn't even recognize him at first, he is so enveloped in the role.<br /><br />The filming itself is rich, lush, beautiful. So what does Stone do with it? Everyone stands up and makes speeches. Over and over, people talk on and on through scenes that go way beyond their need. Anthony Hopkin's voice overs give the film a much needed narrative connectivity, yet Hopkins himself barely appears. When he DOES show up, it is to pontificate like he's onstage at some Shakespearian production.<br /><br />The battle scenes are mammoth, chaotic, splendid. That is, unless you want to have any indication of who is fighting who. Then, all the thrown dust and swirling camera work leave you guessing. Same with the bizarrely intercut timelines. You will have several WTF moments as you try to figure out not just the what, but the when an activity is taking place. Be patient and you will be rewarded with the spectacle of Alexander's final battle in India, with charging elephants and stunning scenery.<br /><br />When comparing "Alexander" to "Troy" or "Kingdom Of Heaven," Stone's movie falls somewhere between the two. "Alexander" is more an accurate portrayal of Alexander than "Troy's" bungling of Homer's Iliad, (at least Stone didn't flinch away from bi-sexuality they way Wolfgang Peterson did with Achilles in "Troy"), but Troy never felt like it was dragging in pace. One the other hand, Colin Farell and the cast of "Alexander" are far more convincing than "Kingdom Of Heaven," even if I believe Ridley Scott managed to craft the more watchable movie.<br /><br />It's too bad that all this amazing work is left floundering in chaos, becuase "Alexander" had all the making of a brilliant movie. It is so ambitious that I can't help but add the fourth star, but I suspect that a few more edits might have made this a more choherent movie. We all know Oliver Stone has it in him, after all, he made a movie that was mostly two hours of men buried in rubble fascinating. Why "Alexander" seems like it was left as rubble mystefies me.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>I was impressed when I first saw Alexander on the screen.  This was before I was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman history.  Then re-seeing it, I fell in love with it, original theatrical cut.  The Director's cut was okay, but not better than the original.<br /><br />I recently recognized the flaws which detracted some people from it, such as lack of characterization of some of the minor characters, a seeming characterization of Alexander based on his flaws rather than his greatness, and so on.  However, I don't think this is enough to detract my intense love for the movie.<br /><br />I think Oliver Stone is a cinematic genius, and it shows in his work like Platoon and Natural Born Killers.  The direction is brilliant, and the incredible detail put into cinematography, costumes, and sets is simply epic on its own scale.<br /><br />The Battle of Gaugamela sequence is pure brilliance, and I believe the most accurate ancient battle portrayal in all Hollywood.  Aside from occasional lapses in which a Phalanx is broken apart, men fight in formation, rather than wandering around the field on their own, picking on-on-one "The Mummy Returns" style battles.<br /><br />The acting is perhaps some of the best I've ever seen.  Colin Farrel dissolves so fully into his role, that it's impossible for me to see the man playing Alexander as the man who played a slick New York agent in "Phone Booth", or a deadpan bald villain with a raspy voice in "Daredevil".  Val Kilmer so fully becomes Philip of Macedon that you can't see him doing any other role.  He's no longer Val Kilmer underneath the scarred eyelid and thick beard, he's Philippos II of Makedon.<br /><br />The lesser-known actors, Jared Leto who plays Hephaistion, Gary Stretch who plays Cleitus the Black, and all the others playing the likes of Crateros, young Ptolemaios, Nearkhos, they are so fluid in their roles that they could quite possibly be the actual characters they portray, Irish and British accents and all.<br /><br />The "Clash with Cleitus" scene is so thickly potent with chemistry between Farrel and Stretch (Cleitus) that it sends shivers through my spine listening to how these two rail at each other, and how literate, yet scathing and understandable Cleitus is.  His vocabulary is like poetry, like Sophokles' writing, and yet his message is so simple and human that it's universally understood, even if you don't speak the language.<br /><br />Inaccuracies aside (they had to cut and condense scenes for time, including a simplification of the Battle of Hydaspes, which Stone himself acknowledges, due to the vast complexity of the actual battle), it's one of the more accurate Hollywood movies about Ancient Greece, and an epic in its own right.  Love it or hate it, it IS an epic.<br /><br />The Final Cut expands upon it even more, and re-arranges scenes so that the lead-up to the Battle of Gaugamela comes first, after the scene of his death and Ptolemaios (Ptolemy)'s brief introduction.  Scene re-sorting aside, new scenes show a more benevolent Alexander, working to bring Phoenicians in to build Babylon's shallow water harbor, granting gifts to his friends and soldiers, freeing Darius's harem slaves and eunuchs, granting great honors on his conquered enemies, including a scene with Oxyhartes(sp), father of Roxane.  Important scenes, such as the clash with Cleitus, are expanded with more dialogue, more action before and after scenes to provide a more solid foundation for the coming events, and such, adding more depth to some, and more reasoning to others.<br /><br />The Final Cut doesn't radically change the movie, but it solidifies some shaky foundations, and fixes some, but not all, of the flaws with the original cut.  The subplot with Cassander and Roxane, mentioned by Stone in the original commentary, is missing, as is the conflict with Cleitus and Hephaistion.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>You know that time of your life when you're at a pool. You're watching the kids, her kids, grand kids, your kids. Kids. And one of them, very dry and as yet unimmersed, goes up to Mom and says, "Mom, how do I dive into the water?" And she says 'honey, you have to get wet first. Go on. Jump in the pool.'<br /><br />OK. Granted it's kind of a stretch but stay with me. Alexander's bisexualty. Oliver. Do it or don't. Pained stares, lots of mascara and 12-step hugs don't do it. It's almost 2006.<br /><br />Stone does great work and like successful directors in a whimsical industry, success is sometimed marred by failure. Or worse, mediocrity. Wall Street, Platoon, 4th of July, Nixon, are juxtaposed against JFK and Heaven and Earth. And one thing's for certain. Alexander ain't great and it might be in the latter category. It seems there might have been some areas that could have been avoided.<br /><br />You know I don't think the bisexualty issue is a big deal but you have to admit, it's a hot topic. It's kind of like gay marriages in the last election. It's bound to attract a stream of negativity. It's a lightening rod. I believe that from an accuracy point of view, it's really hard to say what a person's sexualty is now, much less 2000 years ago. Hell. We don't even know what Bubba's sexuality was. How are we supposed to know Alexander's?<br /><br />And then there's that 'one foot in the water one foot out' approach. Come on Oliver. You're the Director. Make a decision.<br /><br />The scenes tainted in red. The Val Kilmer trip to the blood cave. These are things right out of the 60's. It reminded me of Peter Fonda as Captain America in the cemetery scene. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />And the dialogue. I couldn't understand 1/2 of it because of the background noise. And I just think these were vicious, pagan times when a whole lot of brain-picking and dialoguing and networking just didn't go on.<br /><br />And the 'lets treat our enemies like our friends and return them to positions of power 'cause we're all equals under the same God . . . or multiple Gods.' Man that didn't happen after WWII and I'm pretty certain it didn't happen after the Macedonians sacked Persia and everything else in their path.<br /><br />One last point. The speeches. If you think that Alexander gave speeches on Honor and Loyalty and a Tranquil Homelife and Glory and Equality to 100,000 men, you deserve this movie.<br /><br />Jolie is great as Olympias although, didn't you think Alexander's mother should have been a little less hot and older? Colin Farrell, good actor, great hair. Not in the Heston, Burton, Douglas (Kirk. Please), Crowe mold.<br /><br />Damn tedious. You want something good? Read Pressfield's "Gates of Fire." Great characters; great scenes; great descrptions; little dialogue. 2 stars.

At times I felt like I was watching a very, very long History Channel documentary and yet I have to say that I didn't find the film to be as bad as many other reviewers here apparently do.  I do agree with those who say that a lot of Alexander's important exploits are not showcased but instead are glossed over through Ptolemy's narratives but in fairness to Stone it would probably take 3 four-hour long movies to portray them all and at least the incredible defeat of Darius using the brilliant technique that is still taught in most military schools is shown here with at least for me irritating subtitles which only makes it feel even more like a History Channel documentary but overall I feel that once you get used to Stone's style of storytelling which is unlike most similar epics that we have seen from other directors like Kubrick, Scott or Lean this film while not perfect is still very good and engaging.  I found myself forced to concentrate and to pay attention throughout to catch the flow given the frequent flashbacks and jumping around and as such I didn't really feel the length of the film having so immersed myself in it.<br /><br />Story aside at least the picture and sound qualities were very good and although the special feature documentaries aren't that entertaining at least we finally get Alexander in the form that Stone was best able to deliver.  In trying to show the human side and to explain what makes him tick, Stone has succeeded in emphasising that aspect albeit having to sacrifice the more exciting fighting scenes.<br /><br />Not for everyone but it's probably the best that Stone could have done.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Are you in the mood for a great historical adventure epic in the manner of "Braveheart" or "Gladiator"? Well, you're certainly not gonna get it with this godawful flick. "Alexander" is a 3-hour unfocused bore.<br /><br />Worst of all, the viewer has to endure the overlong running time witnessing Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his best friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), absurdly exchanging romantic looks at each other throughout the picture. Although they (thankfully) never do more than hug, the flick gives the vibe that it may turn into a gay porn film at any moment.<br /><br />Is this the mighty, world-conquering Alexander the Great -- a whiney, girly-boy sodomite? What was at most a minor footnote in the life of a great warrior (if that), writer/director Oliver Stone has given ridiculous preminence. Sadly, because of Stone's twisted delusions, this is how Alexander is now going to be perceived and remembered by many. If Alexander came back from the grave he'd beat Stone to a pulp for defamation of character.<br /><br />Catch this one only if you're into gay romance fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Where to begin this review?  I almost feel like I have to defend my position on actually liking the film, which is hard for me to do because my liking of it is sensory and I am usually a more factual person.<br /><br />What's wrong with Alexander?  Well, it's difficult to be historically accurate even while studying a practically mythological figure, but if you are making a Hollywood film it is next to impossible.  So Alexander the movie only follows the historical aspects of Alexander The Great by the finest of threads.  The dialogue is a little stiff at times also, attempting to modernize into a recognizable pattern the speeches and rituals of a civilization that existed before Christ.  There's a Colin Farrell "buffalo shot" that should have been edited out.  And the plot skips around quite a bit, in an unnecessary fashion.  It could have been bloodier, too.<br /><br />What's right with Alexander?  For one thing, the stunning photography, breathtaking scenery, costume design, and realistic props and settings.  The battle scenes are spectacular, with arrows and pikes and vast armies.  There is one scene in particular, where Alexander goes up against a barbarian, filmed in slow motion as both horse and elephant rear up in facing off with each other, that is so captivating you will find yourself holding your breath.<br /><br />Colin Farrell did a remarkably good job in portraying Alexander, and Val Kilmer was exceptionally, and startlingly, good as Alexander's father, Philip.  Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy and Christopher Plummer as Aristotle did fine performances, but their parts in the film were lesser than their known talents.  Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympias, surprised me.  Normally, I don't care for her acting, but she fit the role perfectly as a deadly beauty who fondles snakes and schemes for her son's greatness.  I've liked Rosario Dawson since her early appearance in 'Kids', and she doesn't disappoint in her role as Roxane, Alexander's barbarian wife.  I think that her part should have been greater in the film, with more played off of her love/hate relationship with Alexander, but this was a big story to put into one film anyway.  And Jared Leto...woof!  When did Jared Leto become hot?  When he put on eyeliner and a long-haired wig?  I'm not sure, but he plays his role as Hephaistion, Alexander's same-$ex lover, quite well.<br /><br />Alexander, then, amounts to some very nice eye-candy to watch for its entertainment value.  It's not a documentary but an epically filmed interpretation of Alexander's battle years, when he conquered most of the civilized world (at that time) in the span of eight short years.  Imagine 2500 years from now a film being made about, say, Ronald Reagan.  Will it be accurate?  Doubtful, but it will most likely be made to please the people of that era.<br /><br />So sit back, pop some popcorn, put the DVD on the bigscreen TV and turn the volume down.  Don't worry about what people say about the $exuality in the film, it is not overt or overplayed, it is simply portrayed as part of Alexander's life, as was common during the time frame of the epic.  Enjoy this film for the lush cinematography and save the documentary for the History Channel.  Its eye-candy, pure and simple.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Before I start complaining about this film, let me say right off that I like Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins.  I've been looking forward to this film for months now, since I saw the first preview but Oliver Stone let me down.  Unlike others who have problems with Colin's performance or Angelina's vampy Olympias, I lay full blame on Oliver Stone.  The movie did not flow with the constant moving back and forth in time and Mr. Stone did not try to capture the real spirit of Alexander the Great.  Anthony Hopkin's Ptolemy is one of his weakest and least interesting roles he's ever played and would have been better left out of the movie.  I think the film would have been better had Stone told Alexander's life straight out, ditching the narrator and focusing on the life of an amazing warrior.<br /><br />Stone leads the viewer to believe that Alexander, though married three times, also enjoyed the (sexual) company of men----Hephaestion, his long time best friend (played by Jared Leto) and Bagoas, a persian eunuch.  The scenes are vague and leave a great deal to the viewer's imagination.  If he was gonna include this point of view about Alexander's life, he should have not been afraid to explore these relationships.  The sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaestion was much more interesting than the relationship between Alexander and his first wife, Roxane (played by Rosario Dawson).  Their violent first night of love making was unbelievable and completely void of any chemistry.<br /><br />As for the performances, Colin did fairly well with the poorly directed role he was given.  By far, the most interesting was Angelina Jolie's scheming Olympias, a woman determined to see her son become king, at any cost.  And as for Anthony Hopkins, he should have passed on this role---it was boring, not worthy of an actor of his caliber.<br /><br />I read recently that Baz Lurhmann has decided not to direct his version of Alexander.  After Stone's messy and disappointing tale of the man who conquered 90% of the known world, I hope Lurhman will reconsider.  Alexander the Great deserves a better movie than this want-to-be epic that is basically a snooze-fest.  I'm giving it two stars for Angelina Jolie's vampy turn as the Queen and Colin Farrell's performance, both of whom can still do a good job even when in a really bad film.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />"Alexander" is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past.  Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in "Oliver" that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of "Where Is Love?" before his part was over).  None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch.  Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.<br /><br />Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue.  It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.<br /><br />For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone.  Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of  "Platoon," "Born on the Fourth of July," "Nixon," and "JFK" (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of "JFK").  The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on.  The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is definitely impressive.<br /><br />At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of "Alexander" is a mighty long haul indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Alexander is a movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Alexander the Great to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the sources associated with the Greek hero (even though a historian was supposedly hired to do just that, though why an Englishman was chosen and not Greek is beyond my comprehension), rather it is a film BASED on and INSPIRED by the legendary conqueror, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the truth.<br /><br />One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied Greek History, it is common knowledge that the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was in relation to his sexuality, which also seems to be Oliver Stone's main theme (!!!) in this film along with his relations with his parents.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is Alexander the Great in question and not some modern leader/general.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read/studied the sources) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually occurred.  Consequently, due to these distortions, the movie establishes a very serious threat of producing armies of misinformed people who think they have accurate knowledge of Alexander the Great when they really do not.  That is NOT good!<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, Oliver Stone throughout the film, CONSTANTLY refers to homosexual relationships between men, when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial; therefore, calling for EXTREME CAUTION when dealing with such matters.  He even goes as far as to proclaim that Achilles and Patroklos were lovers!  What people do in their own bedrooms is their own business, but to involve Greece's kings and legends in alleged homosexual acts, shows complete lack of respect as well as lack of basic/elementary knowledge of the era in question, with most frequent the misinterpretation of love between friends which did not include anything sexual or homosexual whatsoever!  The heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.<br /><br />Lastly, special emphasis must also be made in that the Snake (Olympias' "affection" towards snakes) is an animal holy to Greeks and not a fetish in the way that we might find it today in erotic fiction or medieval fantasy e.g. Conan the Barbarian etc.  Therefore, Olympias' caressing, kissing and even licking snakes is ludicrous to say the least!<br /><br />On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is very good (overall) and the cast are wonderful (overall).  Colin Farrel, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and the rest of the actors (with the exception of Haephestion who could not be more feminine if he tried) have done a excellent job of providing an entertaining (!) film.  Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and Rosario Dawson carry out superb performances, unlike Colin Farrel who falls short of being 100% convincing in his role.<br /><br />Hopefully, more films will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>After 'King Arthur' we had 'Troy.'  After 'Troy' we have 'Alexander.'  After this, we had enough.  Oliver Stone should have done it much earlier, and then this film could have a chance at the box-office.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's cherished idea of bringing the life of Alexander onto the screen has finally realized.  Very aptly, the film runs almost 3 hours.  And it cost estimated $150,000,000, or more.  And, look! the ominous figures on the box-office records, that tell you the film only collected $34,000,000 at the time of writing.  It seems as if audiences sensed something terrible before the thaatres, and run away from there.<br /><br />[IS THIS THAT BAD?] That's eaxctly what you want to know.  I find the film is not that bad.  There are a few thing that I can recommend about the film, but still it is awfully self-indulgent and extremely verbose.  Let me point out these things one by one.<br /><br />[GOOD THINGS] are the spectacular battle scenes and beautifully recreated costumes.  Everyone would agree with the opinion that the film's highest point is the thrilling sequences about The Battle of Gaugamela, in which the troops of Alexander see the bloody fight against the Perusian armies.  These scenes are well-crafted, and the sweeping camera gives you the extraordinary vision, overlooking the battlefield.<br /><br />[BUT SOME THINGS] are ... well, really, embarrassingly, awful.  First, acting.  Colin Farrell as Alexander shows the limitation of his skills, especially in the latter half of the film, where the king gradually gets more and more obsessed with his dream.  In this film, 'obssessed' means a wide-eyed face and the constantly yelling voice, which are both irritatinig.  No wonder the soldiers lost faith, and wanted to go home.<br /><br />[WORST PRIZE], however, goes to super-campy Angelia Jolie, whose career seems keeping on a constant downward trip since two 'Tomb Raider's.  Now, Angelina plays the mother of Alexander, whose idea of reincarnation leads to her eccentric  belief -- and equally eccentric acting -- holding a snake before the terrified boy, teaching the dangers of the real life.  Instead of being convinced, the little boy must have been busy surpressing laughs before her.  (Sorry folks, but I laughed.)  And her phoney accent is a misguided idea.<br /><br />There are more bad things about the film, but they have already been pointed out by other reviewers, so I only say that I agree with them whole-heartedly.  Overlength, pointlessness, meandering story, too much talking, and very dull Anthony Hopkins whose character actually try to 'teach' us.  Supports from Jared Leto, Christopher Plummer, Rosalio Dawson, and Val Kilmer are all nothing.<br /><br />My advice: read books instead.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Decent movie.

Beauty is probably the best characteristic of this film : sandscapes, landscapes, urbanscapes (the famous Babylon of course and some other cities), mountainscapes and even some junglescapes. The plot is simple. Royal family strife with polygamy and jealousy, poisonings and executions, etc A lot of warfare to conquer an empire against those foreigners which translates into Greek as barbarians, and some amusing and amazing battles with elephants, camels and other interesting equipment. A marvellous black horse : the best actor in the film actually. Then a lot of plotting among the generals of this enormous army and a king who will be poisoned when he is finally back in Babylon, and his empire will be torn apart by wars since all the generals want to have a slice of it. Nothing particularly fascinating. One element though comes out. It takes seven years for the conqueror of Babylon to be finally defeated and to go home, and altogether eight years for him to die. That number of eight is maybe an allusion to another war around Babylon, but who is going to see it really ? The character of Alexander is not particularly explored in details. He has little culture, except a little bit of mythology. He thinks he is some kind of God or demi-God, a descendent of Zeus, Achylles, Herakles or Hercules maybe too, and he is typical of his time : a least three wives and quite a lot of manly love but it is all very well wrapped up and embraced with a lot of both directness and chastity. Only the statues are nude. Don't expect more than that. We all know the rest about this Greek culture of old. Good entertainment even for the whole family.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>One but has to read Peter Green's epic biography "Alexander of Macedon" to realize that his was a story meant to be told on film.  Alas, Green's book is far more interesting than Oliver Stone's long and tedious "Alexander".  Colin Farrell is badly miscast as the Macedonian conqueror; he spends the entire film crying, whining and generally overacting to the point that this viewer actually dreaded his next scene.<br /><br />In point of fact, just about everyone is miscast in "Alexander", particularly Angelina Jolie, who is obviously too young to be the central character's mother.  The one saving grace is Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, Philip.  Kilmer gives life to Philip's drunken antics; it is known that the Macedonians were very fond of drinking to excess-Alexander himself killed one of his top commanders, Cleitus, in another alcohol-fueled confrontation (shown all too graphically in the film).<br /><br />Much of the chronology in the film is accurate (though Stone's flashbacks will confuse those with limited knowledge of Alexander's life).  Two major battles of Alexander's Asian campaign are portrayed:  Gaugamela (thought to be near Mosul in modern day Iraq), and The Hydaspes in what is now Pakistan.  Unfortunately neither the place nor the opposing commander (the Indian King Porus) in the latter battle are even mentioned in the film.  I felt the Granicus River, the place where Alexander first met the Persian King Darius III in battle after crossing into Asia, would have made a better subject than the gigantic Gaugamela.  Alexander was badly wounded there, but recovered.  Granicus was a nearly evenly matched affair, which could have gone either way.<br /><br />More than 2,300 years after his death, Alexander's exploits have become legend. Many episodes in Alexander's life are well known in our day: the first encounter with his famed horse Bucephalus (perhaps the first equine in recorded history to be known by name), to the aforementioned murder of Cleitus, to his deathbed, where he refused to name a successor among his commanders.  Somehow the film deflates these occurrences; by trying to make Alexander almost godlike, Stone undercuts the import of them.<br /><br />Even though the timeline is largely right, the film simply does not have "life"; it is told in an almost comatose fashion.  Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" had similar elements, yet was never boring-even the calmer periods of the film were well-acted and held the viewer's interest.  "Alexander" plods along to the next battle, personal confrontation or intrigue without much fanfare.<br /><br />Alexander the Great is acknowledged by just about anyone with a brain as the greatest military commander of all time-he never lost a battle in his short 32 years of life-but this film falls far short of doing his legacy justice.  The biggest flaw in the film is casting Colin Farrell in a role that is clearly beyond his abilities.  One star.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I never did understand how Oliver Stone came to direct <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a>. Somebody like David McLean (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KY">Lawrence of Arabia</a>) or Ridley Scott (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>) seems more appropriate. Stone's vision of Alexander is an attempt at epic, but never quite reaches the grandeur of these other films.<br /><br />First of all, the casting seems all wrong. The Hollywood cast isn't really a great fit for an epic film like [ASIN:B000UPGQIU Alexander]]. Colin Farrell (Alexander) is decent, but not great. At times, he cuts a less than commanding presence. Angelina Jolie overplayed her part as Alexander's mother Olympias. She comes across as psychotic (especially with the fake accent) rather than powerful. Anthony Hopkins' narration becomes intrusive and ruins the drama of parts of the film, rather than enhance it. Some of the best epic films, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KY">Lawrence of Arabia</a>) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a> relied upon relative unknowns (Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe, respectively), allowing the audience to accept them in the role of historical giants. Farrell and Jolie are too recognizable and don't fill the part.<br /><br />Historically, the movie seems to buy into the whole mythology surrounding Alexander as a generous victor and advocate of liberty. The film starts with a historical inaccuracy -  the notion that Darius' army at Issus had hundreds of thousands of men (in fact, the Persian army was probably around the same size as Alexander's). Also, in the movie Alexander's father is portrayed as a drunken fool, but in real life he was quite a king himself who probably would have conquered the Persian empire in his own right. For a good biography of Alexander that dispels some of the myths, check out Peter Green's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520071662">Alexander of Macedon 356-323 B.C.: A Historical Biography</a>. But in a lot of other respects, the film is somewhat accurate and many of the anecdotes (such as Alexander's taming his horse as a child). In short, the plot sticks fairly close to a realistic, if glorified, interpretation of Alexander's life.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're interested in Alexander the Great or movies about the ancient world more generally,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a> - the expanded version of the film - isn't quite as bad as most critics allege. The revised version has more footage and is definitely an improvement over the theatrical version. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a> probably isn't one you'll watch over many times.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>This movie may be a failure, but as one character says of Alexander - `His failure towered over other peoples successes!'  This directors cut is actually a little shorter than the theatrical cut, and the changes are not obvious unless you do a study of the two or someone has told you what they are - but they work.  The directors cut somehow flows better than its theatrical cousin, and does not seem quite such hard work, making it worthy of re-appraisal.<br /><br />However, it is still overripe - the last third of the movie showing the destruction of that which Alexander loved - His horse, his best friend / lover Haphaestion, his army, his health and most of all his dream of one nation - just somehow seem at odds with the rest of the movie, and make for an unsatisfying narrative arc.  Of course, these are just the facts of history that Oliver Stone had to work with, but you can't help wondering if the rival Alexander project of Baz Luhrmann which was scrapped when Stones vision was going to reach screens first, might have been more successful - focussing as it did on just a portion of Alexander's life.  Alexander had too rich a story perhaps to fit into one movie.  The rise of Alexander has more than enough for one epic, and the fall of Alexander is a story in itself - but to fit it all into one movie smacks of the kind of desire to outdo the competition that sank Cleopatra.<br /><br />So what works and what doesn't.  Stone is a genius film maker, and this movie is amazingly shot and has imaginative ideas throughout.  Occasionally these are a little overbearing, such as the reverse colour used when Alexander is injured, but on the whole they succeed - the eagle flying from Alexander talking to his soldiers across the battlefield to the waiting Persians is wonderful (if somewhat poor cgi).  The device of splicing the dual narratives of Alexander's young life with his life as the general making his conquests, is ideal - a straight chronological tale would have been just too dull - especially with the later parts in India being just so depressing.  The cast is veritably star studded, in a modern way, and the supporting cast are uniformly excellent.  Angelina Jolie makes a memorable, sexy but scary Olympias making her perfect casting - except for THAT accent which was a big mistake and quickly becomes tedious.  IN fact, what was it with accents in this movie?  Farrel has an Irish accent that is impossible to hide, but does Val Kilmer have to echo it, and Jared Leto too, as if to say the ancient Greeks were actually an Irish dynasty?  The other major woman in Alexander's life is also a big success, Rosario Dawson playing the exotic barbarian woman who became his wife, but she is under utilised.  Opinions will vary as to how good Farrel was, but in spite of the accent, I think his was a great performance showing the intended emotion, vulnerability and indeed ego of the complicated young man.<br /><br />The music by Vangelis is a masterful piece of music - buy the album by all means - I did.  However, as a score to a movie, it has mixed success... sometimes it is just too distracting  - in epic moments of grandeur it is magnificent - but in battle scenes just tries too hard and does not sit well.  Perhaps it might have worked in someone elses movie of Alexander, but not Stone's.<br /><br />In short, this movie will frustrate you with its length, with its rushing through parts of Alexander's life, and lack of a satisfying narrative arc.  But it is a movie made with great care, by some of the best in the business, and deserves re-appraisal in this director's cut form.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>I wanted to let people know that they should pick up the original cut of the film, not the Director's Cut. Instead of adding scenes, in the Director's Cut they took out scenes. The studio told Oliver Stone to take more of the gay and hertosexual undertones out of the film so Colin Farrell will be more like Brad Pitt in TROY. This was Warner Bros. decision not Oliver Stones, so if you want the real director's cut get the original cut of the film with everything that Oilver Stone wanted in his film. You actually get more for the same amount of money, all the features are the same as the Director's Cut DVD but if you get the original cut you get a longer film. I know this is kinda confusing but I'll say it one more time, if you want the REAL director's cut of ALEXANDER get the original cut not the director's cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>Before I begin, I should first state that most of the imperfections that existed before this edition was released are still present.  But that when all's said and done, this is the only cut that should have survived a triple-dip of DVD releases.  The fact that in his introduction, Oliver Stone asks us to 'enjoy every sublime and awkward pixel', leads us to reason that this still isn't the final product he had in mind, but this is as good as it's ever going to get.<br /><br />I always said that Alexander deserved to be given the "Rome" treatment, and that even at under 4 hours, it should have been longer.  Like Alexander, Oliver Stone's reach exceded his grasp, but not many other filmmakers would have had the chutzpah to try.<br /><br />The biggest problem this movie faced was its erratic casting.  Physically, Colin Farrell a shining gem of a leading man, but he's yet to prove he's much more than a pretty boy, possessing neither the charisma nor the acting chops to pull this role off (but it doesn't help that he's saddled down with some ham-handed lines).<br /><br />I give him credit however, for not many major actors in the world would have kissed another man onscreen for fear of being either being typecast or made to look like a fool.<br /><br />Much has been made of Angelina Jolie's "ridiculous" accent, and I agree that it's jarring, not to mention ridiculous--Stone had Farrell speak in his own Irish brogue, so why ask Jolie to sound like a modern day Irene Papas?  Neither she nor co-star Val Kilmer as King Phillip need any acting lessons, but both seem like they'd phoned in their parts.<br /><br />No such excuses for Jared Leto, who's only role seems to be to look worried and glance longingly at Alexander from time to time when we need reminding about sexual ambiguity.<br /><br />Another complaint is the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy the Elder as a narrator, claiming that the use of a narrator is proof of bad writing (the idea that you need a narrator implies that the story needs to be explained to you), and generally that's a valid complaint, but in this movie, I think the use of narration adds to the gravitas--otherwise it's just another Colin Farrell flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>Based on the several iterations that this film has evolved through, Oliver Stone tried to re-create the tone of those old-fashioned epic films (those old movies that were long, historical or religious in nature, and had intermissions...) but fails admirably.<br />He fails, in my opinion, in a most watchable catastrophic fashion, and because of that, I found myself admiring his chutzpah.<br /><br />The story has been well described in these various reviews. It's a dizzying attempt to cover the life of Alexander The Great.<br /><br />Many terrific actors (Kilmer, Jolie, etc.) give it their all. You can see them trying...even Colin Farrell. You can't say he doesn't commit to the role.<br /><br />Much has been written about the emphasis on homosexuality in this cut, and it is pervasive. I mean that the relationship with Hephaestion (Jared Leto) is arguably the central plot of the film.  This apparently accurately reflects historical data...but Stone almost makes it into a political statement. I just found it a little weird that it was emphasized SO much. I heard someone say that this film made "Rent" look like "Dirty Harry." I don't know if I'd go THAT far, but I see their point.<br /><br />It is beautifully shot; the war scenes are done well...technically it is what you would expect.<br /><br />From a storytelling perspective, this is an unqualified disaster. The timeshifting back and forth is so disorienting, even the titling doesn't help. ("Eight years earlier", "Four years later"...back and forth...back and forth...)<br /><br />The lines alternate between literate and cheesy, but all good epics have some of that...<br /><br />Anyways...I guess what I'm trying to say is that you kinda have to see this to believe it.<br /><br />But that's not a huge recommendation...</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>This movie got so much bad press when it was in theatres I avoided it, but that's what makes DVDs so great.  I actually enjoyed this film, but then I came into it with a predisposition to liking films of this genre.  Films like Spartacus, Ben-Hur, and Gladiator are among my favorites.  That doesn't mean this film lacks problems.  Some of the plotting was a bit long and boring and the acting was not always up to par; however, Colin Farrell was very good in the role of Alexander the Great and Angelina Jolie took mother-behind-the-scenes to new heights.  From an F/X standpoint, the battles were big and exciting, if a bit on the bloody side.  Anyone who enjoys over-the-top historical films full of battles and sex and exotic locales should enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>At a cost of over $ 150,000,000 to make, and overtaken at the box office by the "SpongeBob" movie, "Alexander" is the 21st century "Heaven's Gate." The participants in this epic disaster should hope that few people see this film, because like "Heaven's Gate" in 1981, this could be a career-breaker. Oliver Stone's direction, working with a weak and often preposterous script, is a major catastrophe. The only scene that works in the entire 3 hours of this film is when the young Alexander (Connor Paolo, the only cast member whose reputation as an actor remains untarnished) tames the wild horse Bucephalus.<br /><br />As Alexander, Colin Farrell is hopeless. Instead of having a commanding presence, as one would assume Alexander had to have, he is feeble and gives us a "smaller than life" hero, a puppy dog in need of his lover Haphastion (Jared Leno in heavy eye makeup). He also not only has a thick Irish accent, but very poor diction. An actor getting major roles should be skilled enough to remove regional traces from his speaking voice, and be able to acquire a "non-accent."<br /><br />Another vocal treasure is Angelina Jolie, who pouts and plays with her pet snake collection, and sounds exactly like Lotte Lenya in "From Russia with Love." If this film makes a dent in the Hollywood history books, it will be for this bizarre characterization of Olympias. What was Jolie thinking, and why did Stone allow it?<br /><br />The quasi-historical epic of heroism and adventure is my favorite genre, and I wanted to enjoy this film, but was almost repulsed by it. If you want to see a towering failure, this is it. Filmed in Morocco, there are miles of rusty colored desert, and the landscape was much better served in the made for TV Bible films. The soundtrack by Vangelis is also unsuccessful, and in many scenes seems to be out-of-synch with the action on the screen. This ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen, reminding me a little of Bob Guccione's "Caligula," except the actors are wearing clothes. Arf! This one is a dog.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>Alexander is a waste of time and your money so if i was you i would not rent or buy this movie!!!!!

Reviewers and critics made it seem as though this movie had the plaque. I must admit Oliver Stone did not sugar-coat the story or makes Alexander too heroic. Believe me; you may never see a major motion picture that tells the story like it is like this again. Oliver Stone took a different approach with this historic figure and he really didn't capture the real spirit of Alexander the Great the way it was written in history books.<br /><br /> Anthony Hopkin's as Ptolemy is one of his weakest and least interesting roles he's ever played and would have been better left out of the movie. I think the film would have been better had Stone told Alexander's life straight out, ditching the narrator and focusing on the life of an amazing warrior. Stone leads the viewer to believe that Alexander, though married three times, also enjoyed the (sexual) company of men----Hephaestion, his long time best friend (played by Jared Leto) and Bagoas, a Persian eunuch. The scenes are vague and leave a great deal to the viewer's imagination. If he was going to include this point of view about Alexander's life, he should have not been afraid to explore these relationships. The sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaestion was much more interesting than the relationship between Alexander and his first wife, Roxane (played by Rosario Dawson). Their violent first night of love making was unbelievable and completely void of any chemistry. As for Colin Farrell I thought he did fairly well with the poorly directed role he was given. By far, the most interesting was Angelina Jolie's (minus the accent) scheming Olympias, a woman determined to see her son become king, at any cost.<br /><br />It's obvious much of the film's budget went into the sets, costumes, and their authenticity which was great. I wouldn't mind viewing the uncut version to this. My theory is that people should not be reprimanded for telling a true story in its raw form. Oliver Stone and Mel Gibson are among those people. I don't recommend it to everyone, but if what I've written above strikes a chord with you, or you truly love history and would like see what the world circa 326 BC might have looked like don't pass on Alexander. It might not be `Alexander the Great,' but it truly is Alexander the Colossus.  One should just approach it for what it is and not what one would expect a historical epic to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Is Alexander as bad a disaster as the critics are saying? No. Merciful heavens, it's worse. I mean this is in the class with Heaven's Gate and Town and Country. In this movie Alexander the Great is portrayed as whiny, often weepy mama's boy with a complex the size of a mountain about his mean old dad. That's it.  You sit through what feels like several hours of weeping and pychological mish mash. People around me were actually laughing at the movie and it's not meant to be a comedy. Colin looks silly in that wig/dye job and Angelina Jolie as Olympias was ....strange. Val Kilmer gave such a great performance as Doc Holiday that it's sad to see him hamming it up in this movie. I liked the elephants though. If you don't go to a lot of movies pass this one by or you'll be left furious for wasting your ten bucks.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's long in development bio-pic of Alexander the Great is, sadly, one big mess.  The first thing you'll notice is some outrageously over the top acting, not to mention the mis-casting of Colin Farrell in the title role with a blonde mane and unquestionable love for his long time buddy (Jared Leto).  Angelina Jolie sleep walks as Alexander's snake charming mother, a heavy Val Kilmer looks like he just walked off the set of Wonderland and had makeup over his eye applied, and the only bright spot of the entire casting is the great Anthony Hopkins providing a reflective voice over throughout the film, and it's the only way you'll know what's going on in this otherwise incoherent mess.  It's hard to believe that with the talent involved in Alexander that it turned out like this.  We know that he was a legendary conquerer and strategist, but by the time the credits roll, the only question you're left asking is what's the point?  It's disappointing that something Stone appeared to have so much heart in ended up like this (his commentary is definitely worth hearing on this DVD release as he discusses the film's bad press), but believe it or not, Alexander could be a lot worse.  Worth seeing for Stone afficiondos or those interested in Alexander the Great, but all others should avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Of all the people in this world, I should be one to give this movie 5 stars.  I would be thrilled to give it 5 stars.  I would love to be able to brag to people how wonderful & well done it was.  Unfortunately, I cannot ethically do any of the above.<br /><br />First a little on me.  I have studied the life of Alexander of Macedon for the past 15 years.  I've read books and essays on his life, including the biography by Arrian. I wrote a term paper on his life while in college.  I own several documentaries on his life.  I have studied the background facts of Greek culture extensively.  As I mentioned, I should have loved this movie  & in fact I wanted to love it.<br /><br />Now a little on the movie.  Somehow, it just didn't work.  Colin Farrell is a good cast for Alexander and most of the acting is decent.  The battle scenes are impressive and the soundtrack is pretty good (fittingly written by a Greek - Vangelis).  However, in the end it falls short of being worthwhile, and not even Sir Anthony Hopkins appearing as the elderly Ptolemy can change this fact.<br /><br />The basic problem with the film is that it's.....well.....boring (and my it pains me to say that!).  That a movie on Alexander's life would take 3+ hours to pull off is not surprising.  Unfortunately, this is 3+ hours of rather dull cinema.  The movie will have a spectacular battle scene and then get bogged down by some rather inconsequential aspects of Alexander's life.  Sadly, it seems to go on & on & on with some of these footnote elements.<br /><br />There are a few scenes here & there that are well done.  And, there are also some anecdotes of his life that happened kinda / sorta the way they appear in the film.  It's accurate that Alexander was bi-sexual too, but it's not necessary to hammer this fact over the head of the audience.<br /><br />In the end, if you're fascinated by the life of Alexander, this film is maybe worth seeing - once.  If not, you will probably walk out of this film thinking that his life was dull and ho-hum.  That is just too bad.  If you want to see a well-done movie on the ancient Greeks, see TROY.  It was everything this film lacked.<br /><br />If you are interested in the life of Alexander, but don't want to sit through a boring movie, I'd recommend IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER by Michael Wood (available on DVD from Amazon.com).  It's a far more worthwhile depiction of his life than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie was boring. Farrel was miscast. I just didn't believe anyone would follow him to the ends of the earth, let alone a whole army. He was a good actor, but he seemed out of place in the ancient world. Jolie had a strange accent and even a stranger role. The movie just sort of stopped when she was on.<br /><br />The battle scenes which were usually Stone's forte, were boring. The movie flipped back and forth several times in flashbacks. This did not help the already diffused narrative thread. Alexander's sexuality was addressed. I guess it was supposed to be better in the director's cut, but it was still not very well done. A pouting boyfriend hanging around in the background with no substantial role was not interesting. Alexander's wife had very little to do too.<br /><br />The good parts are the exotic scenery and the supporting caste, except for Jolie. Plummer, Kilmer, and Hopkins were good. I just had a hard time sitting through it.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>"Dreamers exhaust us," says Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins, looking like an elderly Yoda at the library in Alexandria), "we must kill them before their dreams kill us all."  Call me crazy, but I loved ALEXANDER.  I went in with incredibly low expectations based on dismal reviews, and instead I wound up sitting there with my hand frozen halfway to my mouth, fist stuffed with popcorn, not moving a muscle until the picture was over.  The movie may be "bad," but it's bad in a personal way, with lots of colorful sequences and some camp howlers that just move the action along as vigorously as anything De Mille could have turned out in his hey day.  If you thought the acting was bad in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, and yet you can't stop watching that picture every Easter, you will be crying with joy when you see ALEXANDER, nearly as long and twice as pagan.  Colin Farrell looks so young at first--he's good playing 19 or 20, and it's only when he ages that his acting starts falling apart.  I thought Angelina Jolie was fantastic, unashamed of her part, putting herself into it with her whole heart and soul.<br /><br />She looks wonderful, even when dozens of white, pasty slugcolored snakes writhe and wrap around her marvelous body--were these all CGI or did she actually work with them?  She certainly gives the impression of a mother whose priorities were 1) having fun with snakes and 2) the welfare of Alexander.  Val Kilmer was great, whether he was trying to rape Olympias or taking little Alex through a mural tour of the great heroes of Greek history--Oedipus, Prometheus, Medea, no one was spared.  The actor who plays Bagoas or whatever his name was--the boy who looks like a girl--has the strangest body, and both he and Rosario Dawson, who plays Roxana, Alexander's barbarian bride, seem to be in a competition for who can cast smoldering looks the furthest.<br /><br />All the actors really threw themselves over the cliff in this one, and I as a movie goer appreciated it, there's too much irony in the movies nowadays and hardly anyone gives that kind of balls to the wall performance like they used to.  Well here there are at least a dozen of them, and Colin Farrell's thighs are serious competition to all the other best supporting actor nominees of 2004.  I also liked the way Oliver Stone told the story so that none of the central questions of the film are ever answered and we are thrust back onto the prongs of our own curiosity about this marvelous "Mager Alexandrum."</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Alexander" has two major problems. The first is the fact that it is a two hour movie that they decided to extend. And they extended it, and they extended it, and they extended it, to the tedious three hour lenght that it is now. Why was it so long? Because director Oliver Stone had the urge to make every scene ten minutes long, and have Alexander the Great make his before battle speeches last for six or seven minutes. The second mjor problem with the movie was the casting. Angelina Jolie was actually the best part of the movie, and she is usually the worst. I hate Colin Farrell, and found him awful in "Minority Report," and "A Home at the End of the World," which is one of the worst movies of the year. He has no skill, and even though he is always playing a different character, he seems to act exactly the same. There's a scene in "Alexander" where he is riding his horse, and he should have a serious look on his face, but looks like he is about to break into the smile. Maybe the cameraman was making a funny face, but we will never know. Anthony Hopkins was useless, and he was the man telling the story to a scribe so he could put it into history. That was something that led to the extending minutes, and all the scenes that he was in was long speeches. That's how the movie starts as well, with a long speech that made me wonder when the movie would end.<br /><br />Alexander was born to King Philip II, and his mother is Olympias, who collects snakes, and always seems to have one around her neck. he is educated so that he is destined for being great, and his mother knows that he will one day be something special. Years later, one his parents are divorced, his mother wants him to marry a women that would ensure his place on the throne. His father is assassinated, and Alexander becomes the king. The only person that Alexander loves in his friend Hephaistion, but he still finds it neccessary to get a queen, so he marries Roxane, for hopes of having a son. As he goes on his quest, he wants to conquer the nations of Macedonia and eastern Asia. They go farthur east, men die in battle, and Alexander wants to be with Hephaistion. His mother continues to tell him that he is the "only Alexander of his kind. He is an Alexander the Great." Alexander continues to question his choices, and eventually he just becomes confused in his mind and his heart.<br /><br />The other historical epic that came out this year was "Troy" and the difference between "Alexander" and "Troy" is that "Troy" has a much better story. It is the story of a ten year war with ten thousand ships. "Alexander" is in the wake of "Troy," and even Achilles is mentioned many times. At least Colin Farrell was better than Brad Pitt was, but he wouldn't have been my first choice for Alexander. There were two major battle scenes in the movie, the first being following by a seven minute motivation speech, and the second involving elephants in Africa. The second is much more exciting, but the two battle scenes are too long. There is alot of blood, and like a French movie "A Very Long Engagement," I wish they could show battle scenes without that much blood. It is more realistic, but it sometimes is gratioutious, and could even be pointless. "Alexander" is not one of the worst movies of the year, but it's not one of the best. It is entertaining, but extended to the point where you want it to end. I didn't bring my watch to the theatre so I wouldn't look at it from time to time, but I did think about it sometimes. "Troy" was a better movie, visually and written much better. I was never bored during it, but "Alexander" had more useless scenes, even though the two movies are pretty much the exact same lenght. It's a shame that this couldn't have been better, because this had potential. Historical epics are great sometimes, and as "The Lord of the Rings" proved, a three hour movie isn't always suffered by its lenght.<br /><br />What I did like about the movie were the visuals. I gave "Vanity Fair" five stars, mostly because of the visuals, but the acting was also good in that movie, something that "Alexander" suffered from. This was a great movie to look at, and the last hour was also very exciting. From the last time Alexander saw his mother to the end, I loved the movie, and I wished that the rest could have been up to par with that. The music was good for the most part, even though historical epics all seem to have the same kind of music. I've heard battle music more times than I could count. I've never seen any other Oliver Stone movies, but I heard that alot were better than this, especially "JFK." The reason I liked "Troy" a lot better was because that was legend instead of mostly historical fact. The only things I remembered that were true with Alexander the Great was that he was a conquerer, he died of a fever, and he was a homosexual. This movie does use his homosexuality, but it doesn't use it againist him, or make it wrong to be it. "Alexander" would have been better as two hours, and with a different lead.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for violence and some sexuality/nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>When I first saw Collin Farrell in Tigerland I thought, "this guy is really good and is going to be somebody'. Then he became the 'It' guy of the moment and was showing up in just about everything and doing nothing really well. This movie, he is totally miscast and out of his element. I think the movie, like a few others, was trying to cash in on the success of the Russell Crowe movie Gladiator. It was over long, focused too much on Alexanders sexuality and had the dumbest casting. I mean Angelina Jolie as Farrells mother was just plain nonsensical. Val Kilmer was really horrible too which is a suprise cause he usually is really good. But the major flaw is the story itself. It tries to tell too big of a story in a limited amount of time. And Collin Farrell is in over his head. I have decided he is not that good of an actor. He is just a pretty boy who was good in one movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I'm originally Persian and Know Exact History of my country.

Babylon was not the original part of persia. in that time it was a country that had been captured by persians, later in the time of partan and sassanid empire, till 18th century it became an original part of persia. persian empire had 3 capitals, perspolis, now near shiraz in iran, ekbatan, now near hamedan in iran and shoush, now near ahvaz in iran. babylon was only a city. not the capital of persia and was never that crowded in that time!<br /><br />there was several wars in the center of persia, some of them was very heroic that small parts of iranian patriots, stopped alexander army for 6 mounths in the central persia mountains. the main city with huge amount of treasures that alexander captured, was perspolis, near shiraz that was the main capital of persian empire, and he destroyed it. there is no sign of any persian capital in thisd film, I bet oliver stone doesn't know that the persia is iran! in a scene we see him in a battle with persians, and what a ridiculous scen! the worse battle snene i've ever seen. from there, he jumps to babylon and from there, he flies to hindokush and india, what did oliver stone done? he hase changed the history, insulted millions of persian peole, fooled milions of american and world's people, and at the end, he couldn't make too much mony of this freak he made!</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>There is a myth and legend that when Julius Caeser saw a status of Alexander the Great, he broke down and cried because Alexander had conquered the world and Caeser had accomplished nothing in his lifetime.  That was Caeser's turning point, and another great man was born.  Alexander would emerge from Macedonia, never to return to his homeland, to conquer 90% of the known world, crush and kill all his enemies, and die at the ripe old age of 33.<br /><br />This movie, however, fails to deliver the most pleasing portrail of this war hero.  We see those who were supposed to be the great influences in his life, namely his mother and father.  Angelina Jolie, who is usually the lovable vamp, comes across in some odd Russian accent.  Her love for her son is obvious, but her marriage to Val Kilmer is anything but happy.  She is adament that her son will become a great man and a military leader.  His father is a drunken slob who doesn't seem to care much for him, as he is a reminder of his marriage to Angelina.  As he grows, his love of miltary grows, and he eventually leaves home to conquer the world.<br /><br />So why is this movie bad?  It's bad because of the jumpy, choppy editing.  We are flashing back and forth too much from his childhood to adulthood.  Many were bent out of shape about the obvious love between him and Jared Leto, but guess what?  Homosexuality was celebrated among ancient Greek culture, and is today!  It was all told in flashback, and it became just plain annoying.<br /><br />If you're looking for a history lesson, it's annoying because the story does not run smoothly.  And Colin Farrell?  It's a little ironic that the woman he married has a resemblence to the woman in his illicit sex tape.  He's an alright actor, but he's a rude, drunken slob and I can't get past it.  Alexander would be flipping over in his grave.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>My only reason for seeing this film is because Colin Farrell is in the lead.  I realize some people are not too keen about Farrell but he is a changed man.  He is married and a father.  Yes, he has alot of energy and vigor, but he is a tireless, versitle actor and a darn good one at that.  He is also Irish and that makes him good too.  I have seen Colin Farrell in many different roles.  He just keeps getting better.  One day, he will win the Academy Award.<br />  First of all, I can not believe Oliver Stone directed this film.  Some of his other films had those choppy, quick frames and the hand-held moving camcorder effect I do not care for.  No one likes a dramatic scene where the camera keeps moving around like an earthquake and you can't really make out anything.<br />  This story of Alexander takes place in perspective at 333 B.C., 48 years before Joel(?), after the historical accounts in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible.  Around the time Egypt was reconquered by Persians and when the Samaritan temple was built on Mount Gerizim.  Still confused?<br />  Well, just sit back and enjoy the strong performance of Colin Farrell with a cast of Jared Leto, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.<br />  The Director's Cut includes violent scenes, sexual scenes of man/woman, male and female nudity and scenes that imply bisexuality.  I have read their were several scenes of nudity and bisexuality in the theatrical version that will not be seen in this Director's Cut DVD version due to the fact Oliver Stone cut the scenes out.<br />  ***Warning:  This particular Disc froze 1 hour and 25 minutes into the film after Colin says, "I wonder...did you ever love him?".  It froze on Angelina Jolie's reaction and skipped 9 minutes of footage.<br />  If you see black space followed by the map of Hindu Kush, your DVD has skipped 9 minutes of important scenes.  Rewind it back.<br />  Disc 2 is the Special Features.  It includes 1 hour and 26 minutes of Behind-the-Scenes of "Alexander", Tease Trailer, Theatrical trailer, "Vangelis scores Alexander" (musical score), DVD-Rom Features.<br /><br />***Update: Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.<br />  As of February 2007, Oliver Stone has released the unrated version on DVD at 214 min (3 hrs, 34 min.). This will be the complete, longest, uncensored version.<br />  The theatrical version was only at 175 min.<br />  The Director's Cut (DVD) was only at 167 imn.<br />  The new Final Cut (DVD) runs at 214 min.<br /><br />The new DVD version "Alexander Revisted: The Final Cut" includes 39 minutes of footage never seen in the movie theatres and 47 minutes of footage not shown in the previous DVD Director's Cut version.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>Sorry but I was very disappointed in this film! The Story of Alexander is a great one and a good moral lesson to boot. The man went out and basically took over a huge chunk of the known old world. He was one hell of a soldier and General. But He also wound up as a monster and a tryant who had lost his soul in the loneliness and madness of being an absolute monarch. Who was probadly was poisoned by his nobles in Bagdad as they were terrified of him.<br />  Also his conquest helped fianance the Hellenistic Age which established Greek Culture as one of the Pillars of Western Civilisation. That would of been nice to mention in the film. Or the establishment of that lovely city in Egypt with the nice library.<br />  But instead we get this dogs breakfast with some very good special effects. That basically said that he was Gay and incidentally kicked The Persian Empires butt. I have no problem with the established historical fact that he was either gay or bisexual or whatever. But there is a whole lot more to the story than just this.<br />  Like why did he do this all this fighting? (Avenge the Persian Invasion of Greece  a century before) Why did they drink like fish back then? (All soldiers drink to a greater or lessor degree)Why did Alexander kill his oldest ,best General and his family? (Because of raging insecurity after his pages tried to kill him) Why did the Army refuse to go into India? (It would of been nice to have one of the enlisted tell us why. Like "I wanna go home & I want to spend my loot!")<br />Hopefully some one some day will do this story justice but I guess its not today!<br />(Hint go see Michael Woods In the Footsteps of Al the Great)</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>"Newly inspired, faster paced, more action packed!" shouts the DVD cover of Oliver Stone's "Alexander: Director's Cut." That new inspiration came the hard way: from the lashing "Alexander" took from legions of critics and from the $150 million film's humiliation at U.S. boxoffices.<br /><br />Director Stone took the opportunity to re-edit key scenes, lengthening here and shortening there. A pair of flashbacks from Alexander the Great's youth now appear later in the film, shaking up the third act and making the epic less linear. But not  necessarily better.<br /><br />A "beautiful and so tender scene" between the king and his male lover hits the floor as Stone tones down the bisexual content. "I can't tell you how many 'real guys' are turned off to this s--t," Stone explains.<br /><br />"Alexander II" loses only eight minutes from the original three-hour running time, though, and the elements that inspired all that hooting and cackling remain: Colin Farrell's goofy blond locks, Alexander's Irish brogue, the odd casting of Angelina Jolie as his mother, Jolie's Natasha-the-cartoon-spy accent, and so on.<br /><br />Those drawn to the DVD by the promise of an improved and intensified film won't have an experience differing all that much from the one in theaters. Expecting little -- and equipped with pause buttons -- many first-time viewers will wonder what the fuss was over this offbeat and mostly entertaining biopic -- probably best approached as an overgrown sword-and-sandal movie, a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Warner released "Alexander" in two double-disc sets: Stone's new cut and the original theatrical. The two versions are not available in one package, unfortunately, and fans springing for both sets will be disappointed to find nearly identical extras. Images are widescreen (about 2.40:1) with brilliant colors and steely sharpness when it is called for. The 5.1 audio deploys the battle scenes with efficiency (sorry, no DTS).<br /><br />Stone works solo on the director's cut commentary. He points out the new changes and offers brief explanations for making them. The goal, basically, was "to keep it moving." Much of Stone's talk is repeated on the theatrical DVD's commentary, which edits in observations from historical adviser Robin Lane Fox. Stone does a good job, but the commentary with Fox is stronger and you learn a lot about the real Alexander.<br /><br />Disc 2 features an hour-and-a-half documentary directed in ragged but effective style by Stone's son Sean. His total access resulted in an unusually candid portrait of a production working through a swarm of problems in lands such as Morocco, Thailand and India. Vangelis pretends to be scoring the film in a brief extra. The movie's frenzied teaser and trailer are included, both faster paced and action packed.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>Alexander was very....long. It was good but a bit too long if you ask me. I'm pretty weak when it comes to Greek history so trying to follow all of what was going on was impossible for me. The movie zips along and if you get a little lost you're totally lost. So I just sat there and enjoyed what I could.<br /><br />The acting was very good. Angelina Jolie is BEAUTIFUL!!! Colin Farrel does a great job acting although I don't buy him as her son.<br /><br />The audience in the theater I was in was like a bunch of 12 year olds in sex ed class where they giggle every time somebody says the word [...]. Nobody said [...] in Alexander but there is a scene between him and his best friend Jared Leto and it's rather romantic. There's no kissing. In fact they don't kiss at all. Jared Leto is the love of Colin Farrel's life and all they do is hug throughout the entire movie. Colin Farrel does kiss a guy (briefly) but it's done in a joking way. Anyway, in the scene with Jared Leto the audience reverted back to kindergarten and they couldn't control their urge to giggle at the queer boys.<br /><br />The way the director handled Alexander's relationship with... whatever his name is..., Jared Leto,  was really disappointing. Alexander marries this [....] who you can't help but hate and there's a whole sex scene there. But the person Alexander truly loves just gets a hug every now and then. Even towards the end where Jared Leto is dying there is no show of affection.<br /><br />So this movie is really crappy if you're looking for a love story. Alexander goes kiss his mother though. That was pretty hot.<br /><br />Other than that, Angelina Jolie is fantastic, although they could have used her more, and the cinematography is beautiful! They story is too hard to follow though. I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars. Not worth the price of a ticket.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Althought I had seen this film on the big screen and though it received indifferent reviews, it's still worth seeing in High-Definition. I bought this at a premium price in HD DVD and the quality is so astounding that I'm willing to forgive the flaws in Stone's epic.  Among them is the casting of Colin Farrell, who though not terribly bad, tends to overplay his scenes as Alexander yet other roles come out better such as Jolie's manipulative mother and Kilmer as Philip, the lustful father.  Also as inviting as the scenery and battle scenes is the luscious, exotic Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, the Persian beauty that Alexander claims but loses.  The seduction scenes between her and Farrell really kept my blood rolling as I watched it!!  At least this film is a big improvement over the boring, talky 1955 version with Richard Burton and Frederic March!!  As Stone states in his introduction for those who hated the film--you will probably hate it more in this version.  But for those of you who did admire this flawed masterpiece (it did much better in Europe than here!!) in the theater--you'll love the riches Stone has added to this version.  Definitely worth seeing in HD DVD or Blu-ray!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>I have to admit Colin Farrell is not the sort of actor I would ever envisage  as Alexander the Great, despite this he does do the role credit despite what many people have said.<br />Angelina Jolie howver is brilliant as his witch Queen mother, beauiful, seductive and full of feminine wiles whilst Val Kilmer gives a great performance as the doomed father of Alexander who does not see his son's worth.<br />There are some great battle scenes, fabulous scenary, stunning costumes, and all in all the cast gel together to make it a watchable movie for the older members in your family.<br />My only complaint is that it is rather long winded in parts but other than that it is a pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>To make an epic feature, first you need a historical character.  Choose a king, or a tyrant, and be prepared to show him as both beloved of the people, and disliked for his mistakes, usually the mistakes that come from the Shakespearian tragic hero conceit of having too much pride (hubris) or being too driven on a certain goal that he neglects other important aspects of rulership.<br /><br />Secondly, you need beautiful people to fill predominant roles.  Choose someone like Colin Farrell, since he's popular, and Angelina Jolie for a seductress.  Choose Jared Leto to be a pretty boy and Rosario Dawson for the historical character's wife.  Then fill all of the extras and back-up roles with ugly fat men and maybe the occassional ethnic woman or two.<br /><br />About the dialog, there are three types: first... there's the dramatic whisper...which you put pauses in between each clause... and then inflex the voice down at the end; secondlythere'sthesomewhatloudbutfastpacedmediumdialog that ends with each word carefully accented; THIRDLY EVERYONE MUST YELL AT EACHOTHER IMPORTANTLY!  Important scenes should contain transitions between all three types.<br /><br />No epic feature should ever be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes long.  Include long marches and sand-and-sandal imagery.  Have slow, whispery dialog speeches that last ten minutes.  Include epic battle scenes that contain about a thousand aerial shots of armies clashing cross-cut with close-ups of people screaming with the occassional sudden cut of two bodies running into each other and falling down.<br /><br />And the most important thing you need to do to make a typical epic feature: at any point it seems the story might be able to end, make something happen just to make quite clear to the audience that the end is never, ever coming.<br /><br />Those are the rules Oliver Stone adhered to in order to put some meat, so to speak, on his analysis of the conquerer Alexander the Great.  I can see what he wanted to do... too bad he left all the important stuff to a five minute battle about two and half hours into the film.  The rest of it was just kind of filler space,  with the only seemingly inherent interest being the homosexuality.  I think he put that in there just so that people'd have something to talk about before the climactic battle at the end.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>So, according to Oliver Stone, who's never met a piece of history he didn't want to distort, Alexander the Great was a girly man crybaby who let his own men insult and belittle him throughout his whole quest for greatness. The very fact that Stone sensationalized the homosexual malarkey of his Alexander cut the rug out from under this film's feet before it ever hit theatres. Alexander the Great is a name that has resounded throughout history for over two millennia - but the history of that story somehow wasn't good enough for Stone. I think even Freud would shudder at the thought of someone who is not a psychologist or even an historian trying to psychoanalyze a man who died over three hundred years before the birth of Christ. It's unfortunate because this could have been a powerful film.<br /><br />Skipping back and forth across Alexander's life (Stone apparently thinks is a devilishly clever way to tell a story), we follow the great conqueror's story from his childhood to his death through the eyes of Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins). Born to Philip of Macedon and his exotic first wife Olympias (Angelina Jolie) -who claimed Alexander was the son of Zeus -Alexander (Colin Farrell) had a complicated childhood. Olympias groomed him to be the next king, worrying all the while that Philip would not recognize him as the legitimate heir. Interestingly, Olympias doesn't seem to age a day between Alexander's birth and his ascendancy to the throne at the age of nineteen. We're talking about Angelina Jolie here, so I couldn't get past the thought that this is an Oedipus complex just waiting to happen. Anyway, Alexander replaces his murdered father, sets off north to establish his control over the tribes there, and then just keeps heading east conquering everything that gets in his way. After his daring defeat of Persia's King Darius, he fights his way all the way into India, farther than anyone before him had ever gone. If he had known those Indian tribes had war elephants, I daresay Alexander might have just turned around at the border and headed back home early. Instead, his military exploits extend over seven years. We hear him talk about assimilating the conquered peoples, and he certainly likes to build Alexandrias all over the place, but this grand vision theme of Alexander's life doesn't get enough play in the movie to sufficiently explain his motives.<br /><br />The movie does have some strengths. The battle scenes are very impressive (except the end of the final one, when Stone decides to get artistic with it), especially Alexander's ill-fated fight with the elephant-equipped Indian tribes. Blood and guts are spilled on an epic scale. Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing as Alexander's devious, snake-loving mother - but I have no idea where that accent of hers was supposed to have come from. Speaking of strange accents, Colin Farrell sometimes sounded to me like he should have been leading Braveheart's forces. He never became Alexander in my eyes - there just wasn't enough substance to his character. If the film had been nothing but battle scenes, Farrell would have been more convincing; it's the scenes taking place between battles that leads this film astray. Most of this time is spent watching Alexander exchange meaningful glances with pretty boys wearing more makeup than Jezebel. The rest of the time consists of all those loyal men who supposedly adore their brave king whining about the length of the campaign, criticizing Alexander's motives and strategy, and making snide remarks about his heritage. There's no way Alexander the Great let his men talk to him the way they do throughout this film. There's really not much leadership on display by here. Alexander's brave, certainly, but he's no Patton.<br /><br />Basically, Oliver Stone does a great disservice to Alexander the Great, passing him off as a dandy with little strategic genius and even less control over men who supposedly loved and respected him enough to fight and die for him thousands of miles from home. Stone's characterization of Alexander is just plain weird - and that's the whole problem with this movie. Let's hope that the youth of today and tomorrow don't see this film and actually believe they're seeing an accurate picture of Alexander the Great because Stone's Alexander ain't all that great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Yes, I sat through the 3 hours.  I thought with Oliver Stone  directing and Anthony Hopkins co-starring there might be SOME substance, but the film is basically 3 hours of yelling, Roman-style fighting, and Jolie's laughably fake accent.  Nothing could have saved this turkey.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This was a juvenile, comic-book treatment of one of the most accomplished leaders in recorded history.  From the repeated gore of battles to the ridiculous sounding of Greek names, everything about this movie was poorly done . . just plain inane.<br /><br />Implying that his mother had a hand in the murder of his father, and that Alexander took his own life after the death of his friend and lover was ridiculously speculative and made no sense.  The insistence that he  felt a mission to be "politically correct" in his dealings with those he conquered was far from historically accurate.  He wanted to Hellenize the world, but that didn't mean that he thought that the Greeks were any less than the most civilized people on Earth.<br /><br />When he continually referred to his actions in the "known world" one has to wonder why he would use this term . . unless he knew of the existence of some "unknown world."  We can look back and realize that the Greeks had no knowledge of the Chinese or American or other distant civilizations but he didn't know that.<br /><br />All in all, it was 2-1/2 hours too long.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>To believe many of the critics, professionals and movie mavens alike, Alexander is one of the worst movies ever made.  It is not.  In fact, it is quite good...in spots.<br /><br />The film drags a bit.  The story line moves back and forth in time, alternating between Alexander as king and conqueror and as son/heir apparent to Phillip.  Some like that device.  I, personally, feel that it is overused, somewhat cliche.<br /><br />The characters are well developed.  Colin Ferrell and the rest of the cast did admirable work.  The battle scenes are enjoyable but sometimes confusing (particularly the battle at Guagamela) and few and far between.<br /><br />Post Braveheart, movies about "great" men tend to deify them, tend to thrust upon the virtues or values of our civilization.  It was a bit hard to swallow that Alexander wanted conquer the then known world, not for riches, the spoils of war or the glory of conquest, but to free slaves and spread Greek civilization to the "heathens."  This much is suggested by Alexander in the film, a position that seems to starkly contrast berating of his generals for viewing Asians as an inferior civilization/people.<br /><br />There is a lot of information packed in the story.  One of the side benefits of a film like this is that it causes history lovers (like me) to learn the "true" story about Alexander, his family, his enemies, etc.<br /><br />Much is made about the bi-sexuality exhibited.  Anyone that has even a cursory knowledge of ancient history knows or has heard that Greek men were lovers of other men and kept women as wives and mothers.  I certainly don't proclaim to be an expert on the subject, but it seemed that the "men" or "boys" to which Alexander and his generals were attracted were extremely effeminate, almost drag queens.  I understand that Greek men loved men precisely because they were men, not because they looked like flat-chested women.  It is a rather minor point, but since the sexual themes in the film seem never to be ignored, it is worth discussion.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good film.  It's by no means great.  I wouldn't purchase Alexander, but it's worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>How bad can a movie be?  If TROY wasn't bad enough, now we have to sit through something even worse?  A hero and actor playing him even worse than Brad Pitt as Achilles.  Over the top violence, stop spearing the horse already.  Ridiculous accents by everyone involved including Jolie.  Oliver Stone needs to get a grip or an editor for his screenplays.  This one was terribly disjointed and very confusing.  The viewer doesn't even like Alexander or anyone else.  Nothing compelling in the film whatsoever.  I would not recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />This was such a bad movie. I wanted to like it, I love the Alexander legends! But it was so sadly poor to be almost pathetic. Angelia Jolie was an utter wooden disaster in her role.  The movie just didn't hang together and the character relationships were lacking. It wasn't at all the rousing epic it was supposed to be.  Too much pomp and not enough circumstance.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I understand that the story of Alexander the Great has been told many times.  Alas, though, this 2004 Oliver Stone version just doesn't work.<br /><br />Collin Farrell is cast as Alexander.  His acting is fine, if not exceptional.  But the material he has to work with is awful.  First of all, Angelina Jolie just isn't convincing as Alexander's mother.  Second of all, there is an overriding theme of Alexander and his male companion, Jarad Leto, having an intimate relationship.  This is only hinted at however and as far as romantic scenes are concerned, a lot more time is given to Alexander and Rosario Dawson, cast as his wife, Roxanne.<br /><br />The film is full of pomp and wise old men, such as Anthony Hopkins, cast as Aristotle, saying wise things.  Naturally, there are a lot of long and boring battle scenes.  And, worst of all, the film is almost three full hours long.<br /><br />I wish I could say something nice about this film but I can't.  My advice is just don't waste your time.  Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>I even like Colin too, but he's speaking in an IRISH accent the whole movie. Angelina's accent is Russian, and the movie is just one bad turn after another. It's almost unwatchable. A guy on the plane sitting next to me (with no sound) said it looked like a horrible movie just glancing at it.<br /><br />You want to watch it because you think it can't be THAT bad, it's a big budget production after all. Think again..<br /><br />The sad thing is we'll have to wait another 10-20 yrs for someone to remake Alexander the way it should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Compared to most epics it was historically accurate although some liberties were taken (i.e the horse didn't die in that battle but from old age, etc).<br /><br />However, the battle of Gaugemala, the snakes of his mother, the winning over of the horse tied to its shadow, his father missing an eye . . . wow, I could go on for pages but there's a lot that's on the money.<br /><br />Focus was more on philosophical and academic teachings to the audience which I could see having a negative impact.  You need to watch this film closely to get it or you will get lost.  Trying to do something else, as I found, will make you miss important moments.<br /><br />Accents were mostly Celtic/Irish and most Historians feel the Macedonians were Celts anyway.<br /><br />Negative aspects?  Lots of stories going on and flashbacks hopping back and forth. Some people may not get or be turned off by the massive symbolism.<br /><br />I can see American audiences having problems w/ the film as Alexander as portrayed as pan sexual and in touch with his feminine side.  American heroes are super masculine right now.<br /><br />Additionally, his parents did a good job of messing him up emotionally, so, some people might see him as weak even though, at his height, he controlled more square miles than the Roman Empire at its height.<br /><br />Would have liked to have seen the razing of Thebes but they took that out.  Not sure if they did the Gordian Knot routine.<br /><br />Again, extremely accurate in History compared to most epic films . . . they even used Mary Renault's old books on Alexander for the digging up of ideas.<br /><br />MY GRADE: B.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Hollywood has rediscovered epics -- "Braveheart" and "Gladiator," and recently the tepid "Troy" and outstanding "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Now we get "Alexander," an overwrought biopic about legendary conqueror Alexander the Great... or as he is shown here, Alexander the dewy-eyed pretty boy. Zeus help us.<br /><br />Alexander (Colin Farrell) was groomed for greatness as a boy, by his drunken oaf father (Val Kilmer) and his snake-worshiping mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed he was the son of the god Zeus himself. And gradually Alexander became a legendary leader of armies.<br /><br />He married the fiery Persian princess Roxanne (Rosario Dawson) but was really in love with Hephaiston (Jared Leto), a friend of his who becomes more than just an old pal. And oh yeah, he also conquered the entire known world (at the time) before dying at the age of thirty-two.<br /><br />Too bad Baz Luhrmann ditched the idea of doing his own Alexander biopic -- assuredly he could only have made something better than the turgid "Alexander." The movie is the most inadvertantly funny thing I've seen in ages. Stone displays all the directorial subtlety of a sledgehammer, using tired cliches like flower petals, harps, snakes and an eagle.<br /><br />"Alexander" is pretty clearly not meant to be a comedy, yet the dialogue is really really funny. It has been decades since a film was so pompous and overwrought --  it has lines like "Conquer your fear and you will conquer death." The story itself isn't much better, focusing less on Alexander as a warrior and conquerer -- and skirting the moral debates of "the great" killing so many for his vision of unity.  Instead, we get his longings for Hephaiston, and his peculiar Oedipal vibe with Olympias. Oy. Stone could have shown Alexander with all his sins and flaws, but decided to purify his image.<br /><br />Which is a shame, since it definitely takes away from the epic quality. The battles are dull enough that I found myself looking at Farrell's dark roots and miniskirt toga. And while much ado is made is about the "brave" love story between Alexander and Hephaiston, Stone shies away from actually showing anything more than smoldering looks. Interesting, since he shows two women being raped onscreen, with Dawson going topless.<br /><br />That love story, which is the unofficial center of the film, is especially disappointing because Hephaiston is merely the object of Alexander's hormones. Stone could have shown them as more than just lovers -- Hephaiston as a friend, as a companion, as a pillar of support to a very stressed Alexander. Instead, he's just Jared Leto in eye makeup. So much for depth.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is a solid and talented young man. But for whatever reason, he just doesn't have the presence that Alexander requires. Not his fault -- he does his best. Leto has the presence of a dead fish, and Dawson does what she can with her underused role. Angelina Jolie is perhaps the most enjoyable to watch. Despite her Natasha Fatale accent, she vamps it up in an almost campy way.<br /><br />"Alexander" has some good acting by Farrell and its leading ladies, but sadly the whole film is a ridiculous, overwrought mess. Well, there's a reason Stone didn't call it "Alexander the Great." "Alexander the Grating" is more like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>'Alexander' has proven that Oliver Stone hasn't lost his touch at making excellent movies. The acting in the movie is fantastic. Even though Colin and some of the others aren't Greek, the cast is still perfect. I love biographical films and this is one of the best I have seen dealing with the subject of ancient times.<br /><br />This film has been given so many negative reviews that it didn't deserve. 'Alexander' is definitely excellent compared to some movies that Hollywood has been putting out recently. The scenery to the story itself is beautiful. There are moments that are truly breath-taking. The visuals of the film are complemented with the music score that really does set the mood for the film and matches the scenes perfectly. 'Alexander', in it's entirety, is definitely something to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Before I get into the review of "Alexander" I must say that I was looking forward to seeing this movie before it was released to theaters.  My thinking was it stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie, plus it's directed by Oliver Stone how could this movie be bad.  Well, needless to say it managed to be not only bad, but horrendous.  After several friends of mine saw the film and hated it, their reasons were vast and shared by many, here are a few examples of their complaints; too slow, too much focus on homosexuality (Alexander the Great was believed to have been bisexual which was common among Greeks, yet this film paints him as only being gay), there's no sense of a greater destiny for the character, horrible editing and time jumps, just to name a few.  But for the DVD release Warner Brothers announced that Oliver Stone had re-edited his would-be epic film and now it is about 30 minutes shorter, much faster paced with more action, and a more balanced view of his sexuality (basically giving more screentime to Rosario Dawson as his wife, Roxanne).  So like an idiot I took the bait, and rented "Alexander: The Director's Cut", now since I never saw the theatrical release I can't say how much faster paced this version was, but to me the pace was excruciatingly slow and still focused too heavily on homosexuality.  But that's enough gripes for now, let's move on to the outline for the story and then I'll gripe some more at the end, but I do have a few good things to say as well for the film, so please read on.<br /><br />"Alexander: The Director's Cut" follows the life and conquests of the man history has dubbed `Alexander the Great'.  Alexander was born of royal blood, his father was King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), a rough, womanizing, drunk of a man; and his mother was Olympia (Angelina Jolie) who many believed to be a mystic and whom herself believed to be a descendant of the gods.  With parents like these Alexander was destined to be somewhat messed up, yet he managed to overcome these two powerfully controlling forces and become one of the greatest leaders and military tacticians of all time.  After the death of King Philip, Alexander assumes the throne and sets off on a quest to conquer the known world.  From the deserts of Afghanistan and Persia to the lush forests of Asia, Alexander's ingenuity for military tactics enabled him to defeat almost any foe he encountered.<br /><br />Now this story sounds intriguing, but Oliver Stone manages to butcher it with terrible editing and time jumps through Alexander's life.  In one moment Alexander is a teenager, the next we're 20 years into the future and he has already conquered several countries.  Also though no sexually explicit scenes between men were shown it was heavily implied, especially between Alexander and his best friend Hephastion (Jared Leto).  This strong overtone of homosexuality wouldn't have been so distracting if it wasn't in every single scene, plus the fact that Alexander is believed to have been bisexual meaning there should have been more focus on the women of Alexander's life.  And yet another problem was that you really don't care for Alexander, in epic films like this you should care for what is going to happen to the central character, whether he lives or dies, whether he will triumph or fail.  In this movie I found myself not caring at all, I would have been fine if Alexander would have died during the first battle, at least the movie would have been over sooner.  Truthfully, the most interesting characters in the film, and the ones I wanted to know more about were Alexander's parents, King Philip and Olympia.  That alone tells you how much of a failure this film is for Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Many people gripe that the casting was all wrong, actually I felt the casting was great, Colin Farrell was very good as Alexander, he just didn't have much to work with, and Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie were outstanding as the controlling parents of history's greatest conqueror.  The casting was not what made this movie fail, as I have alluded to in my complaints of this movie, the biggest reason for "Alexander" failing at the box office and on DVD is none other than Oliver Stone himself.  Oliver Stone is known for making very complex and engaging movies, and for loving controversy which is probably why he infused so much homosexuality in this movie.  If Stone would have just gotten beyond his penchant for controversy and focused more on Alexander's conquests rather than his much debated love life, this film could have been the grand epic it aspired to be.<br /><br />"Alexander: The Director's Cut" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>At this stage, one can only add a silly two cents' worth regarding Oliver Stone's finest film ALEXANDER (2004). One thing that strikes me is how hard it is to recall this film is only six years old. It seems like something out of the 1990s now.<br /><br />This film as historical novelization is, in a word, pure Stone. I love the depth and detail Stone powers into the audience here: close-ups of the Persians is a good example, as is his closing shots of classical images of Alexander including a statue of the Buddha (made first by Greeks and no doubt bearing Alexander's face). I love how Sir Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy in old age, as the Pharaoh Ptolemy) refers to him in proper Greek, as "Megas Alexandros".<br /><br />Its two hour and forty-some-odd minutes running time is tiresome only in two areas: I do not like excessively operatic acting/music injected where it is not needed, and I do not like drawn-out, confusing battle scenes. Adding slo-mo as Stone loves to do so often does not help matters.<br /><br />What I do love is Colin Farrell as Alexander, silly Irish accent and all. (They even had Connor Paolo, as the young Alexander, beef up the Irish so he'd "fit" with Colin). Lordy, how he was mocked when this film was first released. Who the hell is Colin Farrell? What's with the Irish accent? Yet people mocked his bleached hair, so we did know him a little, after all. Well, my take on it is that it is Farrell's finest hour. He'd never reach this level of acting again.<br /><br />Actually, 'the Irish' gets even more annoying as Louisiana-born Jared Leto (as Alexander's boyfriend Hephaistion) puts on the blarney as well. I guess Stone figured to hell with it, let the Irish accent imply Macedonian heritage. And if I'm not in error, at least one Scots as well...let the Greeks talk British English. Only Val Kilmer as Alexander's father King Filipos [Phillip] managed to keep some reasonable distance from over-indulgence. I cannot fathom why Stone had the other actors speaking with silly accents...when they spoke at all.<br /><br />Anyway, with that off my chest, I have a couple of personal angles to approach with this film. While I love the unabashed showing of Alexander and Hephaistion's relationship as man-and-husband, it is to Stone's eternal shame that he did not have the courage to show it all properly. He did not shy away from Alexander's near-rape of his Persian wife "Roxane" (the eternally annoying Rosario Dawson). I might commend him on his beautiful display of the gorgeous Francisco Bosch as Alexander's male concubine Bagoas--yet the studios forced Stone to cut the lovemaking scenes between the men. It amounted to a half hour of footage.<br /><br />It was revolting to me the way Stone ultimately reduced the Greeks, Persians and Aryans to cardboard cut-out figures. Maybe he wanted us to see them the way Macedonians saw them, but I think it was pure laziness. The odd comparison Stone seems to make between Indians and monkeys made my blood boil. Maybe that's just me, but it looked fairly obvious.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer, in his cameo as Aristotle, was a delight and I loved seeing their map of the world as he taught young Alexander. I must also make a special mention of the great Elliot Cowan as young Ptolemy, because he is a believable young Anthony Hopkins--not easy! The last time that was tried was in THE HUMAN STAIN by young and beautiful Wentworth Miller in 2003--and it failed.<br /><br />Jared Leto deserves massive kudos. I know he's a weirdo and no one seems to like him anymore, but he's brash, he's beautiful and he can act his little heinie off here. The way he bores into Colin's eyes with his...love is in the air. Not just anyone can do that. I've heard Leto say he's "asexual" in real life and I know he's had fake gal pals and has a daughter. But that boy is GAY.<br /><br />Vangelis' score, though a bit too lush during battle scenes, is spot-on...I only wish there had been less of it and less volume. An operatic film like this, with its mad scene-chewing, is made worse only by equally operatic music. Ah well. It's film, not history class!<br /><br />I hope I will be forgiven for giving the names of the other actors a bit of a miss here. Go to the Internet Movie Database if you're that anxious to know. I don't see they deserve singling out since this film couldn't help the career of the brave and beautiful Francisco Bosch. There can be no denying it: either you'll despise every second of this film or you'll adore it in a general way. It's a lot better than the miserable TROY, I can tell you that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Am I alone in realizing the inherent beauty of "Alexander". Colin Farrell deserved an Oscar for those last few moments alone, on his deathbed. As much as a non-fan as I am of Colin, even I had to admit that this is perhaps his best performance on screen, even better than his one in "A Home at the Center of the World".<br /><br />One thing that might turn off viewers is the stunning Angelina Jolie with an accent you will either love or hate. Its hard to be neutral to this accent. Its pretty much the same accent she had on in both "Beowulf" AND "A Mighty Heart" which leads me to believe that this woman is wretched at putting on a specific accent for a film. Whether its Eastern European, Greek, Mixed-Race, or Black, Jolie sounds exactly the same - a weird Mediterranean meets Shakira accent that I couldn't quite get into. I think this was the films' only negative.<br /><br />The superb direction inevitably made me want to compare this to "Kingdom of Heaven", a movie that this shares many similarities with. However, I must say that this is not a classic as that film is, though it does have its' moments. Yes, I too had problems accepting a bleach-blond Colin Farrell in the beginning, and the tedious narration by Anthony Hopkins is almost hilarious, but it strangely works.<br /><br />Also, Alexanders' two major love stories - one with Hephastion, his male friends, and the other with what is seemingly his jungle-queen wife - are treated with respect, but also with caution. There is an unnecessary scene of heterosexual copulation that bordered on the absurd, and I only wish they had deleted this from the final cut of the film. As expected, the same-sex angle is conveniently relegated to second side-show, with the two men occasionally hugging and patting each other on the back as if they were long lost brothers. Many viewers found this a little too 'safe', and so did I.<br /><br />Doubtless, the many flaws this film has only make it more enjoyable. It IS long, but it has its share of cheesy moments, scenes of grandeur, and a script that comes alive at the most unexpected places. For all its cliches and horrible accents, this is a film that is awash in color and brightness, and Colin Farrell's single-minded devotion to his childhood sweetheart is only revealed to us during the films' climax, which was to me far more affecting than other historical films of this genre.<br /><br />Four Stars. You might laugh at it, cringe at it, but you still can't help loving it. A Cult Film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.<br /><br />Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.<br /><br />The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.<br /><br />Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.<br /><br />On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points. It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time.<br /><br />This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>There are only two battle scenes in the entire 214 minutes.

This film was doomed from the start with an ill-suited director, a horrible screenplay, a poor script, senseless editing, bad casting, and mediocre acting by most of the main actors.<br /><br />Oliver Stone was probably the worst choice for an epic historical film as Stone's specialty lies exclusively in the relatively narrow domain of the post-1960s Americana genre.  Stone's greatest talent in direction is with themes reflecting the pop-culture and post-modernist American values found in "Platoon", "JFK", "Nixon", or "Natural Born Killers", but not historical epics such as the life and times of Alexander The Great.  Stone's closest attempt at filming a historical epic was with "Conan The Barbarian" and, because of his inability to competently direct such films, he was quickly reduced to a minimal role by John Milius who took full direction to save the film from certain doom.  In addition to wasting film on simply non-sequential scenes for "Conan", Stone actually wanted to use disco for the theme music and Milius ardently insisted on hiring Basil Poledoris to compose the memorable score.  In the case of Alexander, Stone's rather narrow direction skills led to a completely incoherent theme emphasizing on Alexander's homosexuality as being a significant factor to his greatness when it actually wasn't.  As a result, the audience is left with a long film showing Alexander as the hip post-modern psychadelic leader whose main motive for conquering the world was to overcome his insecurity of being gay and spread his gay rights agenda to a desperate and intolerant world.<br /><br />Stone's emphasis on Alexander's bisexual orientation was simply a wasted opportunity and an inappropriate thematic emphasis as Alexander's motives and achievements had little to do with being bisexual.  Actually, Alexander did not like sexual intercourse at all regardless of whether a man or woman was in his bed.  Stone presents Alexander as a sobbing and confused gay sentimentalist in desperate need for his mother's approval and more concerned about his uncertain relationship with Hephaestion's companioship than with conquering the world.  Although Alexander did have a troubled relationship with Olympias, he was hardly the little insecure boy always coming back to his mother as portrayed by Stone and the film wastes too much time on developing their relationship.  Alexander was all too happy to leave his overly ambitious mother behind and to never see her again after he set off to conquer Persia: their relationship was therefore moot after that point whereas Stone falsely portrays it as an ongoing issue.  This was hardly the case as Alexander was probably the most confident leader in history who knew exactly what he wanted from an early age: to be king of Greece and conquer the world!  This is why Phillip told him when he was young, "My son, ask for yourself another kingdom for that which I leave is too small for thee!"  In contrast to Stone's distorted depiction, Alexander's motivations for conquering Persia where essentially the same as Phillips which were to, (1) keep the Greek city-states busy fighting the Persians instead of themselves or Macedonia; (2) to control the vastest economic empire in ancient history by taking its treasures and trade routes; and, (3) to take revenge on Persia for their burning of Athens a century before.  The only difference between Alexander and Phillip is that Alexander rejoiced in the thrill of battle, conquest, and exploration a lot more than Phillip's pragmatic approach to politics and diplomacy reflected by his proverbial statement, "Treat boys with fists and men with oaths!"  Alexander was never really interested in the pragmatic administration of the State and was more than happy to squander his treasures to continue his campaigns of conquest and exploration to the end of the then known world.  Another poor depiction of Alexander by Stone is that of his relationship with Roxeanne.  Stone portrays Roxeanne as Alexander's first wife and of great importance when in fact she was his third wife and the least important of the three.  Alexander married Roxeanne for purely pragmatic reasons and took her more as a hostage than a regal spouse who was to provide an heir to rule his entire kingdom.  Alexander's military resources were being bogged down in Bactria by petty mountain tribes who were carrying out somewhat succesful guerrilla operations against Alexander's forces.  Roxeanne was the daughter of the strongest chieftain in Bactria and so he took her as a bride/hostage to assure her father's good behavior while Alexander went East to conquer India.  Alexander impregnated Roxeanne so that he could in the future establish a direct bloodline to rule that difficult province instead of relying on the whims of local chieftains who had limited alliegiance to him.  The most absurd part in the film is where Alexander is intimidated by Roxeanne and cowers before her like a little boy.  Alexander intimidated!?  I doubt he would have been considered great if that had been true as there would be nothing more disgraceful in that time for a Greek man to cower before a woman of virtually insignificant lineage and a barbarian one to boot.  Please! The film also fails to capture Alexander's genius and grandeur by including his cutting of the Gordion Knot and his crowning as pharao after his visit to Siwa. The plot and theme of this film is also further diluted by failing to develop the perspective of the Persians and Darius III.  The film essentially has no antagonists and therfore no climactic tension to hold any suspense worth speaking of.  In short, the film getting bogged down in Stone's emphasis on Alexander's sexuality completely brushed over these crucial aspects of Alexander's true character and motives as well as the environment he found himself in.  As a result, the audience is left yawning in boredom watching a sobbing and overly gay Alexander who cowered before the women in his life and went conquering the world for self-esteem and to propagate his (or rather Stone's) post-modernist liberal agenda.  It is quite unlikely that Stone's Alexander would have been able to last even a month in leading a vast army of hardened veterans with such a weak personality not to speak of 13 years.<br /><br />The casting was also poor in the making of this film.  Farrel simply had too little charisma and acting talent to portray Alexander as even the great Richard Burton couldn't pull it off fifty years before in Rossen's film.  In addition, Stone's pointless direction along with the already defective screenplay and defective script utterly ruined any chance for Farrel to act the part of Alexander in a convincing way.  Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer pulled it off best even though Jolie's awkward accent tended to come off more as overacting by an actress who is insecure about her role.  Rosario Dawson was also a terrible casting decision for Roxeanne as the real Roxeanne was caucasian and not black/mulato.  She was also considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world after the women in Darius' family.  Although Dawson is relatively attractive, among the many gorgeous actresses who could have played the part she is certainly not one who generally invokes the sense of being the most beautiful woman in the world by any contemporary standard.  One of the worst performances surprisingly was that of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy whose monotonous narrative cries out "God! When will I be done with this horrible script!" throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Stone limiting Alexander's campaign to just the battles of Gaugamela and Jehlum also didn't justice to the greatness of Alexander who never lost a major battle in his entire military career.  Every conqueror or general who came after him from Caesar to Schwarzkopff felt only disappointment at not being able to come even close to his military greatness.  The battle of Gaugamela is abruptly introduced without showing how Alexander got there after brilliantly defeating Persia at Granicus or Issus.  The film simply shifts from Ptolemy's boring narrative to a bird's eye view of the battle field that illuminates nothing as to Alexander's courage and brilliant tactics. The scenes are nothing but senseless phallanx and cavalry deployments giving the audience no idea as to what is happening on the battle field or what Alexander really did to win the battle.  The depiction of Jehlum was even worse as the battle did not take place in a dense jungle but in a large clearing in the semi arid region of the Indus valley in modern-day Pakistan.  A phallanx formation and cavalry tactics would have been utterly useless in a dense jungle environment and any army using such tactics against Porus' elephants and nimble infantry would have been completely crushed.  As with Gaugamela, what won the battle of Jehlum was Alexander's brilliant use of cavalry outmaneuver Porus' elephants and infantry.  Furthermore, Alexander was not pierce by an arrow in that battle nor did he lose his prized horse Baucephalus: both these events had already taken place previously before he advanced into India.  Stone fails to depict Alexander's brilliant victories and Granicus and Issus and no film has bothered to show his siege of Tyre where he sacked the island citadel with two 3/4 mile jettis that his men built in less than 6 months by sheer herculean effort. The film also falsely portrays Alexander as receiving Darius family for the first time in Babylon when he had actually taken them hostage after the battle of Issus.<br /><br />This was simply a terrible depiction of Alexander The Great's life in which Stone wasted the entire theme and plot to show how Alexander being gay as a significant factor to his greatness when it wasn't.  Alexander's youthful energy, godlike self-confidence, and sheer military genius were the main factors contributing to his greatness and not his homosexuality.  That is why Alexander is called "The Great" and not "The Gay."  In truth, I don't think any film medium short of an extended miniseries to the likes of HBO's "Rome" would do justice to the complexities of Alexander's character or the impact he actually made on Western civilization and the rest of the world.  To paraphrase Phillip's advice to Alexander, I would tell the audience to go and seek a better film of Alexander for that which Rossen and Stone have left is too mediocre to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Alexander, Oliver Stone's contribution to the resurrected genre of sword-and-sandal epics, is a clear demonstration that you can make a movie that looks like it should be great and utterly fail.  This biopic of Alexander the Great flounders on almost every level and is probably most notable for making the overblown Troy seem good in comparison.<br /><br />Any scrutiny as to why this movie fails must begin with Colin Farrell who plays the title character.  Farrell, in the right context, is a decent enough actor, but he's out of his element here.  He is supposed to play a great leader, but is not believable in his role.  When Russell Crowe inspires his troops in Gladiator, we believe he's a good general; when Farrell does it in this movie, the only thing I'm inspired to do is eject the DVD (but somehow I resisted and stuck with the film to the end).  It is impossible to accept that this is a man who could command any real loyalty.<br /><br />Stone's direction is mediocre.  The battle sequences are not all that entertaining and his attempts to be "artistic" come off as merely pretentious.  With the sole exception of Val Kilmer, all the actors are either chewing the scenery (such as Angelina Jolie) or underdeveloped.  Unfortunately, Kilmer's decent performance is far from enough to carry this movie.<br /><br />At least a film like XXX - State of the Union doesn't pretend to be great, so when it fails, we're not all that disappointed.  Not so, here.  There is undoubtedly a good movie that could be made out of the life of Alexander the Great.  It hasn't arrived yet.  If it were a film of normal length, it might be worth viewing just to see how bad it is, but at three hours, it's probably better to skip it and watch another, shorter bad movie instead.  You'll still have wasted your time, but at least you'll have wasted less of it.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>ALEXANDER--simply appalling bio of Alexander the Great that stinks on EVERY possible level from story construction to understanding of history to costumes to acting(Colin Farrell has to be smelled to be believed) Angelina Jolie plays with snakes and has a Russian accent.<br /><br />  The film is WILDLY homosexual themed with the Macedonians being portrayed as a bunch of hysterical garishly dressed Gays right out of LA CAGE AU FAUX.

In "Gladiator" the homosexual themes are largely sublimated in costumes and melodrama. In "Troy" the homosexuality is more openly displayed but never rises past the point of visual symbolism most of which centers around Brad Pitt's sword play, braided hair, or nude body. "Alexander", by contrast displays its homosexual themes openly and unapologetically. The dude is gay. Many men were in the Ancient Greek world and it didn't have the powerful political and cultural reverberations that it does today in Victorian America.<br /><br />While I was happy that this film "owned" it's homosexuality more that the other two, I found it very boring. The dialog was trite and tiresome, the themes (as with any Oliver Stone movies) were flagrantly demonstrated and incredibly boring, and the actor who played Alexander was unbearably dull. In "Gladiator" Russle Crowe commanded the screen. No matter how goofy that movie got at times, Maxiums had my attention because Crowe played him beautifully. While "Troy" was not as good as Gladiatory, Brad Pitt played Achilles with all of his strengths mainly in the form of boyish attractiveness and athleticism.

If I had to see it again, I couldn't be persuaded to think twice because that was one of the, if not the, worst ever. Alexander also has me questioning the greatness of Oliver Stone as a director, and I will have to be compelled to take his name off the Best Director list. How in the world did Oliver Stone go from awesomely made Platoon to totally wretched Alexander? Everybody was awful in Alexander, and the movie was so frigging long and utterly pointless in the sea of fogginess and confusion. A lot of cliches ravages Alexander as already the official prostitute, Angelina Jolie, reprises once again a slutty role; Colin Farrell, being a lame, pretentious Irish actor, plays in a non-Irish role; Anthony Hopkins plays an extremely pompous narrator and overly philosopher; Val Kilmer is acting like Jim Morrison once again; and Oliver Stone's overabundance of 70's atmosphere used in Doors, Natural Born Killers, and U-Turn. Natural Born Killers was bad. Any Given Sunday was worse. Alexander was the worst Oliver Stone picture of all time, seriously ranking one of the worst pictures of all time. It's a true hall-of-shame and a true hall-of-worst-pictures.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>I suppose the world does not need another nobody writing on the movie ALEXANDER but here goes anyway. I had heard so many awful things about the movie that it couldn't possibly have been as bad as the reviewers said-- or in a more positive vein, it's better than I had feared.<br /><br />There are certainly problems with the film. To name some: Colin Farrell is miscast as Alexander. It is impossible to have hair that blond and eyes that dark brown unless you're an Italian woman dress designer. I should think that casting Alexander would be almost impossible, but Farrell isn't the one. Angelina Jolie at times is a commanding figure as his mother Olympias, but she speaks with a strange accent and couldn't possibly be old enough to be his mother. Did men in the time of Alexander wear eye makeup (Jared Leto as his lover Hephaistion)? Finally, the nearly 3 hour-long film moves mostly only by the commentary of Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy) and/or captions telling the viewer the time and place of the events.<br /><br />The film does have some interesting battle scenes and some of the panoramic shots are beautiful. A lot of time and effort obviously went into the making of this "epic," but it ultimately is pretty much a lost cause.<br /><br />Oh, Mr. Stone in his accompanying remarks on the DVD makes some interesting comments contrasting the current U. S. administration's endeavors in Iraq with those of  Alexander.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Sometimes there is so much hubbub surrounding a movie before, after and during its release that you literally cannot objectively appraise it without hacking your way through the PR double-speak and so-called critical muck. Such is the case with "Alexander."  Add to this, the fact that the mostly reviled Oliver Stone is in someway responsible for said film and you've added fuel to the fire, as it were.<br />Stone has never been one to back away from a controversy: some ten years later his "JFK" still brings people to blows and his "Nixon" and "Natural Born Killers" still causes some to spew invective or at least grimace or roll their eyes...or worse.<br />But despite all this, what really matters, what is most important, is what is up there on the screen and what there is up there on the screen in "Alexander" is quite impressive. The production is gorgeous and some scenes literally take your breath away: i.e. the scene in which Alexander (Colin Farrell) is injured in India is one: in a battle between men on horses and men on elephants that has to be seen to be believed, Alexander literally sees red...blood red. And the ten minutes that follow this looks like outtakes from "The Doors": it is psychedelic in the best sense: bright blues and pinks, Stone's interpretation of a soul's journey to heaven is breathtaking in its primitive yet evocative way.<br />Some 40 years ago we had what is arguably thought of as the best of the Biblical epics: Anthony Mann's "The Fall of the Roman Empire," but though this film is still impressive, "Alexander" manages to eclipse it with it's outrageous use of color, it's intelligent and cogent screenplay and it's frank discussion of Alexander's many and varied sexual encounters.<br />What also sets "Alexander" apart from "Troy" for example is that it is an epic yes, but its scope is played-out on the personal level. And this is particularly important in this kind of film: for often the spectacle too often obfuscates the people...makes them less important than the pageantry and often cluttered, scenery-bound mise en scene.<br />Several scenes in "Alexander" are particularly thoughtful and human: Alexander's scene with his Mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) after his father Philip (Val Kilmer) is murdered and Alexander's scene with Hephaiston (Jared Leto) in which Alexander declares his love. Jolie and Farrell go for the throat in this scene of maternal love laced with ambition, greed and shades of Oepipus. And even though one would have expected that the scenes between Alexander and Hephaiston would have gone the sexual route (at least a kiss), their scenes are chaste yet charged with  palpable sexual heat and tension that speaks more to their love and desire than would any bedroom romp.<br />Colin Farrell is magnetic as Alexander: often over-his-head as King but always human, kind yet aggressive in the affairs of his Kingdom. Farrell plays Alexander as a flawed man, a son of Titans, though sometimes tentative, yet his performance is grounded enough to make us feel for him and his thirst for land and power.<br />In supporting roles Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy, Gary Stretch as Cleitus and particularly Val Kilmer as Philip fill up the screen with their humanity and charisma.<br />But it is Angelina Jolie as Olympias who almost steals the movie away from Farrell. Claiming that the God Zeus is Alexander's real father,her Olympias is part witch, part snake charmer but nonetheless all Mother:  she loves Alexander and with no real power of her own, wants him to become King at any cost. Jolie is so gorgeous in this film that she defies description. Only Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra comes to mind as a contemporary comparison.<br />"Alexander" then is perhaps not a great film but it certainly is a very good one. And it is certainly better than many who have denounced it...most of time without seeing it.<br />That Oliver Stone has decided to do this film at all is laudable. That he has made a film that can stand up to the best of this genre is commendable. That he has made a film that resonates in the mind long after one leaves the theater is something that few films have...and that is Magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was everything that the critics said. It was bad. I thought Colin Farrell was totally miscast, as was Angelina Jolie as his MOTHER? Val Kilmer was pretty bad too. All that said, I think that the story of Alexander was or is just too vast and it seemed like they were trying to throw all his story into one movie and it was like trying to cram 50 pounds of gay love into a 5 pound reel of film. I guess that Alexanders sexuality might be bi/homosexual/insestuous with his mother or whatever but really, who cares? With all the magnificent things he did in his short life Oliver Stone seems to want to concentrate on his sexuality more than putting time into making a good movie. Jared Letos part as Colin Farrells boytoy was nauseating not because they were lovers but because his character was underdeveloped and basically consisted of he and Farrell making goo goo eyes at each other every time they were in each others site.<br /><br />This is simply just not a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The life and triumphs of Alexander the Great, the spiritual son of Achilles are superbly expressed in the screen through the storytelling of the one million carats actor Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />The stage is simply overwhelming, This epic saga needed somehow this vital component. The battle sequences in the desert against Dario troops are first class and so the last fight in India where the frozen image must have been recognized by Akira Kurosawa wherever he is. The splendid images in red after Alexander being wounded was another hit to remark. The most disgusting failure of the fil is the obsessive tendence of the scripters to remind the sexual inclinations of Alexander and not about his trascencence as conqueror and epic spirit man; that would suppose for instance to denigrate about the genius of Michelangelo due his sexual inclinations, leaving outside the gretaness of his legacy.<br /><br />Two additional details affect seriously the movie as a whole. In the first half there is an excessive use of close-ups. In my modest opinion the close up is like rubato in music: just what you need to emphasize dramatic nucleus or remark the dramatis personae. The second is the presence of Rosario Dawson. To my mind she doesn't represent the Asiatic stereotype ; in the other hand she didn't live the role: too cold and inexpressive.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was really interesting. The highlights performances are for Angelina Jolie who gives a perfect portrait of Olympia; she exploited her erotic face but also revealed the absolute domain of the body language: the expressive eyes delineated her speech. Jared Leto made a wonderful portrait and finally Val Killmer as Filipo was memorable too.<br /><br />Edition, photography and artistic direction are outstanding. And please realize the awful homage to Kurosawa' s Kagemusha when Bucefalo falls seriously wounded.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This is probably Oliver Stone's worst movie. To start things off, for two and half hours, it was quite boring to say the least. The narrative story was jerky and there was so much talk. It was like watching a day time soap opera. The sad thing was, nothing truly important was being said. People who watch this movie will never understand who, what or why of Alexander the Great. All we see is that he went here, won there, been there and done that. You can probably get all the information you need by watching an History Channel show or something.<br /><br />Much of the disappointment in the movie lies with Colin Farrell. While a good actor, he totally lack the chrismatic quality of Alexander the Great. Also lacking was Alexander's sheer genius which often borderline on madness. Alexander was bold with a purpose and he made his own fortune. Perhaps the scripts let Farrell down. God knows that Oliver Stone must have borrowed every single cliches known in Hollywood to filled Alexander's lines that failed to inspire any one of us. I may be in the minority here but I thought personally that Farrell was way over his league in his role. He lacks the screen presence to make us aware of Alexander and if he wasn't a lead actor or shouting very loudly, he could have easily disappeared within the ranks. Compared that with Russell Crowe in Gladiator. You always know where he is, quiet or not!! Anglina Jolie must have cost Stone a lot of money because he does his best to insert her whenever he can into the movie. Unfortunately for Stone, Jolie's role could have been done in ten minute but for some reason, Stone seem to hammered us audience how weird, loving and sinster Alexander's mom was. Her role wasn't believable and it was grossly overdone. Vil Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins were okay at best. Kilmer probably captured King Phillip pretty well. Hopkins playing a narrator had a thankless role trying to educated the audience 15 years of some of the most amazing events in history into few lines!!<br /><br />Historically, Alexander was bisexual and point could be...so what? This homoerotic theme that Stone played around throughout the movie proves to be total distraction to the main theme of the movie. What was the theme? I thought it was to discover what made Alexander....Alexander the Great!!! Maybe I and rest of the audience was wrong on that.<br /><br />Alexander is considered to be one of history's greatest military commanders, his life was filled with battles, sieges and combat. But in the movie, all we see is two battles, short and sweet. We see little of what make him great, only that he like to charge head first into battle. (Mel Gibson also makes the same mistake in Braveheart when he turned a tactically intelligent William Wallace into a banzai warrior.)<br /><br />Frankly, I don't see any real purpose in this movie. Narrative is boring, action is boring, acting is repetitively boring and considering that this is a movie about one of history's greatest military and political leaders, how can it be so boring??</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's ALEXANDER, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time.  The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.<br /><br />The emphasis, however, should be on the word "attempt."  ALEXANDER fails in three basic ways: in its cast, in its refusal to meet certain character issues head-on, and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.<br /><br />Alexander the Great was a charismatic, self-contradictory, and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point.  He was a battle-tested killing machine by age sixteen, King of Macedonia by twenty, conqueror of the known world by thirty-and above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age.  Colin Farrell plays the character as a weak-minded, emotionally distraught entity, going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead you to believe he is in desperate need of a dose of salts.  It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.<br /><br />Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias, the remaining performances are equally impossible.  Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction; it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip.  Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancient-world version of Cher after a particularly thick night, albeit with better cleavage.  As for Queen Roxane, history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father.  The role, however, is considerably revised, and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.<br /><br />During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual.  Unfortunately for those who come unhinged over such matters, you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men: the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas.  That is who Alexander was; that was what the ancient world was like.  But instead of meeting this issue head-on, the film attempts to "indicate" the relationships through a series of longing gazes, the occasional caress, and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen.  The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.<br /><br />For the sexually insecure, there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage; although I went with the unedited version, and although the scenes in question are very badly done, I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringe-inducing scenes improves the film to any significant degree-largely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.<br /><br />The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narration-something that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen.  But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story, such as it is, out of sequence.<br /><br />In essence, the first half hour of the film establishes the tri-fold conflict between King Philip, Queen Olympias, and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation.  At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia, and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous, unexpected, and disastrous flaw in the film.  Approximately two hours later the film presents this "lost time" in the form of a flashback-but by this point the purpose of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway.  Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel storylines and time lines.  One need look no further than JFK to see his skill.  It is astonishing, utterly astonishing, that he could do no better than this and, not being able to do better, did not find a better way entirely.<br /><br />When all is said and done, Alexander is presented as an out-of-control weakling, his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best, and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force, much less lead it to a single victory, much less conquer the known world.  Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema, but the Greeks had a word for ill-advised ambition founded on a god-like arrogance: hubris.  It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished, and in this instance the punishment is a career-crippling, if not entirely career-killing, film.<br /><br />As noted, there are several DVD versions, including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes, eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality.  Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis, who scored it, as well as an amazingly beside-the-point commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Don't let all the four and five-star reviews cropping up here fool you:  there's nothing great about Oliver Stone's long-winded but empty and misguided interpretation of the mighty conqueror's life.  Colin Farrell is a fine actor, but perhaps miscast as the eponymous Alexander, and for whatever reason his performance never carries conviction.  Another pair of excellent actors, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins, are totally misused, leaving Angelina Jolie's perfomance as Alexander's mother Olympias the only one that really works.  Much of the most important moments from Alexander's life are quickly (and sometimes confusingly) glossed over, and the story relies far too much on talky narration to carry the plot awkwardly forward.  Even the battle scenes are handled poorly, disintegrating into indecipherable chaos.  Typically, the homoerotic subtext of Alexander's life is exaggerated, betraying a badly-conceived ideological bent that miscarries completely.  Should have been edited to a more manageable length, but even that would have only resulted in a more tolerable viewing experience, not a truly edifying one.  This is one time the box office and most national critics got it right:  ALEXANDER is a poor investment in time and money that neither entertains nor educates.  Watch the History Channel special and let this unfortunate failure fade away.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>In the spirit of classics like "Spartacus," "The Ten Commandments," and "Mommie Dearest" comes this bio-pic that is miscast, overlong, poorly written, and visually dull for a three hour epic.  It made me appreciate "Troy" so much more.  Yet Oliver Stone still manages to get you hooked a little. There are three major mistakes with this movie.  Mistake number one:  Colin Farrell.  Pretty, yes, I give you that.  Can he act?  Well, no not really.  It was hard to tell sometimes with the ridiculous dialog they gave him.  Some spots are so funny I couldn't stand it.  He kept falling in and out of his Scottish tongue, it was distracting.  I wasn't seeing Alexander the Great, nor even Good, no wait, not even Alexander the So-So, I was seeing only Colin.  Mistake Number Two:  Casting Angelina Jolie as his mother!  She's only one year older than him.  She also suffers from staying to long at the "Camp" grounds with long speeches, overacting, and a flair for overdrama to say the least.  The storyline is pretty much the same as all bio-pics.  Overreaching ambition, secrets, making enemies, partying too hard will all bring you down.  As in most Oliver Stone pics there is a conspiracy or two, but not extreme.  Mistake Number Three;  The camera work.  Half the time I felt I was back watching "Cops," or "The Blair Witch Project" with all that jumpy, clumsy, and awkward camera work.  Mr. Stone is capable of much better work.  His action sequences are dull.  Nothing much reallt to see.  The locations used were nothing special either.<br /><br />Still, I think the film will work as a guilty pleasure.  Its the "Showgirls" of epic dramas.  What's that smell, do I smell a razzie award coming?</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I had high hopes for this movie.  I've been a huge fan of epics, everything from Ben-Hur to Gladiator & Troy, and even King Arthur was entertaining.  I'm a fan of Colin, Jolie & Hopkins so I decided that Alexander, although bashed by every critic, would still be worth my time.  I'm sad to say I was wrong.  I feel that Oliver should have focused of the greater aspects of Alexanders life, like his rise to power, instead of throwing us into the middle of his reign and spending way too much time letting us know he would rather sleep with his friend (played way too femininely by Jared Leto) than his wife.  I felt the acting was lacking, all except Colin.  I felt he did very well.  I feel bad that he was bashed so much for this performance for I felt he was the only part of the movie that remained memerable.  I thought he deserved an oscar nod, although I would have chosen Johny Depp over Colin to walk away with the golden man.  The battle scenes were also very dissapointing.  First of all, you have a three hour movie about the most powerful warrior in the world and there are only about twenty minutes tops worth of battle time...thats just bad judgment on Oliver's part.  The battle scenes themselves were lacking.  The first against the Medes & Persians was a complete mess...the battle scenes in Troy were far superior as was the battle scene in the beginning of Gladiator.  The last scene with the Elephants was the most anticipated scene of the movie for me and it left me bitter.  It could have been sooooo much better.  I read that the battle scene was distroyed going through an x-ray and they were only able to salvage some of the battle, but still, it wouldn't have saved the movie from impending doom.  I don't feel I could watch it again.  The sex scene was steamy, in a funny, laugh out loud kinda way... Overall I give it a 3 ONLY because I feel that Colin deserves that, you know, for trying...</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Unfortunatly their best was not nearly good enough, think all of the worst elements of Troy and then multiply them by a factor of 10.  I have nothing against gay people but there is a really creepy homosexual undertone here that starts at the beginning and stays with us to the end.  I am a student of history and am therefore not ignorant of Greek social practices but the issue of Alexander's Homosexuality should have been a side peaice and not a main focus point for this movie.  Very little redeems this movie in my eyes, well maybe one excellent sequence but no more then that.  Why sit for 2 and ? hours for one good battle when you can just rent Lord of the Rings?<br /><br />I would never sit through it again, nor buy it on DVD.<br /><br />The actors performed well most notably Sean Bean and Anthony Hopkins but the movie itself felt undeveloped in a major way, you can't except an actor to do his or her job if the script just sucks.  Oliver Stone took what had the elements to be a wonderful movie and turned it into some sort of a love story interspersed with long boring speeches.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Too long to function as high camp and too silly to be watched with a straight face (Angelina Jolie's accent! Colin Farrell's haircut!), Alexander's only real success is to prove that the infamous 1963 version of Cleopatra didn't end big-budget sword and sandals fiascos.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Alexander conquered most of the known world in the BCs. Historically, he was a fighter class man. Unfortunately he was homosexual, dying of grief after his lover passed on. Overall, a decent Holywood effort of bringing the Alexander the Great story to film. Worth seeing maybe once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is a pretty amazing film. It has a highly talented cast yet there is a tendency to overacting that makes the film to have more in common with 1950s Hollywood epics like "The Ten Commandments" rather than with more naturalistic, realistic contemporary films. Since all the actors overact, with the exceptions of Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Hephaestus, the blame must reside with the director. The historic record would point to Alexander the Great as a tremendous egomaniacal and charismatic leader. Yet here the script tries to elevate Alexander's mission beyond conquest and discovery into some vague concept of universal respect for diversity which may be a contemporary value but was probably not a value of the ancient world of conquest. Listen to the dialogue where Alexander argues with his generals about his desire that they take wives and produce children among the nations they overcome rather than focus on returning to their wives and children in Macedonia with vast treasures and slaves. An argument could be made that he wished to find a way to sustain his victories, which may occur if the victor impregnates the vanquished and establishes kingdoms overseen by the children of these marriages and unions. Great leaders wish to sustain their victories and intermarriage with the defeated nations and tribes may have indeed been Alexander's strategy. Certainly he followed this strategy with this marriage to Roxannas. But if this was truly the case then why was Alexander also compelled to follow a path of discovery to the ends of the known world, particularly in demonstrating that beyond India is the origin of the Nile which, if followed, would bring him and his troops back to the Mediterranean Sea. The speeches delivered by Alexander to his troops wavered in theme from appealing to their desire for conquest and treasure, to that of becoming rules of these new vanquished worlds, to that of discovering the Nile beyond India which will lead them to their homes. Eventually all the arguments fail and he must return or risk total mutiny.<br /><br />The homosexuality of Alexander is presented in an interesting manner in the film. Alexander seems to have a permanent emotional attachment to his childhood friend Hephaestus but is sexually drawn to the Persian slave boy that becomes his lover. In the first half of the film he asks Hephaestus to sleep with him but he gradually transitions to the Persian slave boy without losing his attachment to Hephaestus as his most honest and trusted companion. His attachment to his wife seems to be one whereby he wished to create a dynasty among the people he conquered. Maybe the film reflects the truth that it is rare that any human relationship will meet all needs.<br /><br />The film is visually stunning, as beautiful as any Biblical or Ancient world epic produced in the last 40 years. Yet the narrative sequence is too jolting, bouncing back and forth in time too often. The film would have been further strengthened by a chronological presentation and the inclusion of Alexander's conquest of Greece and Egypt to give a full presentation of the size of this young man's military achievements.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>take a bad movie add more scenes and make it longer and even more unwatchable,that's what happened here.just because it's about history doesn't mean it should play like a 3 hour speach in history class. please don't add anymore time to this mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>First off, let me just say that I would never make a film on Alexander because I do not posses the quantity of mind to. I know I cannot reach that level of perfection so it's easy to criticise another's work.When you're making a film on Alexander you expect everything to be larger than life yet quite close to most people's perception of reality. Colin Farrell made a weak, very disappointing, disillusioning Alexander. I wanted to like this film but the very character that played the lead role failed to remotely bring justice to the king of kings.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film at first and tried my best to ignore the over obsessive Angelina Jolie who played the role of Olympus. Let me just say the half impish Russian accent she sported did no good for outlining her character.The war scenes in the film aren't really anything like we haven't ever seen before.There is nothing the film tries to over emphasise on. I could take this film seriously for the 160 minutes of it's playing time.The person who played the Persian King was more fit for his role than any other person in this film. Babylon was shown with a lot of glory and quite rightfully so.<br /><br />I hear from a lot of people that the story is twisted in it's own way. Alexander wasn't murdered they say. I do not believe it is correct to diss the film on this basis. The best scene in the film comes when Alexander's 40,000 army fights the 250,000. There is a shot of an eagle flying in the sky and the camera is focussed on the war below from the eagle's eye.<br /><br />Watch this film if you saw Troy and must watch everything that is focussed on an ancient epic tale of a leader of men. Colin Farrell gave his 90% to this film but then his capacity fails him from personifying Alexander. A friend mentioned the actor of Van Helsing would have made a better Alexander. I agree.<br /><br />P.S-<br /><br />To "Amanda Richards(who wrote a poem for her review of the same)<br /><br />Nice work. Was it a school assignment? Sarcasm & Poetry?

The truth, however, as it is remembered sometimes bends and changes between translations, fading memories, and subjective reasoning.  Thus, the truth gives birth to a myth while myths generate their own life in the mouth of storytellers and scholars whose wisdom and knowledge goes unquestioned.  Oliver Stone tells his vision of the greatest human myth of all time - the life of Alexander the Great.<br /><br />Alexander depicts the tale of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great, from childhood until his death at the age of 32.  It should be known that contemporary studies on Alexander the Great often focus on his persona and what made him so great.  Unfortunately, no unbiased material exists in regards to Alexander's character, which has forced historians to deduct information through the recorded events and the limited amount of existing writing concerning Alexander.  It has left him with portrayals such as an evil tyrant to a kind and valiant leader.  The interpretation of Alexander's persona is open to examination, but true image of his character will never be known.  Nonetheless, scholars continue to hypothesize and make calculated guesses as to what made him so great.  Oliver Stone offers his interpretation in Alexander.<br /><br />A fragmented storyline opens with Alexander raising his hand with a ring of some significance while laying on his deathbed.  An old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) reveals this is Alexandria 40 years after Alexander's death while reciting his past to a scribe.  It is a rather idealistic prologue that talks about Alexander's feats and achievements by setting sight on Babylon and the land beyond.  There are several visual insertions of mosaics and wall paintings to support Ptolemy's reasoning, which smoothly transition to Alexander's youth.<br /><br />The disjointed storyline moves back and forth between Alexander's early days and his conquest of the east.  The flashbacks help understand how Alexander became who he turned out to be.  This of course is a subjective interpretation, as so many other interpretations that exist.  The cinematic version by Stone might be different than most desire.  Nonetheless, it is of no-less value than other interpretations.<br /><br />Alexander in Stone's interpretation seems to have been heavily influenced by his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who constantly told him that he was a son of the god Zeus.  It is also apparent that Alexander's father, King Philip (Val Kilmer), influenced him, but much more infrequent than his mother.  There is also a heavy dose of how his education and friendships steered him in the direction of greatness.  These are facets that are essential in any human beings existence, and Alexander was not above it.  This helps paint a more real image than the mythical and mysterious persona that exists around Alexander the Great.<br /><br />When Alexander (Collin Ferrell) stands outnumbered by one to six in front of the Persian army he begins his conquest of the east, as they know it.  This becomes the beginning of a life-long test where Alexander finds himself to have to utilize all his wisdom and knowledge.  The value of an education and sources of influence emerge in the film, as Alexander questions what has been taught when he steps beyond the known world.  It is also evident that the many mosaics and wall paintings in the film are relevant to the story, as Stone frequently returns to them as teachers would use learning tools in a classroom.  Slowly the audience gets to see how this historical person was shaped in Stone's interpretation.<br /><br />It is an epic journey that Alexander undertakes and he is about to learn about group dynamics and the desires of others for wealth and power.  In a sense, the notions presented by Stone are very applicable in the modern world where xenophobia, homophobia, and expansionism exist.  This might seem a little too obvious of a contemporary societal critique, but the question remains for the audience to answer while viewing the film.<br /><br />Some film critics have noted that war sequences are repetitively bloody, but then again is war not bloody and repetitive in the sense of killing?  In addition, the battle scenes create a sense of meaninglessness; as in retrospect humanity knows of the fabled glory of war created by kings and leaders to gain the masses approval and willingness to fight until the death.  Through these scenes, the audience does experience some of Alexander's greatness in regards to warfare, but also see the bloody aftermath.<br /><br />The film, unfortunately, suffers from some larger-than-life acting, which maybe tries to develop a sense that the Greek gods might have been conversing.  Perhaps it is a result of the big Greek forums and the learning of how to speak in public, or it might be an attempt to create an atmosphere of greatness.  Whatever the reason, it feels awkward and it cannot be neglected, as the story tries to deal with more psychological and social issues.  Despite what could be called intentionally overacting, Stone succeeds in capturing a stunning environment for almost all scenes through a terrific cinematography, which elevates the cinematic experience.<br /><br />Stone like so many other storytellers before him has told his version of the truth and sometimes bent the truth to keep the audience's attention, or to create a reaction.  In either case, it seems like Stone has added more to the myths around the historical person that also was the first to be named the Great.  It leaves the audience with a film that the viewer wants to like, but it does not really achieve the greatness it intended to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Most of us know how great Alexander was, how he conquered a big part of the known world before age 35, how glorious his army was, how early he died leaving his empire to crumble and fall apart, and how his hellenic legacy survived for a long time. But we wanted to watch it, see it with our own eyes. Oliver Stone took this problem on his hands, and made a 3-hour movie featuring the Macedonian conqueror. Everything about Alexander is great. This movie, however, is terrible.<br /><br />For starters, the plot. A succession of battle scenes and love scenes. The battle scenes are usually good - after all we're talking about Oliver Stone, the man responsible for "Platoon" and "Born on the fourth of July". We expect great shots of ancient armies facing each other, volleys of arrows, misleading cavalry charges and sword-to-sword fights. We get all that. The love scenes, however, are simply ridiculous. Alexander looks like a - pardon my french - bitch in heat, always trying to get the prettiest boy into his bed. At one time he forgets himself, and then he gets married to a woman - at least she's beautiful, and the only actor/actress that shows talent in the entire movie - Rosario Dawson. In Alexander's time the concepts about sexuality were different, but Farrell plays him like a petty fag.<br /><br />Speaking of acting, there rarely could be a more miscast film than Alexander. Collin Farrell can be the though guy with a three-day beard on his face, but he could never be Alexander. In his shoes, the great general was turned into an effeminate, spoiled, overgrown brat, making faces and open-eyed. Anthony Hopkins was a complete bore as Ptolemy, trying to teach the audience a lesson. Congratulations, Oliver Stone, you were able to loose one of the greatest actors of the post-Olivier era in your movie. And now we get to the worst part. I fell in love with Angelina Jolie in "The bone collector", and I watch every movie she makes just for the sake of seeing her. But this time I can't keep my mouth shut. She's terrible as Alexander's mother, Olympias. And that accent - worse even than Kate Beckinsale's in "Van Helsing". Only those beautiful green eyes prevented me from throwing something at the screen when she was on.<br /><br />So, in the end, when Alexander dies and the movie is over, we feel greatful. There is, however, one extremely beautiful scene in the movie, one that is shown in the trailler, where Alexander's horse is facing an elephant, both of them standing in their hind legs. This scene elevated the rating of the movie in one star.<br /><br />Grade 3.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>This is a fanciful and somewhat interesting interpretation on the life of Alexander the Great,  but as a film epic it is sorely lacking...especially in the screenplay and leading performances.

Alexander is more of a hysteric than a hero and this Director's Cut is particularly long and tough to endure without a few hits of the Pause button.<br /><br />The Director's Commentary track, however, is the most worthwhile thing about this...for hearing Oliver Stone's own opinion, thoughs and defense of his title character is a bit like attending a university lecture by a professor who is very ethusiastic about his subject matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Back in the 1980's I thought Oliver Stone was the greatest director we'd ever seen when he released, "Platoon". He's never been able to catch lightning in a bottle again, since.<br /><br />"Alexander" is the story of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) and his conquests and his relationship with his mother Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and his father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer).<br /><br />The film is ostensibly being told in flashbacks via the great scholar Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to his students. It is an unnecessary gimmick. Hopkins does fine and the added time is arguably some of the best information that we receive in the film - BUT if the script had been better written, these scenes would not have been necessary.<br /><br />Farrell is in way over his head as the lead in this film. He can't carry the film. He neither has the talent nor the emotional range for such an historic figure. Why does Farrell use his native Irish accent (and why does the young actor who plays him as a youth do the same?)? More on this later...<br /><br />Jolie as Alexander's mother uses as bizarre Russian-esque accent that is terribly out of place with who Olympia actually was.<br /><br />Stone seems to be confused as to what direction to take the film. He gives us enormous battles of grand scale, but he doesn't take the time to let us learn about the combatants (you get face shots, but from a distance you can't tell who's who). He attempts to give us detail about Alexander's thought process regarding current and future battles/conquests, but the dialog itself is so juvenile in content that it's more like a couple of kids arguing over who's going to play cowboy and who's going to play Indian.<br /><br />We move through all of Alexander's important battles ad infinatum!! It is completely unnecessary for us to go through each and every battle in the way that Stone has us do. It is redundant and quite frankly very boring after a time. How many times can we hear that Alexander's troops are unhappy and disagree with his campaign and that they want to go home? Well, we hear it over and over. And we also get repeats of almost the same speech from Alexander...<br /><br />Alexander doesn't take spoils of war in Babylon, India or any other areas of Asia. This we are told over and over. But we are never privy to the "why". There's more action than dialogue and even though this was intended to be a BIG TENT POLE film (aka: action film), the very subject matter warrants a closer, more intelligent look than this film provides.<br /><br />Alexander was the not only Alexander the Great, but he is - to this very day - the greatest (and some would say most benevolent) conqueror to ever walk the Earth. Surely, such trite treatment is insulting to his greatness.<br /><br />I'll give a few kudos to Stone for his major inclusion of Alexander's bisexuality (it wasn't a big thing back then), but what the heck is up with that androgenous male dancer with whom he takes up late in the film? Did he cast away Hephestaion (his lover since childhood)? Is he cheating on him? It is seemly there for shock value. It makes no sense plotwise. Since Jared Leto is cast as Hephastaion, it would seem that the best material regarding Alexander and his male lover are on the cutting room floor - Leto's role is so small that it is almost cameo material.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife is very miscast. She looks about as Persian as an Eskimo. That aside, we're never really sure if she is disgusted with Alexander's relationship with Hephastaion or if it is Alexander with whom she is initially disgusted - a better set of actors might have been able to answer this question.<br /><br />Now, the accents....Jolie's Russian is totally bizarre, but let's move on. We know that it is traditional for American films to have foreign characters denoted by using English accents. If the foreign characters are villains then they typically (and insultingly) use German accents. If this is the case, then why in the world is Farrell using his native Irish for Alexander? Why not English? No one else uses the Irish accent. Here we have the accents of an immediate family: Philip (kilmer), Alexander's father: English accent; Olympia (Jolie), Alexander's mother: Russian accent; Alexander  (Farrell), Irish accent. Bizarre doesn't even begin to describe it. The poor kid who played Alexander as a young boy must have been nonplussed trying to figure out why he was delivering his dialog in an Irish accent.<br /><br />The film is sadly not worth the three hours it takes to watch it. I would really enjoy seeing a film on Alexander using a tight script, good actors, and some tight direction. "Alexander" has none of these.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The film:<br /><br />It's kind of funny how popular entertainment works. All I remember hearing about Oliver Stone's "Alexander" is that it was a horribly acted, poorly constructed shambles of a movie. Scanning the torrent of vituperative scorn heaped upon this film will give you an idea of the climate at the time of its release. Needless to say, I was dubious. Any movie that scores lower than Jessica Simpson's "Dukes of Hazzard" must be an abomination, right?<br /><br />However, I am a Stone fan, and was inclined to offer the benefit of the doubt. I loved JFK, Nixon and Natural Born Killers, and enjoyed Any Given Sunday and The Doors. At his best, Stone excels at getting truly absorbing character portraits up on the screen, and setting them against an expansive backdrop which captures the essence of the period.<br /><br />Alexander, starring Collin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony Hopkins, Jared Leto and Christopher Plummer, both succeeds and fails in these categories. Some of the characters are endlessly fascinating, some are rather threadbare. Certain aspects of the period are wonderfully represented, and some are sort of left up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Some performances are pitch perfect, others, while enjoyable, are painfully weird and out of place. All told, Alexander is somewhat weak in comparison with Stone's best.<br /><br />So why did I enjoy it so much?<br /><br />Looking at the above-listed stars, it's easy to see that Stone has assembled a particularly good ensemble cast. The weakest of the bunch are Farrell and Jolie. However, each actor does an admirable job of creating a character, Farrell and Jolie included. If anything, Jolie's performance is hampered only by her youth (she is only one year Farrell's senior, yet plays his mother), and her wretched accent (somewhere between Eartha Kitt and Austin Powers' Frau Farbissina). Farrell's performance is just a bit shallow - he looks heroic and manly in battle sequences, certainly, but doesn't do much beyond that. Sometimes, he really seems to nail complex emotions. Other times, it's just a bit poster-board and flat.<br /><br />The rest of the cast, however, including the lesser-known supporting players in Alexander's army, are uniformly terrific. Particularly good are Plummer as Aristotle, Kilmer as a drunken King Philip, Hopkins as an aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Alexander's male lover, Hephaistion. Rosario Dawson plays Alexander's asian bride Roxane, though beyond her pendulous naked breasts and dancing ability, I can't say I got much out of it (Dawson really shines in 2005's Sin City, though). To me, though, the performance that makes the movie what it is is by Connor Paolo, as a young Alexander. This 14 year-old actor absolutely nails the portrayal of a young, idealistic prince with adolescent dreams of grandeur. This portrayal really lends a depth to the later plot, acted by Farrell, which Farrell himself really doesn't provide.<br /><br />But any Stone movie review eventually comes down to Stone himself. How well did he construct the story, and how well did he execute it and edit it together?<br /><br />My main gripe with the story of Alexander is its naivete. I really have to wonder how historically accurate it is to portray Alexander as an idealistic dreamer who longed to unite the world in a Pax Romana-esque explosion of culture and personal improvement. Certainly, all of these things may have been present in the man, and they may have been ancillary effects of his conquest, but it is pretty tough to swallow as Farrell dreamily describes his vision of a great society to his male lover Leto. The story functions much better when Alexander is instead portrayed as a conqueror impelled by his family demons to push across the globe for something he knows not what.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the film is truly wondrous at times in its evocation of ancient times and places - Babylon is a singular cinematic achievement - utilizing CGI nearly seamlessly to truly give the impression of a "wonder of the world." Similarly teriffic cinematography and composition are achieved in portrayals of India, Egypt and the steppes of the Himalayas. The scenes of Greece and Macedonia also shine, especially in HD, really placing you there in the time. This film is Stone at his finest visually, creating a world which draws you in.<br /><br />I for one really liked the way the so-called "gay" element of the movie was handled - watching Alexander provides one of the better explications of the homosexual "lover-beloved" relationships that were present in Hellenistic noble circles. Again, this concept was grounded by scenes of the young Alexander and Hephaiston being taught by Aristotle about the idealistic virtues of manly love - scenes which brought into sharp focus what could have seemed gratuitous homoerotic later scenes between Leto, Farrell, and a few others. It's a part of Greek history, and Stone kept it in as a big theme, instead of bending to anachronistic puritanism. Kudos to him for that.<br /><br />Besides Stone's possible anachronistic interpretation of Alexander's world-uniting motives, historically, this film really can't be faulted. It is true to the sources we have, be they Plutarch and Herodotus, or more modern scholars. Those sources may be tinged by legend or political agenda, but they are all we have. This is a movie which you could show a professor, who would be hard pressed to point out a major error (unlike the barely recognizable "history" of "Kingdom of Heaven.") I would also say, as is Stone's talent, this movie makes you feel like YOU ARE THERE. I would show this film to students to get them excited about the Hellenistic period. (Though at 214 minutes, it might take two class periods...)<br /><br />As you have read, this cut is 214 minutes. Certainly, this is a long movie. But Stone, in his ability to create scene and to really transport the viewer, makes this movie fly by. It felt like 2 hours, not 3 and a half. Stone has re-ordered the fragmented structure of the film. The previous director's cut grouped various scenes closer together by time period - Alexander's childhood was one big chunk, then his travels were another, intercut with his early reign and death. This cut, on the other hand, basically takes the two time periods (childhood through early reign; travels across Asia and death) and skips back and forth between them, each line running roughly forward. Both cuts can be followed, especially if you have some knowledge of Greek history. I have to say I prefer the first director's cut a bit, since I found the childhood scenes so strong, it was nice to have them in a chunk. But this cut still works. The added material fleshes out the side characters much better than the previous two cuts, which is welcome in any case.<br /><br />Alexander is an enigmatic movie. It fails at so much, but only because it tried for so much. I was completely absorbed and never bored once during the 3.5 hour running time. I felt transported to the world it created, and my emotions were stirred in a simplistic way by the scenes of glory and adventure on the screen. Ptolemy (played by Hopkins) utters a line which might serve as the movie's epitaph: "His failures were grander than others' successes." So true of Stone. He wears his ambition on his sleeve, is rarely if ever subtle, and draws a lot of critical fire for this. Yet the explosion of creativity which results, whether it succeeds or fails, is never boring. I recommend Alexander for this reason alone.<br /><br />Let me put it another way: This is a movie that got critically bashed, and I can't really discern why. It's better than "Dukes of Hazzard." It's also better than "Revenge of the Sith," a film from around the same time which received many positive reviews despite its bizarre dialogue, paper-thin character motivations, and plot holes. It's got its problems, but it is also big fun if you're a fan of the historical epic genre, the director, or of the historical period.<br /><br />The disc:<br /><br />As far as the quality of the Blu-Ray presentation, let me put it simply. I own Planet Earth, 2001, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Prestige, all renowned for their sterling HD transfers. Alexander tops them all in terms of detail and color.  You know how some Blu-Ray discs look fine enough, but really seem like something a particularly good DVD could do? The aforementioned "Kingdom of Heaven" is one such disc to me. This Blu-Ray presentation leaves you with no doubt. This is High Definition, pure and simple, and no 480p DVD disc could do what this disc does. On my 50" SXRD display, the detail is overwhelming, the color is beyond rich and vibrant, and the 3-dimensionality is extraordinary, especially in the festival scene in Greece, the scene in the cold mountain pass, and in the Babylon entrance scene. At its best, this is THE demo disc to really show off your system. There are a few spots where black levels falter (such as the palace in India) or flesh tones are a little hot (Aristotle springs to mind), but these flaws represent 5 minutes or so out of a 214 minute experience. The rest of the film is nothing short of flawless, and the visual splendor aids in drawing you into the film.<br /><br />The extra materials also excel - two commentaries including a director's track and a historical overview by Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, two documentaries with amazing behind the scenes access, and a bevy of other features. Really first rate.<br /><br />If you like history, this is a movie to get. If you like great HD, this disc is a no-brainer. If you like neat and tidy 90 minute films which spoon feed you the plot and who to root for/against, this is NOT the movie for you. It is complex, confusing at times, ambiguous in its morality, violent, lusty, raw, and disgusting. But that's history... have you ever read the bible? Yeesh. This is a movie which inspires love and hate all at once. I for one find it utterly spellbinding, even though I am well aware of its flaws. In the end, I think this is completely appropriate for its subject matter: Alexander the Great, a historical figure who, warts and all, you can't simply ignore and would do well to study. I give this disc 5 stars for its technical brilliance, its creative spark, and its sheer, mesmeric "movie magic."</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>How bad can it be, right? Well, don't make the mistake of seeing it just because it's out on video. It's just bad all around. And it gets there slowly.<br /><br />The plot is a mess. Stone can't decide who Alexander is. He's not terribly brilliant a commander - or is he? He can't seem to inspire his men - or can he? And when he does, is it on purpose? And when he fails, with a limpid speech, is that really him, or not? And what of his grand vision? Not much of that shown. And he can't persuade his men that it's a grand vision.<br /><br />Not that I blame them. Colin Farrell looks ridiculous in his half-blond hair and nostrils flaring. It just distracts from the film and makes you think, couldn't they have spent more on makeup?<br /><br />Only Val Kilmer is somewhat worth watching in his limited role as King Philip. The battle scenes are not as good as some reviews would have you expect, although the sight of charging elephants is somewhat awesome; and that crimson effected battle is just an eyesore.<br /><br />It fails to capture Alexander's vision and triumph, and portrays him as a boyish simperer. Yuck.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie held a lot of promises.  Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Plummer, Colin Farell, Angeline Jolie, Val Kilmer and the list goes on.  Normally, I wouldn't have minded the length of the movies.  I sat through Kingdom of Heaven and King Kong.  Time passed quickly but towards the third quarter of Alexander, my concentration started to give way.  I couldn't help but noticing Irish, English, Russian accents spoken as Macedonians.  The battles meant to be the highlight for movies of such proportions but it wasn't executed as successfully as in Kingdom of Heavens and even Troy!  Utlimately, it came to the direction of the movie.  I guess that the planning and execution of it wasn't tackled until the movie started.  Throughout the movie, Alexander tended to fight against his inner demons (with much manipulation by his mother, Olympia versus his father).  I tried to feel for Alexander, the flawed conqueror and yet, I couldn't.  The battles were many and emphasis was never made to let us relate between Alexander and his generals.  Oliver Stone the director painted them as racists and ignorant mercenaries who would fight one another the moment Alexander died.  The only bit that touched my heart would be that insignificant moment between Alexander and his favourite horse which was actually registered in history, the very horse that fought with him all the way to history.  The last quarter was the hardest bit to swallow with arty farty red against white background and pscyhedellic images to the point that it felt out of character with the rest of the movie.  There was much said about emphasis on Alexander's love for his male lover (Jared Leto) here that it 'killed' the movie.  However, the latest offering of Brokeback Mountain doesn't seem to have that problem.  The reality of the matter is Alexander is a commendable and valiant effort but pitching that against superior offering by Ridley Scott, it's simply a good but forgettable movie whilst Kingdom of Heaven seemed to be a well planned and executed balanced movie which would be seen as a standard for the Crusades theme in the forseeable future.  Alexander is very much an Oliver Stone movie as he suggested a conspiracy theory about the nature of Alexander's death, as narrated by Anthony Hopkin's character.  Alas......it would have been great.  Commendable but don't expect too much out of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>This movie is such a mess. There is so much to complain about, I'm not even sure where to start ripping apart at.<br /><br />The acting is horrible. Colin Farrel never has the look of an actor who is in command of the film. Mel Gibson had it in Braveheart and so did Russell Crowe in Gladiator. You never really get that in Alexander. I don't think Colin was a bad choice to play Alexander he just lacked the boldness of somewhat who accompished the things this man did. He lacks that scren presence.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is a great actor, but nothing is given to him to work with. He plays a fat old man, but when he is on screen he owns it. Phillip is a great character and it's a shame that Kilmer couldn't do more with him.<br /><br />Angelina is creepy at Olympia. Mythology said she served her gods, but the character is annoying in the film. All she does is complain and complain. I'm a huge Jolie fan, but I got tired of her scenes. They are all same. It's either kill your father Alexander or come home Alexander. Give her some more lines to work with.<br /><br />The homosexuality in the movie is a huge distraction and it hurts the movie a lot. History tells us that most men in that time period were known to swing both ways and especially men in power. Oliver Stone takes all of those scenes over the top. I was sick and tired of watching Colin and Jared Leto stare at each other passionately with cheesy backgroudn music. I got tired of seeing him do the same scenes with the guy from Babylon. I can't stand forced drama like this and I can't believe that Warner Brothers let Oliver Stone do it. Alexander should be known to the world as the great military leader he was. Nobody really cares if he was bi-sexual.<br /><br />The battle scenes are some of the worst I've ever seen. Capitol One should check into a law suit because Oliver Stone copied the armies from there commercials. I was just waiting for one of the warriors to scream out "What's in Your Wallet." The scenes are bloody but without all the gore. I wanted to see a battle, not a big bloody mess like all these scenes were.<br /><br />Oliver Stone really needs to be slapped upside his head for this movie. He didn't do his homework at all. I've always felt the guy was overrated. He should take some heat for putting together this $300 million dollar piece of junk. To add insult to injury the movie is three hours long.<br /><br />This movie truly was an epic. It was an epic to see if I could stay awake and make it out alive. The theater I saw it in was half crowded and everybody was ripping the film. All the critics have been right in ripping it. This movie could go down as one of the worst ever and rightfully so. There is nothing that could make me sit down and watch this film again. Nobody should be but subject to that punishment. Save yourself some time, brain cells, and money by missing this film. At least when Troy butchered The Illiad, they made the movie fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>I cannot imagine, that anybody was thinking: this is the movie we have been waiting for. Who is still interested in the longforgotten battles of an ancient Macedonian army nowadays?<br />Colin Farell is horrible in this movie, but I didn't have a clue what Angelina Jolie was doing. Although everybody speaks English in a normal way, she is using a strange kind of<br />accent. Only the fighting scenes do pass the test, but that is the only aspect of the movie that does. Do not go and see this one if you like this genre. You are still better off watching Troy.<br />That one wasn't all that either, but at least that movie's cast isn't so bloody annoying. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>What can you say about "Alexander" that hasn't been said about the Encyclopedia Britanica? It's long and interesting and has great pictures of far away exotic places, and although I wouldn't want to read the Britanica cover to cover, I'd advise anyone to subject themselves to Oliver Stone's historical biography. This is a play-by-play review of the DVD. Preliminary thoughts include feeling as though I am boarding the Titanic as I sit down to watch this notoriously criticized film, and there is a nagging doubt that it is somewhat shameful for a director to approve a modified version of his product with "Faster-paced Action", like it was a new improved laundry detergent. ... Already I don't know what I hate more; the stuffy history lesson narrative, or the shiny, young Greek protege child actors with British accents, ...Much time has passed, (or so it seems, I'm not yet through the first hour), I don't think I can make it to the end. Colin Farrell (Alexander), looks like a bunny rabbit in shock, like that last living look of a soon to be road kill on a country highway. Alexander has conquered half of Asia and I keep thinking of other things I might be doing with my time, like cleaning my apartment or starting a stamp collection. As I write, Alexander and his buddies are discussing the dangers of homosexuality. Mind you, they're all in skirts. The battle marching scenes are stunning, the actual battles; so-so, with sweeping aerial scenes of thousands warring, intercut with ridiculous close-ups of swords piercing a foot, and facial reactions to injuries like being bopped on the head by The Three Stooges. The subtitles are absurd. "MACEDONIAN LEFT", means nothing to me. It's hard to tell who's winning the battle but the charging camels win best float in the parade, (I've yet to see the earth-shaking stampeding Indian elephants), ...Hell, Bush would have conquered Asia in half this time, ...There's a "Gone With The Wind" dead battlefield nod. Nice. ...I'm in Persia now. Alexander is falling in love  ... with everybody. Nothing like a little Greek debauchery. Better lock up the camels and snakes. ... Damn, I hit the wrong button on the remote and I'm back to the beginning. Babylonian Twilight Zone. Was I in Persia or India?, it all looks like an ancient Asian opium room, ... I'm through the first hour. Not bad. Not bad at all. It has a youthful and adventurous "Jason and The Argonauts" appeal, and a philosophical world domination theme, and epic cinematic proportions of ancient global vistas and artistic design. What the producer's of this DVD need to do now is offer a secret Alexander decoder ring in every package. ... After nearly three hours, it's over, and the verdict is, it's long and complicated, and the ill-chronological order doesn't help matters, but it's a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Alexander" is great!

'Lexander also when he was a wee one lost his father King Philip, played by the cool Val Kilmer (Mind Hunters, The Doors)...even Kilmer cant pull off anything good. Alexander's story is told by the great low voice of Anthony Hopkins (The Human Stain, Hannibal). We learn that Alexander might have some homoerotic ways, having feelings for his friend, played by Jared Leto (Panic Room, Urban Legend). The empty action picture also stars Rosario Dawson (Frank Miller's Sin City, KIDS) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis '05, Velvet Goldmine). To say this is a masterpiece is surely laughable...it doesnt even hit that mark. Farrell's performance cant make the cut. Oliver Stone sprinkles in some red in a gigantic battle between Elephants...and who needed that red, anyway....I was thinking Alexander Born Killer when that red popped up. A grand failure in many ways though it isnt the worst movie of 2004...it just plain stinks like rotted fish.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Being a fan of the big epic, I went to the theatre with high hopes for this film.  As a bit of a history buff I was aware that many of the ancient Greek men had male lovers.  I had heard some of the reviews mentioning the gay overtones, so I was not shocked or upset seeing them in the film.  I think that it was a sub plot not executed well.  My major problems with the film come from the fact that Stone has made Alexander a whining unlikeable character.  I don't know if it was the writing or the actor, but I really did not feel any charisma from Alexander.  The real Alexander has been reported to have had a temper and a huge ego, but there was a genius mind, a very brave heart, and a charisma that made men follow him to the end of the known world.  I just didn't feel that from this Alexander.  Also I wasn't a big fan of the quick cut battle scenes, and the lack of several key battles from the movie altogether.  The director's cut doesn't do very much to change any of the problems I had with the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>ALEXANDER DIRECTOR'S CUT (Warner) is Oliver Stone's "re-configuration" (his words) of his sweeping bio-epic of the world's greatest warrior-conqueror and, apparently, bisexual.<br /><br />The original $140 million (not counting advertising) theatrical release was reviled by critics and shunned by audiences, earning a paltry $30 some million in the U.S.<br /><br />After a decades long fascination with Alexander the Great, Stone was shocked and humiliated at the public reaction and immediately started re-imagining his film for the digital edition.  Stone cut nearly 20 minutes from the theatrical release and added about ten minutes of unseen footage.  Hundreds of additional edits dramatically reshaped dozens of sequences.  In addition, he removed a significant and controversial homo-erotic love scene between Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his male lover. What was originally mocked as "Alexander the Gay" is now less so.<br /><br />Compared to the theatrical release, Stone's "Director's Cut" is a misnomer.  After all, the first release was also his cut.  However, this DVD is a different film; better because it is more accessible.  The action has been beefed up and the once confusing narrative is easier to follow.  And the already magnificent score by Vangelis seems somehow more effective on this new cut.<br /><br />Stone is a bold, inventive, visionary director who takes chances with controversial material.  However, his attempt to get under the skin (no pun intended) and create a psychological and emotional portrait of this extraordinary historical figure who conquered the known world by the age of 33 over two millennia ago has not been fully realized.<br /><br />But make no mistake, in the midst of awesome images of breathtaking scope, savage violence, and revealing intimacy there are also unexpected moments of insight into a puzzling, complex and paradoxical character.  I'm referring to both Alexander and Stone himself.<br /><br />Stone's dense commentary on this cut is way above the norm, with tons of historical information as well as personal observations.  But the secret thing that drove Alexander -- and why the director's obsession with him -- are still a mystery.  The second disc's feature length documentary on the film's production by Sean Stone (Oliver's son) are nicely done, refreshingly raw and unpretentious.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe this is only a work-in-progress that will eventuall undergo more changes and, like a great artist painting over a flawed canvas, Stone will eventually reveal the masterpiece that lurks beneath the surface of what is probably the most expensive vanity production of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Rented the Director's Cut version last night. I was seriously hesitant to watch this sucker at all, considering how it got lambasted by the critics and many, many others.<br /><br />So the big question on your mind is "Was it really that bad?"<br /><br />Yes ...and no. Sorry. I'm not trying to cut hairs by saying "define sex", as Bill Clinton would. I'm just trying to say that there were definitely some excellent qualities in this film that made it watchable.<br /><br />But there were also some serious downers that made it painful, too.<br /><br />For me, I didn't have a problem with the acting nor the actors. I thought all of them (yes, even Jolie with her faux-whatever-accent) gave a fine performance. I love Val Kilmer as an actor, and I wasn't disappointed by his portrayal of Phillip, the father of Alexander.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins, as always, was fine as the aging Ptolemy who gives us his narrative take of Alexander throughout the film.<br /><br />The battle scenes were well done, too. You may have heard about "The Elephant Battle", and how great it was. Well it is. This alone may well be worth the price of renting the film.<br /><br />In true Oliver Stone fashion, we also get the colorful scenes of death and destruction, never holding back (ala Platoon, 1986).<br /><br />Where the movie falters is in its execution and screenplay. The storyline jumps us back and forth and back and forth and back and forth in time, trying to make sense of why Alexander is the way he is. This was terribly irritating and, sometimes, confusing.<br /><br />"Are we in 329 A.D. again?"<br /><br />"No."<br /><br />"Oh."<br /><br />But the film is not as bad as the critics would have you believe. And the Greeks (the current Greeks) just need to shut up about the "gay" scenes and eat a few more olives. It was common for men to take other men as lovers. Twas no big deal. And it's not like this film showed two men pumping away at each other. There were only three hugs, two sets of tears, a few words of affection, and one simple kiss. Whoopty-Doo.<br /><br />I do feel that the problem with the movie is that Stone tried to cover too much information in one short film (although 3 hours might not seem that short to some). But when you try to capture all of the essence of one man who changed the course of history in one, quick stroke, I think you're bound to fail. This thing should've been a miniseries, about 6-12 hours in length, in order to keep the story flow moving forward without the confusing and constant flashbacks.<br /><br />So is it worth your time? I think so. It's not Stone's best film, but it's definitely entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Ever since seeing `Gladiator' I have been obsessed with the swords-and-sandals epics.  Sadly there hasn't been a film since to really capture all that `Gladiator' was able to capture.  That said, I had really high hopes for `Alexander'.  Oliver Stone is truly a visionary director, if not highly misunderstood.  Some of his films reach levels of greatness (`Natural Born Killers') while others are overshot even for him and fail miserably (`World Trade Center').  `Alexander' falls somewhere in the middle.  It has moments of superbly crafted greatness, yet it has many other moments of meandering mediocrity.  The cast is filled to the brim with big names, yet it is the smallest names that work the best here, and while the film is shot with a truly epic scope it fails to embrace the gritty grandeur that is the very definition of `epic'.<br /><br />Telling the story of Alexander the Great and his rise to power is a hefty assignment.  He's on of the most recognizable faces in World History and his story is one of the most interesting and commanding.  Alexander truly defined the word `great' and his life should lead to one fantastic film.  Sadly Stone doesn't seem to really grasp all that could be had here.  He sees facets of Alexander's life, facets mostly unknown to the American public, and attempts to uncover them and them alone in a way of `enlightening' us.  The problem is that the most memorable and interesting parts of Alexander's life are thus left barely breached.  First and foremost Alexander was a warrior, a leader, a man who conquered the known world at the young age of thirty.  `Alexander' the film never really fleshes out this warrior in him.  The opening line in the film refers to Alexander as a god; but the film never gives us any reason to think so.<br /><br />The action sequences, while decent, are really just that; decent.  I expected so much more from these (especially when word got out about the elephants) but I was disappointed at the amount of confusion these battles led to.  They are choppy and hard to follow.  Another area of complaint was the sets themselves.  While they looked authentic to a degree, everything seemed `too' authentic; if that makes any sense.  Especially in the scenes involving Old Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins); I just felt like I was in a museum.<br /><br />The acting is also a sore spot.  Much has been said in regards to Angelina's poor accent, and while it didn't bother me to the extent that it bothered critics, it really was terrible.  Val Kilmer was atrocious here, and Anthony Hopkins was easily forgettable, which is very uncommon for him.  Jared Leto plays Hephaistion horrifically.  It's sad because his character could have been marvelously portrayed.  It's such a baity role; male lover, friend and advisor to the king; but instead he plays him so subdued and brittle you would never get the impression he was a warrior alongside the king.  He's too much of a badly portrayed stereotype if you get my drift.<br /><br />Colin Farrell on the other hand scores well here.  Many critics balked at his portrayal of the doomed king, but I actually think that Farrell did a superb job.  He goes through so many emotions it would have been easy for any actor to get lost in them and fumble through them so-to-speak but Colin maneuvers himself through this cast array of emotions effortlessly.  I was stunned at his presence.  I have been watching him for a while now and have been so happy with his steady rise in the ranks.  Films like `Tigerland', `Phone Booth' and `Alexander' show what this guy is capable of.  Rosario Dawson also delivers a well crafted performance.  As Roxane, Alexander's bride, she captures her raw exotic persona that made her the woman she was.  While Stone makes it a point to rest Alexander's heart in the hands of men we are able to get a glimpse of the passion Roxane sparked within his soul despite his extramarital longings.<br /><br />One area I can give it the greatest of praise though is the score, which elevates the film in a way and delivers a marvelous tone and mood.  It's beautiful in every way possible.<br /><br />Like I mentioned on the outset; there are moments here that work very well.  This has to do with Farrell's dedication and determination to make it work.  There are just too many moments that don't work for this to be considered a great film, or even a good one.  It moves very slowly in scenes, and while I enjoy a slow-moving character study as much as the next `quote-unquote' critic, I still like to be interested in the subject.  `Alexander' moves at such a pace that it loses the audience in many places.  Oliver Stone might have undershot this one, not taking it to the places it could have gone.  He really could have gone there, taken it to that next level.  With a subject like Alexander the Great you almost have the responsibility to make it big and bold but sadly for the most part `Alexander' is long and dull and uneventful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I got to go to a sneak preview of this movie at my college campus; and let me just say at the end the movie the theater of 100 people were not happy!  Granted none of us really complained because the campus paid for us to see it, but if they hadn't I think that their would be a storm for our money back.  I was extremely excited because after seeing Troy (which was amazing) and knowing Jared Leto(loved him since My So Called Life--plus his parts in the movie were choppy; like they started to give him a scene but realized it was too long of a movie and made his scenes just retarded) was in this  and all the other big names I thought this would be so awesome. I was wrong!<br /><br />First I didn't realize it was 2 Hours!  Fine if a movie is well made--but two hours of the same thing OVER AND OVER!  Not good.<br /><br />Colin was terrible.  I mean I have seen people in plays on campus with no money coming to them do better.  I just didn't feel him as an actor. And the hair...two hours of that was not good...it looked too fake and bleached.  I know they didn't have bleach then!<br /><br />The jumping around was just redundant after a while.  The fight scenes LONG and BORING!  Not well thought out!  And the other big names Jolie and Hopkins didn't shine either.  What happened to them?!  I just don't have anything good to say about this movie.  Okay I will admitt the end like the last 15 or so minutes where everyone dies was good.  I am not sure if it was because I knew it would be over or if I really did like it.  I don't want to see it again to find out.<br /><br />I can't take back the 2 hours that I lost of my life.  But I can help to save another person from wasting their time.  If you really want to see it.  Wait until DVD or go when you are so bored you don't mind losing some of your life to a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>How can you miss with a cast that includes Anthony<br /><br />Hopkins, Christopher Plummer, Colin Farrell, Angelina<br /><br />Jolie and Val Kilmer...and director Oliver Stone<br /><br />behind the wheel?  It's easy.  If you are expecting a<br /><br />Stone classic such as Platoon, Wall Street, Talk<br /><br />Radio, Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors, or<br /><br />Natural Born Killers, you will be extremely<br /><br />disappointed.<br /><br />Granted, Kilmer, Jolie, Hopkins and Farrell turn in<br /><br />outstanding acting performances, and Vangelis provides<br /><br />a beautifully haunting and bold soundtrack, but<br /><br />"Alexander" loses his "balls" (if I may boldly state)<br /><br />when the "truth" behind this "great" is suddenly<br /><br />exposed with blatant and eplicit scenes of taking a<br /><br />piece of bread and buttering it on both sides...if you<br /><br />get my drift.<br /><br />Not being an historian, nor an astute pupil of ancient<br /><br />history (I'd never make it on "Jeopardy"), I did not<br /><br />realize (nor did my lady) that Alexander the Great was<br /><br />bi-sexual.  By no means do I object to anyone's sexual<br /><br />preference, but I was totally taken by surprise to<br /><br />discover (ON THE SCREEN...IN LIVING COLOR) that<br /><br />Alexander's true love was a man.<br /><br />During the first of several love scenes (some<br /><br />subtle...one blatant) with each other, a family got up<br /><br />and left the theatre.  I applaud the parents for that<br /><br />wise move.<br /><br />What could have been a great film simply rubbed me the<br /><br />wrong way (no pun intended).  I suppose there will be<br /><br />those that will praise this film for its boldness and<br /><br />daring recreation of history, but it simply turned me<br /><br />off.  If you are a movie buff (like me), it is<br /><br />definitely a film you must see for its editing,<br /><br />incredible aerial scenes through the eyes (and wings)<br /><br />of a hawk...and the acting, specifically, from Kilmer,<br /><br />Jolie and Farrell.<br /><br />Jolie and Kilmer are portrayed as Alexander's parents.<br /><br />  Both are dysfunctional and abusive.  She hates<br /><br />men...he hates women...and together they struggle for<br /><br />power in Babylon.  Murder, revenge, love, obsession<br /><br />and greed play a huge role in this flick.<br /><br />The most memorbale scene is a jungle battle in<br /><br />India...with Alexander and his faithful horse braving<br /><br />the tribal troops riding massive elephants and donning<br /><br />blankets of steel.<br /><br />The most touching moment comes from Farrell when his<br /><br />father is murdered...a scene one will never forget.<br /><br />If this sounds like a movie you want to see, then<br /><br />don't miss the first 30 minutes.  Listen closely.<br /><br />There is an abundance of "words of wisdom" that is<br /><br />played out in nearly every scene for the following 2<br /><br />1/2 hours.<br /><br />If you can look beyond the love relationships between<br /><br />men and men, you'd give it a 4 or 5 on a 5-star scale.  I give it a 3 for the acting performances, editing and soundtrack.  If there are 5 stars in the film, it is definitely Vangelis' stunning soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>There was no way I could have sat through all of this film. And this is only the second edition of this film - Oliver Stone has released another edition, the 'final' cut, which I unfortunately got recommended on Amazon. Does he really think a third edition is going to make the film worth watching? My answer's no.<br /><br />I got this for cheap, but now it has no re-sale value, and it looks like I'm stuck with it, unless I can fob it off onto some poor unsuspecting soul. People rave about Oliver Stone, the man who wrote Scarface (but who unfortunately cannot be blamed for the poster that everybody MUST have), like they rave about David Lynch or James Cameron. Personally? I couldn't sit through Natural Born Killers either. But I did sit through Lost Highway. What does that say? Two movies of Oliver Stone's that I cannot sit through.<br /><br />I watched it for an hour, and then checked to see how much longer I still had left to watch. When I saw I still had another hour and 40 minutes of pure hell, I switched it off. If there's no story in the first hour, then the director is either stretching it out big time, or there's no story to the film at all. And who the hell is Alexander? I never learned about him in my history classes at school. And I took them for four years.<br /><br />The only shining star in this film was Angelina Jolie, looking all Greek and gorgeous - but speaking in what can only be a Russian accent? Val Kilmer is absolutely wasted, considering what he had to go through with the fake scarring over his eye.<br /><br />There are so many 'good' reviews of this film, that it's hard to believe we watched the same film. It shows that throwing lots of money at a film will not necessarily make it a good film that people will flock to see. It's diabolical and should be forgotten about. Forget it ever happened, forget Oliver Stone ever actually had the audacity to release THREE different (but not better) versions of it and forget the big name stars actually got PAID to appear in this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I had high expectations for the movie.

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's extremely far from great!  Whoever decided to use Colin Farrell to play Alexander, should be shot!  He looks ridiculous with blond hair too.  See Gladiator or Troy instead, they're great!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Oliver Stone<br /><br />One of the most valuable lessons a young fiction writer must learn is "show, don't tell".  What this means is that rather than handing the reader every point the author wants to get across, the writer should let the details come out naturally as a part of the story.  To illustrate with examples what sort of a man the main character is, to show the reader and let the reader see for himself.  With film being such a visual medium, this is not a problem that I expect to encounter very often when I go to the theatre.  Unfortunately, this was a big problem with "Alexander".<br /><br />"Alexander" is narrated by an aging Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), a former warrior chief who was with Alexander (Colin Farrell) during his rise to glory.  Ptolemy is teaching his students, explaining who Alexander was and the difference between myth and man and why even those who were there have a hard time telling the difference when they look back and remember.  Ptolemy, with long stretches of narration, explains to the viewer what sort of upbringing Alexander had with his mother Olympius (Angelina Jolie) and King Philip (Val Kilmer), and what sort of man he grew up to be.  We see how abusive Philip was to Olympius and how much she hated her husband.  Olympius, from an early age was poisoning the mind of young Alexander against Philip and Philip knew it.  That Olympius had a large influence on Alexander's life is stated in no uncertain terms.  Then we are brought forward years later when Alexander is on campaign.  We are told that he has become a bold warrior, and we see Alexander lead his men into battle.  What we don't see his Alexander grow into a bold warrior.  We don't see the events that shape Alexander into a man.  We see Alexander as a youth talking about conquering to the East, which explains his campaigns against Persia and beyond.<br /><br />"Alexander" lacks a strong thread of a narrative running through the film.  Perhaps the story of Alexander the Great is too big to be told in a three hour movie, but what we are given is bits and pieces which flash forward and back in time and are introduced and narrated by Ptolemy.  We are told the details of Alexander's life, and then we see the portion of the movie that follows up on that detail and that explanation.  It is almost as if the theatre were a college classroom and every now and then Ptolemy pauses the movie to explain what has come before and what is about to come before letting the movie continue.  Because of this what we see is really just episodes from the short life of Alexander the Great.  We see Alexander's great love for his friend (and perhaps lover) Hephaistion (Jared Leto), and the trouble that his marriage to the barbarian Roxane (Rosario Dawson) caused amongst his men.  But there is no narrative here.  "Alexander" is a collection of scenes.<br /><br /> Another problem with "Alexander" is that Collin Farrell does not convey just how impressive a man Alexander must have been.  To have done so much that was so unprecedented must have taken a force of will and a magnetic personality that Farrell just does not exude, not as Russell Crowe did in "Gladiator" and not as Mel Gibson did in "Braveheart."  Farrell did well here, and he is a fine actor, but he doesn't exude the leadership that Alexander must have had and that Crowe and Gibson were able to in their movies.<br /><br />By no means am I trying to suggest that "Alexander" is a waste of time.  It isn't.  It is a huge historical epic movie (and I like those) and it is beautiful to look at.  Most of the actors give a fantastic, believable performance in their roles and Angelina Jolie is delightful in her over-the-top portrayal of Olympius.  There is a campy feel to Olympius with her accent that honestly reminds me more of Natascha (from the Bullwinkle cartoon) than anything else, but the most fun "Alexander" has is when Jolie is onscreen.  Honestly, "Alexander" is a bit of a mess with no actual story that it is trying to tell, but it is still an entertaining mess if the expectations are lowered appropriately.  "Alexander" is not the Academy Award worthy movie that many had hoped, but there are worse ways to spend three hours.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>Towards the end of this film Alexander invades India. It is raining there are moneys all over the place and the troops march through jungle. Now in reality the part of India invaded by Alexander was north west India. A rather dry place which is now Pakistan. There were no jungles and monkies would have been confined to cages. Why is it that a film is just so inaccurate?<br /><br />At the battle of Guagamela 47,000 heavily armed Greeks met a large number of lightly armed Persians. The Greeks lost 500 killed. Yet the conclusion of this battle looks more like aftermath of the battle of Borodino in which tens of thousands were killed.<br /><br />However the major irritation is not the historical howlers. At school there are two types of people. Those who are good at sport and those who like reading books. The ones who are good at sport develop a self confidence early on and are free of doubt in themselves and what to do. Those who read books are always full of self doubt and dither when faced by decisions. Alexander was a person who was raised for militiary command since being born and commanded large bodies of men from the age of 17. There is not the slightest suggestion that he ever suffered from self confidence or doubt in himself. His invasion of the Persian Empire was a meticulously thought out operation which involved the neutralisation of the Western part of the empire to destroy Persian sea power and to free the Greek cities in Ionia. Alexander then moved to conquer the centre of the Empire.<br /><br />Stone's portrait of Alexander is one of the sort of kid at school who read books, who was eaten by self doubt and dithered. Not only is Alexander portrayed in that way so are his generals. Prior to the battle of Guagamela which was an easy win the movie portrays Alexander's generals as wanting to retreat or not to engage. The historical accounts suggest that after previous victories including Issus the Greeks knew that they would win and Alexander's generals were more confident than he was.<br /><br />The ancients saw Alexander's life as a tragedy. He started his campaign with Greek virtues but he began to be seduced by barbarian customs. He wanted his soldiers to prostate themselves to him and he wanted to merge the Persian and Greek peoples. Stone has a different approach. He sees Alexander as a wounded soul because of his fathers rejection of him and his mother. The real Alexander was not a 20th century feel good type who suffered from identity issues. He was a person who was raised in what was at the time the most militarily developed part of the world and he set about using his country to conquer the world.<br /><br />Still the costumes are good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"Coming out of tiny Macedonia, Alexander (356-323 B.C.), led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33."<br /><br />The good: Young Alexander calms and rides wild black stallion Bucephalus; Val Kilmer as Alexander's warrior father Phillip shows the boy cave drawings of Greek myths which presage Alexander's life... Two battles - the first at Gaugamela where young Alexander defeated King Darius and the second - magnificent and spectacular battle of Alexander's army against elephants in India with the unforgettable shot of Alexander on his horse against the huge animal; the surreal atmosphere of the last battle thanks to the color red that dominated the scene as seen through the eyes of the wounded Alexander. Legendary Babylon with its Tower and the hanging Gardens is breathtaking as it is shown in the movie. Angelina Jolie was regal....when her mouth was shut and here I come to the bad and the ridiculous. Who on earth decided that the Queen of the Ancient Macedonia in the 4th Century B.C.) should speak with the most horrible imitation of an Eastern European accent ever on the screen? The scenes between Jolie and Farrell made me laugh - so bizarre and ludicrous they were. Besides, even if I assume that Olimpias had Alexander when she was very young, 15 or 16, she did not change a bit when he was 25, and they looked together like a brother and a sister or two lovers - not like a mother and son. The real problem is that with all the and passion for his project and its subject, Stone could not make his overlong (almost three hours) movie as interesting and convincing as just some of its parts are. I have nothing against non-linear structure - when it works but here it was distracting and confusing - the only way to realize where and when you were was by watching the length of Alexander's hair. As for Farrell in the titular role, he was not bad - he is just not charismatic enough. I could not help thinking of another Alexander the Great project - Baz Luhrman's with Leonardo DiCaprio - who is a better actor and who was incredibly good in the last year's "The Aviator"... Well, quoting one of my favorite critics, "the movie has some interesting moments but you can find something better to do with this part of your life."</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"Alexander Revisited" is the definitive version of Oliver Stone's underrated film on the life of Alexander the Great. Stone has added almost forty minutes of footage to bring the film's running length to three hours and thirty-four minutes, including an intermission break. The new footage offers some new insight into the characters, but for the most part, allows the audience to breathe more. Scenes are now allowed to flow better, making this a more complete movie experience.<br />The great performances are made even better with the new footage, and supporting characters are fleshed out even more, especially the character of Bagoas, who we now get to feel for. The new scenes also allow us to feel with the characters emotionally.<br />Overall, this is definitely the best version of the film! If you didn't enjoy the film before, then you might enjoy this version of it. But if, like me, you did enjoy the previous versions of the film, then you're going to like this version even more!

But I digress. Apparently this film has end titles but the management of the cinema I attended saw fit to drop the curtains and up the lights before the film had even ended, as if to say: "right, you lot. OUT!" Or maybe it was a moment of misguided altruism: "My God, that was a turkey. I'm sure you'll all want to get out as quickly as possible!" Well, actually no. I was determined to watch it to the last excruitiating copyright symbol. Throughout the screening, a bit of curtain had inexplicably been left jutting out on the left side corner, obscuring part of the screen. Cynics might say, the less you see of Alexander, the better. In fact, there were no walk outs. Perhaps we were taken in by Oliver Stone's flattery of European audiences, and determined to sit there with an air of masochistic superiority. However, one gentlemen pretended to stretch in order to take a furtive glance at his watch. Saw that, mate. Surprising to hear so little guffawing from a country that made Life of Brian and Carry On Cleo. The only members of the audience behind me giggling were Americans. Now, I'm a terrible giggler and this should have set me off, but perhaps I was too stupified. I don't like to kick a man when he's down, so I'll merely tell you what sent the gigglers off the most. The notorious: "you love...HEEM?" followed by Alexander's bizarre wedding night, sure to be a bad movie fan classic. Then there was Alexander's Lion headset which made it look like a lion was sipping wine at one point. Bucephalus rising up against an elephant also on it's haunches (actually, that was me laughing. I definately heard myself). Surprisingly, Hephaistion's celebrated death scene did not muster so much as a titter from the giggle squad. Perhaps they had keeled over and died at that point. I was unable to keel over and die, dressed as I was, head to toe in rubber. Hey, I said us British were masochistic. Had a hell of a time getting out of the stalls, too.<br /><br />My own personal favourite bits were Alexander talking tough to his cohorts and then talking in a mincing voice to Hepheistion, as if in the closet. Eventually he appears to come out in horrified public by kissing a servant. Hang on a minute, I thought this sort of thing was accepted in those days, so who needs to come out? Another crass moment was the camera jiggling up and down, presumably to illustrate the effect of approaching elephants. Inexplicably though, in an innocuous following scene in Alexander's quarters, the camera starts jumping up and down again. I think it was pointing at a bowl of fruit or something.</p></br></body></html>

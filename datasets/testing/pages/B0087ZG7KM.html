The tipping point is that BRIDESMAIDS comes with a core of emotional truth whereas if you lift that sense of mystery from THE HANGOVER, what's left is a series of skits. BRIDESMAIDS comes with more heart. It passes the smell test, demonstrates staying power. Odds are, it won't be long before other films are being lauded as "the next BRIDESMAIDS." And, based on that comparison, I might check out that other film, too.<br /><br />Our self-destructive lead character Annie (Kristen Wiig) is informed that "hitting bottom is a good thing," but I think we all know that's a bunch of baloney, a heap of hooey. Character building can go fudge itself if it means one has to go thru what Annie does just to learn valuable life lessons. Annie's had a bad time of it. Her bakery shop went south. Her boyfriend is this self-absorbed, belittling, non-committing assclown. She rooms with an odd and portly British brother and sister whose presence, let's face it, can't possibly make anyone feel comfortable. Her current job as sales clerk at a jewelry store is as fulfilling as it sounds. And, to point out the cherry on her misery cake, Annie's best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is getting married, with Annie tapped as the maid of honor.<br /><br />Oh, does Annie have issues. She's one of life's self-saboteurs; she can be blamed for much of the bad joss what's befallen her. She loves her best friend dearly, but the cheap, pathetic side of her can't help but be resentful that their lives are going opposite ways. And since the hits keep on coming, why not now introduce the magnificent Helen (a very good Rose Byrne). Helen is the gorgeous trophy wife of Lillian's fiance's boss, and she's struck up a friendship with Lillian. Helen, wealthy as Croesus, supernaturally efficient at organizing weddings, and determined not to be upstaged. Helen and Annie immediately get on like houses on fire. Annie senses that Helen is poaching her best friend. Out comes the competitive streak. Except that Annie isn't as straight-faced sneaky as Helen. Watch Annie fall apart.<br /><br />The theater I went to became sheer bedlam, rocking with belly laughs so raucous that entire chunks of dialogue went unheard. So that means something. Unless you're a friggin' recluse, you must have some down-to-earth women friends. These bridesmaids are drawn from stereotypes, but these actresses are all so funny. I can point out several of my women pals who fit several of these molds to a damn T. The fantastic cast works so well together. I haven't laughed so hard in years as when the bridal shop disaster went down. Anyway, this shouldn't come as a shock: Women sleep around, and often exercise the right to be vulgar when in comfortable company, and they certainly engage in scatological humor. Wendi McLendon-Covey ("Rita") is one of the bridesmaids, a discontented housewife with unruly kids, and although she's not in the movie a lot, she makes an impression (especially with that "crack the blanket in half" line). But it's the unfiltered Melissa McCarthy ("Megan"), built like a pugnacious fire hydrant, who ends up stealing the scenes.<br /><br />Not having watched SNL in forever long, I didn't know Kristen Wiig from Shatner's wig. But now she's fixed on my radar, and now I expect this same level of funny out of her. Kristen Wiig is amazing in BRIDESMAIDS, co-writing it, performing in it. Her character is at turns petty and self-pitying and abusive, and yet there's a pained vulnerability and an innate likability that makes you invest in her. She's so sad sack. You long for her to get her sh-- together, and you pull for her to get with that charming highway patrol cop with the unexpected Irish accent. But she's so resistant, so stuck in her rut. You pull for her.<br /><br />Setting aside Wiig's ability to emote (which apparently surprised people left and right), her comic talents are what separate her from the pack. She has exquisite comic timing. What she does in that airplane sequence is spectacular stuff. And she exhibits marvelous chemistry with Maya Rudolph. Their friendship feels real; it helps to ground the story. I think this is a huge turning point for Kristen Wiig's career, if she rides this good momentum. And BRIDESMAIDS, it's one of them rare animals, a chick flick that a guy can sit thru without feeling that he's fulfilling an obligation to the girlfriend or the wife.<br /><br />The DVD gives you the option to watch the Theatrical Version or the Unrated Version, and also the following bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Lively Audio Commentary with director Paul Feig, co-writer Annie Mumolo, and actors Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper<br />- 3 Deleted Scenes, including Annie on a horrible blind date with Paul Rudd (totaling 00:07:48 minutes)<br />- 5 Extended & Alternate Scenes, including more grossness at the bridal shop (totaling 00:08:38 minutes)<br />- Gag Reel (00:03:44 minutes)<br />- Line-O-Rama - repeated takes, actors trying out ad-libbed lines (00:12:08)<br />- Cholodecki's Commercial - a faux commercial advertising the jewelry store that Annie gets fired from (00:01:00)</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Finally, I've seen something that stars Kristen Wiig and wasn't a complete disappointment.<br /><br />I loved her on "Saturday Night Live" and I'm always amazed at how talented she is.  In BRIDESMAIDS, she not only stars but also shares writing credit...which is another reason I enjoyed this movie so much:<br /><br />Only a woman would have written this.<br /><br />As crude as BRIDESMAIDS sometimes is, rivaling male-oriented gross-out comedies like THE HANGOVER and such, this is still a story that only a woman would write.  My case in point: the scene where Kristen feels the need to keep snatching the microphone from best friend Maya Rudolph's rich soon-to-be sister-in-law.  The need to assert just how much these girls love and respect and care about Maya...only a woman would have written that.  Guys wouldn't understand how much that means to a woman.  Male writers would've just come up with schtick to embarass the girls.<br /><br />So BRIDESMAIDS ends up being a fairly interesting insight into women and how they think.<br /><br />It's also really funny!</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This is an interesting blend of some gross humor, not too much, and real drama but not sappiness among a group of women.  One is about to marry and her best friend is at odds with another close pal as they try to plan the wedding, get dresses, etc.  Wiig and Rudolph are hilarious and heartbreaking, but it's Melissa McCarthy who really steals the show in all of her scenes as one of the other friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This film started off on a very strong note, with a really great cast, and there are many funny bits in this film. This is a 'chick flick', but it has sex, vomiting, and explosive crapping in it. However, none of this is shown in graphic detail like you would see in a 'guy flick', you do not see any throwing up or any gross bits, all of it is covered up, and that was what made it funny without being gross (and the reason behind the vomiting and etc are plausible)<br /><br />However, I did not like how the movie ended, it started off very strong but ended on a somewhat weak note. I was prepared to give five stars, but the ending wasn't that good.<br /><br />There's one thing that bothers me - the pink dresses on the cover of this DVD are never seen in the movie itself. Yes, it's a minor quibble and doesn't affect the movie itself, but why use a different set of dresses that is never used in the movie? It'd be nice of the cover actually matched the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Finally, a chick film for the chick film haters! Bridesmaids is the equivilant of a really good, rauchy guy flick, but for the ladies. Everything from the cast to the script, to the gags is utterly over the top-but in an awesome type of way. I can't remember when I've laughed this much, and I don't even like watching comedies, and certainly not anything labeled 'chick flick'. Is it predictable? Sure, but at least it keeps you entertained til the very end.<br /><br />The premise is as simple as it gets-two best friends, one is getting married, and then of course there are the other bridesmaids-ALL with issues of their own. And then you get to witness every event prior to the wedding get completely messed up in some way, from the engagement party, to the bridal shower, to the bachelorette party. And probably one of the funniest scenes- the girls go pick out their dresses.... Really, it's best to just watch it instead of having people talk to much about it. Yes, it's on the raunchy side to it's not really suitable for kids, but for everyone else, it's a go! Plus, this is not just for girls. I really think the men will get into it as well!</p></br><a href="../users/ATHTCOG6BB6WK.html">ATHTCOG6BB6WK</a><br/><p>Bridesmaids takes "friendly" competition to a hysterical level when an old best friend feuds with the newer version. The scene of lava from Brazil is just wrong but hilarious. The bridesmaid Annie needs to get her head on straight and stand up for herself when others don't treat her right, but instead she vents on the wrong people. The Wilson Philips song at the end is a good theme song for her. I love Megan because she is so genuine.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Kristen Wiig is a comedic goldmine.  She just knows how to milk `funny' out of any and everything.  The fact that she wrote this screenplay is testament to that fact.  What it is also testament to is that she understands the importance of layering her comedy with drama, and by drama I don't mean your textbook drama of the theatrical kind (although some of that is here too) but what I mean is genuine, heartfelt drama of the almost bitter-sweet kind.  There is a sadness here that meshes beautifully with those `funny moments'.<br /><br />`Bridesmaids', which was marketed as a `Hangover' for chicks (complete with focus on a Las Vegas bachelorette party) is anything but a rehashing of that successful 2009 comedy.  Instead, Las Vegas is a minor scene that doesn't even really happen and so the focus of that event in the trailer was an obvious misleading of audiences, but it was a twist I was so happy to embrace because last thing I wanted to see was this turn into `Hangover' redux.  Instead, `Bridesmaids' tells the story of a Maid of Honor trying to get a grip on her own thankless life while trying to support her best friend, who happens to be getting married.  Annie is so lonely and pathetic and depressed and yet Lillian is glowing with marital happiness.  When Annie meets Helen, Lillian's `other' best friend, a rivalry is born for Lillian's affections and attention and soon the crazy is unleashed in various forms.<br /><br />`Bridesmaids' primary problem is that it doesn't know when to call it a day.  It is probably about twenty minutes too long.  That isn't to say that there is a lot of fluff here, because there really isn't and the more mellow moments (especially concerning Annie's budding romance with traffic cop Rhodes) are needed in developing the film as a whole, but it really should have been trimmed back.<br /><br />The performances are all wonderful.  Wiig is flawless here, truly developing her character beyond the comedic timing.  Just watch her face as she hears about Lillian's engagement.  There is such sadness behind those eyes, such depth of character.  You can see her telling her story without uttering a single word.  Rose Byrne should probably stick to comedy forever since she isn't having much luck with the drama side of things and her performance here is the highlight of her career (she was also lovely in her jovial scenes in `Marie Antoinette').  She is totally on her A-game and delivers some of the film's funniest moments.<br /><br />And I just love Chris O'Dowd!<br /><br />In the end, `Bridesmaids' is a great little film.  It is funny and charming and sincere, which is a hard combination to come by these days, especially in this genre.  Wiig exercises her funny muscle in more ways than one and develops a film that keeps on giving.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Meet Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig), whose life is not going well. Her bakery shop on which she spent so much money has failed. Her life is falling apart like her old car. But her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), who is going to marry, asks Annie to be her bride of honor. Annie is happy to accept, but soon realizes that organizing a wedding requires great patience especially when you have to compete with rich and domineering Helen (Rose Byrne).<br /><br />Whether or not you like "Bridesmaids," one of the biggest hits of 2011, depends on what you expect from the film, which is produced by Judd Apatow. "Bridesmaids" is a "laugh-out-loud" comedy, not a romantic comedy. The film's story is more about the rivalry and friendship between women, which is told with several gross-out jokes involving sex, food poisoning and drinking.<br /><br />In comedy there is a thin line between "laughing with" and "laughing at." While wavering between the two territories, "Bridesmaids" often leans toward the latter with episodes (the bathroom scene) that will make you laugh at the expense of the characters' dignities. While some audiences will find it hilarious, others will think it is embarrassing. OK, "The Help" also has a pie-eating episode, but it is not that crude.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" is a string of sketches cobbled together. The sketches are mostly funny, but the film loses momentum when it starts to take itself seriously, with a subplot about Annie's romantic interest. I enjoyed watching the film, but does it deserve Oscar nominations? I don't know....</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy<br />star in this 2011 comedy.

I was thoroughly entertained by the film, but comedies don't usually fare well at awards time. Kirstin Wiig is definitely a force of nature; co-writer and star of the manic romp that pushes the envelope in many ways. A fine ensemble cast mainly features 4 actresses: Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne & McCarthy. All are fine. The DVD I watched had no extras, which is a drag, because I wanted to know more about how director Paul Feig put it all together with such precision.<br /><br />Unless you're a complete curmudgeon, I don't know how you won't be entertained by this film about how regular people like you and I show their vulnerability and humanness. Kick back, enjoy...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Bridesmaids starring Kristen Wiig is definitely worth all the hype! Mostly movies that get a lot of attention like this one did during the summer; I tend to hate but Bridesmaids is one of the funniest films of 2011! Wiig is a freakin' genius at what she does and she also co-wrote this comedy as well. The scene on the airplane is priceless and I love how this film has some depth to it, Wiig's character Annie is someone you can't help but idenitfy with and root for. I love, love, love this movie! I highly recommend it, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>I think my expectations were set too high since I was told it was "like The Hangover" - they are similar in some respects but Bridesmaids lacks the clever plotting, carefully planned payoffs and inherent likability of the broken characters.<br /><br />Bridesmaids has a couple of extremely funny scenes linked together by a very predictable story but it never really delivers on the promise of the premise. Kristin Wiig's character is a mashup of the SNL roles she's played in the last season and comes across as annoying and unbearable. Maya Rudolph snoozes her way through the film and doesn't really have any funny scenes to play to. The Unrated edition has some over-the-top dialog that doesn't really add anything to the film.<br /><br />Still, in a year of pretty bad films, it's not a terrible film - just not a particularly good one.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>And so the masses cried out,"Where is the twenty-something gross-out comedy for women?" and lo, the gods of cinema did smile and outpoured Bridesmaids, the latest effort from producer Judd Apatow, the genius mind behind such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up.<br /><br />The movie centers on Annie (Kristian Wiig, who also wrote the screenplay), whose best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), is about to get married. Her newest friend (Rose Byrne), a type-A who organizes everyone's parties/lives, appears to be stealing away affection from Annie who starts to go slowly mad. Annie's life hasn't been in the best of shape anyhow since she lost her business, lost all her money, lost her job and her apartment. Having this added stress on top of it doesn't make things easier and though she eventually gets a new boyfriend in the form of an Irish immigrant cop (Chris O'Dowd), her life remains chaotic and unhappy. Mind you, this is a comedy.<br /><br />And for the most part, it's a very funny! It's rude and crude in parts (particularly in a scene in a bridal shop), but those parts are funny, so I'm fine with that. I will say the movie starts off very strong, sags significantly in the middle (the airplane scene went on way too long), and recovers somewhat in the end. There's still some laughs in the later parts, but the first portion of the movie is where most of the fun is to be had. I will also say that the first part is strong enough to make up for the sagging parts in the middle.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect movie, but it is fun and it is worth seeing. Hopefully it will be the start of a trend where people write good comedy films about women and their relationships, much as they have with men. This movie stands well on its own, but if it's the start of something bigger, I'll be quite pleased.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Kristen Wiig is the only reason I wanted to see this movie, and she is hilarious! Of course, it had more great actresses such as Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, and Wendi McLendon-Covey. There were a lot of hilarious and disgustingly awesome jokes. Wiig plays Annie, best friend to Lillian who is about to get married. Annie is asked to be the Maid of Honor and becomes jealous of Lillian's new rich friend, Helen. Throughout the movie, Annie slowly goes crazy and constantly competes against Helen. If you want a good decent comedy, you'll love BRIDESMAIDS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>SNL alum Kristen Wiig co-wrote and stars in this raunchy comedy all about the ladies.  Much has been made of the fact that this film is for the girls what the celebrated Judd Apatow movies are for the boys.  It's true.  In fact Apatow is a producer.  While there is plenty of in-your-face humor related to sex and bathroom mishaps, the best stuff is more subtle and will produce chuckles rather than guffaws.  In fact, the two 20 year old dudes sitting behind me at a theater viewing clearly didn't get the jokes.  Wiig is terrific as the best friend of the bride (Maya Rudolph) who has found a new friend who wants to control everything.  She's played by Rose Byrne as you've never seen here before...damn funny.  While everyone has their moments, the best character is chubby Megan, the sister of the groom and played with great vigor by Melissa McCarthy.  I could have done without the vomit and diarrhea scene as the ladies were trying on dresses, but hell I was laughing.  While the movie is no doubt a comedy, there is some touching moments when Annie (Wiig) hits the bottom.  The movie should also be noted for being Jill Clayburgh's last film.  She plays Annie's mom.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is hillarious i laughed so hard when i watched this movie, the megan character is awesome. i loved that character the most. this was a fun movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>"Bridesmaids" was not just a laugh 'em up type movie.

Starring SNL-veteran Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), Bridesmaids isn't much of a departure from other Apatow-produced comedies, containing the same improvisational, gross-out humor that typically characterizes his films, with the only difference being it has a cast lead by women. I saw the film in a theatre that was about 95% full, with about 85% women, and the other 10% husbands that were dragged to the show by their wives. There is a target audience for Bridesmaids and while it can be enjoyed by both sexes, the women laughed hysterically at every joke I didn't laugh at...Or perhaps it was just every joke. If you fall into this target audience, you may enjoy the film more than I did...And I actually quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />Wiig plays Annie, whose personal life is in a state of turmoil. Her cake shop has gone under, leaving her to slave away at a jewelry store, she's low on money, and the only man in her life (an uncredited Jon Hamm, who, if you'll excuse the pun, is hamming it up and seems to be having fun) is a little too honest about their relationship status. In the midst of all this, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), Annie's friend since childhood, has recently become engaged and has asked Annie to be her Maid of Honor. She also selects four bridesmaids; Helen (Rose Byrne), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), Becca (Ellie Kemper), and her fianc&eacute;e's sister Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Adding to Annie's personal troubles is her insecurity over Lillian's friendship with Helen, who takes charge of nearly all of the wedding details. Meanwhile, Annie meets a sweet Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) while the stress of Lillian's wedding piles on.<br /><br />The six women that lead the ensemble each have a different style of humor that both fits in with and complements the film perfectly. There is, however, an unspoken and rarely discussed rule of ensemble comedies that dictate two things: (a) no less than one character will be underutilized, in this case Becca, the na?ve newlywed and (b) one character must stand-out from the rest due to the way they contrast with the main characters, in this case Megan, the odd, overweight sister of the groom. Each actress is very funny in her own way, with Wiig convincingly embodying Annie and scoring many laughs throughout. McLendon-Covey as Rita, an unsatisfied wife and mother, has a hilarious deadpan that seemed to really click with the audience. If I were to speculate I'd say that Rita touches on the things that mothers would never say out loud. The whole cast had me laughing at various points in the film, but it is McCarthy whom I would call my personal favorite and, in my eyes, is the star of the show.<br /><br />I admit to being easily amused and I have found terrible comedies passable because of my lack-of-resistance to amusement. It's easy to make me smile, chuckle, or even laugh a little bit. What doesn't come easily to me is full-on, gut-busting, teary-eyed laughter. From the first moment McCarthy appears onscreen as Megan, she had me in tears and, to my surprise, this happened again and again nearly every time she appeared onscreen. Yes, she plays a character not unfamiliar to the world of comedy, but she brings such a unique charm and comedic presence to the role. There are moments with her character that are built on gross-out gags, but, shamefully, I laughed. In fact, McCarthy made me laugh harder than I can ever recall laughing in a theatre. This is not hyperbole; she had me in stitches.<br /><br />The gross-out humor in Bridesmaids does not go anywhere we haven't seen men go in thousands of comedies over the years. There is one particular scene at a dress boutique that sent most of the theatre into riotous fits of laughter. I wonder to myself if Wiig included the scene to make a point about double-standards in film, as no one complains when men do the same thing in movies. Well, I do; I'm not a fan of humor that revolves around flatulence and bodily functions. To me, it's nothing more than lazy writing and, while my theatre seemed to place me in the minority, I found it more repulsive than funny. As, by Hollywood standards, the cast is made up of average-looking women (a good thing, as it's easier for an audience to connect with Wiig and Rudolph, who look like normal people), I do wonder if this scene would have elicited the same laughter from a cast of big-star, Hollywood bombshells. Either way, I would have no complaints about this scene being left on the cutting-room floor.<br /><br />While the film starts off strong, I feel it loses steam in the second half when it veers towards a more dramatic route and becomes weighed down by its own seriousness. Apatow films seem to follow this template often; a first hour of non-stop hilarity and a second of turgid drama. I am being a bit rough on the dramatic elements here, as they have a good message and are essentially well handled, just not as effectively as the comedy. I attribute this to the writing; the comedy is improvisational and spontaneous, which leaves the dramatic stuff feeling more scripted. Annie's romance with the Irish cop, for example, is cute and sweet, but overly predictable. Fortunately, the film is kept consistently entertaining by this very talented group of women, but a little more consistency in the storytelling wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />It's not perfect and with a 125-minute running time (with trailers, you're looking at a theatre experience of 2 hours and 20 minutes) it could have been trimmed a bit in the editing room, but Bridesmaids is still one of the surprise comedies of the year. I knew women could be raunchy, but I doubted their ability to carry a raunchy comedy themselves. Wiig, (especially) McCarthy, and the rest of the girls outdo themselves, bringing both charm and consistent hilarity to the proceedings. Far exceeding my expectations, Bridesmaids is the funniest film I've seen this year.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Don't think this is some Kate Hudson chick flick.  This is a solid R rated raunchy comedy in the same league as Superbad.  Just substitute women for men with the same sex, cursing, vomiting, crapping and big laughs as you would find in any over the top comedy.  I laughed out loud several times, and the movie is filled with a lot of talented quirky characters.  This one is worth seeing in the theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>BRIDESMAIDS is not a film this viewer would normally have watched, but in a week where there is very little else available On Demand on television, the button parked here.  In many ways the film was a surprise, actually better than expected. The promo for the film was that it was a female version of HANGOVER or BORAT, an attempt to demonstrate to guys that women can be just as gross and vulgar as men.  But actually the story is more a tale of a group of sad women, unhappy in many ways with their relationships with not only men but also with other women.  Written by star Kristen Wigg and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig it is a pulled together series of vignettes about women in distress, and while it does include the gross-out promises of PR (barf/flatulence/body insert references) and the manner in which women in competition behave, it still remains a story of how sad people cope.<br /><br />Annie (Kristin Wiig) is a barely employed woman who has lost her dream of having her own bakery and having a  meaningless physical relationship with cad Ted (Jon Hamm) relies on her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) to get through life, until Lillian announces she is getting married and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Even though Annie is broke, living with a disgusting British brother and sister as a roomer, she accepts the responsibilities.  The sparkle of the wedding dream plans fizzles when Annie meets the incongruous group of women who will be bridesmaids: the wealthy, haughty Helen (Rose Byrne), the obese socially gross Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the oversexed inappropriate mother Rita (Wendi McLendon McCarthy) and the silly insubstantial Becca (Ellie Kemper).  In a series of gag moments - eating in a Brazilian caf&eacute;, trying on dresses, a grossly overdone flight in the direction of Las Vegas, and a preposterous wedding shower - the girls fall apart as potential friends only, of course, to some together in the end.<br /><br />There are a few redeeming elements in the film that are worthy of attention - the Irish police officer Nathan Rhodes  a sparkling Chris O'Dowd) who provides the only semblance of true sentiment in Annie's ridiculous life and Annie's mother played by Jill Clayburgh in what was to be her last role (she died of Leukemia seen after the film was completed).  Kristin Wiig does carry the film, despite the fact that her expressions and character show minimal variation as the story plods along. But in the end, despite all the attempts to out-gross HANGOVER, this is a sad little film about bruised women  and how their interdependence provides a way out of the meaningless lives they lead.  Grady Harp, September 11</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>This is a true American piece of art, characterized by the strong will to criticize ill traits by the least powerful citizens. The least here was a middle class woman struggling with employment, love, separation from her senile mother, and her inability to secure basic living needs. She was being used as sex object by a male wolf, pushed out of her shared residence by similarly struggling aliens who could not afford to pay their share of the rent. Her experience with the abusive male partner tainted her views of all males and rendered her skeptical from people in general. That was the main character that represents the majority of the American people, split between hard social choices and equally tough financial challenges.<br /><br />The main character will then shine in an educational criticism of fellow females whose ill traits served no good cause. The moviemaker chose a not very attractive bride to demonstrate the vanities of squandering money in social setting that strained the financial situation of the family beyond any good reason. The wedding arrangement of such not very attractive female extended from female bachelor party that ended in food poisoning, to group travel to Las Vegas that ended to detention and arrest of the main character, to an extravagant shower party that ended in manic episode of destruction and upset, etc.<br /><br />Along the many events stretched through the wedding arrangement, the underlying struggles of main character are compared to the ongoing vanities of the wedding events.<br /><br />The choice of characters was flawless, and the comparative alternation between the substantial human struggle with basic living needs versus the nonsensical waste of squandering money on nonessential formalities, luxury, food, dress, and travel,was brilliant.<br /><br />The movie started with provocative sexual play, followed by female sexual innuendo that might have been thrown in there based on a money making decision, it yet excludes the movie from being used as an educational material to younger age groups.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>I laughed so hard I cried. The audience was infectious - this was truly a laugh-out-loud comedy. There wasn't as much heart in this one as some of the other Apatow movies, but it was still generally a sweet movie (dirty and over-the-top, of course, but also sweet).</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a>. They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFBB1E">The Office</a>), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the "wedding industrial complex" with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.<br /><br />Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8UOY">Away We Go</a>) has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VPX5Y4">Get Him to the Greek</a>, captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with &eacute;lan.<br /><br />However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XAODE">Reno 911</a>) and Ellie Kemper (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N5N5SO">The Office</a>) have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038M2AOG">Mad Men</a>) really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Saturday Night Live have generated many female stars who have transitioned successfully from television to film and you have to add Kristen Wiig to that list as her film "Bridesmaids" is hilarious, fun and a fantastic comedy!  Definitely recommended!<br /><br />It's time for another Apatow produced comedy but this time, it's not about the guys but all about the ladies in "Bridesmaids", a film written by Saturday Night Live star/comedienne Kristen Wiig and actress Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig ("The Office", "Nurse Jackie", "Weeds").<br /><br />The comedy was released in May 2011 by Universal Pictures and was met with critical acclaim and surpassing "Knocked Up" as the top-grossing Judd Apatow film to date (the film was budgeted at $32.5 million and earned over $281 million in the box office).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen.  Picture quality for the DVD is very good as a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors BUT if you are wanting the best quality version of this film, the Blu-ray version is the way to go, because this film is quite vibrant and looks much better in High Definition.<br /><br />The Audio is presented in English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DVS Dolby Digital 2.0.  On DVD, the audio is clear coming through the front and center channels, good use of ambiance from the crowd and music coming from the surround channels but if you want better audio quality, once again, you will want to go for the Blu-ray version which should have a much more immersive soundtrack ala lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring an enjoyable, upbeat and hilarious audio commentary (for the unrated edition) with director Paul Feig, co-writer Annie Mumolo and cast members Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper.<br />  Gag Reel - (3:47) Outtakes from "Bridesmaids".<br />  Line-O-Rama - (12:10) Featuring the multiple improvised scenes from `Bridesmaids".<br />  Deleted Scenes- (7:52) Featuring three deleted scenes: Blind Date with Dave, Bonjour and Last chance.<br />  Additional Extended & Alternate Scenes - (8:40) Featuring five extended and alternate scenes: Meet Gil & Brynn, Judy on Barb, Ham Slacks, Becca Pukes Again, Split the Rent: Breasts<br />  Cholodecki's Commercial - (1:05) Check out what's new with Cholodecki's when you watch the never-beforeseen "commercial" from Annie's jewelry employer!<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" comes with a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Finally, we get to see Kristen Wiig show us her true talent as a writer and as an actress in "Bridesmaids".<br /><br />Yes, she has appeared in "MacGruber" and "Extract" and of course, we see much more of her comedienne talents on "Saturday Night Live", but "Bridesmaids" is the film that allowed her to show her creative side as a writer but also as the lead actress.<br /><br />And what I loved about the movie is that while it does contain the hilarious, gut-busting gross out scenes that we are typically used to seeing on a Judd Apatow film, what "Bridesmaids" does much better than other Apatow films is that it manages to keep things real, in the fact that the situation Annie is in, happens to many people during this survival era during this economy.<br /><br />Depression from losing a business, depression from not making much income, depression of working a job that you don't enjoy, depression of things not working right in your life and things tend to compound itself one after the other with Annie that she is unable to deal with it.  She becomes reclusive, doesn't have many friends and the one true friend that she does have, she finds out that she has this other life with friends and also has a best friend, while Annie had always thought that she was Lilian's (Maya Rudolph) "best friend".<br /><br />Fortunately, "Bridesmaids" is a comedy thus the film doesn't explore the psyche, dark depression that Annie is in but instead showcases her ability to sabotage things in her life.  Her jealousy towards Helen (Rose Byrne) ignites this inner jealousy of trying to one-up her, but she is unable to and it just causes problems.<br /><br />Maya Rudolph's role as Lillian is possibly her best role to date.  While she does partake in some of the hilarious moments in the film, it's not forceful like other Apatow films where everyone has to be hilarious (or borderline-stupid).  She cares about her friend and trying to keep things balanced between her childhood friend Annie and her best friend Helen.<br /><br />And Rose Byrne does a fantastic job in playing the somewhat devious best friend that clamors for attention and always trying to remain positive despite not having any close relationships with anyone else around her but Lillian.  Similar to Rita, her stepkids are just as mean to her.  But Byrne looks absolutely ravishing in this role and also partakes in some of the fun moments of the film.<br /><br />But then you have the other female characters and once again, I'm sure people can relate to these type of women...Becca (Ellie Kemper) as the woman who has been with only one man and has never experienced other men, so she never really had the chance to explore and the other friend Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is a woman who may have married wealthy, but she is bitter about how life has changed after marriage and having children.  Having a husband who doesn't look at her the same when she was younger and having children who are young but yet are quite profane towards her.  So, Rita acts as the negative person towards Becca of how life will not always be happy and cheerful because of marriage.<br /><br />And then of course, you have the odd-ball Megan.  Melissa McCarthy's character is so off-the-wall, you just don't know what is going to come out of her mouth.  Surprising, hilarious and once again, the Apatow style of filmmaking of where improvisation really brings out the craziness of the character.  And just as off the wall are Annie's British roommates, you just don't know what will come out of their mouths as well, especially the visual of the female roommate (played by Rebel Wilson).<br /><br />And the film also has the one of the final appearances of the late Jill Clayburgh and also features the musical reunion of Wilson Phillips.<br /><br />The DVD contains both the regular theatrical edition and the director's cut. The main difference from what I have found is a scene in which Annie's British roommates are bathing with each other and when Annie goes on a blind date with a single father. There is nothing extra raunchy about the unrated version, but it was good choice for Paul Feig to eliminate those scenes from the theatrical edition.<br /><br />There are a good number of special features included and but if you have a Blu-ray player, I would definitely choose the Blu-ray edition over the DVD edition because their are many outdoor, colorful scenes and I have no doubt in my mind that those scenes would look much more vibrant in HD.<br /><br />Overall, "Bridesmaids" is a fantastic comedy.  Guys who are used to Apatow films can easily get into this film and see how an-all female cast can be equally funny (and gross) but I have to admit, of the many Apatow films I have seen so far, "Bridesmaids" is well-written and well-cast and strikes a fine balance between the crazy and hilarious moments of an Apatow film but yet managing to incorporate a screenplay that is fun, entertaining and worth watching.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" is definitely recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I did not care for Superbad or KnockedUp or similar comedies and movies,sadly new style comedy isn't doing it for me,Bridesmaids is semi-Funny and geared towards a female audience from a vulgar point of view at times.Maya Rudolph I had to do a double take on her cause' she looked nothing like her former self and Sadly Newer SNL is not funny so I don't really care for actors from the New SNL.I watched it cause it was a freebie and it seemed to fill the time but It wouldn't be something I'd go outta of my way to purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that has received such exceptional praise and a particular comparison to being a female version of THE HANGOVER that most people have high already set expectations before viewing this movie.  I did not see this in the theater and was filled with anticipation to watch the blu ray.  I love most of the women here and was not let down at all.  Funny though, after all the hype, it was not anything what I expected.  The comparison to THE HANGOVER?  This film involves a roadtrip but differs greatly for it is a comedy with heart.  Kristen Wiig is the true headliner here and she carries this film from beginning to end.  She provides many of the greatest laughs but her character also provides the true heart and emotion to this film.  Yes, it is a laughfest comedy with humor that is sometimes a little gross but under all that is a heartfelt story.  Maya Rudolph also provides heart to this film.  For the comedic part of the film the greatest performance is given by Melissa McCarthy.  This is a huge breakout performance for her.  If you aren't too happy after your first viewing of this film I highly suggest ginving it another viewing without expectation.  You will then see the many layers that make this film a huge success.<br /><br />The blu ray comes with the theatrical version as well as the unrated version.  The video is amazing and colors pop while fleshtones are realistic and lovely.  Black/white ration is excellent and the picture just jumps off the screen with a vibrant crispness.  And the clarity shows every detail in every frame to great detail.  The audio is also excellent.  Dialogue is always present and clear and when music comes the surround speakers are put to great use.  This film honestly shows blu ray at its best.  And the blu ray edition also has hours of amazing extras that are not on the dvds.  I highly recommend this film.  It is an amazing comedy with an all female cast that will have you in stitches.  But try to forget the hype and try to not have any expectations for this film is different and better than it is being described.  This is indeed a great comedy that truly touches the heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Pretty much everyone I know raves about this movie, and after finally seeing it for myself, the only thing I can safely conclude is that pretty much everyone I know has god-awful taste in movies. "Bridesmaids" is AWFUL! There are a few...A FEW funny lines/ moments, but they are few and far between. The film is mostly gross humor, which I hate, and most of the characters are vain and self-absorbed and I absolutely hated all of them. What bothers me the most is that Melissa McCarthy received an Oscar nomination for taking a dump in a bathroom sink.  That just goes to show how far the Academy's standards have fallen. Ugh.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Before I say what I'm going to about this film, this is going to sound difficult to do but don't go in with high expectations 'cause then you won't think it as funny as it is. OK, here it goes: "Bridesmaids" is the funniest movie I've seen (so far) this year!!! This film is just plain hilarious! Don't go thinking this is some female version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQZ5BO">The Hangover (Extreme Edition)</a>. It may have "Hangover"s raunchy humor but it has a hell of a lot more heart without the simple <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXS7">Dude, Where's My Car?</a>-like plot. Although, appearing from the advertising, this may seem like it's all about the bachelorette party, it's not. The film does not primarily focus on all six girls, but particularly Rudolph (the bride-to-be), Wiig (the maid of honor), and Byrne (the new, rich best friend). Byrne, who is known mostly for drama (FX's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IPCRWS">Damages: The Complete Seasons 1-2</a>), does wonders in comedy; to catch her prior comedic performance, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97PG">Get Him to the Greek (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. And Melissa McCarthy shines as Megan, the future sister-in-law, who -- along with Wiig -- owns most of the laughs in the film! Kemper basically plays her other cute, girl-next-door role Erin (from NBC's "The Office") but does well at it. McLendon-Covey (Comedy Central's "Reno 911") also does well as the mom of three boys who needs to run wild. And Jon Hamm (AMC's "Mad Men"), who proves that drama is not his only talent, is great as the jerky pretty-boy, booty-call buddy, Ted. But the triumvirate of Wiig, Rudolph and Byrne are the best ones here! Their chemistry truly compliments this film. The movie, co-written by Wiig, not only is hugely humorous, but also speaks to the very reality that is how catty and territorial woman can sometimes be with each other (i.e., when Wiig feels her role as best friend is being taken over by Byrne). The great thing about the film, besides the laughs, is the true message that Wiig's Annie has to learn as things in her life fall apart all around her. She has to step up and learn to respect herself, not feel sorry for herself, and at the same time be sensitive to others. This may sound like a bummer or too deep for a comedy, but the film pulls it all off without being pretentious or too deep.<br /><br />Both Wiig and Rudolph have shined in previous roles and proved their acting chops -- Wiig in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPTJOA">Whip It</a> and Rudolph in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8UOY">Away We Go</a>. Their friendship in the movie is what overall sells the story. And Wiig's blooming romance with Irish policeman Officer Rhodes (a likeable everyman Chris O'Dowd) does not get in the way of the overall story nor distract from it. If anything, it helps it along and I applaud writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo (who has a cameo as Wiig's neurotic flight co-passenger) for correctly balancing it all without a hitch, and a special shout-out to producer Judd Apatow and director Paul Feig (creator of "Freaks and Geeks") for having the wisdom to take on the story. This film attempts what I believe writer Nancy Pimental was trying to do when she wrote the 2002 Cameron Diaz stinker, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HYG">The Sweetest Thing (Unrated Edition)</a>. Pimental was attempting to incorporate the gross-out humor of male comedy films such as "Knocked Up," but also trying to make a touching female-bonding film. In my mind, Pimental, the director (Roger Kumble) and cast all failed. The film came off to me like some pathetic attempt at making women too much like guys. However, "Bridesmaids" balances the raunchy with the endearing with great success!<br /><br />This film works for both sexes: women will LOVE to view it with girlfriends and men will love it for not having to roll their eyes! That's how downright funny and enjoyable this film is! The only thing I have to warn you about is that you may have to see it a second time just to catch the funny lines you missed from you (and the audience) laughing so loud and hard.</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>This girl comedy is just ok. It's not more than that because the central character is brainless and brings her problems on herself. Some scenes are amusing, but for the most part it's all ho-hum.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>As a guy, it's definitely not cool to watch a movie that goes by the name "Bridesmaids" but, to my total amazement, the GREAT news is that, not only is the humor intended for *both* guys and girls, but it actually hardly focuses on the wedding itself (until the very end, other than a quick party segment in the middle).<br /><br />Bridesmaids seriously had several really well-written and laugh out loud segments that never irritate nor feel tacky either.  The storyline focuses around the blonde-haired woman played by Kristen Wiig who stars is many adventures, or rather, MISadventures, haha.  She meets a cop and they fall in love but... well, I wouldn't be so quick to call this "love".  More like the cop falls for her but she's too afraid to make an impression when the relationship tries to take a serious turn.  That's one of many elements to this puzzling relationship.<br /><br />SEVERAL of the laughs come when Kristen's character meets up with all her friends and they unintentionally find themselves caught in situations where things go horribly wrong.  To give a few examples, in one scene they all go out to eat together at a restaurant and afterwards while shopping for wedding clothes, they become violently sick.  This leads to a scene that's best not to spoil not only for the surprise factor, but for the appropriateness of the matter, haha.  You'll CERTAINLY know what I mean when you see how disgusting this particular bathroom segment is!  Another hilarious segment comes during the plane ride when the blonde woman takes drugs and gives the steward and stewardess a hard time.  I like this plane segment in particular for the many layers of depth between ALL the characters.  Many of these jokes qualify as humor done in a subtle way, but it works beautifully.<br /><br />The storyline is SO well-written in fact, that it manages to keep your attention the entire way through.  The writers did a good job coming up with a script that both men and women can enjoy together, however I do believe some of the jokes are a little too offensive for women (such as one scene where a woman explains how dirty boys become when they reach their teenage years- she doesn't hold anything back).<br /><br />Other than that, expect a quality storyline, lots of laughs, and well, how can we forget the one woman of the bunch who's rock solid both physically and attitude-wise?  She's actually tied with Kristen Wiig's character for most exciting actress of the group.  All the characters in the film end up fitting the role perfectly as the story unravels.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This movie is a good movie, but for mature audiences. It is just really funny, and the acting is good.

Including a bridal shower in which the guests go home with puppies as party favors.<br /><br />Touted as the year's funniest movie, but I didn't laugh once.<br /><br />Even when they try to devolve to bathroom humor with food poisoning puke and diarrhea, this movie barely registers on the funny meter.<br /><br />As I said, the only redeeming value for this movie comes in the form of the loveable police officer played by Chris O'Dowd. (From tv's The I.T.

I had heard so much about the gross-out humor, and 'women behaving badly' themes, that I was expecting this to almost be a female Hangover. But it's not at all - the core story is much more soulful, and it's really a kind of romantic comedy, but the focus is on Kristin Wiig's character, as opposed to a man. It's a nice counterbalance to all the male-centric movies out there. There is one gross-out scene, and I did wince and cover my eyes at that, but some people like that humor, and so why not have women doing it for a change (we have bodily functions too after all!!) All of the female leads were outstanding, and the 'real-life' friendship between Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig shines through as the centerpiece of the plot in this one. And for what it's worth, my husband liked it too - it's not just a chick flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A genuinely funny script that didn't really need to go the gross-out route, it doesn't suffer for choosing to do so anyway. At its best during a rapid-fire first hour, the humor cools off noticeably when the drama llama rears its head during the home stretch, like it suddenly decided not to fully commit to any one specific identity. Though it occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and legitimate discomfort, the flick's lively, personable cast is never far off, life preserver tucked under one arm. Loaded with all-stars from every corner of the comedy spectrum, the jokes are delivered with predictable credibility, with many cast members also showing a surprisingly strong set of dramatic chops to boot. Despite a sappy, lovesick ending that seems to stand in contrast to its initial character, this is a witty, charming, raunchy little bundle of joy that's as good as you've probably heard, no more and no less.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>The pending nuptials of a young woman brings her friends together as her bridesmaids, and hilarity ensues. The film's star is her maid of honor, who has man issues, and a rivalry with one of the other women of the wedding party. I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. The humor does contain some raunchiness, but it is not overdone.  There are legitimate laugh out loud moments in this one, but the strength of the film is its heart. Relationship issues are dealt with, quite often with laughter, and there are several talented comedic actresses here, all bringing something different to the table. I could have done without the bathroom gross out scene, but otherwise Bridesmaids is an unexpected treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Bridesmaids is a rare breed of comedy, one that provides the raunchy, gross-out laughs of a guy buddy film like The Hangover & Wedding Crashers, but one with a heart.  The film focuses on the downward spiral of Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her best friend Lil (Maya Rudolph) plans her wedding and names Annie as maid-of-honor.  Annie had a bakery that tanked and now she is forced to work at a jewelry store and live with an extremely creepy British brother & sister in a cramped apartment.  She degrades herself by sleeping with Ted (Jon Hamm) who is more than upfront about the relationship being just about hooking up.  In the meantime, she gets into a competition with Lil's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) on who is really Lil's best friend and running the wedding.  Along the way she falls for an Irish cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) with whom she can't really commit.  Lil's future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy) adds the most comedic relief as an in your face, over sexed woman who seduces an undercover air marshal on an aborted trip to Las Vegas.  While Ms. McCarthy has been garnering much deserved praise for her portrayal of Megan, it is Ms. Wiig who is the heart & soul of the film.  Watching Annie slide further and further into depression and misery could be painful, but Ms. Wiig handles it with just the right touch to where you feel sorry for Annie but she stops short of becoming completely pitiful.  There a far too numerous hysterical scenes to detail, although the trip to an exclusive bridal shop stands out.  Suffice to say, Bridesmaids will make you laugh, maybe even cry and you will have enjoyed the two plus hours of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"Why can't you be happy for me and then go home and talk about me behind my back like a normal person?"

After thinking she is being replaced as best friend she tries too hard to compensate. Almost ruining the wedding in the process. This movie has what I call the "Due Date" or "Hangover" curse. Like those movies, the first people to see it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in thinking this is the female "Hangover" I was excited. While I can see the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn't as good as expected. Overall, this is a good movie, but because of the expectations I had I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might, just to see if it's better the second time.<br /><br />*Also try - Something Borrowed & The Sweetest Thing</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>I could list a whole string of adjectives, but I don't have even an interest in doing that. Just the bottom line: "Bridesmaids" is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />Nothing aroused pity or awe. Nothing was redeeming. There was nothing to celebrate. Absolutely nothing made me smile, not even inside and this is supposed to be the Comedy of the Summer. All I can think of is the bride-to-be squatting in the street in her soon-to-be wedding gown and having a diarrheric outburst after eating spoiled food. It was not a funny moment. Or picturing that awful woman slinging her leg on the door post while the air marshall was trying to get to his seat. Or that awful Kristen Wiig destroying the bridal shower decorations and food because she was jealous.<br /><br />The whole movie had the feel of Saturday Night Live to it, not the various old Nights, but the current one that is vulgar and foul beyond belief, lead especially by one of the most obnoxious "comedians" to ever hold sway over the show. I'm sure Phil Hartman is rolling in his grave.<br /><br />The poor Irish actor, who was stuck as Kristen's love interest--I mean, how did he get in there?<br /><br />That's all I care to say about this pitiful movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />Many people compared 'Bridesmaids' to 'The Hangover' but in terms of the comic tone of its characters, I found it much more similar to a recent indie film, 'Cyrus'. Both films attempt to get laughs by introducing a series of passive-aggressive types. The passive-aggressive credentials of the film's protagonist, Annie Walker, is established very early on when she sleeps with a boyfriend who also is afflicted with a passive-aggressive personality. When the boyfriend aggressively declares he has a rule about not sleeping over, instead of acting angrily, Annie lamely declares, "you're funny in the morning."<br /><br />The interesting thing about the passive-aggressive type is that the passivity masks a deeply repressed reservoir of anger. When the anger finally rises to the surface, it often comes out as a challenge, marked by a hurried retreat. We see this when Annie and her best friend Lillian (the bride to be) attempt to take an exercise class in the park without paying. When they're found out by the instructor, they run off with the excuse that they can no longer afford the high price of admission (despite actually costing $12).<br /><br />Annie's lack of self-esteem is on display when she turns off her customers by telling them that you can't trust anybody, while working as a salesperson at the jewelry store. As is often the case with a lot of the characters here, there's a thin line between the unsavoriness of their blatant aggression and viewing that aggression as humorous.<br /><br />Often the language of the passive-aggressive character is cloaked in overly diplomatic terms; the underlying sub-text of course, is an insult. For example, when Annie's mother (played by Jill Clayburgh in her last film role) tries to put a positive spin on Annie's negative life situation, she relates a story of a floundering gay prostitute she met at an AA meeting, concluding that "hitting bottom is a good thing."<br /><br />Screenwriters Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumulo try to mine as many laughs as possible from Lillian's assorted bridesmaids with mixed results. Lillian's cousin Rita can't stand her "disgusting" three teenagers and the joke about semen being all over the house is too crude to be funny. Becca, Lillian's friend from work and Megan, the groom's sister, ineptly conclude that Annie isn't single when they spot her next to two successive creepy guys who they should have known she would have no interest in. Little is done with newly married Becca character throughout the film but Megan (Melissa McCarthy from the 'Mike & Molly' TV series) proves to be one of the more amusing aggressive characters in the passive-aggressive pantheon. Megan not only can bond with a dolphin while on vacation but isn't afraid to make her sexual wants known (in spying one particular tall guy at the wedding, she proclaims, "I'm going to climb that like a tree").<br /><br />It's Helen, the snippy Trophy wife of the groom's boss, who turns out to be Bridesmaid's central antagonist. Again, the dialectic between her passive and aggressive side is evident when we first meet her. Helen aggressively attempts to steal Annie's thunder as they lock horns with their back and forth toasts to Lillian at the engagement party (the joke becomes tiresome as it goes on for much too long). There's more silly shenanigans during the tennis game, when we view Helen and Annie blasting one another with tennis balls in slow motion. Only Helen's completely lame, passive remark to the stepson's expletive ("put a quarter in the smear jar") hits the mark!<br /><br />Annie begins to lose Lillian's affections when she brings the bridesmaids to the Brazilian restaurant and most of them end up with food poisoning later on at the fitting room. It's a scene that doesn't work at all as it's too divorced from any kind of recognizable reality (both Megan and Lillian end up defecating in inappropriate places including a sink and outside in the middle of the street). Annie's meltdown on the plane to Vegas proves to be only slightly more amusing. Most of it relies on Annie's face-off with the flight attendant while she's intoxicated. The bit with Annie in sunglasses pretending to be a first-class passenger is something a real drunk would do--but when Annie exclaims that there's a 'colonial woman' churning butter out on the wing--that is truly a line of inspired lunacy! Meanwhile we do take some pleasure in Megan's vindication over her insistence that the man sitting next to her on the plane indeed turns out to be an air marshal.<br /><br />There's one more truly amusing moment before 'Bridesmaids' devolves into sentimental romantic comedy--that's Annie's confrontation with the young woman back at the jewelry store, resulting in her being fired (in substance: Young lady: Did you take your Xanax? Annie: You have four boyfriends--have fun having a baby at your prom).<br /><br />Once Annie has her final meltdown at Lillian's shower, Lillian expresses her true feelings toward Annie (how she's truly screwed up the pre-wedding preparations). Events are now set in motion where whatever comedy remains in this very spotty laugh-fest, is lost. Megan drops her animosity toward Annie and conscripts her to help find Lillian who's gotten cold feet about going through with the wedding. I haven't mentioned Officer Rhodes as he's the least interesting character in the film. After Rhodes reluctantly agrees to help locate Lillian (he traces through her cell phone messages), it's only inevitable that he and Annie will end up together after Annie's initial sabotage of their relationship.<br /><br />'Bridesmaids' probably has gotten more accolades than it deserves as it's one of the few films today that features an ensemble of women in comic roles. Unfortunately those roles are formulaic, as the passive-aggressive types proffered up here, could probably fit into any situation featuring contemporary mores. Occasionally there's a clever line or two but the humor quickly devolves into silly slapstick or outright crudity. Perhaps with some tighter editing, 'Bridesmaids' might have proved more palatable in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Chick flick appealing to guess who for the following reasons:<br />Reasons presented in "Bridesmaids":<br />(1.) Female insecurity showcased with lots, of shopping, eating, swearing and girlfriend breakups.<br />(2.) Women pursuing the perfect marriage but ending up feeling trapped; multiple examples.<br />(3.) Implied sex scenes revealing that it's not uncommon for it not living up to the girl fantasy.<br />(4.) Female mutual jealousy and competitive envy cat fights.<br />(5.) Female bipolar/manic depression alternating between hysterical and slovenly episodes.<br />(6.) Whether showing women social drinking or individually it was all formula stereotypical.<br /><br />Basically, just dumb jokes and even dumber slapstick. It is a bit of a concern that a significant number of Americans look forward to these TV soap-as-film reruns. It's just another in an endless stream of LA/NY rewrites for an established audience. Note; Not that the guys don't have their formula flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>Bridesmaids is sort of a female version of the Hangover. There's the person who's about to get married (with the fiance largely absent), a goofy sibling comes into the picture, with one of the main characters of the film in a lousy relationship. But Bridesmaids stretches the story over a longer period of time and includes more characters (and it packs in way more character development). It's also funnier, even if it is a bit more formulaic and relies somewhat too much on caricatures (like, as gut-bustingly hilarious as they are, main character Annie's screwball roommates, a disgusting brother-sister pair). As interesting as it is to watch Annie's goofy ups and downs, and her fine acting, she does come off as a younger Meg Ryan in the way that, as attractive and likable as she is, she just can't seem to get her life together. Better than all that is the dialogue, which is pretty sassy, especially when it comes to the over-the-top sister of the groom, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy, who is a swarthy and raunchy butch chick (her suggestion for a bachelorette party is to do a ladies Fight Club for the young bride). Jill Clayburgh is awesome as Annie's wacky mother; sadly, it was her last film as she died of leukemia in November 2010 (ironically, her first film credit was for The Wedding Party in 1969). As for the plot, it's pretty predictable... but what a ride! Like all comedies, this one also devolves into a few pivotal "key life lesson scenes" that are as serious as they are unnecessary (do we really care how and when the bride came to her senses and realised who her true friend really were?), but they are short-ish, and we quickly get back to the hilarity with a dose of... Wilson Phillips?</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>I'm not the biggest Judd Apatow fan, but I do consider his films entertaining. A good majority of the films produced under the Apatow Productions moniker are more than a little amusing, as well. In fact, I'm partial to both Anchorman and Pineapple Express. Despite Apatow's involvement with the film, Bridesmaids didn't really interest me all that much in concept. Another R-rated comedy revolving around a wedding with a mostly female cast? Who cares? The underestimation on my part probably helped the film more than anything as Bridesmaids turned out to be an adult comedy with a little more meat on its bones than the trailers perhaps lead you to believe.<br /><br /> While the film is both filthy and raunchy at times, the foundation of Bridesmaids lies within the relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their chemistry along with the way they both screw up their lives when they're away from one another is the heart and soul of the film. Lillian's marriage falling apart is kind of a given just with how eccentric each character in the main cast is, but Annie's depression, downward spiral, and inability to drive herself forward rather than continuously pushing herself back is key to giving the film an emotional kick that isn't even hinted at in the trailers. Melissa McCarthy steals nearly every scene that she's in thanks to her outrageous antics and incredibly high self esteem. Nearly every one of the bridesmaids gets a good laugh at some point in the film even if a few of them (Reno! 911's Wendi McLendon-Covey and The Office's Ellie Kemper) don't get as much screen time as others.<br /><br />Bridesmaids almost felt like it was stronger during its more dramatic and softhearted sequences in comparison to the overall comedic atmosphere of the rest of the film, which is weird since it is absolutely a comedy. While the obscene and sometimes scatological jokes used in the film were mostly original in execution and chuckle-worthy at times, it somehow all just felt very familiar to me. The Brazilian food that gave them all food poisoning felt like it borrowed heavily from Dumb & Dumber, the Wilson Phillips joke was funnier in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, while most of the scenes on the airplane seemed to offer a female version of a scene straight out of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with more profanity. Then there's the film itself which was like Wedding Crashers if seen through the eyes of the women in the actual wedding. I guess on one hand, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. All of those comedies are rather exceptional while at least two of them would be considered classics, but that sense of familiarity was still there like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu sneaking up behind you and trying to tickle you while spewing a constant string of F-bombs.<br /><br />Bridesmaids is a dirty, vulgar, over the top comedy that attempts to affect your limits of compassion just as much as the extent of your hilarity. While some of the gross-out humor came off as a little much at times, Kristen Wiig is able to prove just how talented she really is. It is at least able to offer an R-rated comedy that both sexes will enjoy, which is more that can be said for most PG-13 romantic comedies. Bridesmaids is an entertaining stumble into borderline comedic genius that will keep people talking about it long after it's relevant.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>Huh. I really fell for that b.s. advertising campaign.<br /><br />Unusual for me as I'm normally quite adept at seeing through the manufactured manure. But give credit where credit is due - they caught a cynic and an experienced film fan. I got sold a pile of poo dressed up as a steak.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed would be an understatement.<br /><br />The campaign made this out as the female version of '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a>', so I had very high expectations. This was NOTHING LIKE like that hilarious flick. This was...<br /><br />Geez, I don't know. I don't have a frame of reference to compare this to or with another film. Maybe something seen on the Lifetime Channel or Oxygen. Maybe.<br /><br />I suppose there were some silly moments, and Melissa McCarthy's occasional flatulence flare-ups and profanity laced commentary mildly livened things up a bit here and there. But there were stunningly long stretches of Kristen Wiig's character being overwhelmed, extraordinarily uncomfortable, and dealing with a mega heavy dose of soul-crushing low self-esteem.<br /><br />Ha ha?<br /><br />I don't get it.<br /><br />The body expulsion scenes were gross without any real sense of hilarity. That's a gimme in comedies. And it failed. What the bleep?<br /><br />And that was sixty-minutes worth of the film. The only real laugh out loud moment was... uhm.... there wasn't one. That was one tough hour let me tell you.<br /><br />The second hour... can you believe this was actually two bleeping hours long?!?!?!?!<br /><br />The second hour was the start of the "Vegas Trip" which was heavily advertised, and I completely don't get this part, but they didn't end up in Vegas. In fact, there isn't one scene in Vegas and the characters all return to their homes and lives in Wisconsin.<br /><br />&lt;deep breath><br /><br />And the downward spiral continues from there.<br /><br />&lt;sigh><br /><br />I haven't been this fooled before in a very long time. And how sad is it that an AC/DC song got pulled into this pile?<br /><br />Two hours, ten minutes, and sixteen seconds. I bet I'll want that back one day.<br /><br />So sad.<br /><br />One final note - what does it say when the funniest parts of this entire flick were the 15-second outtakes with, again, Melissa McCarthy?</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>I always love the notion of women being dubbed "the fairer sex."  I've always been raised that a woman can do pretty much anything a man can do, and if my 41 years on this earth have taught me anything, it's that women can be just as crude, boorish and stupid as men.<br /><br />Hollywood seems to forget this, basing far too many of its female characters (especially in comedies) on sterile models of Barbie-esque perfection.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Hollywood has milked the "funny good guy must steal the bombshell from the rich jerk" storyline for ages - the object of desire in these movies is invariably given little to do.  (Think Rachel McAdams in "Wedding Crashers" - a talented actress does little more than grin and look gorgeous).<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" takes a refreshing break from tradition by focusing almost exclusively on the ladies.  And these ladies, by and large, do not act like "ladies," but instead are well-rounded, flawed, funny women.  Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph of "SNL" fame play lifelong friends who are going on different tracks as they head into their 30s.  Wiig's Annie has her self-esteem in the dumpster after her Milwaukee bakery failed - now she's content to be on the booty call speed dial for a spectacular jerk (Jon Hamm of "Mad Men").  Rudolph's Lillian, on the other hand, has gotten engaged to a successful guy in Chicago and she seems destined for a life of country clubs and European vacations.<br /><br />Both friends understand they are growing apart, so Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor, naturally.  Annie is thrilled, only to be horrified that Lillian's future sister-in-law appears to be all-too-eager to become Lillian's new best friend.  This harpy, Helen, played with WASPy evil by Rose Byrne, is everything that Annie is not - rich, poised, and (seemingly) self-assured.  What ensues is a traditional battle royale between Annie and Helen as they vie for the role of maid of honor.  Thanks to the other bridesmaids, including Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Rita (Wendi McLendon Covey of "Reno 911"), this is a battle spiced with raunchy humor and replete with poetic profanity.  These are good things.<br /><br />I must admit that I came to "Bridesmaids" late, after all the hype and Oscar nominations.  Ultimately I can't say that this is a great comedy - it is genuinely funny and has a few laugh-out-loud moments, and it definitely has a heart.  But all I've heard is that "'Bridesmaids' is the new 'Hangover.'"  That just flat-out isn't true - even despite the great comic performance by Melissa McCarthy as Megan, there is nothing in "Bridesmaids" that is as original as "The Hangover," if only because there is nothing in this movie that approaches the comic genius of Zach Galifianakis.  (Perhaps if Wendi McLendon Covey had been given a little more to do - she inexplicably gets no lines in the second half of the movie.  The lady is comic gold.)<br /><br />Definitely a solid comic effort - something that is all too rare these days - and an enjoyable reminder that women can do far more in a comedy than be the sterile object of desire.

So when this film appeared on cable I went out of my way to plan a viewing; now, having seen BRIDESMAIDS several times, I will be adding this hysterical romp to my movie collection.  BRIDESMAIDS is laugh out loud funny; it's snorting your drink through your nose funny; it's rolling on the couch funny.  Kristen Wiig leads this exceptional cast as insecure, self-destructive Annie, a woman with a knack for picking loser boyfriends (Jon Hamm in an uncredited role), with her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), getting married--and asking Annie to be her Maid of Honor.  Among the other bridesmaids is the beautiful, organized, and filthy rich Helen (Rose Byrne), who is vying to become Lillian's new best friend. . .and the cat fight is on, with knee slapping results and donkey-braying comedic bliss.<br /><br />This is not your Aunt Edna's comedy; this film has a decided raunchy edge, from total anarchy on a flight to Vegas, to a food poisoning attack during a dress fitting.  ("It's coming out of me like lava!" proclaims Melissa McCarthy, part of the bridesmaid ensemble and an unabashed scene stealer.)  If seeing the female gender push the envelope into locker room humor makes you uncomfortable, BRIDESMAIDS is not for you.  Wiig aptly carries the freight, and her genuine chemistry with Rudolph is no doubt a byproduct of their years together on SNL.  You'll feel a twinge of sadness seeing Jill Clayburgh, playing Annie's mom, who died just a few months before the film's release.  One star off for the inevitable "chick flick" moments, including a sappy Wilson Phillips sing-a-long, along with an ending that was strangely wanting.  But who cares?  If you're looking for belly laughs by the barrel, BRIDESMAIDS is right down your alley.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>You know what, this movie wasn't actually that funny.<br /><br />Then, they throw in the cliche romance for the main character that follows the typical love, someone gets mad at someone, and then love again by the end of the movie plot........<br /><br />Some of the comedic lines delivered in this movie seemed improvised or on-the-spot.  Who acts like this?  No one.  No one is going to meet someone for the first time and then say how they broke a child's blanket in half because it was so full of dried semen.  The lines were so over-the-top and ridiculous.<br /><br />Some scenes that could have had anyone on the floor with laughter were not pushed far enough.  The movie wound up just being really cheesy and full of scenes of improvised, badly-acted lines and lame jokes. (the one woman takes about 10 puppies from the bridal shower  -  who cares, it's not funny.<br /><br />The scene where the bride had diarrhea in the street:  you saw nothing but her sitting on the ground.  How was that funny?  Should of had it all over her dress, she could have slipped on it........<br /><br />The point is, you can't try act serious (as with the street crap scene) but then go OVER THE TOP the next minute.

We then find Annie talking sexual humour with her friend Lillian...whoopee.The scenes where the bridesmaids get sick is quite gross and WAY too obvious.Her roommate Byrne is on the big side and when she shows Annie her tattoo on her back of course this is time to show all the fat folds and the butt crack...been there,done that.*yawn*.Chris Dowd's lackluster performance as Nathan is no where near believable,so I cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to believe why a good looking lady like that would ever fall for a milk toast guy like Natahan. Annie and Helen's attempts at getting Nathan's attention by her constant driving by his squad car are just plain childish stuff and very unfunny.And Wiig's over all performance as Annie is far from ingratiating.It's underplayed too much and the spark just is not there.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its a/r of 2:40:1 and the picture is clear and crisp.This release comes with the theatrical version and the unrated version.There are deleted scenes,extended and alternate ones,a gag reel,commentary and more.There is also(at least in the Canadian release) a terrible layer change hesitation.The scene goes from Nathan and Annie sleeping together to a shot of Annie laying on the bed.I counted at least an eight second hesitation which is the longest I have ever encountered.The disc I checked and it is pristine.This is obviously a manufacturing error and not as a result of a disc scratch or film flaw.Universal take note.<br />All in all a disappointing movie from this reviewers perspective.The humour is oft times of the toilet brand and quite juvenile,so shallow you can see through it and it is telegraphed way,way ahead.It's the old "when you can't think of something smart,go for the lowest common denominator".The main characters did nothing for me but I got the most kicks from the more "minor" co stars.If this is your thing then I recommend it but if not put aside all the hype you've heard,save your money and give it a HUGE pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>This movie had its funny moments....like when the main character Annie is trying to get the cop's attention...and when one of the bridesmaids takes home too many party favors (especially knowing what those party favors are).  I also liked the message about not placing all men into one category.  Some men really do have big hearts....though I doubt these types of men would sleep with a woman on the first date.  I'd think a man who wears his heart on his sleeve would take it slowly so his heart couldn't get broken so easily.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that the dialogue felt untrue at times.  For example, there's a scene in the store where Annie tells off a young girl in a blunt way that didn't seem like something her character would say.  I also didn't think a guy would really be that blunt in bed.  And I didn't think the bridesmaid who stole the party favors would really be that aggressive with people.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love seeing inappropriate people in comedies.  They usually crack me up, but they only do so when there's a sincerity behind their actions.  The outrageousness in this comedy felt like it was trying too hard at times.<br /><br />I'm also not a big fan of raunch humor and in this movie, one scene is so over the top, I had to look away.  I also thought the movie ran a little too long and the love story, sweet as it was, was also predictable.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this movie had it's funny moments and it's sweet romantic moments, but in the end, it was just okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Annie (Kristen Wiig, TV's "Saturday Night Live", "Knocked-Up, "MacGruber") is going through a rough time; her bakery has closed, forcing her to take a job at a jewelers, she has move in with a creepy roommate (Matt Lucas, TV's "Little Britain") and his strange sister (Rebel Wilson), and she has a relationship with a rich guy (Jon Hamm) who seems to view her as more of a necessary tool to satisfy his sexual needs. Then, her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph, TV's "Saturday Night Live", "Away We Go", "Shrek the Third") announces she is engaged and wants Annie to be her Maid of Honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Helen (Rose Byrne, TV's "Damages"), the wife of Lillian's fianc&eacute;e's boss, and there is an instant competition between them. Because Annie is having such a difficult time with her finances, she tries to bluff her way through the increasingly expensive bridal party arrangements and plans. But the other women are determined to have some fun and spend some money. And every occasion seems marred by some difficulty.<br /><br />Written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig (an actor with many credits and a Judd Apatow prot&eacute;g&eacute;), "Bridesmaids" is a funny, funny film. Despite the moments of hilarity, some of which could be considered near brilliant, the film suffers from being too long, by at least a half hour, and this detracts from the overall quality.<br /><br />Wiig is often the bright spot of any "Saturday Night Live" episode. The weekend this film opened, she was the star of a skit called "Ann-Margaret Throws Away A Piece of Trash". It appeared at the end of the show, but it was a physical, funny and slightly brilliant idea with a dead-on impersonation of Ann-Margaret, circa the late 60s. It was also short. Many of the skits on "SNL" suffer because they go on too long. Wiig and Mumolo have written a story to give Wiig's strengths a showcase. There are elements of all of Wiig's memorable characters in Annie and thankfully most have been toned down to make the film more believable and interesting.<br /><br />But many of the scenes play out too long, beyond the funny parts, causing the film to drag. I realize they are trying to make a film about people we might really know, and want to infuse these characters with some humanity, but smaller doses of this world would have made the film seem funnier. It almost seems as though they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a comedy with some raunch, or if they wanted to make a romantic comedy with some funny moments.<br /><br />The movie, produced by Judd Apatow, is being sold as a raunchy-female version of "Knocked Up" or "The Hangover". It doesn't deliver on this. There is one scene like this, and it's good, but there is just the one scene<br /><br />Annie is played with a lot of heart. She and Laurie are great friends and have known each other for years. This is established quickly and allows us to witness this dynamic. When Laurie announces she is engaged, Annie is overjoyed but you can also see she is just a bit jealous. This is the beauty of Wiig. Much like Steve Carrel on "The Office", she is able to quickly reveal parts of her character while portraying something very different. When she hears the news, she is overjoyed but a subtle shift in her voice reveals the jealousy, and her competitive edge. Annie has a lot of different facets to her character and Wiig seems to not only embrace these, but to celebrate them.<br /><br />Lillian's fianc&eacute;e lives and works in Chicago, so Annie makes the drive from Milwaukee to attend the lavish engagement party hosted by Helen (Byrne). This is an opportunity for Annie to meet all of Lillian's new friends. But she and Helen instantly begin competing against one another, using an evening toast to try to one-up each other.<br /><br />Given Wiig is the star of the film, she naturally has the lion's share of screen time. But it is nice to see a couple of other characters really stand out. Some stand out for the wrong reasons. As soon as Maya Rudolph's Lillian announces her engagement, she becomes a straight man, trying to remain calm as so many things go wrong. It isn't the flashiest of roles, but it gets the job done. As she begins to take on the responsibility and stress of becoming a bride, her character becomes more and more serious, more of a mediator between Annie and Helen, more of a cheerleader to keep Annie happy.<br /><br />Rose Byrne's Helen is a more complicated creation. She is necessary to provide the catalyst for Annie's insecurities, but if that were all she is, she would quickly become boring. During the engagement party, Annie's first glimpse of Helen seems pulled from a Grace Kelly film; Helen is tall, glamorous and turns towards her (us) in a way that makes Annie realize how pretty she is. Annie is more modest, wearing her best clothes, but they pale in comparison. And she is also dealing with the effects of the long drive, rumpled clothes and hair. Annie can't compete with Helen. When she feels she can, she tries, but Helen will always be able to outspend her. And Helen seems equally determined to compete with Annie for the one thing she can't buy - Lillian's BFF approval. It is nice to see the different levels of this character and the underhanded things she is willing to do to win the day.<br /><br />Even though it is natural, given the narrative conventions, for Lillian to ignore Helen's actions, this helps to make Lillian's character seem more mediocre.<br /><br />When Helen finally comes clean, it seems predictable and a little forced. It seems as though Wiig and Mumolo knew this moment had to come and worked hard to fit it in somewhere.<br /><br />The real stand out of this group is Melissa McCarthy (TV's "Mike and Molly") who plays Megan, Dougie's sister and a de-facto bridesmaid. She is a stocky, manly woman who likes to deal with things matter-of-factly, providing a firm handshake, her wrist covered by a carpal tunnel bandage, and a straight word. At the engagement party, she wears slacks, a button down shirt and a little Kangol hat, covering most of her hair. It's almost a clich&eacute;, but because she is the least acceptably "desirable", she is naturally the most sexually advanced of the group, the most outgoing, the most willing to try anything. She also consistently reveals new things about her character. Because she and Annie are the most different, Annie has the most trouble accepting her new friend. But she proves to be the most interesting of the bridesmaids.<br /><br />The other bridesmaids, played by Ellie Kemper (TV's "The Office") and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the most forgettable. In fact, they seem to disappear completely for the last half of the film.<br /><br />Annie's entire life is a mess, but the mess of her romantic perils takes center stage. She is in a relationship with a richer, better-looking man (Hamm) and their encounters are funny because they are so painful for Annie and we want to yell at her "Are you crazy?" Yet, she keeps coming back. After an evening of sex, which he seems to enjoy much more than she does, Annie leaves and tries to return to her car. But he hasn't opened his gate. Rather than face the indignation of returning to him, waking him up, and asking him, she tries to climb over. Just as she is about to slide over the top, the maid arrives and opens it with her clicker, Annie riding the gate like a mechanical bull.<br /><br />Later, she meets Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, "Pirate Radio", "Gulliver's Travels (2009))", a Minneapolis State Trooper, who pulls her over. They run into each other again, start talking and eventually go on a date. He really is quite charming, and exactly the type of guy Annie should be with. But all of the distractions in Annie's life cause her to flip out when he makes a sweet gesture and she shuts him out. Later, she needs his help and has to go to great lengths to get his existence.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" is better written than most "SNL" comedies, most of which seem like a series of extended skits. But it does occasionally feel episodic: Engagement party, Bridesmaids have lunch, Try on gowns, Trip to Vegas, Bridal shower, Wedding. Each of these is funny to varying degrees. But when each of these set-ups ends, there are the 'in-between' scenes, the moments meant to move the narrative along and connect the dots. While well written, they are less funny and slow the entire film down. The best of these are the moments between Annie and her two lovers, because we all know people who are in the same situation and Annie seems to make the same choices they do, both good and bad. With Hamm's character, they are funnier, but with O'Dowd's character they are sweeter, more romantic and even a little charming.<br /><br />Three scenes really stand out for their comedic value. The engagement party which ends with the never-ending dueling toasts has another funny joke running throughout. Even during the toasts, when the scene seems to be going on forever and ever and ever, we start laughing for that very reason. Neither woman is willing to give up because to do so would give the other woman the upper hand.<br /><br />Later, Annie gets the bridal party to go to lunch at a Brazilian chiaroscuro. Despite the dubious appearance, they decide to go ahead at Lillian's urging. Everyone digs into the plethora of meats wholeheartedly. These moments pay off later when they try on gowns at a super-chic, expensive boutique.<br /><br />The bridesmaids decide they want to party in Vegas, despite Annie suggesting a more modest, local idea. Annie buys a coach ticket; everyone else splurges on First Class. As soon as Annie sits down, she starts to freak out because she is afraid of planes. Annie runs up to First Class to talk to Lillian. Helen quickly gives Annie some pills to calm her down. Everything escalates from there.<br /><br />The trip to Vegas is particularly good, well-written, funny and memorable. But it takes place about half way through the film. When it is over, the rest of the film is noticeably less funny and seems a bit long. It is still a good film, fun to watch, but it almost seems like a different film.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" is very good, if uneven. You should definitely check it out. I get the feeling this is the first of many memorable examples of Kristen Wiig's comedy we will get to see on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>'nuff said ~ THAT's EXACTLY 16 Candles - revisited.<br />Interesting how time doen't change anything ... hello!

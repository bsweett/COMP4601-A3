A son thinks his father is a blowhard who can't be honest with him. Edward Bloom (Albert Finney in a kind of Southern accent) loves to tell stories that he perhaps embellishes and exaggerates, but maybe not that much. There may be more than a kernel of truth in those tales. But, at any rate, this causes a rift and separation between the father and his son William Bloom (played by Billy Crudup, a frequent Broadway player). The senior Edward Bloom as a youth is played by Ewan McGregor. He's a winning actor you can't help liking because of his smile and his openness. As a youngster Edward Bloom saw his death in a witch's eye.<br /> The movie is part fantasy and part realism. Along the way there are monsters, giants, man-wolves, a witch, an enormous catfish, a phantom town, and other amazing sights.<br />Danny De Vito plays a circus ringmaster, Steve Buscemi plays one of Bloom's neighbors who is living in a dreamlike utopian town, and Helena Bonham Carter plays a witch and a woman who is in love with Will. Jessica Lang plays Finney's adoring wife.<br /> The movie creates a pleasant mood, a fairy tale-like atmosphere. It has an upbeat ending, and I don't know why exactly but the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump; this film has that same kind of romantic and sentimental flavor.<br /> It was directed by Tim Burton who often deals in fantasies and oddball stuff. He's provided some eccentric roles for Johnny Depp. This is a satisfying, pleasant movie. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll have fun with it.<br /> Filmmakers like Burton have a unique opportunity through their medium to present imagery that is bizarre, over-the-top, surreal, dreamlike visuals. He sometimes goes further than necessary as in "Alice in Wonderland," But this movie combines just enough fantasy with the everyday to make it a lighthearted  experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish tells the story of William Bloom and his reconciliation with his dying father through the stories he used to hear from his father when he was a kid. This is without a doubt one of my favorite Burton films, filled with visual moments that follow the 'Burton formula' but with a story that goes way too far from your average Burton movie. Many reviews already exist about the film itself so I will now proceed to talk about the release and explain why I gave this only 3 stars being a favorite film of mine.<br /><br />THE MOVIE<br /><br />The movie is presented in anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Color is generally consistent and looks well in HD, but not as well as it should . It would seem a if the film has been manipulated as there is a softer look in it that I do not remember seeing at the theater; close ups that should normally look detailed look way too soft and with a 'waxy' effect. Scenes that I was looking forward to see in high detail look dull and not as they should for a Bluray release (the circus sequence, the whole arrival to Spectre or the daffodil scene are two examples that come to mind) The video quality is indeed an improvement over the existing DVD, in color at least, but there is no doubt this could have looked way better than it does in this release.<br /><br />Audio tracks included are uncompressed English PCM 5.1 (which sounds incredible in the few scenes that take advantage of an HD sound system), English and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, English SDH, French, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai<br /><br />THE EXTRAS<br /><br />Prior to getting this, I owned the existing DVD release that included among the extras an audio commentary with director Tim Burton, some mini documentaries about the story and the characters as well as some other features hidden as 'Easter eggs'. Well, all those extras but the director commentary are gone in the Bluray disc. The hidden extras are also nowhere to be found, so the director commentary is pretty much the only extra feature included in this release. If you, like me, have heard a Tim Burton commentary before, you may already know you cannot expect great things from it nor interesting information, Burton passes most of the time silent and when he talks it is usually to make a joke or point out something that may not be relevant at all. Trailers of other feature films in BD are also included.<br /><br />Overall, an average upgrade from the DVD, if you are a person who likes to watch documentaries and extras on how a film was made, you may want to get the DVD instead or keep your copy if you already own it. Hopefully we will have a special edition Bluray some day that features a new remastered in HD that does to justice to this film,  visually speaking.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie, and despite its emotional ending I was somewhat disappointed to find out that the man was a liar all along.  Okay, the few final scenes may be open to interpretation, but I still say the guy's a liar.  Of course, most people probably know that before they even open the DVD box, but I've always been quite gullible.<br /><br />But the more I thought about it, the more I thought that we all have tall tales to tell about ourselves.  I mean, I've had a cat that could sleep with his eyes open, I've had a job where I cremated people, I once drove home and saw part of a miniature golf course lying on my neighbor's lawn, I've beaten a multi time world champion powerlifter in an official meet, and I once arm wrestled a guy who survived the concentration camps of the holocaust.  All of these statements are true, but I'm leaving out a lot of information regarding each one on purpose.  I guess knowing what not to say is an important part of storytelling too.<br /><br />The music in the film is perfect.  Perfect.  The tall tales are pretty good at bordering reality and fantasy just right, although there are one or two instances where they cut clear into fantasy completely.<br /><br />Big Fish may not have the originality of The Neverending Story, but it certainly has a lot of charm.  The Alabama setting adds a lot to the atmosphere.  The title fits in perfectly with the symbolism and themes.  I don't recall the use of any bad language.  It's probably the closest thing to a George MacDonald story you'll find on film.<br /><br />(12/12/09 - actually, I do remember some slightly bad language from Devito, and the kids visiting the witch house)</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>It turns all around the father and his son and their difficult relation. It was perfect as long as the son believed in the stories the father was telling him all the time, that is to say as long as Father Christmas really was a childhood hero. But older age came and those stories sounded all silly, even sillier and sillier and they led to a complete break between the two, the father and the son, till the father came to the point of departing from this life. The son and his wife came back and he was confronted to the stories again. But one day when he was sorting out some old documents of his father's for his mother he came across a strange deed that showed the existence of an estate under the name of his father. And he went there and discovered that this estate had some tremendous reality and that the witch of the old stories was the young girl from some other old story who had become a piano teacher and had benefited from this estate. She sure was in  love with the father but the father was faithful to his wife. The son then discovers that all the stories were just embellished true stories. The Siamese Chinese twin women were in fact true  Chinese twins though not Siamese. And an epiphany takes place. When the son was keeping watch over his father at the hospital one night, the father called him and the son understood the father was asking him to tell him a bedside story to put him to sleep, the big sleep. And the son is inspired to tell him his own version of his father's embellished stories and that story enables the father to go to his long sleep with all the characters of his own stories. And when the funeral arrives, the son, his wife and his mother can only see with their own eyes that all the characters of these stories are true people. But in the meantime some miracle had happened. The son on the command from his dying father had taken him away from the hospital to the river where he had put him back into the water, as if the father was only a captured big fish living among the humans and waiting for this last minute to recapture his true nature and swim away down the river where he had come from. That's when the film could have turned grotesque or just funny strange. But Tim Burton is a genius of the paranormal and how to make it look so natural that we are obliged to believe in it and to go back to our infancy, when we believed wonderful stories full of unbelievable wonders that we could only believe in deep in our hearts because they were so beautiful. Tim Burton is a magician that mesmerizes us with surrealistic images.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>A very bizarre movie even for Tim Burton, Big Fish is one of my favorites.<br />Wonderful acting, Jessica Lang is particularly powerful in this movie.<br />The rest of the cast is equally talented, bringing some funny moments, some strange moments and some tear jerking moments.<br />I think this movie was compared to Forrest Gump a lot. I can see the reasons, but I believe this to be the superior film.<br />Both movies have incredulous story lines, but in Gump's case, they tried to make the impossible seem real. In Big Fish's case, you never know what is real and what isn't. You won't know the truth until the very touching end.<br />Brilliantly directed, and unbelievably overlooked by many film lovers.<br />I'd put Big Fish in my top twenty any day.<br />Brilliant, strange, touching and memorable, Big Fish achieves greatness on every level.<br />Another brilliant contribution from Tim Burton, do your self a favor and rent this.<br />I think you'll be amazed by just how original and innovative this movie is.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Edward Bloom is dying, and his son Will, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, dearly wants to know just who his enigmatic father really is. The problem is that Dad was a blowhard storyteller who talked about things he did not do and did not talk about things he did do ("we never talked about not talking"). He was a combination of the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, very charming and very fake, and so Will laments, "I have no idea who you are." But maybe Will has misread his dad, and all the stories are true in some sense. The overall theme of Big Fish is thus entirely poignant, but the metaphors mix rather badly with humor, surreal scenes of giants, witches, crows in dreams who prophesy death, etc., and an extended love story about Mom and Dad. This good film could have been better if the visual medium had not overwhelmed the otherwise rich plot potential.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Big Fish is a film for everyone, from little children to grown adults for not only is it loud and colorful and very entertaining, but it touches upon the very fabric of human relations, and what better fabric to touch on but the bond between father and son.  Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dieing, and it's becuase of this, and because of this only, that his son William (Crudup) returns home with his pregnant wife (7 months to the day).  William has no relationship with his father, mostly because he has a misconstrued perseption of who his father really is.  All he has in memory of his father are the 'tall tales' he told him as a child.  Theres a fundamental truth that runs throughout this film, and it's that as children sometimes we take our parents for granted, we assume the worst, and worse yet, when we don't understand them or don't want to understand them we can write them off completly.  As William finds out through the recollection with his fathers stories, not everything he knows is a lie and his idea of who is father is couldn't be further from the truth.  Albert Finney gives a brilliant performance, as does Ewan McGregor who plays Edward in flashbacks of his younger years.  As much a fairytale this film may be, it's not that far from reality.  A sweet and endearing film, truly exrtaordinary!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Big Fish is one of Tim Burton's films that doesn't leave you depressed and struggling to find a dry hanky. What it will leave you with is a feel-good feeling while you'll be searching for a clean hanky.<br /><br />Better known for his oddly different movies such as Edward scissorhands, and sleepy hollow, Tim Burton has constructed a movie that seems impossibly fairy-tale like in its intense beauty of story telling and lush settings, while still keeping the draber side of the story (reality) enthralling.<br /><br />Williem Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who grew up with his storytelling father, (Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor) who always seemed to have wonderful exciting things happening to him. Even if they seemed to wild to believe, Edward manages to make them truly real. However children cannot stay young always, and finally Will grows up to despise his fathers storys, believing its the lies of a man who is has been discontent with his life and family. Lies he has invented to soothe himself that his life didn't turn out the particulare way he wanted. The people he has met, the things he has done never happened, only in his imagination that is. People alive only in the reality of his father dillusional mind<br /><br />Unable to listen to his father any longer, he tells him that he justs wants to know the real him. "But I've told you!" Edward replies, " You just haven't been listening." So begins the journey through the fantastic mind of one man who believed the world was designed to be lived to  the fullest. He was the master of his destiny and death was just yet another adventure to be looked forward to.<br /><br />The end is the best part of the fairy tale, when Edward is dying and tells William to tell how he dies. Coming from a man who has spent his life polishing his life up, it is his son's turn to follow his footsteps. Follow Will does, turning his fathers death into one of the most touching part of all the previous stories told. Even in the realm of fantasy there is reality, which is proven by his fathers actual funeral when mostly all of what the son has told his father happens in the reality realm. Not as colorful of fantastic, but just as wonderful.<br /><br />Tim Burton strikes again, with yet another movie that will leave feeling as though life is truly as beautiful as portrayed here. One must only be ready to open their eyes to the truth</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>&#65279;This is a story of a son's reconciliation with his father.  The plot device of using the fantastic<br /><br />tales of the father to illustrate the son's frustration with his father is well done.  I have a personal dislike for the use of freakish characters such as giants but this was actually well carried out with a Fellini-esque flair.  The acting and interrelation between<br /><br />characters were flawless.  Overall a good film that provides a heart-warming insight into human<br /><br />foibles.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Tim Burton directs an enchanting story about storytelling and the magical properties of fantastic tales.  The story begins with the son, William Bloom, who has moved to France with his expecting wife, Sophie. and after three years he is forced to return to the US to see his dying father, Ed, with whom he has not spoken in three years.  William is determined to find out the truth behind his father as everything that he has heard since childhood about his father has been fantastic imaginations about giants, miraculous adventures, and big mysterious fish.  However, as William returns to his childhood home the fairy tales told by his father continue, and the question is whether William will have time to find out the truth before the old man dies.  Big Fish is a powerful cinematic experience as it combines the traditional and contemporary manners of storytelling and as the tale unfolds it leaves the audience with both entertainment and notions to ponder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Tim Burton is a master of movies that blur genre lines.  Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were action-adventure-superhero movies with a twist of black humor provided by Nicholson's Joker and DeVito's Penguin, respectively.  Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow were horror-comedies, and Mars Attacks was kitsch-scifi-comedy.  I could go on, but will get to the point.  Big Fish contains elements of tragedy, comedy, adventure, fantasy, and drama, and mixes them up into a delightful and sensitive tall tale unlike any of Burton's other works.<p>The casting is immaculate: Ewan McGregor makes a great younger version of Albert Finney, and Allison Lohman is a dead ringer for a young Jessica Lange.  Other members of this stellar cast include Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Billy Crudup, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robert Guillaume.  <p>Although the story is a bit uneven at times, spending a few moments too long in the fantastical reconstructions of Finney's youth, the stories are so worthwhile and entertaining that the viewer is willing to overlook this shortcoming.  The movie also runs a bit long at just over two hours, but the final scenes tie the movie together neatly and give the viewer a sense of completeness and satisfaction with the outcome. <p>The primary theme of the film is the stories that we tell and how they affect other people's lives, a topic in which I have long had a casual interest.  A secondary, but nonetheless important theme is one of a son reconciling with, coming to grips with, and ultimately accepting his father for who he is, not who the son wants his father to be.  This theme alone makes the film worthwhile, and causes the viewer to reflect on his or her own parental relationship.<p>Viewed with a less critical eye, the movie is still very entertaining and the sort of wildly imaginative story to which only Burton could do justice.  Probably the best film I've seen since The Passion of the Christ.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Starring Ewan McGregor, and Albert Finney in an offbeat story about an estranged son who returns home to visit his dying father, and learns more about him by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. In a typical Tim Burton offbeat and colorful way, McGregor (playing his father as a younger man in flashback) helps the son (played by Billy Crudup) by re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows, the result of which is often funny but also beautifully poignant. Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.<br />The main thrust of the script is how the initial "Fish Stories" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Keep that in mind as you watch "Big Fish," for the fact and the fiction come together in a cohesive whole to paint a picture of the eccentric Edward Bloom in this touching, fanciful story of a father who tells tall tales and the son trying to make sense of them.  Considering the films' sweetness, warm nature and uplifting story, is surprised to learn that Tim Burton was on hand to direct.  Burton, now in his fourties, is a perpetual Hollywood outsider, often telling stories of sympathetic oddballs and socital outcasts, which come through in films like his "Edward Scissorhands" and even his take on Batman, which paint Bruce Wayne has a lonely, bachelor billionaire saving society while not taking full part in it either.  But in "Big Fish," Burton shows his emotional range, reportedly taking the project after the death of his own father.<p>The film opens as Edward Bloom (a terrific Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) are estranged due to Edwards' unbelievable stories about his life, which Will has grown tired of.  But, with Edward on his death bed, Will goes to his side, to try and learn the truth to why his father tells these tales.  Through various stroytellers and listeners, we learn Edwards' remarkable life story:  meeting witches, giants, werewolves, swampy utopias, his romantic hook up with his wife (Allison Loman and Jessica Lange), his fighting in Korea and saving that same Utopia he had visited earlier in his life.  This web of stories are expertly woven by, not only Burton, but also screenwriter John August ("Go") who fill the story, not only with idyllic images of Americana and plenty of good-natured humor, but with an emotional core that one cannot help but connect with.<p>And that core is done justice by an excellent acting ensemble, led by the lovable Albert Finney as the aging Bloom an Ewan McGregor and the younger.  Their performances perfectly match, weaving a character as fanciful as his stories but also as real as his disease.  Look for Finney to take home an Oscar for his work.  Billy Crudup is wonderful as well as the doubting Will, who softens throughout the film, leading to a tear-jerker scene in which, by telling his own story, Will shows he understands his father.  Juicy turns are on hand all around, as Steve Buscemi plays a poet turned bank robber, Danny De-Vito as a werewolf carnival manager and Helena Bonham Carter as a scret admirer of Edward and his tales.  One of the surprise best of the year, "Big Fish" will leave you believing in those tall tales again, and Tim Burton's filmmaking abilities.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I will have to admit that "Big Fish" wasn't high on my list of movies that I really wanted to see. I went to see the film with some friends this afternoon. Much to my surprise I loved the movie from the wonderful casting of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Helena Bonham Carter to the vibrant colors of the film. Billy Crudup plays Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney) estranged son Will who comes home because Edward is dying. Will wants to try to learn the truth about his father because his father had a reputation for telling tall stories. He wants to get to know his father on a personal level. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel (another book I need to read now that I have seen the film version), director Tim Burton weaves a tale that weaves back and forth from the present moment/reality to the past/fictional(?). Tim does a wonderful job of melding the past and present together. I never thought that Helena Bonham Carter was remotely attractive but I have to admit that she looked beautiful as Jenny, a friend from Edward's past. Alison Lohman looked convincingly as a young Sandra. She did look like Jessica Lange but younger. I loved Matthew McGory as the gentle giant Karl as well as the Chinese twins Ada and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing. I didn't really think that Billy Crudup had much depth (maybe the depth of a dixie cup) as Will. I guess Tim could have cast someone much worse than Billy, like Billy Zane for example. Otherwise the rest of the ensemble cast in the movie put in outstanding performances. I also loved Steve Buscemi's character Norther Winslow and his transformation which I won't give away. I thoroughly enjoyed "Big Fish". There wasn't a single moment in the movie that I didn't enjoy. I didn't realize until the film first came out that Albert Finney played Daddy Warbucks in the film version of "Annie". I haven't seen Albert Finney in the movies in years. He looked quite different in "Big Fish". Just thought I would share that piece of information.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>There are a lot of high expectations out there for Tim Burton's newest film, namely because it's getting more Oscar talk than just about any of his movies combined. It's been called his "masterpiece" by some people, but more often than not, it's getting slammed for being uneven. Well, the film is uneven in parts; I'll give you that. As Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a slowly dying father and husband, ventures back into his past to tell of the outrageous situations into which he got, sometimes that quirkyness seems to hurt things. A few subplots simply border on being ridiculous, and it becomes easy to understand why Finney's thirty-something son resents him so much for feeding him what he considers a line of crap. But then, reader, there are moments in Big Fish (and many of them, at that) when the sun shines through the clouds and you're caught up in the rapturous experience of watching a good narrative. The movie starts off wonderfully, and reaches its pinnacle when the love of Edward's (played in his early years by Ewan McGregor) life enters the picture in a gorgeous moment during a circus. Fish also has some really intelligent things to say about the nature of truth, the bond between fathers and sons, and the legacy of our lives. <p>  The effect of Big Fish upon viewers will be mainly a choice. You won't enjoy the movie if you sit back and agonize over how some of the philosophical notions of Burton's work have been explored much better in other movies; you'll probably roll your eyes at a key scene toward the end that looks like it was lifted out of 8 1/2; and you'll probably know where the whole darn thing is going at points. But you have another option - to sit back and let Burton's own catharsis of the death of his father wash over you in all its flawed, magical glory, and you won't leave dry-eyed. Sure, Big Fish isn't perfect, it is manipulative, and it won't get any Oscars, but it still beats a great deal of 'family' fare out there right now. Look carefully, too, and you'll see Ewan McGregor become a full-blown star. If anything, Big Fish is proof that we'll be seeing more from him in decades to come. Hopefully the same can be said about Fish's eccentric director. Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I think that those who are disappointed in &quot;Big Fish&quot; need to keep one thing in mind.  Tim Burton directed this film, but it is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace.  Those who are disappointed by this film probably feel so because the ending does not reach the lyrical height of &quot;Edward Scissorshand&quot; and the powerful idea of why it snows sometime in that suburban town.  I was actually thinking along those lines, wondering what wonder Burton would pull out of his hat this time, when it dawned on that this was not that sort of a movie.<p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; twists time between the present, in which old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, and the mythical past, in which the young Ed Bloom (Ewen McGregor) has the adventures that he is always telling everybody about.  Ed has been telling stories all of his life, to the complete enjoyment and captivation of everybody who hears them, except for his son, Will (Billy Crudup).  After a flare up at his wedding, where he thinks the day should finally be about him rather than his father, Will goes off to Paris with his wife to work as a wire service reporter and stops talking with his father.  But then the old man's health takes a final turn for the worse, William comes home and finally demands that his father finally tell him something about his life that is real before he dies.  Ed is not worried because when he was young he looked into the glass eye of a witch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and he knows how he dies and this is not it...yet.  <p>What I picked up early in this movie is that Will is wrong.  Ed is not a blowhard.  Forget what Billy says and listen to him tell a story.  Look at the faces of his wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange), his daughter-in-law Josephine (Marion Cotillard), and the people in the audience when Ed tells his story.  Even when they let Ed know that they already know the story, such as the one about the car and the maple tree, these women have such love for Ed on their faces.  Only Will misses the point, and apparently he takes some of the audience members with him.  But when Burton gives cinematic vision to Ed's stories we can see the magic as well as hear it.  <p>So we get to see the stories about Ed meeting Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), his meeting Ping (Ada Tai) and Jin (Arlene Tai) during the war, and his wooing of the beautiful young Sandra (a postively glowing Alison Lohman).  Because this is Tim Burton these sequences are as fantastical as you would expect.  However, ironically, there is a moment in &quot;Big Fish&quot; where Burton goes too far and gives Will a brief glimpse of the fantasy world of which his father spins his tales.  However, that moment is a mistake, because it sets up the idea the film's final payoff might be along those lines and is at odds with both the conclusion and the overall film. <p>The trap in this film is quite clear to me now.  Audience members think they are supposed to identify with Will rather than Old Ed.  The truth is that we are supposed to identify with young Ed.  How can we not?  It is young Ed who hits the long homerun, who wins the girl, and who saves the town of Spectre.  But do not feel sorry for old Ed, because his wife is perfectly willing to climb into the bathtub with him, even when they are both dressed.  Will is the one that his been missing the magic and who realizes an ephihany when he proves himself to be his father's son.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>I loved "Big Fish." Next to "The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King" it was one of the quickest movies that I have ever seen, and also one of the movies that I did not want to end. This movie had so much to like, that a shorter list would be the list of things that were bad about it.  I saw "Big Fish" in Manhattan while it was still in limited release, and now I am waiting to see it again when it expands. And don't listen to the MPAA rating. This movie should have been rated PG- it is not good for all audiences. but certainly for children with there parents. <p>Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom. Bloom likes to tell the many stories of his life, but his stories are false, and he says that they are real, much to the dismay of his son Will, who wants to find out who his father really is, and what happened in his past. Will may get that chance, however, when Edward's wife Sandra calls him and tells him that his father is dying. Will goes to his parents house right away with his preganant wife Josephine, where Will demands to know who his father is. Over the course of Will's visit, we the veiwer hear about Edward's stories. We hear the story of how he and his childhood friends went into the house of a "witch" who supposdly has an eye that if you look into it, you find out how you die. We hear the story about Edward's meeting with a giant named Karl. He then leaves the town that he grew up in, and while attending a circus he finds his true love. In a special shot where everything freezes where it was, including things that are in mid-air, we see Edward meeting Young Sandra. The owner of the circus makes a deal with him. For every month that Edward works for him, he will get one piece of infomation about Sandra. But my favorite story is the story about the famed poet Norther Winslow. It comes up so fast, and it's so hilarious because it's the last thing that you would expect happen. Winslow is played by Steve Buscemi, who is a brilliant actor who you see everywhere. You've probally seen him in "Ghost World", "Big Daddy", "Fargo," and many other films. <p>Tim Burton directed "Big Fish" and I can't think of another director that could have made this movie perfectly. The man who produced "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and "James and the Giant Peach." If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll love "Big Fish." It is filmed in the usual Burton style. It is a strange movie, but very realistic. It is hilarious at times, and then full of heart at others. The only other movies that came out this fall that contained those elements were "Something's Gotta Give," and "Matchstick Men," but the stories from all three of these movies combined are complety different and have nothing to do with the other, except for the elements that create the genre. "Big Fish," was simply a great movie, and it is a movie that I have never seen anything like. Even the acting was brilliant. I really like Ewan McGregor. I liked him in "Moulin Rouge," I liked him in "Down with Love," I liked him the last two Star Wars movies, and I liked him in "Big Fish." All of the other cast members were great but I do think that McGregor deserves an Oscar nod for this. If "Big Fish" was nominated for an Oscar, I believe that it has a strong chance of winning. I really hope this review makes it to amazon so I could stress the fact to people that "Big Fish" is one of the best movies of the year. <p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference. <p>Big Fish is also one my top 25 list. Just look through my lists and you'll find that list.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>I was worried when this movie was out.  Though for many years he was known as the director with the midas touch, his two most recent films(Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow), were neither the commercial success that was predicted, nor pleasing to his fans.  This was all changed with Big Fish, a harkening back to the style that made him famous.<br /><br />The movie is based off the relationship between a father(Ed Bloom: Ewan MaCgregor and Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The relationship is a strange one, Will has little knowlege of who his father is, his father is given to telling tall tales.  He has done this all his life, and seems to revel in being the center of attention.  But his son tires of it and after an arguement they break contact.  Until his mother calls telling him that his father is dying, and she thinks he should come home.<br /><br />Ed Bloom then starts to tell his various life stories to his sons wife.  They are all tall tales, and distinctly American in flavor.  They range from a witch in the swamp that had a glass eye that you can see the time and manner of your death, to strange town in the boonies called Specter(you never leave because it is so perfect.  These stories are done in the tall tale fashion, Ed Bloom always seems to have the answer and always comes off as charasmatic and virtuous.  Ewan MacGregor always seems to have a grin on his face.  But they all have the traditional Burton style of warped humor.<br /><br />This is a much mellower and more family based than some of his movies, ie the dark fairy tale "Edward Scissorhands" or insane BettleGuise.  Some of the stories still have that edge, ie the poor man living in the shadow of Bloom all his life and eventually has his woman stolen from him by Bloom, or the chinese singers who are also siamese twins.  But the stories are usually upbeat and have a positive nature to them.  His character is also made up to be the archtypical American Hero for that era.  He is a sports star, good looking, charasmatic, brave, earned his own way, and served in the war receiving honors returning to his wife after it was all over.<br /><br />The acting was good all around, and well cast.  Ewan McGregor played his role excellently with the wide smile and thick sounthern accent.  Helen Carter has two small but memorable roles and the girl who had a crush on Bloom and the witch.  Danny Devito looks like he is having too much fun as the circus manager Amos Callaway.<br /><br />The movie was surreal as any of Tim Burtons movies are, but he didn't let it cut into the movies emotional content.  Which was the connection that the father had with his son and wife.  Many consider this movie a tear jerker towards the end.  Making this a great movie for a broad audience, families, couples, or fanatics of Burton's cinematic vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>a big-hearted fantasy that includes much of what Disney usually leaves out: namely, all the quirkiness and tragedy involved in life.

Luckily, my wife was desperate to watch this film, so I was &quot;forced&quot; into watching it soon after the date of its release in DVD. I say luckily because the story is mesmerizing and the fantastic elements are fun and add a certain charisma to the film.<p>Will (Billy Crudup) is tired of listening to his father tell stories over and over and being the center of attention in every gathering. When at Will's wedding, Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan Mc Gregor) repeats his annoying behavior by retelling the story for the nth time of how he caught a big fish, Will gets extremely angry and they get into a confrontation. This leads to three years of silence between father and son, which is only broken when Edward gets seriously ill and the doctors have no hope left for him. <p>Will goes back with his parents' house and we get immersed into the different stories Edward told through the years, from a witch that showed him how he was going to die, to the time when he started growing extremely fast and had to spend three years in bed as a result. As the stories pile up, the son finally starts to understand who his father is and to appreciate that which has bothered him for so long.<p>Tim Burton leads us through a labyrinth of myths and legends, with skillful storytelling and scenes that will make even the toughest of you feel emotional and maybe drop a tear or two. It is definitely I movie I recommend everyone to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Famed cult director Tim Burton's "Big Fish" was greeted by generally positive reviews, but some of the negative ones were scathing - dull and preachy, belabored, pretentious, long-winded, strained. So, as a Burton fan, it was with some trepidation that I saw the movie. I'm glad I did. It's got its weaknesses - some of the fantasies don't work as well as Burton had hoped they would, I suspect. But, for the most part, it does work as a delicate, almost magical allegory. It also contains some great performances, especially by Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter.<p>What if, when you were a kid, your father filled your head with fantastic stories of his own youth? Stories about his encounters with a very big fish, amazing exploits in a war, encounters with a giant, his travels to a town that exists in its own space and time, etc.? And you, as a young man, with your limited imagination, could not accept your father's filling you with these stories? What if you could not relate to him because you felt his whole life was a lie? And, finally, what if you discovered that his crazy stories were not, after all, that far from what really happened? What would you do?<p>These and other questions are what confront Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] when he returns home from New York City to the rural South where his father, Ed [Finney] lays dying. Hostile and angry, Will confronts his father. [Of great importance to the story is Will's mother [Lange], who loves Ed unconditionally and is enchanted by his wild tales. But, of course, she loves Will unconditionally as well.] <p>As Will fights Ed, we see flashbacks of the young Ed [Ewan McGregor] living out these improbable tales in sequences of amazing visual detail. At first, Will may have the upper hand, but as we watch, it is Ed who wins the battle and our hearts. He may not have always told the truth, but it is his life, not Will's, which is the more heroic and worthwhile. Will, we learn, merely clungs to surface realities, while Ed has fully embraced the realities that lay just beyond our reach.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>A man tells his stories often enough, he becomes his stories and his stories live on after him. In that way he becomes immortal. Big Fish is a story about storytelling, about embracing the magic of existence, and the art of telling tall tales, even if they are true. This is a wonderful movie and it's life filled to overflowing with more life than life itself. I loved every minute of it.  I watched this movie because it was Directed by Tim Burton, I had no idea what it was about, but I heard it was very good.  The first part of this movie was a fun heartwarming set of tall tales, intertwined with a son angry at his father for allways telling them and never letting him know the real truth. I thought it was a good movie 4 out of 5 stars or so. Then the ending.  I wasn't ready for the movie to end, but I have to say this is the best ending I've ever seen in a movie. The way in which the story brings the son around and shows us why and how his father's stories work is fantastic. I'm watching as circus freaks are waving at an old man and I'm tearing up. Only Tim Burton could cause me those emotions at those images. 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book "Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions" by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell, at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however, Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others. It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes, where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker, a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of "Forrest Gump" and "The Princess Bride". Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable. Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is. Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of the senior Dr. Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work. The direction, however, is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant. This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son. I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>I found it exceedingly hard to give this film a rating, even those 4 stars i decided for i'm not absolutely certain about, it could easily have been a 3-star decision or a a 5-star even.<p>The reason for this is that "Big Fish" is a tricky proposition to make up your mind about. The fact that many reviewers either absolutely love it or found it tedious is attesting to that notion.<p>  While "Big Fish" is on the surface a film about a father in his dying days narrating the incredible and zany stories of his life and a son who tries to find out if these stories have any truth in them and simoultaneously learn who his father really was before he dies, there's quite many underlying and very significant questions and issues that this film deals with.<p>  To begin with, we as viewers never really find out with any certainty if these stories are indeed true, but instead we are "trained" through the course of the movie to think with father Gloom's mindset, that is:<br />"it doesn't really matter if they are true, it only matters that they make a good story".<p>  And then just when you think that's all there is, you realise that this film is like an onion really as another layer reveals itself to you:<br />"but isn't reality a matter of total subjectivity, and that what one person perceives as real the next person might think of as complete nonsense"?<p>  And yet who's to say what the answers "really" are? Big Fish walks , in my opinion, a very tight rope, and having to maintain a very precarious balance it does incredibly well.<p>  After the disaster of the "Planet of the Apes", Burton comes up in a domain where he does best: one between dream and reality where the borders are not only blurry but there might not be borders alltogether. It's all very "fortean" in concept, but Burton has proven in other films in his past that he can deal with this domain quite succesfully.<p>  Aside of the premise of the film (which again, will be perceived by a lot of viewers differently) this is a cinematic masterpiece as Burton brings to life the old school of grand-moviemaking to life.<p>  Alone the stunning depictions of the stories of father Gloom are cinema at its dreamy bestand this complimented by a cast headed by McGregor who ultimately finds a vehicle for the performance of his life make up for a not easy to forget film.<p>  The rest of the cast is up to par as well. Father Gloom played by Finney is a wonderful zesty character, as well as his wife played by a graciously aging J.Lange. De Vito and Buscemi, even in second leads, remind us easily why they belong to that league of premier actors.<p>  Sure enough, were this film to be taken literally, there are quite some plot holes, to name one example, why would a woman be so terribly in love with someone who was basically never there?<p>  But, this is exactly the trick here. Big Fish should not be judged on that merit. Burton himself has inserted not one, but many hints inside the dialogues of the film in that direction.<p>  Do see it. I'm not claiming it will change your life, but it will provide a lot of food for thought if you find a way to allow it to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie.  Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs.  Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters.  It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system.  With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square.  No small feat if you ask me.<p>But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded.  A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.  Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.<p>William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich).  You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.  Except none of them seem true.  Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish.  William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories.  But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend. <p>BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner.  From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater.  The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.  I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.  What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.  <p>I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.  It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.  Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face.  Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.<p>Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.  His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.<p>Tim Burton's directing is top notch.  He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.  He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.  His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines.  In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.<p>BIG FISH is also a film about heritage.  What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.  Watching a life unfold around us. <p>BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.  Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.  If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Big Fish" is the latest bit of calculated whimsy from famed director Tim Burton.  With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one "big fish story" after another.  Now old and facing death, Bloom needs to come up with a rousing finale to cap off his largely fictionalized life.  Bloom's son, William, a realist and pragmatist, bitterly resents the "lies" his father has been feeding him ever since he was a boy, and yearns, in these last moments together, to hear the "true" story of the old man's life.  But, in his investigation into the veracity of all the tall tales he's been told, William discovers that there may be more truth to these myths and legends than he has ever allowed himself to believe.  He also realizes that, in debunking all the whoppers, he will be depriving his father of the one real trait that defines him as a person and that distinguishes him from everybody else.<p>The title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously.  On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character.  On the other, Bloom is, himself, the "big fish" in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him.  "Big Fish" is actually most effective in the scenes set in the present, as father and son come to terms with the quality that each dislikes most about the other.  William feels deceived by a father who, despite the fact that he made himself appear to be a larger-than-life heroic figure, was actually just a mediocre, often-absent dad, too busy with his secret "fantasy" life to make time for his own lonely son (the story has strong echoes of "Death of a Salesman" in its underlying vision and theme).  Bloom, in a similar way, finds his son lacking in the kind of large-scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.<p>The film is considerably less successful in the "flashback" scenes tracing Bloom's life from his own birth to his son's early childhood.  The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner - filled with hauntingly mythical settings, surrealistic events and doses of Magic Realism - but the filmmakers can't overcome the unfortunate fact that these sequences are essentially as uninteresting and irritating as real "fish stories" tend to be.  Bloom's "adventures" come across as dime-novel vignettes, which is supposed to be the point, I guess, but it still means that we are squirming with impatience through large - indeed very large - stretches of the film.  Every time we come back to the present - to real, flesh-and-blood human beings - our interest picks back up.  That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.<p>Burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion.  The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role.  Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange).  Billy Crudup brings a subtle depth to the role of William and the scenes between him and Finney truly touch the heart.  Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito round out the impressive cast.<p>Maybe it says more about me than it does about the film that I ended up liking the parts that were the LEAST Burton-esque the best.  But, then again, this is from someone who thinks that the comparatively earthbound "Ed Wood" is Burton's best film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Big Fish" is brilliant, it is Tim Burton's best movie of his career. Ewan McGregor plays Young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney (in his Golden-Globe nominated performance) plays his older version of Edward years later. Billy Crudup plays Edward's son, Will. The story is about a father who is dying of cancer and the son who doesn't believe the facts of his life because they seemed too impossible to have really happened. Edward retells his facts of his life to his son and his daughter-in-law, Josephine, played by Marion Cotillard. Through his retellings, he meets a lot of strange, but interesting people. Karl the Giant, played by Matthew McGrory, Jenny, The Witch, played both by Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's real-life girlfriend. There is Norther Winslow, played by Steve Buscemi, Amos Calloway, played by Burton regular, Danny DeVito. Ping and Jing, played by Ada Tai and Arlene Tai. Edward meets the love of her life and his wife, played in his retellings by Alison Lohman and played outside of his retellings by Jessica Lange. There is also the family doctor, Dr. Bennett, played by Robert Guillaume. The movie is brilliant, Tim Burton's best movie ever and his directing is brilliant without compromise. The screenplay by John August, which is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, the screenwriter of Go, Titan A.E., Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. His next screenplay is again with Tim Burton for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant and the end credits song "Man Of The Hour" by Pearl Jam is brilliant without compromise. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. The movie also got a Golden Globe Best Picture nomination for a Musical or Comedy. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is brilliant. The production and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Colleen Atwood is brilliant. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian is superb. The visual effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks is brilliant. The performances by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast are amazing, especially from McGregor, Finney, and Crudup. Casting them was a brilliant plan on Tim Burton's part. I loved this movie, because it was different than what Burton usually does. It is a brilliant achievement for Burton and it is a masterpiece. How it was made was intriguing because it seems that it was strange, but once I got used to the idea of the movie, it made me change my mind right away. It was a little bit like Burton's last masterpiece "Ed Wood". I enjoyed that movie but I enjoyed this movie better, because it proves that Burton is a gifted filmmaker who knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it. Go see this movie when you can get a chance because it is a brilliant movie that hit the top of my top 10 movies of 2003, and not because that, because of your opinion of the movie, which could change people's minds like it did with me. Take anybody you want to see this magical film that is different than it seems.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, and the tall tale sequences made me chuckle more than I normally would while watching a movie.  However, when I read the reviews which absolutely slaughter this film, I am inclined to agree with the criticisms.  As it approaches its climax, it too often slides into maudlin sentimentality.  It also leaves much to be desired when exploring the relationships of sons & fathers.  It is probably best not to try and seek deeper truths from this movie.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining, by and large.  As Edward Bloom understood, the deeper truths of a story really pale in comparison with how good of a story it is in the first place.  For this reviewer at least, a really good story about a bunch of really good stories is justification for liking it.  My four-star rating comes with the qualification that at times, it promises to deliver more than it really can, and tries to be more than it really is, and stumbles as a result.  When it did become a bad thing to be a really good yarn?  Sometimes that really is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>Can there be any other director who has carved such a perfect niche for himself as Tim Burton? The undoubted master of the "adult fairytale" tackles the issue of the relationship between Father and Son in the film 'Big Fish'. With an impressive cast including Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup and Jessica Lange - oh, and not forgetting "Mrs Burton" (Helena Bonham Carter) - 'Big Fish' is set up to succeed from the get-go. What Burton has created is a humorous and yet moving journey through the fantastic life of one Edward Bloom as retold through a series of flashbacks. The film strongly evokes memories of the equally surreal 'Edward Scissorhands' and the gently comedic fictional biopic 'Forrest Gump'.<br />This film is a heart-warming, funny and quite mesmerising tale. There is something strangely homely about Burton's 'Big Fish' - it is one of those films that makes you reassess some of your own relationships. The acting is of a high calibre throughout - I thought Lange's performance as the loving wife of Bloom was wonderfully understated in particular. The supporting actors include the superb Steve Buscemi and Burton's old mate Danny De Vito. I did have a couple of minor gripes in this regard however - Finney's delivery is sometimes mumbled or slurred to an extent that I could not make out what he was saying (this could have been intentional, but was irritating nonetheless) and McGregor's Alabama accent was jarring. It's not that he didn't carry it off, but for an actor who has such a characteristic accent of his own (Sean Connery anyone?), the fake southern drawl did take a little while for me to feel comfortable with it.<br />This story will make you laugh and will warm the cockles of all but the most hard-hearted viewer. Highly recommended as a film for those prepared to sit back, suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy the ride. If you have seen some of Burton's other work ('Sleepy Hollow', 'Beetlejuice' or 'Edward Scissorhands' for instance), you may be one of those people who feel they are just a little too weird...possibly a little too contrived. Have no fear if that is the case. Whilst this bears the undeniable Burton stamp, it is probably his most accessible - dare I say mainstream - film. Very nice work indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Will and his father Edward have become estranged over the years because of the many tall tales that Edward has told his son.  When Will receives a phone call from his mother telling him that his father is dying, he knows he must go to him and find out who his father really is and what is the truth about his life.  Whenever Will asks questions, his father replies with the outlandish stories that he has heard all of his life.  As the movie continues, Will finds out that not all of his father's stories are fantasy, and those that are have served a purpose in his life.  This is a beautifully told tale of fact vs. fancy, and the reconciliation of a father and son.  It is touching and is well-acted and directed.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor shine as Edward Bloom, who repeats his preposterous stories thousand times before his son Will -- stories about a giant living in a cave, a witch whose eyeball reflects how the watcher dies, and of course, the big fish.  Now old Edward does it again, before Will's wedding guests and Will himself, who begins to find his daddy too annoying these days.  <p>But the day comes when Will realizes that Edward is not all lying -- actually, the stories he told were all based on truth.  On the deathbed of Edward, he recounts the days of his youth, the romance with his wife, and a little secret about the town of &quot;Spectre.&quot;  <p>The strength of &quot;Big Fish&quot; is its visual flair, and the director is Tim Burton.  The picture is filled with his imagination, which is greatly helped by the able cast including, besides McGregor and Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman as Edward's love Sandra, and Danny Devito.  Jessica Lange plays older Sandra while Will by Billy Crudup.<p>Again I say the visual is great because the stories Edward tells us tend to be repetitive, and its contents are not always interesting, or 'big' enough.  Some episodes are not necessary while some look mercilessly shortened, especially the one about the girl 'Jenny' who is incredibly cute.  Burton keeps on his tales, and they mostly work, but he needs more careful selection and less running time to produce the same effect.<p>Still, the film is moving when it concentrate on its theme -- the relations between the characters, the father and the son in particular.  I don't buy the idea of casting McGregor as Edward from Alabama, but as his resembrance with Finney would justify it.  Well, but Burton's best remains the one about another Edward, which is of course, &quot;Edward Scissorhands.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Big Fish didn't do that great in the box office and also wasn't as well appreciated as it should've been.

So most critics gave Big Fish lower ratings because they liked The Barbarian Invasion more. Some critics did notice it and appreciate it a lot but not enough did.  <p>  Meanwhile I think Big Fish deserved the sort of appreciation that Forest Gump got. Hell for me it made me feel the way I did when I first saw Forest Gump as well. It's touching, uplifting, funny, romantic and highly imaginative. The performances  are great as well. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finny is equally great as old Edward Bloom. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Danny Devito, Helen Bohen Carter (Fight Club) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World) are all good in supporting roles as well. Critic Roger Ebert said that Tim Burton does better work when he focuses more on a story than effects like with Sleepy Hollow and Edward. He makes it sound like Big Fish doesn't focus more on the story when it does. It's all story and all heart. Burton isn't George Lucas, he can make a good movie even without eye popping effects. He proved that with EdWood and I think he proved that with Big Fish too. When it was over, I was thinking about the acting, direction and the story and about how good of a movie I just saw.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of Tim Burton, so I walked into Big Fish with some trepidation. I was aware that this was Tim's big break - a genre movie that wasn't quite so "genre," just like Sam Raimi directing Spider-man. Would he be able to pull off something that's not quite so dark and wonderful but still retain that magical quality that makes Tim's movies so much fun? <p>Yes! <p>This is not to say that Big Fish is a happy-go-lucky film. The plot revolves around Will Bloom, a journalist, and his tenuous relationship with his tall-tale-telling father, Edward Bloom. You see, Edward doesn't just make up stories -- he transforms them into Homeric proportions as he spins each tale for his audiences. What Will found to be a wonderful trait as a boy turned to cynicism and frustration as a man. It's like finding out Santa Claus isn't really but still seeing him every day. What do you say to the man? <p>Nothing, in Will's case. He had long since stopped talking to his father. But then Edward falls ill and Will is called back home. Thus begins a journey through Edward's life, as told by Edward himself and played out for audience as if it were real. <p>What's compelling about Big Fish is that the events are played with enough seriousness to take them as truth. Yes, there's a witch with a glass eye, a goat-eating giant, the conjoined singing twins Ping and Jin, and a ghostly town named Spectre. But they are all presented with careful maturity. When one of Ed's young friends looks into the witch's eye, he sees his own death on a toilet bowl as a middle-aged man. You half expect his head to explode or something. <p>That theme, that Ed knows when he's going to die, is an undercurrent throughout the entire film because it crosses the line between fantasy and reality. If Ed's tales are actually false, if they're complete fabrications, why does a man on his deathbed believe in them so strongly? Is it just desperation? Or are they real, in some way? <p>The answer is both. Ultimately, Will keeps looking for answers that cannot be found - he wants to know his "real father," but in reality he can't accept who his real father is. It is Will who is the fabrication - he has constructed a form of "normalcy" that doesn't exist and that he judges his father by. In the end, it's not about the veracity of anyone's story...it's about listening. All Will ever wanted to do is have his father listen to him. <p>And at the end of the film and Edward's life, he finally does. This is an exceptional piece and one Tim should be proud of that still manages to stay true to his fantasy roots and yet takes a serious look at very real issues of death, immortality, and a father and son's affection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>"There comes a point when any reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he made a mistake. The truth is . . . I was never a reasonable man."<br />-Young Edward Bloom<p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" proves the truism that memory can never be totally accurate or complete.  Making matters worse is that sometimes the person recalling the past will embellish his or her memories to the point where fiction and fact become inseparable.  Yet, is this necessarily a bad thing?  Who amongst us after all has not been amused by the occasional tall tale?<p>Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is and has always been a master storyteller.  His son, Will (Billy Crudup) has heard all of the tales of his father's youth many times over while growing up.  He loved listening to them when he was a small boy but became annoyed by them as he grew older and began to recognize them for what they really were - tall tales.  When Edward falls ill, Will returns home and asks his father if he would finally come clean and tell him the truth about his life.  Will is desperate to find out who his real father is since surely he was not the man who during his youth had adventures with a legendary catfish, a witch with a glass eye, a giant, a circus run by an unusual ringmaster, a mermaid, and two Asian singers joined at the hip?  Or was he?  <p>At first glance it might appear that "Big Fish" is a whimsical story about a man who lived a fascinating life in his own mind.  However, a closer inspection reveals it to be a much more deeply layered film than that.  On an individualistic external level, it explores the notion of legacy by examining one man's desire to make himself seem more fascinating than he really was.  And on an individualistic internal level, it explores the psychological importance of utilizing the imagination to alleviate the personal disappointment felt when one's life does not turn out to be as colorful as had been hoped.  Yet, despite the profound themes circulating throughout "Big Fish," the film never feels too heavy-handed as Burton skillfully includes just the right amount of amusing moments from start to finish to keep you smiling.  Much credit must also go to the amazing group of actors and actresses in the film.  There is not a single miscast performer as Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham-Carter, Danny DeVito, Matthew McGrory, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, Ada Tai, and Arlene Tai are all great in their respective roles.  Ewan McGregor deserves special recognition for his portrayal of the young Edward Bloom as he is totally convincing in every scene he appears in no matter how outlandish the surrounding circumstances may be.  Kudos to Burton for making amends for his disappointing re-imagining of "Planet of the Apes" (2001) with this film.  Here's hoping that "Big Fish" is the start of another creative winning streak for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Big Fish is one of those movies everyone should see. We can all relate to it somehow and Time Burton has given himself another hit movie.<p>Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom's life. Young Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and old Bloom by Albert Finney. He is on his deathbed and his son Edward who is played by Billy Crudup has come to make his reconciliation with his dad. He's tired of his dad's stories and wants the truth from him. He feels like he doesn't know his dad, and he knows time is runnig out.<p>Ewan McGreggor is awesome. His fans will argue this as his best performance ever and I think it is. He is enchanting in the movie. He does a great job faking the accent and he just takes the role and runs with it. I wish he could get really get academy consideration for his role. It's really that great and an Oscar nomination should go his way. He's just as good as Depp in Pirates and Penn in Mystic River. This could be the best performance of his young carear. Ewan won't disappoint you.<p>I liked Billy Crudup in the movie. His character isn't a real lively one and has a lot of mixed emotions about his father. Crudup plays with the emotions well. He's a good actor and I hope to see more of his work in the future.<p>You also have to love Albert Finney in the movie. His character is loveable and he displays a spark that just makes you smile. He's a loveable old guy and his performacne will and can draw tears.<p>Tim Burton has just made a simply fantastic film. I really wish I could just shake his hand. He's a great director and has always made original and fun films. They've always been a little werid, but it's always made them special.<p>Big Fish is a great film. Take the family to see it. It's an enchanting and fun tale full of stories and memorable characters. Come see one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see a movie. Big Fish is just simply fantastic and is something everybody should see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Just got back from this movie and let me just say it much better than I thought it would be. And I had high hopes! First of all, the visuals are some of Tim Burton's best to date. The multiple fantasy worlds he has created are some of the most unique ever put to film. The acting is extremely strong, especially Albert Finney(old Edward), Ewan McGregor(young Edward), Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi(very funny role), and even the little known Billy Crudup as Edward's truth seeking son. All the rest of the cast are great as well, but have much smaller roles. Even though this film is full of funny and amusing situations, it is still at heart a serious and moving film. My eyes actually teared up at the end sequence with Albert Finney's character being taken into the river with all his friends watching on. This film will be watched by many for years to come, and some have already called it Burton's masterpiece. While the visuals alone are not impressive enough to top Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, or even the first two Batman films, it is the Father-Son story that breathes life and warmth into an already beautiful looking film. As the wisest people claim that true beauty is on the inside rather than the outside, is only but a half truth as with some of Edward's stories in this film. Because in this rare instance, Burton has made a film that is imaginative and beautiful inside and out.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's return to genuine film making is a welcome endeavor indeed. Here he creates a film that reminds me of what great film making is all about: fantasy, love and reflecting on the human spirit. I scoffed at a review that compared Big Fish to The Wizard of Oz when Big Fish first came out, but upon viewing it the comparison is really not hyperbolic at all and is actually quite justified. There is a unique carelessness and an innocence that resides perfectly and constantly in both films. To me, both films are truly a breath of fresh air and hope.<br /><br />Big Fish is a book written by Daniel Wallace and is the delightful story of Edward Bloom, who has reached the twilight of his life and surrounds himself with his son, daughter-in-law and his wonderful wife Sandra. Eddie has seemingly lived a fantastic life of lies and exaggerations and his son has grown to call his bluff on more than one occasion. In fact, his son returns not just to possibly say good-bye to his father, but to attempt to get him to spill the beans on the truth of who his old man really is. Eddie of course, stands by his stories and brushes off his son's accusations nonchalantly. Most of the film we see Eddie revisit his life as a whole, seen through only his own stories. How he once befriended a 12 foot man; how he arrived in a town that was paradise, once to early and once too late when he turned it back into paradise again; how he joined the circus for three years so he could find out pieces information once a month from Amos the ringmaster about the girl Eddie was sure would be his wife and how Sandra would believe Eddie to be dead in war but he would return. The stories are full of details that would clearly indicate they are false but sometimes they are just better that way. Eddie is a mythological figure and that is just fine with him and as a viewer it's fine with me as well.<br /><br />Eddie is played by Albert Finney who is in turn mirrored by Eddie's youthful version, the outstanding Ewen MacGregor who once again proves his versatility. Jessica Lange plays the older Sandra and she is played as a youngster by the talented Alison Lohman who carries as much energy and beauty as you could expect for a role with so little dialogue and so much importance. She is a real find and makes you fall in love with her right along with Eddie. Helena Bonham Carter brings her talents to the roles of The Witch and Jenny (or all of the other important women in Eddie's life). Steve Buscemi shows up, which is always a pleasant surprise and of course Amos is played by Danny DeVito who is as enjoyable as ever. The flat Keanu Reeves clone Billy Crudup is perhaps the only drawback, but he is a safe casting call as Eddie's son and does what he can in discovering that his father is exactly what he says he is and more.<br /><br />Let me just add that I believe Big Fish is a family film. I don't see why it shouldn't be rated PG rather than PG-13. The language rises above the prime time television level once, there is blood only in a comedic and romantic fight sequence that has a truly admirable message and there is a women's nude rear displayed briefly and non-sexually. This is not grounds for a PG-13 movie. I would bring a seven year old to see this. In fact, my guess is that the movie was directed at this demographic. When content is not exploitative, it is not really inappropriate. I can't see why Rock Diesel films get PG-13ed when the message is nothing short of "Kill the bad guys, make a lame joke, drive and crash really cool vehicles and get the dirty chick". Anyway, Big Fish may be about a guy who is stretching the truth but the characters' hearts couldn't be more firmly in the right place. The scene when Eddie fills an entire field with Sandra's favorite flower and stands in the middle of the field, outside of her window and calls out to her comes to mind. It brings joy to my heart in a way that only a film like The Wizard of Oz can, and a small child should never ever miss that kind of message. Big Fish is a smart film that really generates a ton of emotion and convincing special effects. I don't doubt for a moment that more work went into the effects than money. This film carried a sense of hope, pride, real love, respect, fantasy and the crucial element that films of these tainted times often forget: natural and unforced optimism.<br /><br />Then there is Tim Burton. He is the filmmaker that can put all of these elements together and for the first time tug at your emotions as well. Two things make this film better than Burton's other work. Firstly, it is real and doesn't dwell on being over-stylized and under-dramatized. Secondly, it is pure, clean and full of moments we can all relate too. Tim Burton has made a film that will alienate his older fans who haven't matured like he has, without "selling out" (he's done that before) and he has made a film that the whole world can watch, enjoy and discover this unique filmmaker. I'm glad that he saved some of his real film making inspiration for this wonderful little story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film is essentially about story-telling. If you keep this in mind as you watch the film, it offers an interesting contrast between the story-telling of an elderly Alabama businessman, Ed Bloom, and the storytelling of the film's director, Tim Burton.<br /><br />Ed Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor in his youth and by Albert Finney in his old age, is a natural story-teller.  He takes the raw material of everyday life and enhances it, embellishes it, and pulls it together in an entertaining whole. Because his life had several odd twists and turns, he has more raw material for his stories than the average fellow.  His courtship of his wife Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her youth and by Jessica Lange in her maturity, comprises the most romantic and the longest tale in the story.<br /><br />Ed and Sandra have a son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, who has heard one tall tale too many and has become estranged from his father for the last 3 years while Will and his young wife live in Paris. The story moves from the vastly romantic courtship of Ed and Sandra to Will's stuggle with the relationship with his father. Basically Will assumes that if the stories are embellishments of truth that he does not really know his father. As his father is dying of cancer, Will tries to break through and find the real father underlying the tall tales. His father is insulted and hurt by this approach, and through his sick-bed story telling Ed captivates Will's beautiful young French wife.<br /><br />At the end of the film, the son Will, is left alone with his father as his father is dying and tells his father a tall tale of his father's death, surrounded by all those who have know and loved him, as he becomes a giant black catfish who swims away. At the end we see the son Will finally recognize that the tall tale, the embellished story, contains an essential truth that must be protected and clothed and escorted with the trapings of fantasy so as to be recognized, appreciated, and absorbed.<br /><br />This is the truth that Burton wishes for us to comprehend about the role of the storyteller and he relays this message in his own tall tale.<br /><br />As a final note, since I am from Alabama, I personnally enjoyed seeing the scenes that were filmed in old downtown Montgomery and on the Huntingdon College Campus.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book "Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions" by Daniel Wallace.

It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell,  at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however,  Will and his wife rush to his side.

As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others.  It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes,  where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker,  a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a  bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of "Forrest Gump" and "The Princess Bride".  Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.  Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.  The direction, however,  is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.  This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.  I am certainly glad that I did.

The macabe genius has slipped up here lately with his re-make of "Planet Of The Apes", but the man is back and in a big way. Burton has always been able to take his audience on an incredible journey into the minds of oddball characters(Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) and into the presence of magical worlds and fairy tales. Never has he done so with such brilliance as he has with this latest offering. The movie is about Edward Bloom, a man who is seen young(played by Ewan McGregor), and as his older present day self(played by Albert Finney). Edward is not long for this world, and his estranged son Will(Billy Crudup), comes back home with his expecting wife, to see his father and patch things up before it's too late. Will has always been hearing his father's wild tall tales, and has had enough. He wants the truth. He wants to know the man that his father really is before the man himself is no more. From his bed, Edward Sr. talks with his son and the discussion takes us through the life and journeys he has been in. Young Edward is seen as a young man with ambition and determination with a lot left over to spare. He is seen journeying through the world into haunted woods, enchanting towns, working in a traveling circus, and coming across people such as a giant, witches, werewolves, and other interesting characters. Will tries to get to the bottom of these tall tales that his father has been telling and claiming are as true as they can be. It's a son hoping to reconcile with the man, the father, that he never really knew. This is like "Forrest Gump", but in a way that only Tim Burton could tell it. The story and screenplay is solid and laced with delicate writing, settings, and colorful characterizations. The fact that this wonderful film was so overlooked during 'Awards' time was downright criminal. Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, appears in the film, as does Burton regular, Danny DeVito, who plays a circus ringleader. Jessica Lange plays Edward's wife in present day, Sandra, and that character is played in the past by Alison Lohman. Jessica is such a fine actress, and it's too bad she wasn't given more to do. They did a fine job of getting the two actresses to play the same character. Crudup is a fine young actor and he does a solid job as the confused son searching for answers. Who wouldn't be in his place?. Who would believe the stories, or some of them, would be true?. Every frame is flawlessly choreographed, and the sets and art direction are magical, clear, colorful, and have a very serene feel. This is definitley Burton's masterpiece. It is a film that seems more human than anything he has done. The acting is sincere. Ewan brings an enthusiasm and down home charm to his role as the younger Edward, and he is enigmatic throughout. You are instantly charmed and even though you already know how he turns out, you root for him and wish him the best on his journey in life. Albert Finney does a fine job as the older, ailing Edward. He comes across as a very likeable old man who just embraces life. That's what the film is. Embrace life. Live it to it's fullest. One other review stated that Finney was unpleasant. I find that so untrue. This is pure gold. I haven't been this enchanted with a film in a long time. Thank you Tim Burton. Can't wait for the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>Big Fish is a movie about a familiar character type:  the ex-jock who becomes a highly successful traveling Southern salesman.  Edward Bloom is a "well-liked" salesman who spins comic fish stories and Davy Crockett style tall tales about his days of athletic glory.

Big Fish is a comedy masterpiece that you cannot afford to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Tim Burton has created the best mix of fantasy and drama that Hollywood has ever seen. Burton mostly known for his fantasy side directs with his usual brilliance. Although my loyalty lies with "Beetlejuice" as my favorite Burton film, "Big Fish" is an excellent addition to Burton's list of some of the most magical motion pictures ever to come out of Hollywood. The cast is superb, the set decor is out of this world, and the story is a piece of mind blowing fiction. Last but not least I always have to mention the soundtracks of Burton's films. Composer Danny Elfman is phenomenal, his music scores always add so much to Tim Burton's films. BIG FISH was recommended to me by one of my Amazon.com friends (thanks), ..of course being that I see all of Tim Burton's movies in theaters I had already seen it. It's a masterpiece in every way, after watching it again today I was reminded of just how great it truly is. 5 stars = excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Nowadays, it's rather common for companies to produce movies about misunderstood children and the plutonic relationships with their parents.  This movie turned it the other way around, of the son refusing to take his father as he was &amp; subconsciously disowned him as none of them shared the same identity.  In the end, as the father was facing his inevitable death from terminal illness, the son finally came to term and reconciled with the demon that haunted him for years.  As viewers sat through the movie, in the end, we would understand the significance of the title, &quot;The Big Fish&quot;.  The bottom line is things are as they are.  As simple as that.  I could emphatise with this movie as I am having the same kind of relationship with my dad.  It's difficult to come to term with the fact that we are so different from one another but in the end, we simply have to learn to let go, clinging for the impossibility that perhaps, my dad happens to pretend to be someone that he's not.  I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's movies as his vision is second to none and distinctly his.  Other than his disappointment in Planet of the Apes, Tim Burton is arguably one of the most creative Director I truly appreciate.  By looking at the additional features in DVD, I could sense that this project is a very personal one for him.  One could also say that this movie is not as dark &amp; as bleak as his previous offerings and perhaps, it has something to do with his new life with Helen Bonham Carter who played different characters in this movie.  One could also catch a glimpse of the writer of &quot;The Big Fish&quot; as an Economics lecturer as a cameo appearance!  Overall, a very heart moving movie with strong performances by Albert Finney, Danny de Vito, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor.  Then, there are also three Oscar winners in the production crew such as costume designer, director of cinematography, special effects designer Stan Winston.  Definitely bang for your buck.  Timeless and appealing to all ages.

Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging. <p>Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<p>Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.  The direction, however,  is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.  This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.  I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I'm not quite sure how diehard Tim Burton fans will take to this movie.  For one thing, it is Tim stab at making a sentimental movie.  Now, so far, Tim's stock-and-trade has been irony.  That his not to say that his films are not life-affirming - paradoxically, Beetlejuice is tremendously life-affirming.  However, this movie aims for the heart and does it without any trace of cynicism.  <p>The salvation of the movie comes from the imagination of the stories Bloom tells and Burton's visual sensibility.  This is Burton's best movie in years.  (Planet of the Apes was AWFUL.)  As we watch the always-engaging Ewan McGregor get into one unbelievable adventure after another, we can't help but be amused.  This is not a movie with a beginning or an end - just a whole lot of middle.<p>Once again, it's not quite Edward Scissorhands, but it deserves much more attention than it got when it was originally in theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>i loved it completely today, as i opened and viewed my glorious new dvd! truly tim burton's masterpiece, it cracks you up, gets you so involved and wrapped up in it, it's hard to let it end! the acting by the entire cast is wonderful, the cinematography is breathtaking, the story so full of imagination, humor, and heartwarming events, you may find it irrestable as i did, and view it all over again. the dvd ac-3 sound is incredible as is the digital transfer. it is, at times, astounding!  do not pass this one by-it is a marvel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>I saw Big Fish while in limited release in New York City. What a sweet little picture. Too nice infact, it'll be sure to be ignored. You will either love it or hate it because it's just plain sincere and straight forward. I found albert finney to be as charismatic as ever. Ewan McGregor, was a bit type cast, but he's good at playing the perfect guy. It's the most un-tim burton, tim burton has ever been. Which adds to the movies unique look and feel. He allows his imagination to grace the screen but unlike things like Kill Bill it never distracts from the over all experience. Tim Burton said he made this movie as therapy for losing his parents recently. And that what this movie feels like, good medicine. I recently had a scare with my mom going to the hospital, and this movie really made me feel better.<p>The stories, this is the meat of the movie. They are fantastic. They are funny. I believe they really happened. They are hauntingly surreal and are as intriguing to watch as they must have been to hear. This is where the movie takes off and sweeps you off your feet. I won't ruin  stories themselves but they were a complete delight to behold. So much so, that the scenes in between them tend to drag on until the next tall tale comes along.<p>My criticism are few but if I had to nit pick I would say that the cynical son is almost TOO cynical, and it's really stupid as to WHY he doesn't talk to his father anymore. But when he starts to soften up, that falls to the way side. The movie starts off a little strange, the editing could have been tighter and basically when we dont see albert finney or his younger self things definetly slow down on screen. It has its flaws.<p>And last but not least, the Pearl Jam song in the credits...PERFECT. I smell a best song oscar for Eddie Vedder and crew.<p>Good Job Tim. Sweet movie. Don't get so hyped about it folks. It's not Ed Wood and it's not anything else. It's a bit over sweet, so it depends on what kind of mood your in.

Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney `flounder' about in the present day incarnation.  The luminous Jessica Lang languishes in the role of the wife in present day, standing by as a prop while the dispassionately played son tries to synthesize reality and his father's tall tales fed him over the years.  An odd film, and not his usual quirky special way, it just didn't work for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Excellent story of a son discovering his father: the man he never knew.

Big Fish's interesting. The concept glorifies the script using appropriate character combinations. Its a big movie of its own sort. I wouldn't say its one of the best films I have seen without seeing it again.<br /><br />The much celebrated father's character in this movie is quite empowering. There are movies that I like and appreciate because they are well wound out as in the story relating is pretty solid. I liked OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU for it tales of past vast country lands and inane yet imaginable people.<br /><br />I liked Big Fish more for the eyes, the small trespasses and the fact that "A big fish remains a small fish if kept in a small pond"<br /><br />Cheesy? Go watch the film , lovers :)</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>The relationship between a young man and his dying father takes center stage at this original movie, that seamlessly mixtures fantasy and reality in order to create a film well-worth watching.<br /><br />The son, William (Billy Crudup), wants to know more about his dad before it is too late, but is fed up with the incredible stories he always tell about himself. The problem is that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), cannot help but talk a lot and make reality more interesting, disguising it as he deems necessary. But after telling a story many times, it becomes real to you, and Ed can't distinguish truth from lies any more. But who knows, maybe he doesn't want to...<br /><br />The talks and fights between father and son, mixed with their interaction with their wives, take them down memory lane, as Ed remembers once again what happened to him from the moment he left his little town as a young man. Ed doesn't stop telling tall tales, but the spectator will be happy for that due to the fact that thanks to the skill of the director of "Big Fish" (Tim Burton) Ed's stories come alive, and we are introduced to witches, giants, werewolves, the biggest fish in the river and even to the charmed town that young Ed (Ewan Mc Gregor) visited in his wandering days. We also get to know how Ed met the girl he knew would become his wife (Alison Lohman, afterwards played by Jessica Lange), and the unconventional way in which he proposed to her.<br /><br />Those stories are too strange to be truthful, of course, and that is the problem for Will. But soon enough he will realise that maybe not all Ed's stories are complete lies, and that he might know his father much more than he was aware of.<br /><br />I highly enjoyed this movie, even though it made me cry a little at the end. I want to point out that the general tone is one of optimism, and that "Big Fish" is so visually engaging that you will believe you are living an extraordinary fairy tale. And what can I say?. I love good fairy tales!!!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" spins a yarn about one of the great yarn-spinners of all time, Ed Bloom, and it does so in the enchanting fashion that makes great story-tellers proud.<br /><br />The present-day Bloom (played by the great Albert Finney) is in the twilight of his life, beset by cancer and soon destined to leave this mortal coil.  According to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Bloom has filled his life with telling fantastic lies embellished with ridiculous fables enhanced by Bloom's own mythical view of himself.  And Will has had enough of it, rejecting his father to work in Paris as a "just the facts" reporter - the duality is obvious:  Dad tells false but interesting tales, while Son writes factual-yet-drab articles.  As Will says, "Dad, you're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined... you're just as charming, and just as fake." Against his wishes, Will returns home to be with his dad, along with his pregnant wife, during his last days.<br /><br />As various characters interact with the dying Bloom, he continues to relate various tales about his past, which allows Burton to go into full flashback mode.  According to himself, the younger Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor (one of the most likable actors working today), did lead one heck of a fantastic life, replete with witches, giants, werewolves, circus performers, Siamese twins, international intrigue, romances and, of course, a really big fish.  Burton invests each of the various episodes in Bloom's past with a wonderful combination of realism and fantasy.  One thing to remember about people who live in a fantasy world - to them, it's normal, and they tend to act like normal people.  It is refreshing that for all the fantastic things Bloom saw and experienced, none of the characters appear to be too over-the-top or cartoonish.<br /><br />This being a Burton film, also beware his trademark black humor.  If you've seen other Burton films, it should come as no surprise that one character gets his comeuppance by having a heart attack on the john while "reading" a Playboy.  (And what a wonderful comeuppance it is!)<br /><br />Initially, Will refuses to engage his father's tales, and many stories are told to Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard).  But then Will's mom (Jessica Lange) tells Will to start going through all of his father's accumulated personal effects from his long life, and Will starts to see some proof of his father's legendary exploits.  And young Will gradually sees the wisdom in his father's penchant for exaggerating his own legends . . . and one of the movie's best moments comes when Will realizes that he's got a bit of Dad's storytelling ability running through his veins.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, well-written, and well-acted (although one wishes that Jessica Lange had more to do with her role), "Big Fish" is sure to enchant viewers who appreciate a good story, and a heart-felt ending will have more than a few viewers dabbing the corners of their eyes.<br /><br />The DVD has some decent extras, but nothing out of the ordinary (we're not talking about a Peter Jackson 4-DVD pack here).  The pictures and sound are great - a good DVD for a delightful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) is the perfect director for this film about a dying father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup), alienated by the father's habit of grabbing the limelight with his elaborate tall tales.  The film is a bit confusing, with multiple actors playing characters as the timeline jumps back and forth, but the fantasy sequences show Burton at his best and the cast, including Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange and Steve Buscemi, is flawless.  The film uses elaborate folk stories about circuses, giants and warfare to address the relationship between fathers and sons, and is thus a film that will be entertaining for children even as it touches men in a more personal way.<p>The dvd extras are very good and include a commentary track by director Tim Burton; a trivia game about Burton's previous films; and many fine featurettes concerning several of the characters, Burton, myth, special effects, and the book on which the film is based.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Tough one for me.  I love Burton films and am a big fan of most of the actors.  When I watched this, I was ready to be pulled into Tim Burton's dreamy, fairy-tale world and I ... wasn't.  Beautiful to look at, nice score, fine actors - but I really felt the schmaltz come through in a mainstream don't-give-the audience-credit kind of way.  Burton's best makes you feel as sad, happy, schmalzty as the best of them, but without your feeling so commercially manupulated.  There is a depth missing here and sadly, I felt nothing but a pretty surface on this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>A delightful diversion from regular films! The screen frequently pops with whimsical exaggerations and candy-tinted flourishes in this imaginative adaptation of Wallace's novel. <p>Plus, we have a liberal dollop of humourous banter, dealing with an evocative theme that most of us could relate to. Unlike the big narrative arc that is typical of most movies, we get a collection of woolly, offbeat short stories featuring the same pivotal character. Which is great. <p>On the potential negative side, if you don't like fantasia, be warned: there are oodles of make-believe tricks and tropes, and by the time we drag to the supposedly reconciliatory finale, the deck is so stacked against reality that one needs a jug of cappucino to continue caring. <p>Not to mention that there are at least three British artists in the lead attempting a Southern drawl (with mixed results) in their accents. <p>Regardless, what's not to savour in a well-made movie with no problems that a better judgment in editing wouldn't have solved! <p>Recommended rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Most children start out their lives idealizing their parents in one way or another, and the pedestals are slowly hacked away, but sometimes a new one is erected. Growing up, Will (Billy Crudup) idealized his father, believing all of his incredible, tall tales of adventure - even including his own dramatic birth.<p>Now in his thirties, married and with a baby of his own on the way, Will must now tie up loose ends with his father who is dying of cancer.  Edward Bloom (as a young man, Ewan McGregor, present day portrayal by Albert Finney) seems to touch success everywhere he goes, not having much himself, but enriching the lives of those around him. His sweet smile and positive outlook make him not only an effective salesman of useless household objects, but a salesman of himself and his &quot;big fish&quot; stories.<p>Disgusted wih his father's apparent allergic reaction to telling a simple fact instead of a tall tale, Will has let 3 years pass without a word between them, but now must face the reality that time is now his worst enemy.  Will finally confronts his father, telling him, &quot;I don't know who you are.&quot; Will leaves in a huff, and going through his father's papers, begins to investigate the truth of his father's past.<p>As Will begins to unravel the tapestry his father has woven, he finds that &quot;not everything (he) has said is a complete fabrication&quot; as his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him... and some of the most unbelievable of his stories turn out to be very true, albeit sometimes a little exaggerated.  Will finds himself turning back into that young, believing child - rebuilding even a bigger pedestal to place his father upon - the opposite of what he expected.<p>It's easy to understand Will's resentment - his own mother, while not telling her own tall tales, never seems to be a voice of reason - expecting a young child to grow up not knowing what is real - her sole focus in life seems to be on her husband, and very little focus is on raising the little human they've created together.<p>Those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart-wrenching reconciliation.<p>Lots of light hearted moments and tongue-in-cheek scenes break what little tension the viewer experiences.  Some language a partial nudity make this unsuitable for young viewers, but compared to broadcast television, it is quite tame.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'; a mature fairy tale about a young man trying to understand the man his father truly is.  Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest; never overplaying his hand so-to-speak.  `Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.<br /><br />This is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The film revolves around Will and Ed Bloom.  Will has never really understood his father; in fact he appears to have a deep seeded contempt for him and the fact that he feels he was never allowed to get to know him.  This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.  When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.<br /><br />What he gets is...<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.  The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.  The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.  This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.  Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.  Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.  Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.  I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.  In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.  Jessica Lange is marvelous and touching as Sandra, Ed's wife, and Billy Crudup manages to make Will believable and relatable.  Recent Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard does a fine job with what little she is given and makes a lasting impression; albeit because she is stunning and possesses such unforgettable beauty.<br /><br />The immense cast of `fantasy' characters are all brought to life vividly as well thanks to strong performances by everyone from Helena Bonham Carter to Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi.  Alison Lohman does a fine job as the younger Sandra as well.<br /><br />In the end `Big Fish' is highly entertaining.  It is a fantasy tale that the whole family can enjoy and it manages to teach a beautiful lesson about family relationships.  This is also where that whole `anti-saccharine' element can be a minus.  What is great about `Big Fish' is that it feels honest and `adult' throughout, yet what I miss is that uncontrollable emotional connection that is supposed to overwhelm the viewer as the film draws to a climax.  If Burton had only kicked up the `syrup' for the ending, then I could feel this film was perfect.  There is a balance needed when doing anything, and while one does not want a film that is one big mushy mess we should never underestimate the value of some well positioned waterworks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, and more other talent than I can remember. But who cares? The story's the thing.<br /><br />If you set out to write something that takes no risks whatsoever, you can write a Garfield comic strip. Tim Burton could never do that. He takes risks, communicates his ideas, and makes you think. You must suspend more disbelief for him than any other director I can think of, but it's usually worth the effort. BIG FISH seemed to be faithful to a novel, and it also seemed to be quite slow at first. But it was laying the groundwork. You'll enjoy this strange movie, and you'll think about it after it's over.<br /><br />Oh, one of the themes on the surface of BIG FISH was that dad was a teller of tall tales, his son wanted to know the real him, and it was damn hard to sort the truth from the fiction. As I was editing RISING FROM THE ASHES, allegedly about my childhood, I had no idea what I remembered and what I made up. The stories we tell ourselves...</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This is an amazing adult fairy tale filmed by the ever impressive imagination of Tim Burton with several great messages contained within the disguise of an old man's dreams.<br /><br />Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying but he refuses to leave behind his tall tales about all of the situations he has encountered in his life. His wife (Jessica Lange) remains humored by her husband's fantasy life but is troubled that her son cannot seem to warm up to this extraordinary man. Edward's son Will Bloom (Billy Cudrup) has grown weary of his father's inability to deal with reality and is sick of hearing about oversized fish, perfect Southern towns, spectacular circuses, Siamese twins, glass eyes that see the future, haunted forests and gentle giants who don't exist. But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it. With flash backs to Edward's youth (played by Ewan McGregor) all the tales seem come to new life.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication. It shows the despair a child experiences when shadowed from the truth and the distance a father creates by telling tall tales hoping to make himself appear more than he seems. But it also shows the ties of a family never quite severed and so close to the core. With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well. This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability. At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace. Only Tim Burton could have managed to bring this book to life. For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments this movie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping. But in the end what is a tall tale? In a world of differences trying to understand another's reality may seem blurry at times but imagine the possibilities if we allow others to envision our most precious dreams.....Tim Burton opens up that other world so grab your pole and go fishing!</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Like the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in quintissential Burton style, Big Fish weaves together elaborate tales of witches, mystical towns, giants, a circus, conjoined twins and much more into a tale of magical realism.<br /><br />The film is based around William Bloom (Billy Crudup)- a frustrated young man who travels with his wife to visit his dying father Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) in order to try and patch up their troubled relationship. The cause of this is William's annoyance (and, one senses, jealousy) at his father's incredible gift for magical storytelling. The pair flashback to relieve fantastical, biographical elements of his father's life as a boy and young man. Ewan Mcgregor plays the young Edward Bloom with a kookiness and idealistic charm although at times he fails to come across with the necessary larger than life charisma that is required of the role.<br /><br />The central message of Big Fish is the posing of the question- is it important to tell the truth, or can beautifully told stories become part of a person's character and life as much as the actual events in their life? This exploration ultimately seems rather shallow in the end. The philosophical and psychological substance of the movie doesn't quite achieve the depths that one senses Burton aspires to.<br /><br />However the film is certainly worth watching- not least for the beautifully crafted cinematography, evocative backgrounds painting a magical, traditional small town American scenes and the subtle, bittersweet score.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's BIG FISH is essentially two hours spent hearing the stories of Edward Bloom, the sort of guy who, in real life, would be considered obnoxious and unbearable but, in a movie, is regarded as a quaint treasure. Bloom's tales of giants, circus freaks, werewolves, enchanted fish, enchanted towns and one-eyed witches in the mountains of Alabama are clearly fiction, though not really good fiction. In the film, his son is annoyed - looking to hear a bit of truth from his dad before Bloom drops dead.  All he finds out, unfortunately, is that his dad didn't stretch the truth all that much ... and, apparently, that the truth wasn't really important anyway.<p>Yeah, in a movie, it's supposed to be all uplifting. But I refuse to see Billy Crudup's character in a negative light just because he's the only one refusing his father's painful whimsy. If you were sitting next to Edward Bloom for a long period of time, too, you'd want him to stop talking nonsense, too.<p>BIG FISH, which all Tim Burton fans will rush out to see, is his most grounded-in-reality film, I suppose. It's got a clever group of actors who make the most of the material that they're given.<p>The main problem with the film, I guess, is that Burton himself is far more interested in the colorful world of Bloom's stories. Burton's never been very good at a connected, driven narrative, anyway. It's always been more style than substance.<p>Because of that, Burton all but ignores making the "real life" bits as good as the stylized "stories." And the two elements never really come together. Never is there a moment where we feel the character McGregor is playing becomes the character Finney is playing, and the film needs that.<p>It's pretty to look at, but it's a letdown.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book "Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions" by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell, at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however, Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others. It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be.<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes, where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker, a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, and singing Siamese twins. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of "Forrest Gump" and "The Princess Bride". Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable. Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is. Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of the senior Dr. Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work. The direction, however, is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant. This is an absolutely exceptional film.

The film is narrated in a very interesting way, it is divided in episodes, some of them show the current time, and some of them show the past of the characters. We are witnesses of the fantastic and supernatural adventures that Edward (the main character) lived in his youth.<br /><br />The young Edward, played by the charismatic Ewan McGregor, goes through the funniest situations, he meets a lovable giant, he goes through an enchanted forest, he arrives to a wacky town where everybody threw their shoes to the electric wires, he works in a circus packed with freaks, he meets a poet that has written only three lines in the past 12 years, he goes to the war and he meets the love of his live. And those are only half of his adventures.<br /><br />The cast of "Big Fish" is excellent, it's a combination between veteran actors (Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny De Vito), remarkable actors (Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi), and young talent (Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup).<br /><br />The technical aspect in "Big Fish" is another highlight of the film, the locations are very colorful, the visual effects aren't as pretentious and overwhelming as in other movies, but they are simple, realistic and effective and get the job done. The makeup and the costumes are also excellent. Finally, the music is outstanding, it combines classic tunes with the original score, written by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />It's a huge mystery why this film was so underrated and ignored by the Academy, it is much better than "Seabiscuit", for example. Anyway, "Big Fish" has it all: fantasy, drama, comedy, adventures, sad moments, tender moments, unforgettable characters, interesting situations, an all-star cast, in few words this is a little gem.<br /><br />The audio and picture in this DVD are crystal clear, and the DVD extras are amusing and informative, there are not too many extras, but there are really good. However, the DVD does include a valuable audio commentary, courtesy of Tim Burton. So if you like fantasy films, this is a very good one, "Big Fish" is a great addition to any DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>A good film, but the key part of 'Big Fish' rests in your belief that young Ed Bloom (as portrayed by Ewan McGregor) can become old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney).<br /><br />No way.<br /><br />I never for a second bought into that, and instead spent the entire time thinking about what a absurd leap of faith that required.  By contrast, Alison Lohman becoming Jessica Lange was a lot more believable...unfortunately, that connection is not as tantamount to the core story.<br /><br />Do you want to see a movie where the young-to-old transition works at a fascinating level?  Check out the 2001 release "Iris" where young John Bayley - as played by Hugh Bonneville - morphs into the eldery version played by Jim Broadbent.  You would *swear* this was the same actor playing both roles.  And, equally impressive, we get two very famous actresses - Kate Winslet and Judi Dench - playing young and old Iris Murdoch respectively to great effect and a semaless transition.  That's the gold standard for this technique in my mind.  'Big Fish' comes up short.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Big Fish is a fairy tale of a movie. Even though it's long, it never gets boring. The acting is good (even though the southern accents arent.) BF is a really enjoyable movie- it was better than I thought it'd be.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE A LOT MORE THAN 5 STARS."Big Fish" is my favorite movie, and will be until something better comes along.{Doubt it}. I am extremely impressed with this and think that Mr.Burton and I have much in common.I'm going to be a future author, and this movie is the same kind of idea of what I write about in books. Believe me, there is definetely something wrong with somebody if they've ever said they did not like this movie and is not changing their mind. One of my favorite characters is Karl the giant. I agree  with anyone that this movie didn't really have a plot to it, but at the end it seemed as though it sort of did. I guarantee most people will love "Big Fish". I do! {If you don't like this, something's wrong with you}.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is good enough for viewing and certainly more likely to be well received by older generations and/or people who have lost a parent.

I grew up in the South and have never heard of stories such as conjoined twins from North Korea, or a witch who'll show you your own death through a glass eye. My wife kept elbowing me in the ribs throughout this film. She couldn't believe someone could spin as much bull as I do. Well there's your proof. I don't see how this movie can be called 'moving'. I mean the son might have learned a lesson in that maybe his father was more than a teller of tall tales, but then again who wants to hear the story of one's own birth a million times whether it's true or not?</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; has been adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and directed by Tim Burton. This whimsical tale of a strained parent-child relationship is Burton's most personal film to date. It's a story of a son returning to his childhood home, where his father is fatally ill, in hopes of discovering the man behind the myth that his father has always cultivated. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is in many ways a family drama with typical family themes, yet its otherworldly elements lend the film a distinct Burtonesque tone and appearance.<p>Edward Bloom has been a personable man and a great storyteller all his life. His fantastic tales have been loved by all, no matter how much truth or myth they may contain. But ever since his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), was old enough to realize the stories couldn't be entirely true, he has resented his father's unwillingness to say things the way they are. Estranged as adults, Will visits his dying father (Albert Finney) in hopes of learning the truth behind the magnificent tales of Edward's youth and gaining an understanding of the man he has known only through elaborate myths.<p>Although &quot;Big Fish&quot; is telling us the story of Edward and Will's relationship, Edward, true to form, tells us his life's story in fantastic tales. So the film spends most of its time recounting Edward Bloom's life story as he tells it, with young Edward played with great charm by Ewan McGregor. These adventures are a visual feast and don't seem to compete with the film's present-tense father-son drama. The myth and the drama are blended seamlessly, much to Tim Burton's and screenwriter John August's credit. The faults I find with &quot;Big Fish&quot; are that some of its stories would have been more interesting told rather than seen, and the odd conglomeration of stories that constitute Edward's repertoire sometimes give the film  an uneven pace. It goes without saying that &quot;Big Fish&quot; is sentimental. It most closely resembles Burton's &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; in tone.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include two multi-part featurettes, which can also be viewed during the film by activating a feature called &quot;Fish Tales&quot;, a trivia quiz, and an audio commentary by director Tim Burton. When activated, &quot;Fish Tales&quot; displays an icon on your screen during the film's playback that will take you to the relevant featurette. The first featurette, &quot;The Character's Journey&quot; contains three parts, each focusing primarily on one of the film's characters: the young Edward Bloom, circus ringmaster Amos Callaway, and Will Bloom. The film's cast and director Tim Burton discuss the characters in interviews. The second featurette is &quot;The Filmmaker's Path&quot;, which has four parts. Tim Burton talks about the film's themes and inspirations. The production designer and effects coordinators discuss their role in expressing those themes. The fourth part, which is entitled &quot;The Author's Journey&quot; and features interviews with author Daniel Wallace and screenwriter John August, may be of interest to those who have read the book. &quot;The Fine Points: A Trivia Quiz&quot; is a game which allows you to view a short documentary about filming the circus scene if you answer the trivia questions. Tim Burton's audio commentary has an unusual format. It's an interview, so there is someone asking Burton specific questions as the subjects come up during the movie. This makes the commentary kind of low-key, but very informative. Burton talks about every aspect of the film, from its themes in relation to his own life to comments about the performances to technical details of filming. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French. There are two unavoidable previews on the disc.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Billy Crudup plays Will Bloom, estranged from his family and living in France when he is summoned urgently to his father's side. His relationship with his ailing father has long suffered from his father's love of absurd tall tales, which Will has interpreted to be a wall or form of distance between his father and him. He feels he has never known the real Ed Bloom. He agrees to come to his dying father's bedside in a bid to find out once and for all who his father was. Contentious relations aside, Will returns to hear the larger than life fish tales once more. The sadness of the story is bittersweet-otherworldly flashbacks brought to fantastical life by Tim Burton's unparalleled creative eye and the wide, bright, inviting smile of the ever engaging Ewan McGregor as a young Ed Bloom. Albert Finney's narration takes on new life when personified as such. Will's skepticism is eventually quelled as he realizes that these stories are who his father is, and when he finds out that there is some truth behind the hyperbole. He learns finally to love and respect his father, whatever his quirks. At once both whimsical and moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's visually stunning but a bit too drawn out fable Big Fish was actually more deserving of 3 1/2 stars.<p>Pretty boy Billy Crudup playing Will Bloom, a young married reporter estranged from his father Ed Bloom is drawn to his dying dad's bedside to understand the essence of his life.  The aged Ed Bloom played marvelously by craggy, jowly, veteran actor Albert Finney was a Alabama based travelling salesman whose life story consisted of a Forrest Gumpian collection of hard to swallow tall tales.  Crudup and his wife played by French actress Marion Cotillard are treated to a plethora of these fables narrated by Finney.<p>The young Ed Bloom played by the versatile and likeable Ewan Mc Gregor marches through many improbable life experiences supported by nice performances by among others, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and the weirdo Steve Buscemi.  Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman give creditable performances as Ed Bloom's wife Sandra respectively older and younger.<p>The movie loses some of it's luster as it plods on about 1 or 2 stories too long.  The ending is somewhat predictable which left my with a slightly vapid, unsatisfying feeling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>I've been a really big Tim Burton fan for a very long time. I love all his movies. Before I hit the theater, I know the movie was going to be a father and son one.....,but a weird one. The imagination of Tim Burton has been captured on film for all his films. The way he makes the movie all dark, and just....amazing at the same time is amazing. He is like one of my favorite director of all time, Better than Spielberg. This is a father and son movie and I would understand if someone cried during the film. I felt like crying. This is like the first really great fairy tale in year's...!!! What surprised me the most is that Rogert Ebert hated this film. As which Richard Roeper liked it. I guess Ebert got a little nuts since Siskels gone. Don't listen to Ebert, listen to Roeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Being a Burton fan, I wanted to like this better, but it never really clicked.  There are quite a number of wonderful scenes in "Big Fish," but stringing them together into a whole is a problem.  Albert Finney as Edward Bloom is miscast.  He doesn't seem to get a grasp on the character (very unusual for Finney), or at least doesn't harmonize him with the earlier version of Bloom - as played (wonderfully) by Ewan McGregor.  And without that key element, the movie doesn't have a heart - or least only half a heart. Still, this is an ambitious movie, and two stars seems low, but it's this very ambition that I think sinks the film.  It's crowded to the point of not leaving much of an impression.  (And it has more "guest" appearances than "The Greatest Story Ever Told."  If there's an actor you've missed seeing lately, check out "Big Fish.")  The movie runs in a million seemingly picaresque directions at once, ultimately leading me nowhere. I did feel the ending to be very well done, but by that time I'd lost most of my interest. My son's condemnation - every 10 minutes or so, seemed appropriate: "This is boring."</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Quite possibly the most overrated movie of recent times.<br /><br />Eclectric but not useful in any way. So far fetched that it was untraceable.<br /><br />If people believed this movie touched their hearts or some other part of their body, they may need help.<br /><br />As one who can handle fantasy and bizarre themes, I was expecting, at least in some part, a movie that could give me something.<br /><br />My only piece of empathy was with the son who had been lied to all through his life and could not pick fact from fiction. Everyone loves a dad who has a wild imagination and funny stories but here was a kid who still, in his 30's had never been in touch with his dad.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Take The Wizard of Oz and mix it up with Forrest Gump and you have Big Fish.  Tim Burton has made yet another film classic.  Take all his previous films (Batman, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands) and turn them all upside down.  This film had almost no dark scary places, and hardly no dark colors.  This Tim Burton film was like a burst of all the colors of the rainbow.  The effects, the acting, the score, and the cinematography were all superb.  Alongside Ewan McGreggor, Jessica Lange, Albert Finney, and Billy Crudup, stand an awesome supporting cast including:  Allison Lohman, Steve Bushemi, Helena Bonham Carter, and the always awesome Danny Devito.  This film is for everyone to see.  Go be taken away by Big Fish.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This "fish tale" is generally a nice story about a father who tells tall tales for years to everyone and has a son who has resented those stories, thinking his father was nothing but hot air. The big pluses for this film were the colorful scenes and the fact that is was simply a nice story.<br /><br />Since this is a Tim Burton film, it's no surprise that the visuals are so entertaining but it is a surprise that the story isn't a dark one. I guess that disappointed a lot of his fans but thought it was a Irefreshing change of pace from him, and I appreciated his effort here. It's the kind of movie many folks wish they made more of today.<br /><br />The fun parts of the film are not the beginning or ending but the middle in which the dad's stories are brought to life. There are some strange and fun characters. The story is a bit too much New Age/reincarnation mumbo-jumbo but the whole thing is so bizarre that you can't take anything seriously....except the father-and-son relationship, of course, which is meaningful. That may be a bit heavy but almost all the film is a lighthearted fantasy.  It looks great on disc, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's funny that despite films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands on his resume, Tim Burton is always known as director behind Batman and its sequel, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice, very dark gothic films. So it's quite surprise to see Big Fish, not only because it's tonally different but also cause it's good.<br /><br />Will is trying to figure out the kind of man his father is, only problem is his father is Edward Bloom. He's particularly known for telling wild stories to the point where they become just mere fairytale-like which is exactly what Will hates. So before Ed dies, Will wants to know his dad once and for all.<br /><br />In flashback mode, Edward as a young kid got a glimpse into his death by means of a witch with a magical glass eye. So he decides what anyone would probably do: go nuts and explore the world. His adventures find himself finding a colorful town, in the war, meeting the girl of his dreams from the moment he first saw her and being his own boss. He ends up meeting a wild assortment of characters including a really big giant, a Ron Jeremy look-alike circus runner and a poet.<br /><br />It's quite a change from film like Sleepy Hollow but his trademark visual style is still here. I think what sets this fim apart from other films with similar set design is that here it feels natural and not too flashy. Meanwhile something like Chocolate Factory where yeah it was really vibrant but it felt rather plastic oddly enough, as if it was designed solely to get a rise out of people. Here it falls in naturally.<br /><br />Acting-wise is pretty straight across the board. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney do great jobs as young and old Edward Bloom and always dependable and cutie Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange plays his love Sandra. The rest of them are kind of one-note but they're endearing anyway so we don't really mind.<br /><br />For people wondering whether it's worth the double dip if you have the original, ask yourself one question: do you want a book? Because that's pretty much what this release does that's different. It's a book filled with artwork. The DVD is essentially the same, probably right down to its packaging too(I didn't buy the old one).<br /><br />If you're a big fan of Edward Scissorhands, you'll probably get into this one. For all others, give it a try. Might surprise you.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>While some find this movie strange, I found it quite touching.  Yes, it is about fathers and sons and families and the way they hold things together with stories of various kinds.  And yes, each of us has more in our lives than even those closest to us really know as they have more than we can ever know.<p>Is it a great movie?  I don't think so.  However, I think it is a very good movie.  It never does come down on the hard edge of what all of this really means in each of our lives.  The movie seems to think it is enough to wrestle a bit with the way lies, poetry and truth fit together.  Well, that really isn't enough for a great work of art.  I did enjoy the poetry of it all and visually the movie is breathtaking.  But in a way it is cold in the way a post card is colder and more impersonal than your own snapshot even though it is many times more beautiful than what you were able to produce.  <p>We really don't get into these people terribly deeply except in one extraordinary scene where Ed and Sandra Bloom (Albert Finney and Jessica Lange) are in the bathtub in their clothes.  It is an amazingly truthful and achingly touching scene with barely a word being said about what is being communicated between them.<p>Ewan McGregor does a fine job as the young Ed Bloom and Billy Crudup's portrayal of the son, Will Bloom, learning that reality isn't quite as cut and dried as he had always thought.  It was wonderful to see Robert Guillaume again.  He does a fine job as the family doctor and has an important scene teaching Will Bloom a bit about the difference between facts and truth.<p>There are many other fine performances and I don't want to come across as being down on the movie.  I liked it a lot.  I just think there was one more level the director could have taken the movie to make the movie important instead of just touching and at times quite funny.  But by all means, see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>At the beginning of this film, I must confess that I was skeptical as to whether or not I really wanted to invest much time into it.  It seemed to meander, providing a fantastic, satyrical &quot;Burtonesque&quot; view of a world of askewed reality.  It seemed to meander some...the premise, a boy and his father, fallen out from one another due to the son's embarrassment at his father incredible stories, are reunited when the son learns that the father is dying of cancer.<p>The balance of the movie is told in vignette flashbacks, jumping from the present day narrative to the many incredible stories of Edward Bloom, the &quot;Big Fish&quot; of the story, whose tales stretch credibility to its limits.  The film, which is so definitely Tim Burton, is also more.  Although I was slow to pick up on it at first, I came to realize that the film was, in fact, a reflection on the complex relationships between fathers and sons.  It touches on the believable infallability we all have for our fathers as children, and the &quot;fall from grace&quot; of our fathers when we discover they are as human as we are.<p>Though the story provides plenty of whimsy, and at times, plays more like an episode of &quot;Amazing stories&quot; than anything else, at its core is a powerful story about relationships.  This is a bit of a departure from the standard Burton fare, whose narrative stories are generally pure fantasy, without a thread of realism to them...such examples include &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and even &quot;A Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.  This story is more human than any of those, focusing not on the fantastic, but using the fantastic stories of a father whose life was incredible without the tall tales to explore the psyche of a man who never knew how to fail.<p>In the end, this film is a great tribute to fathers and sons everywhere, and is a film worth sharing. With the approach of Father's Day, this might make for a nice gift to share with Dad, and more, it is an entertaining romp through the fascinating world of Edward Bloom, Burton's newest slightly-askew-but-ever-so-human hero.  <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>If you take The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and crossed it with Forest Gump, then you'll get a good idea of what Big Fish is like.  Tim Burton has always had a knack for taking bizarre subject matter and making a heartwarming movie out of it(like Edward Scissorhands).  Burton has certainly redeemed himself here after that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations!  Feel it, feel it!).  It's a whimsical, bizarre, funny fantasy with just the right amount of sappiness thrown in.  Some people might think the movie's just plain weird, but the human interest aspect of the story should overshadow the goofiness.  Interestingly enough, the opposite is true;  If you're too much of a man, the fantasy element is plentiful enough to make you forget about the touching father/son drama being played out.  Pretty well balanced if you ask me.  It doesn't look like other Burton films, most of this is in the daylight.  That's small potatoes coz his humor and style do still shine through.  I really hate to use this lame cliche, but this is a very good film for children and adults alike, though the adults are gonna get alot more out of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" is one of the more interesting movie going experiences I have had in some time.  The movie is well casted and acted, with the pacing and direction perfect.  Don't look for a complex storyline or big plot twist, because this movie really does not have much of a plot.  What it does have is a lot of heart, and characters you will enjoy spending 2 hours with.<p>Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) is dying.  As his son Will(Billy Crudup)comes to visit, Edward recalls lots of stories from his youth, about how he met his wife, his son's birth, different experiences he had, jobs he held, and so on.  Edward as a young man is played by Ewan McGregor.  His son has heard it all before and is upset because it is all make believe.  He hates that his father continues to fabricate these lies.<p>But the stories are magical and captivating.  Will's wife soon falls under the spell as she hears the stories Will has endured his whole life.  Every fisherman can tell a story about the "big one" that got away, hence the title of the movie.  The end of the film is not so much a development of the plot as it is a confirmation of it.  We suspected what we see, and we are happy with it.  James Thurber would have been proud.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>What an amazing movie!  William Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who is coming to terms with the impending death of his father Ed (Albert Finney).  Will has issues with his father because he is tired of listening to Ed's fabricated stories about his life.  We are treated to many of those stories in a delightful series of flashbacks featuring Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom.  The retelling of these stories leads Will to do some investigating, and he is finally able to understand what kind of a man his father really is.<p>The performances in this film are fabulous.  Ewan McGregor is hysterical, and his resemblance to Finney is kind of eerie (as is Alison Lohman's resemblance to Jessica Lange).  Helena Bonham Carter also delivers an outstanding performance in her dual role.  Tim Burton does an amazing job creating the magical world of Edward's imagination: the visual effects are astonishing, and the whole film has Burton's creepy &quot;edge&quot; to it.  <p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; is an amazing movie that is comical as well as sentimental.  I will never understand why it wasn't given an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I unfortunately never got a chance to see this movie while it was playing at the movie theatres and it's a real bummer because "Big Fish" is a really amazingly well done movie and one of the greatest movies of 2003. I was lured into seeing this film after reading and hearing all of the great reviews that this film got and let me tell you, this movie deserves all of the great reviews that it gets. Another thing that also made me want to see this was that it was directed by Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors. In fact, even as high of expectations that I had, this movie surpassed even those. <p> "Big Fish" is the tale of an elderly father named Edward Bloom. Edward and his son William have never really gotten along very well. Edward has told his son William about his eccentric and highly adventurous life during his younger years to his son when he was a child but William however found it to be too `fantasy-oriented' and wants to hear Edward's `real' story without resorting to talking like it's a `fantasy' world. After it turned into an argument the two became estranged for over three years but  Edward has fallen ill to a terminal illness and Will returns to see him and learn about his past. Flashing back into Edwards younger days, the movie showcases all of the fun not to mention outrageously adventurous things Edward did during his younger days. <p> This movie is just absolutely amazing but it's also a mix of tears and laughter as it's one of the most bittersweet movies that I've ever watched. Tim Burton who usually showcased his trademark with his generally macabre natured movies completely takes a U-Turn and replaces the Halloween styles with a more southern classic atmosphere and he as a result breaks new ground in his career and it works almost perfectly.  Burton on a directing note, hits another home run right out of the park on this movie as well. The story is just stellar and brings out incredible depth to the father/son dynamic.<p> The acting by the entire cast was absolutely stellar especially by Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom and also by Albert Finney as the much older Edward. The movie plot is just fun and not to mention heartbreaking yet funny all at the same time. It will leave you happy yet wanting to cry at the same time. This movie is so much fun and so emotional that I literally did not want it to end. It's that Good! <p> Quite frankly, this is one of the best movies of 2003 and I strongly recommend that you buy this DVD as soon as possible because it is worth the money and I plan on watching it at least 500 more times!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>There's a dreamlike quality to Big Fish, a kind of luminous, otherworldly tone that befits a story that skips from the incredible to the mundane like a flickering candle. In the end, it is a surreal, touching story--a darn good tear puller--that left me feeling a bit happier, and even a bit wiser.  Nicely done.<p>I must admit that I'd held off seeing this movie because I'd lost hope for Tim Burton.  His downright awful remake of one of my favorite films, Planet of the Apes, had turned me cynical and suspicious.  Was he, as it appeared, just a poseur--with dirty mop of unkempt hair and fat-framed glasses fancied by eighty-year-olds?  Had his successes been a scam perpetrated by a guy who'd fooled a lot of dim-brained Hollywood numbskulls?  Big Fish, if it truly is Burton's child (after the Apes fiasco, I must admit that I've not entirely disabused myself of the idea that Burton just put his name on this--but I digress), redeems him.  It isn't soaringly great, but it is truly well-done and enjoyable.<p>There are a few minor problems which I should point out.  Billy Crudup, who plays a son in search of his real father, is a very weak actor, and whether it's him or the role he plays, or both, he comes across as just plain unlikeable.  It's really too bad, since his role could have provided for an added bit of depth and resonance to the film.  Thankfully, his screen time is very limited--perhaps Burton, himself, judged that Crudup was too weak to merit a central place on the screen.  But for all of Crudup's weakness, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor give outstanding performances.  McGregor, who plays Crudup's father character as young man, shines with likeability and energy, the kind of person you meet rarely in life and who pulls you in with his joy and indefagitable innocence.  Finney is splended as a sputtering, kind-hearted yarn-spinner.  Jessica Lange is fine in her small role, and the young actress who plays her character as a young woman (Alison Lohman) is almost too beautiful to be believed--which adds, of course, to the ghostly, dreamlike quality of the film.<p>I really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!  It's gentle and provocative entertainment that is well worth seeing with the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>"Big Fish" may be Tim Burton's best film.  At the very least, it's his most underrated.  Everyone always talks about his concept work/production on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8P8">older</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729652">work</a>, but I'd argue that this is a more solid film than those.  Instead of comparing, though, I'll just talk about what makes this movie so great.<br /><br />The basic plot is this:  Edward Blood was never the best father, especially through his son's eyes.  He'd always tell patently false tales about his life, often hogging the attention with his fantastic stories.  Now, as he gets closer and closer to death, he recounts his stories to his son and his new daughter in law, in hopes that his son will finally come to know who he truly is.  This sort of story was perfect for Tim Burton, because he gets to finally flex his creative muscle and pull it in multiple ways, since the "telling stories" parts of this movie make this more like an anthology than a straight film.  Burton's over-the-top style often seems like it is just TOO much in some of his films, but his direction was perfect for this movie.<br /><br />It's a whimsical, heart-breaking, fantastic fairy tale for adults.  Not in the dark way that people often assume "for adults" means, but what I mean is that the themes in the story are very much about growing up, what it means to be a man, and the pain and joy and terror of getting old.  A lot of it is silly, but certainly in a good way.  This film is funny, quirky, weird, beautiful, tragic, and hopeful--much like life itself.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Tim Burton is such a predictable director of films that even when, on the surface, he seems to be stretching himself, he's actually merely distorting art towards his own relentlessly immature aesthetic. In a sense he's the dark filmic counterpoint to Steven Spielberg's gauzey light pabulum. Neither has a fundamental grasp of what it is to be human, nor the essence of a good tale. Quirkiness does not equal interesting. If you doubt that you must find Tourette's sufferers fascinating rather than annoying.<br />  Big Fish is TB's attempt to do `adult' drama, yet it so desperately tries to rip off the best in other films- even less successful ones like Forrest Gump, a tale similarly set in Alabama. Along with that film's everyman-ness Big Fish tries to channel the warmth of My Dog Skip, the father-son dynamic of October Sky, & the rites of passage feel of Stand By Me. While it does not succeed as well as the aforementioned trio this is a good movie. Yet, dammit, with another director this could have been a great movie, certainly alot better than Burton's previous bests- the flawed but interesting Ed Wood and Planet Of The Apes. Instead, it's maybe just a little better. It's like when you see the goddess of your dreams but she turns out to be an Anti-Semite, smoker, or lesbian.<br />  Let me remove myself from despair & give you the capsule tale: an old talespinner- Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying and his son, Will (Billy Crudup), wants to know the reality behind the stories that so charm everyone else- including Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard). The last few days of Ed's life give way to flashbacks and fantasies. The young Ed (Ewan McGregor) has all sorts of adventures: he meets a giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), discovers a Utopian town called Spectre, befriends a witch, catches an elusive legendary big fish, and joins a circus run by a werewolf named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). He joins the circus to get information on the girl of his dreams- the young Sandra (Alison Lohman) who's engaged to his childhood nemesis. Later, he becomes a military spy and rescues a pair of gorgeous Chinese Siamese twins named Ping and Jing from the Red Army.... Still, this is overall a good film- there is a wonderful sequence where young Ed 1st sees Sandra and time stops. He walks through hoops and juggler's balls fall to the ground as he walks by. This is a great sequence because it does simulate that feeling, but we've seen the time-stop before. What makes the scene a winner is that, to compensate for that momentary sensation, time has to speed up. Doing so causes Ed his opportunity to meet and woo Sandra for a few years.<br />  This is truly unique, but- alack- the only instance of using fantasy to serve a narrative purpose, and not just be `ooh-ah' fantastical! That TB only does this once in the film confirms it was a happy accident, not an understood exercise of filmic control. Still, the acting of Finney and McGregor is superb, as are the other supporting performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Based on a book by author Daniel Wallace, Tim Burton's Big Fish embodies many components of a typical Burton film--fantasy, odd characters, imagery, mystical settings--yet, in this instance, it does it with a Southern flavor. The film's main crux is a father-son struggle, and we see them struggle between what is a tall tale and what is truth, what is fact and what is fiction, and what is reality and what is exaggerated. The son, Will (Billy Crudup), has had to listen to his father's tall tales for years, and he believes that this has created a rift between he and his father for years, and that he doesn't know who his "real" father is behind all these fantastical tales. Edward Bloom, who reminisces into the past with tall tales, has many imaginative adventures, including a walk through supposedly haunted woods, an encounter with a witch and a giant man, joining a traveling circus, and trying to get the girl of his dreams.<br /><br />Tim Burton's capacity to create symbolism, eccentric characters, colorful scenery and depth in this story help to make it an exceptional film. One of the more telling points of the film is when Bloom, as a youngster, goes through a dark path to find the town of Spector, a sort of Utopia, where everyone stays because they never want to leave. Bloom decides that it isn't right for him to be there, and, while leaving, he promises a young girl that he will come back to the town sometime in the future when he's "meant to" come back. While here, he also meets a struggling poet (Steve Buschemi), who he later winds up helping rob a bank. Later in the story, he realizes why he must come back to this town.<br /><br />What I also enjoyed about this film is that there wasn't just an emphasis on plot and imagery; there is also some depth. Some life lessons that the son must learn are to appreciate those close to you and to have faith in something that seems far-fetched or implausible. When learning of his father's decline in health, the son attempts to tie those bonds that have kept them at a distance. He learns that truth and fantasy are closer than he thinks.<br /><br />This is a unique film, with some beautiful scenery, exceptional casting, and interesting storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Big Fish is one of the best movies I have seen recently. This is a great drama/fantasy film that almost had me in tears more than once while I watched it. Ewan McGregor and the others did a fantastic in this film. It was good to see Steve Buscimi in the film as well, since I'm a fan of his.<br /><br />Like always, the scenery and the places that the story took place in looked amazing, almost like a fairy tale world within the mind of Tim Burton. This fit in well for this story since the entire film is like watching a modern day fairy tale come to life. I was very surprised with how good this movie was, this has definitely become one of my favorite movies that I have seen recently.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Director Tim Burton has never really made a film quite this sentimental before and after seeing Big Fish he was long overdue. This film is a very touching and enchanting tale about a father and son trying to mend their paths. Ewan Mcgregor is very impressive in this movie, he just seems to shine with optimistic purity. Albert Finney as the same character in the dusk of his years is equally affecting. The only weak link is Billy Crudup who is very wooden and dry, but the film works nonetheless. There is a magic in Burton's best works, and Big Fish is definatly one of these. Even if your not a regular Burton fan check it out, it may surprise you. If you are a Burton fan and haven't seen it then what's your excuse?</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Who can deny about the originality and underground gaze of this filmmaker? Burton is the true authentic storyteller whose imagination has overcome the standards. From Beetlejuice through Batman I, The sleepy hallow to this trip plenty of visual elegance and arresting and captivating images all along the movie.<br />Supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son. The father to my mind represents the same Burton, where imagination and reality are blended, so the limits between what's the official story and what was dreamed is difficult to definite.<br />His son grows surrounded of legends and half truths and when his father to just one step from dying. He decides to rebuilt all his father's life trying to find and establish the truth from the legend. The fish and the wedding ring is a special life lesson that will be revealed at the end. But the kinetic camera and the ravishing journey behind the great love of his father, the impressive sequence with the huge yellow narcissus carpet will be the mute witness for the materialization of that expected love.<br />Burton through this extraordinary metaphor, and visibly inspire by the magic realism -Think in Alejo Carpentier and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez-, invites us to think and reflect about the love for the little things, to see far beyond the meaning of the things by themselves and the importance of the imagination as the true essence of a better existence. Of course there is a heartfelt homage to Wizard of Oz, in the thirties, Rene Clair's Beauties of the night in the fifties,  Mary Popins in the seventies Fellini' s Amarcord and The clowns, of the seventies, Petersen's Never ending' s story, of the eighties  and Jean Pierre Jeunet's the city of lost children of the nineties.<br />The cast is impressive Finney steals the show as the dying father, Ewan Mc Gregor as himself in his youth and the fabulous Helena Bonham Carter shines in her secondary lines with her enigmatic beauty and supreme talent.<br />Sumptuousness, and poetic rendition.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Big Fish is a terrific film that, once viewed, will leave you scratching your head as to why it was noticebly snubbed at the 2003 Academy awards.  It's GREAT, inventive, and packs an emotional wallop.<br /><br />Big Fish is the story of a family, essentially.  The father is a notorious teller of tall tales, and his son has had his fill of them.  The father is in his final days, and the son comes home at his mother's urging, hopefully to help bridge the gaps in their relationship, and to maybe help the son 'get' his father, who he can't understand.<br /><br />In typical Burton fashion, this movie has visuals that can be larger than life.  However, in context of this story, it works SO well, as the backstory for a man whose life itself may be larger than legend would have is perfect.  The set design and cinematography lend such a surreal quality to tales that may or may not be tall.  It provides a world that have just enough realism to keep the audience wondering 'Hmmm...maybe he's NOT exaggerating.'<br /><br />By far, this film is Burton's best work yet.  I've found Burton throws people into two camps, 'Love him' or 'Hate him.'  This is definitely a middle of the road Burton that can easily be watched by non-Burton fans, because the story of Father-son estrangement is universal, and Burton's storytelling gives the highly emotional subject enough whimsy to make it enjoyable, but never loses the powerful emotions of the characters and should easily move the most hardened heart with it's interesting examination of parent/child relationships.<br /><br />This really is a can't miss addition to one's collection, and I can highly recommend it to those who like films with emotional punch and stories that make you think.  An added bonus, is that you will find you need to rewatch it several times to pick up subtle nuances the tall tales tell.</p></br></body></html>

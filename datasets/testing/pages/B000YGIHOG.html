It only works if you don't think too long on certain aspects of the film, purposely designed for reaction, not contemplation.  But.  There was a lot to question (plot-holes, if you will).  And it was these craters I kept falling into, saying to myself, wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.  The greatest example of this is returning people to a segment of London, supposedly clean, while just a few blocks away there were still bodies lying around.  Health issues aside...how do you keep people from roaming into unsanitary areas (which they didn't, two strayed)?  The BIG question being, why the rush to return people to an unsafe area, other than providing the story with a very convenient reason for mayhem to follow/continue.  AND, how did the dad (Robert Carlyle) happen to have the unerring knack of finding them no matter where there went/hid?  That went well beyond convenient and into the arena of being just a plot ploy.<br />I was also a little put off by the obvious distain for Americans, the military in general, by the filmmakers.  It wasn't necessary to the plot so one suspects a little bias on their part.  I wanted action, not political commentary.<br />The gem of this piece had to be the candlelight dinner sequence in the dark house that abruptly turns into mad flight in a blast of daylight.  That, and the helicopter showdown.  Wow.<br />So what's next, 28 Months Later?  I'd buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />More of a follow-up than a true sequel, 28 Weeks Later nonetheless does what good sequels should do: it stays true to the spirit of the original while doing something new; an engaging and stylish horror movie, 28 Weeks Later doesn't break new ground like the original did but it offers a compelling ~100 minutes and offers allegorical connections for those who care to look for them.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Months have passed since the rage virus descimated England. The infected have all starved to death, and the threat of future infection has been eliminated. Now, the US, under UN authority, has set up a green zone in the heart of London where survivors and those who were away during the viral holocaust can begin new lives. Eventually, England will be re-populated, the terror will be a distant memory, and the world will rejoice. OOPSY! Something's gone wrong! An infected has somehow survived and infiltrated the green zone! How could this be? All precautions have been taken. All proper procedures followed. The military is in complete control. In spite of all this, the rage is spreading again! Chaos and anarchy have replaced order and civil structure! The whole thing has come apart! Our new utopia has been destroyed, leaving a seething hell in it's place! Hope has been devoured by hopelessness and insanity! The infected have escaped the green zone and are rampaging once more! It's alright, the military is doing it's best to stop this renewed plague! Don't worry, I'm sure the UN is already working on a new and improved plan! Nothing can possibly go wro...</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Let me say right off this film is creepy as hellz, it's sort of has a low budget feel, which makes it seem very real.  It's amazingly violent and from the start you know your in for a disturbing ride.  At times, the violence seems gratuitous, and one scene where one of the main characters attacks the other is really disturbing.  For what it is, it succeeds, frankly if you looking for a creepy apocolyptic horror film you'll probably be pleases, but otherwise you might out to skip this or be forewarned, you may have trouble sleeping afterwards, it's that creepy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>In a genre where sequels fare poorly, this exceeded expectation.  The movie starts 28 weeks after England was ravaged by the virus in 28 days later.  The US army has taken control of the country, the zombies have died out, and folks are slowly repopulating.  The writers put a stronger family element than most zombie flicks.  Of course things don't go well, and there's a lot of sprinting away from the bad guys.  The movie's pace is very quick and it's over before you know it.<br /><br />The downside are plot holes bigger than you could imagine.  There's a lot more of "What are they thinking?" than usual - despite the genre.  That said, I'll see 28 Months Later if they come out with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I had mixed feelings with this movie.<br /><br />The first 40 minutes or so was nothing but one clumsy (and confusing) segment after another.  The scene involving a man running to his boat while these fast-paced zombie-like creatures chased after him was more confusing to watch than it should have been.  There was so many unnecessary rapid movements in the camera shots that I could barely tell what was going on.  After all the fast-moving shots were over, you then saw that the man finally escaped on the boat and was free.  It was really awkward.  Sometimes action scenes can move TOO fast, and this is a great example of that.<br /><br />After the 40 minutes of boredom in the beginning was over, the story finally became to pick up (and so did the action scenes).  From there, the virus that was infecting the people and making them go crazy began to become the main focal point of the story.  The actual virus was disgusting to witness, with the people quickly shooting blood all over the place as they banged their heads repeatedly against the walls.  Quite unrealistic though, and just exciting for the violence only.<br /><br />This resulted in these snipers who were on top of buildings at nighttime aiming directly for the kill shots to eliminate the creatures, and therefore, getting rid of the virus and preventing it from spreading.  This was the most interesting part of the entire movie.  Actually, just the fact the snipers were so accurate with their shots was pretty scary itself!<br /><br />None of the storytelling aspects were interesting that involved any of the main characters.  The older girl and the younger boy were both pretty forgettable.  Overall, just a decent movie for people who want to see these new and improved deadly zombies that can move as quickly as people can, and just an alright movie and nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I was in the minority of hardcore horror fans who found 28 Days Later to be a huge disappointment for a number of reasons, but I have to say that 28 Weeks Later is a much better film than its predecessor. I still can't see how any horror fan could rank either film as among the best zombie films ever made, though - there are just too many problems in evidence.<br /><br />It's been six months since the "Rage" virus outbreak in Britain has been contained, and some civilians are now being allowed back into London - into a highly secure sector tightly controlled by the American military. You don't get in without a thorough medical examination, and the military are everywhere, from boots on the ground to eyes in the air to snipers on top of buildings. Yep, nobody's getting in or out of this place without authorization. Nothing could possibly go wrong here. Not even Houdini could possibly manage to evade all of this security.<br /><br />The movie opens quite effectively, with a group of survivors holed up in a house having their dinner ruined by a full-scale onslaught of zombies. In a scene that forces you to wonder what you would do in the same situation, Don (Robert Carlyle) cowardly leaves his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) behind order to save his own ass. When his kids Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) arrive back in new London from wherever they have been, he gives them an edited version of their mom's death. Now, you would think that two kids, one of whom is almost an adult (not to mention exceedingly hot), having already lost their mother to the virus, would never even dream of leaving the safety of their new home to wander out into the forbidden zone. Of course, you would also think that this tightly secured zone would at least have a gate or something to prevent that very thing from happening. Alas, no. Something potentially good actually comes from their escapade, though, as a survivor is found who is seemingly immune to the virus raging in her system. Now, you would think such an important medical subject would be watched and guarded more closely than Fort Knox, yet someone easily waltzes into her room, does something really stupid, and becomes infected. Once the authorities figure out what has happened, they immediately go to Code Red and lock the place down. Civilians are huddled into "secure" areas - unfortunately, just turning the lights off doesn't do much good if you're going to leave a door to the place all but wide open. Can you see a pattern here? Too little too late doesn't even begin to describe the security problems in evidence all throughout this film.<br /><br />Anyway, the second half of the film consists of a race for survival, as Tammy, Andy, and a few others run for their lives from both the increasing numbers of brand-new zombies and the military forces out to exterminate them and everyone else in the infected sector. This is where the film really hits its stride, throwing numerous scenes of blood, explosions, and carnage at the viewer. It's good stuff, no doubt about it - not to mention timely. As the film's few good characters fell by the wayside, I cared less and less about those who remained (especially the annoying boy). I still consider the first film the gorier of the two, however, mainly because there are far less zombies vomiting up blood all over the place in this sequel.<br /><br />The ending of 28 Weeks Later obviously lays the groundwork for a third film in the series, so expect a question or two to go unanswered here. While I was not anxious to see any sequel to the disappointing 28 Days Later, the improvements seen in this film give me hope that a third movie would definitely have potential. The "less plot, more action" approach so in evidence here indicates to me that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo recognized the extent of the plot problems inherent in Danny Boyle's original film, so the third time might truly be the charm.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>I Liked this one as much or even more than 28 days. The movie here focuses on the aftermath of the rage virus, pikcing up the pieces where 28 days left of. The movie starts 28 Weeks later when around 1000 odd english citizens are allowed to return back to London but they are confined to stay in a military guarded and protected block of the city called sector 1. The story develops as one of the infected from outside the sector is brought into the sector as the subject does not show sypmtoms of rage virus but it is later found that the subject is immune to the virus but is neverthless a carrier of the virus. Unlike the previous one by Danny Boyle which aimed at more of a cult clasic or film noir style and pretty much focused on 5 characters against an army of zombies, this one is more centered on the emass infection of people  and we also get to see the role of the army as a overseeing body which protects the people and also kills those very people without compassion following strict military orders when there is a chance that they have been infected. The zombies are portrayed with greater movement and agility and ferociousness than in 28 days.There is also more blood and gore. The direction is spot on keeping the tempo up and the tension pulsating. The Soundtrack follows the same grunge metal theme which acts as the coda for the diseased and hopeless london.The movie sustains interest because it paints this grand canvas of large scale infection seen and experienced through the eyes of a family. Robert Carlyle is the father of this family and it is about him and his two daughters and his wife and what happens to them along the way.  I won't give away more than that. The spanish director of this film is really good and this is his first movie in the English language. This guy is going to make a lot of good movies. He is that good. He's a made a sequel that stands up to the predecessor.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>Hard to beat the original for a fresh zombie take; This film starts out with one of the best opening sequences since the remake of Dawn of the Dead; And while the film rarely comes close to reaching the same level of intensity as those first few minutes, there are many different scenarios that arise that are close; Carlyle does what he can w/his limited character, as do most of the actors; The sense of character development from part 1 is lacking, but there are still plenty of harrowing zombie moments for those interested in the genre and looking for a solid horror effort. I just wished Danny Boyle had directed this...who know what would have happened then!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely fantastic, and is without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies to date. The gore is even nastier than before, and it's even more action-packed than the original. While I may like Resident Evil: Extinction more than this zombie movie(it's so damn good! how can anyone hate a work of genius?), that doesn't mean that I can't stop loving this movie. The story basically picks up after the events of the first movie, except it's different characters in this movie, and as you would expect the infection comes back(though I'm not going to reveal how it comes back). If you loved 28 Days Later, you'll love this gory horror show.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>'28 Weeks Later' is as good, if not better than '28 Days Later', so its probably 4 and a half stars for me. Right from the opening scenes this will have you hooked. Robert Carlyle as Donald Harris is holed up in a remote house with his wife and some other survivors. This immediately brings 'Night of the Living' to mind, and '28 Weeks Later' can certainly be compared with that ground breaking film.<br /><br />There are a number of brilliantly realised set pieces in this film. One near the start and another that hinges around a plot twist, which you might see coming, but I didn't. It also has some genuinely creepy moments , most noteably in the London Underground, where frankly I didn't want to watch (but had to). The acting is all of a very high standard and the Director has done a fine job recreating the sort of post-apocalyptic feel that the first film had.<br /><br />My only real criticisms are that sometimes I found the fast-cutting a little too fast for my liking, but maybe I'm just getting old. Also there is a rather unlikely scene near the end which seemed a little contrived. However the actual ending was very good and certainly left the producers an opening to make another film. That would be a mistake though, because overall this is cracking film that any subsequent sequel would undoubtably fail to match.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>i give it 3.5 stars. 28 weeks later is not a bad film, but this one plays more like an action flick than a horror. the only problem i had with the film was that it kinda felt like they rushed production ( dont know if that is true or not) but all in all still a good flick needed a bit more horror than action. more gore than the 1st. if u are a fan of these films then  check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Yet one more commentary on man's folly, 28 WEEKS LATER brings us back to that place of stark, stark terror and dead end fortunes: London. It's 28 weeks later, and things look to be safe now for the repatriation of a desiccated city. Fifteen thousand civilians have already been allowed to move in again, under the watchful eye of the U.S. Army. But one survivor turns up who is found to be immune to the rage virus, an immense discovery which could potentially lead to a cure. But it's a double-edged sword, as this survivor now also becomes an Infection carrier - as everyone soon horrifyingly finds out. So, 28 weeks later, it all begins again.<br /><br />No, this one isn't as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>, which set a new and stylish benchmark for horror. 28 WEEKS LATER, while sleek and scary and shot with vitality, doesn't quite give off that same vibe of bleakness and hopeless inevitability. This one also has a faster pace and more action. But both 28 DAYS LATER and this sequel aren't about saving the world or finding a cure. No, they're about sheer survival, about getting the eff out of Dodge without getting mangled or bitten or gouged or snacked on. And it's about fighting as hard as you can for your loved ones and friends. Because of this, these films tend to affect us more on a personal, primal level. These panicky, desperate characters resonate more with us. We're no brilliant scientists or superheroes out to save the day; we're basic blokes trying to make it out alive. And these films, they'll slug you in the gut.<br /><br />The premise unerringly targets one fear within us all: fear of the virus, whether it's the flu virus or the plague or, heck, even a computer virus. There's just something so frightening and debilitating about an infection which leaves us helpless and which could spread so widely, rapidly, and exponentially and seemingly has no cure. The monsters here aren't really zombies in the old-fashioned sense. They don't crave to munch on your brains. Instead, they're fueled with an unquenchable and mindless rage. They'll run you down and catch you and inflict massive pain and intolerable violations upon your person. If they happen to munch on your brains, it'll probably be accidental. Another factor which punches up the horrormeter needle is that the Infected aren't slow or shambling like your grandfather's zombies. Instead, these are savage, bestial wackjobs who chase down their victims with electrifying alacrity.<br /><br />Don't look for the characters in the first film; they're not here. The focus instead is on a tiny band of folks, which includes a sister and her little brother (who also might be immune), a military medical officer, and an intrepid Army sergeant. As they struggle to flee to safety, they not only must elude the murderous Infected but also the military, whose mandate has been drastically elevated to Code Red, which basically means that the fit's hit the shan and now all civilians are considered lost causes. These kinds of films, I really hate it when I find myself pulling for a character. I know the odds are my favorite might buy it at any given moment. It's doubly chancy when you happen to like a lot of them. Those four I mentioned? I liked them all. It's a pity.<br /><br />You get caught up in the oppresive mood of the film. First of all, the chilling, driving score will make certain of that. And the very good and willing cast won't let you down, either. I started getting that edgy, crawling-under-the-skin feeling right from the opening minutes, and when that knock rapped on that door, brother, I was already yelling at the screen: "Don't you open that bloody door!" But of course they did. Then come the first bits of horror. But don't get the impression that it's all remorseless terror and jugular veins getting munched. There are let-ups and times for winding downs, fleeting though they are, and, admittedly, there isn't much respite in the latter half of the film. But juxtaposed with the bloodletting and -curdling are moments of serenity and sweetness, as when Andy and Tammy motorbike it back to their home and we get to enjoy the tranquil, eerily empty streets of London. But, of course, that's only to set you up. There are several disturbing and graphic scenes and a harrowing sequence staged in a pitch dark, subterranean setting, with a rifle nightscope as the sole means of vision.<br /><br />A bit now on the special features, which are actually worth spending time on: there's the pretty interesting audio commentary by the film's director and producer, both of whom share co-writing honors; 2 deleted scenes (a cafeteria scene and Andy's fractured subway dream) with optional commentary; the 13-minute-long "Code Red: the Making Of" featurette; "The Infected" featurette- (7 minutes long, and you get to meet the Infected movement advisor); the "Getting Into the Action" featurette (7 minutes); 2 so-so animated graphic novels: Stage 1 -"Development" (7 minutes long - featuring Warren and Clive, who, while attempting to invent a rage inhibitor, unwittingly give rise instead to the Rage Virus) and Stage 3 - "Decimation" (4 and a half minutes long - two humans in an Infected-populated London battle it out); and, naturally, the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />An expert exercise in evoking goose bumps and night chills, 28 WEEKS LATER might also leave you a bit depressed and maybe even wrung out. But in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>here we go again, with this deadly virus that turns you into a flesh eating, fast as hell, nasty looking zombie. this is a look at the aftermath. people trying to restore some order after all the chaos in 28 days later. some survivors in a quarantined location. everything looks like it's going to be okay, then...something unexpected that reintroduces us to the deadly virus. IT'S BACK!! then all hell breaks loose and once again it's everywhere. everything is out of control it seems that nothing or no one can stop it, or can they? who knows, but one thing i do know you definitly have to watch this sequal. one of the good ones. i give them props, and it's good enough to watch again and again. very real, and an eye opener because you never know what and when somethings could happen. another look at the human race on the verge of extinction, and what we as humans do to survive, or some do just to simply eliminate the problem. sometimes things aren't so simple. the first one was impressive, and this second one leaves you wanting more. very well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>There's gore galore, gallons of blood, lots of screaming and running, plenty of aerial shots, and an apocalyptic feel to this movie.  However, you can tell that the original director is not at the helm.  Also, much of the action is repetitious rather than necessary for the plot.  As well, the military does such stupid things that you cry out for a smart civilian (like a movie reviewer?) to give them some advice on what to do with these raging people and the innocent uninfected ones.<br />In a really stupid move, someone ends up spreading the disease to France by the end.  Dumb soldier!  Dumb! Dumb!<br />Too bad that the always-pleasing Robert Carlyle is compromised so soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>28 Weeks Later provides a worthy sequel to the original 28 Days Later, and maintains the same frenetic pace, music style, filming look, and edge-of-your-seat thrills that were provided by the original. It doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The filme begins with a great scene which is assumed to have happened at the same time as the original movie. We find Don, Alice, and several others attempting to squeak by in life, scrounging on what they can, hiding in a dank, dark basement of an inner-city cottage of sorts. The windows and doors are boarded up; no light gets in. They don't want those infected by the Rage virus to realize that "normal" people are inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, they are discovered, and their quiet, safe cottage soon becomes a source of carnage and chaos. Don is forced into self-preservation mode when an infected person is placed between him and his wife. What makes the decision especially difficult is that Don is right next to an escape route. An exciting start gets even more interesting when Don decides to abandon his wife and make a break for it.<br /><br />As he makes his way out of the cottage, he looks back to find his wife screaming for him, and looking at him through a window. The anguish is written all over his face as his wife is taken down by the infected, but he continues to make his escape, running as fast as he can. Naturally, he begins to get chanced by the infected, and a great fear of someone being chased is realized: open fields with no escape route are not the preferred location.<br /><br />After Don's escape, where he has to yet again make a decision to leave someone behind and display the truism in today's cynicism, the movie ties up the loose ends of the original. The British Isles, just as Jim and that soldier who was chained up along with him suspected, have been quarantined, and the Rage-infected people are left to die of starvation. Well, 28 weeks later, the world decides that the outbreak has contained itself, and the time has come to rebuild society on the British Isles.<br /><br />The cleanup effort contains all you would expect: a large military presence, burning of bodies, reconstruction, creation of order, and repopulation. The U.S. Army and its NATO allies hold strict control over the logistics and the mission. It's still not safe, and only an isolated area of the island where the majority of the cleanup has occurred will be inhabited. Most of the repopulation is comprised of those who were off the island at the time of the original outbreak, or at least those who made it off.<br /><br />Don is placed in this location as a manager of a building of sorts, and his children are part of the repopulation process. We're shown the happy reunion and we find out that the children were in Spain when the Rage outbreak began. It's only a matter of time before his children, Tammy and Andy, ask about their mother, and Don, naturally, lies to them, telling them he tried to help her but the Rage-infected people got her. He sells it really well, though, and they believe him.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Don, the movie had to progress, and the Rage had to reappear; otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie. So, naturally, Don's children escape the quarantined zone to travel back home. There are some items they want to get, specifically a picture of their mother, so that she is never forgotten. It turns out that their mother isn't dead, and Don, as well as involved scientists, have some 'splaining to do!<br /><br />It turns out that the mother has the Rage virus, but is somehow immune. This tidbit of information should have been passed to Don, because he clearly wants to make amends, explain himself, and be "close" to his wife. And, thus, the outbreak begins anew.<br /><br />From there, disorder and confusion ensue, with the military unsure how to handle the rapid spread of the virus, especially when fueled by a frantic, scared, panic-stricken population. The military is forced to go into a "Code Red" situation, and that is almost always a bad thing for the bad guys. "Code Red" in this movie means using a sledge-hammer to kill a fly, and the military does a pretty good job of killing the fly. It's just too bad that it's not 100% effective.<br /><br />As a result of the slight military inadequacies, we find a cast of survivors, which include the children and their doctor, as well as one of the Army snipers, running to the safety of a helicopter extrication at Wembley Stadium.<br /><br />The film ends on a somber, downtrodden nature, as we see the helicopter, which has presumably crashed, in Paris, France, and the Rage virus has spread off the British Isles.<br /><br />It's a worthy sequel, with much of what made the original such a cult classic. The only real negative that I can mention is that there are parts of the movie, in the director's effort to convey the incredibly frenetic post-outbreak chaos, that have very shaky, unstable, even distracting filmwork. It's as if the filming was done during an earthquake and there is absolutely no stability. Otherwise, the style, theme, sound, feel, and if possible, even the smell makes the viewer think of the original, and in that effort to be true to the original, this film is a resounding success.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later" put an interesting twist on the Zombie Film genre, namely that the zombies technically weren't dead; they fell victim to a virus that turned them into raging, animalistic monsters. And they actually ran after their prey as opposed to ambling along like drunks, moaning and groaning all the while. But despite the prominence of blood and guts, the effectiveness of that film depended more on the human drama, centering on an isolated group of survivors trekking across the British countryside. For the most part, the same formula is followed for "28 Weeks Later," which is probably why it works. The only difference between the two films is that this one is larger, with more characters, more violence, and more gore. Does that make it an inferior film? No, not really--surprisingly, it remains on equal ground.<br /><br />The film opens during the middle of the original crisis. A small group of people barricaded in a rural cottage is ambushed by the Infected. The only escapee is Don (Robert Carlyle), someone the audience will have trouble labeling as either good or bad. On the one hand, the fact that he abandoned his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack), and left her for dead doesn't put him in a good light. On the other hand, any one of us would probably do the same thing when thrust into such a desperate situation. It's all about survival; it's no longer about love and commitment.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward six months. The American military has since stepped in and successfully decontaminated and reconstructed an isle directly adjacent to London; twenty-four hour electricity has been restored, as have hot and cold running water and supermarkets (they've also reopened a pub). Fifteen thousand people populate the area, with more survivors arriving everyday. The two most important survivors are siblings Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), Don's adolescent children. They're absolutely delighted to be reunited with their father ... that is, until they learn that their mother is gone. Worried at the prospect of forgetting all about her, they decide to sneak out of the safety zone and pay a visit to their old house.<br /><br />Once there, they discover that their mother is still alive. She's then examined by the American military; as they feared, she's infected with the Rage Virus. Yet she doesn't show any symptoms, which leads Medical Officer Scarlet (Rose Byrne) to believe that Alice is carrying some kind of antibody. Could this mean that a vaccine is on the horizon? Maybe even a cure? Unfortunately, no one will ever know; a series of mishaps reintroduces the virus to the population, resulting in pandemonium. The military is forced to execute Code Red, which states that everyone must be exterminated whether or not they're infected.<br /><br />The rest of the film is effectively frantic and fast paced, focusing its energy on Andy and Tammy's fight for survival. At this point, Scarlet realizes how important the siblings are; if their mother carried an antibody for the Rage Virus, chances are at least one of the children does, as well. This is quite an interesting reversal: the siblings' love for their mother essentially made them responsible for reintroducing the virus, and now they may be the only ones who can stop it from spreading. This shows a complexity and depth that's rarely present in a horror movie, and it takes on greater significance during some of the film's more gruesome scenes. Example: gunning down innocent people proves too much for Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a dedicated military officer. In a direct violation of his orders, he decides to help Tammy and Andy escape.<br /><br />But for the dedicated Zombie Film fanatics out there--the ones who could care less about such complexity--you can rest easy knowing that this film contains plenty of frightening, blood-soaked moments. I'll be the first to admit that it's a lot of fun to watch; that's half the appeal of a Zombie Film. But make no mistake: "28 Weeks Later" completely avoids B-movie territory, allowing believable drama to get through to the audience. Even in the midst of violence, gore, and terror, the audience can feel the emotional turmoil toying with the characters, even the ones that aren't as decent as they appear to be.<br /><br />The film works in other ways, as well. I distinctly remember a scene near the end of the film with Scarlet, Tammy, and Andy in the London Underground. It's pitch black; Scarlet relies on her night vision scope to help the siblings move along. They try to avoid stepping on the dozens of rotting corpses littering the floor. The intentionally amateurish nature of Scarlet's point of view solidified the scene, allowing the audience to actually feel the tension along with the characters. This was the most frightening scene of "28 Weeks Later," and it alone shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing. It's quite original as Zombie Films go, cleverly balancing sheer terror with drama. And yes, it also has a lot of cool makeup effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>A watershed film, Boyle's "28 Days Later" was a gripping hybrid ... a zombie art-film. Boyle showcased his talents as a world-renowned director while creating a work that left cosmopolitan horror-enthusiasts in awe. Aside from the gorgeous cinematography, "28 Days Later" recognized the original intent of zombie-film: to act as social commentary. "White Zombie" (1932) and "Revolt of the Zombie" (1936) set a historical tone for zombie-film which was somewhat lost after Romero's trilogy. But Boyle revived the zombie-film in 2002 ... giving zombie-fans and academics a reason to love zombies again!<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" has Boyle's fingerprints all over the film (he was, in fact, involved in some of the directing): 1.) Robert Carlyle is cast in a lead role (you may know him as Begbie from Boyle's "Trainspotting," 2.) the soundtrack is a continuation of John Murphy's original score (in fact, I heard variations on the track "The Tunnel" throughout the film,) 3.) it uses Boyle's trademark bridge-shots, and 4.) it employs Boyle's use of a digital format.<br /><br />The film itself is fast-paced, action-heavy, and extraordinarily tense. It is shocking and gripping. Unlike "28 Days Later," the film opens with a "weak" but sympathetic character who is trapped in a heinous lie ... which ultimately leads to the second outbreak. It is an "edge-of-your-seat nail-biter." Quite literally, I never heard one audience member utter a single word through the duration of the work. It offers not a moment for reflection ... it is completely relentless. Perhaps not until the drive home will you decide if you liked the film or not ... or even begin to process it.<br /><br />Now, it must be said that there were some failings. **SPOILERS** Foremost, the recycling of thumb-through-the-eyes assault was less an homage to the original than a needless repetition. Second, while Boyle's "28 Days Later" delivers the horrific tales of Infection through narration (Jim was comatose throughout the spread), this film actually shows the audience the carnage in close-quarters. While some may find this thrilling, many will find it gratuitous. To clarify, when asked to name the bloodiest horror-film of all-time, people inevitably say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ... but Hooper's film is a virtually bloodless work. What's the relevance, you ask? On-screen violence tends to be less potent than the violence an audience member IMAGINE. (Which is why Nispel's remake of "TCM" was a critical failure). Moreover, the conclusion can be predicted in the first twenty-minutes of the film which may leave you a little frustrated. (But it's still a great conclusion!!) Finally, while the soundtrack echoes the original film, the attention granted to the first film was lacking here. "28 Days Later" had a cutting-edge appeal: including "God Speed You Black Emperor" and excerpts from Faur&eacute;'s "Requiem" (namely "In Paradisum") on the same soundtrack was brilliant!! I wish there was more diversity in this new work ... instead, with one exception, the soundtrack is a rehash of the instrumental work from "28 Days Later."<br /><br />Still, the attention to detail is fantastic!! Something for which to watch ... note that when Doyle selects a horse on the carousel, he chooses one named "Zed." "Zed," as you know, is the British word for "Z" ... and is often used as a way to refer to zombies (see "Shaun of the Dead" and "World War Z"!!) Just a neat homage to other zombies films and literature!!<br /><br />While the film lacks the character-development of the original, it is ambitious and exciting. Though it can never compare to the original, it will not disappoint!! It is, by all means, a five-star zombie-film!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's film was done in such a way that a sequel was almost bound to fail. Their film was a horror movie alright, but it was really an exercise in experimental filmmaking. Any film that was to follow it up will have to contend with the cool factor of not just a twist on the zombie theme (even they are not zombies) but the choice in music and look of the film. All I can say is that 28 Weeks Later doesn't disappoint and even surpasses the original film in certain aspects.<br /><br />Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a great job of trying to stick to the premise begun by Boyle and Garland in 28 Days Later and adding his own signature to the sequel. The film begins with a scene which encapsulates what someone who never saw the original film needs to know about what to expect with this one. We're introduced to Don (played by a gaunt and quite haunted Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) trying to survive with several others at their English countryside cottage just outside London during the first couple weeks of the Rage-virus outbreak. This prologue shows just how tenuous any form of safe haven can be once sentimentality overrides the primal instinct for self-preservation. Don is given a choice of choosing sentimentality to try and save someone he cares about and maybe die in the process or follow the basic need for self-preservation in time of extreme danger and distress. Don picks the latter and we're shown how horrible his choice was but at the same time how plausible a decision it was when put into context. If we were put in a similar situation could we honestly say that we wouldn't had made the same choice which Don took. The scene with Don running across the open field with dozens upon dozens of Rage-infected people chasing after him was quite chilling.<br /><br />The movie goes through an introductory credit sequence explaining the timeline since Don's escape from the cottage. We're told that the British Isles was quickly quarantined once authorities saw how futile it was to try and save it from the ravages of Rage in the first couple weeks. Following-up on the final scenes in the original film, we know now that those infected by Rage would soon die out due to starvation and that 28 weeks after the first sign of outbreak the world outside of the British Isles have decided that it was now time to clean out the last vestiges of Rage-infected victims who haven't starved to death and begin reconstruction and repopulation of the country. The U.S.-led NATO force in charge of this monumental project is led by U.S. Army general Stone (The Wire's excellent Idris Elba) and have cordoned off a safe sanctuary in London's Isle of Dogs where British citizens who escaped the initial outbreak or were outside the Islands when it began would be housed in while London was slowly sanitized.<br /><br />This is where Don has been sent and given a job as a manager helping with getting London back on its feet. We're shown the arrival of Don's two children who were safely abroad in Spain when the outbreak first hit England. Their reunion is heartfelt though bittersweet as Don must answer his children's questions about what happened to their mother. Let's just say that Don's explanation is not exactly accurate. The Tammy and Andy (played by newcomers Imogen Poot and Mackintosh Muggleton) take his answers at face value but still end up sneaking out of the protected Green Zone to get to their old cottage to pick-up some items of sentimental value. This is the only part of the movie which seemed implausible and made me realize that once again a horror movie ended up with some characters doing dumb things that would lead to nothing but death and destruction. What the two kids find once they get to the cottage marks the beginning of re-infection and the extreme policies enacted by the military to contain the problem. But containment doesn't hold and soon enough a Code Red order is given to all military personnel.<br /><br />It is once the Code Red is given that most filmgoers will see the allegorical similarities of U.S. policies and tactics in their War against Terror, especially in Iraq. While I do not prescribe to this notion, Frescadillo handled the situation well. I say I do not prescribe to the notion that the second-half of the movie is a direct condemnation of U.S. war against terror and occupation of Iraq, because it's a theme in apocalyptic movies that's been used before there was a war on terror. It is in this second-half where 28 Weeks Later reminded me a lot of George A. Romero's underappreciated horror film, The Crazies. Just like in that film, the military in 28 Weeks Later don't seem to be heartless about their reaction to the new outbreak and break of containment. Instead their overreaction to the whole deteriorating situation looks to be born more out of desperation and an inability to comprehend the best and most humane way to combat the crisis. As it's always mentioned in other forms of fiction, the military is a blunt instrument and never a subtle one. The Rage infection and those infected seem to only be stopped when using the most blunt procedures and tactics, but such ways also have a tendency to cause much collateral damage to the innocent.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is much more epic in scope that 28 Days Later and it is in that which it surpasses the original film. While the first film is more the lives of two disparating groups of survivors and how both groups attempts to survive shows how quickly one could fall from civilized behavior while another continues to hold on to it, the sequel shows that in the end even people with the best of intentions will succumb to the basic instinct of survival with any means necessary. The established shots of London overhead and down on the ground empty and lifeless really brings the apocalyptic nature of the movie with the force of a sledgehammer. These scenes followed up with the firebombing of Canary Wharf really highlights just how much more grimmer and nihilistic in tone and scope Fresnadillo's sequel over Boyle's more hopeful one. It is quite a surprise that its the actions of the youngest and most innocent (as children are usually protrayed in horror movies) which causes a new cycle of outbreak and ultimately the fall of the attempt to bring normalcy back to the British Isles.<br /><br />I would say that --- even though the movie doesn't really involve zombies but zombie-like people --- 28 Weeks Later actually resembles George A. Romero's Living Dead films more than Boyle's 28 Days Later. While Boyle's film took some of its basic themes from Romero's work, he still didn't go far enough. Fresnadillo took the theme of humanity being more dangerous than the Rage-infected ones during the original film's third act and expands on it with 28 Weeks Later. There's a deep sense of pessimism and cutthroat survival instincts inherent in the film's themes. The only form of humanity to be seen actually comes from the same Americans whose attempts of reconstruction ends up an exercise in total annihilation of the problem even if it includes the innocent being destroyed in the process.<br /><br />As a sequel to 28 Days Later, Fresnadillo's film shared some stylistic and thematic qualities with the original film, but ends up becoming a wholly independent work (one could watch this sequel without having seen the original and still understand what was going on). Where the original film only touches the surface of the Rage virus doomsday effect on the British Isles and its population, 28 Weeks Later ceases that basic notion and gives the viewer a first-hand look at its aftermath and, later on, how it looks when an outbreak occurs in an area packed with survivors. For a fan of Romero's classic zombie epics I do prefer Fresnadillo's work and the look of his film over the original one, but he does sacrifice some level of characterization to keep the film's tone and frenetic pacing in the latter-half from being bogged down. The film ends on a really downbeat note even as survivors make it to safety. This film really becomes an exercise in nihilism more than what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were willing to do with the original film.<br /><br />In the end, 28 Weeks Later brings over enough of what made the first film such a cult, and later on, a mainstream horror success to be considered a sequel that matches the first one in quality, and at times even surpasses the original in certain aspects. The acting is actually very good despite some characters not being fleshed-out more thoroughly, but I find this understandable to keep the frantic pace of the film from start to finish from being slowed down. For fans of the first film I don't think this sequel will be a disappointment. It may not reach the same creative heights for some fans but it surely won't ruin the experience of having seen the original. The film also introduces a new face to the genre world with the excellent work turned in by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In addition to Alexandre Aja from France and now Fresnadillo, the world of horror is getting a nice infusion of young talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>...comes arguably the best zombie movie ever made. 28 weeks later is great in almost every way shape and form, blowing the god awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> out of the water. The first ten minutes alone were scarier and more action packed than 28 days in and of themselves (and let's not forget that in those opening 10 minutes we see more infected than we see in the entire first movie).<br /><br />Set 28 weeks (duh) after the original infection the US army has declared England free of infection and has begun moving British refugees back into the deserted wasteland that once was the British Isles. A kid named Andy and his older sister are the first children to arrive back in England and are happily reunited with their dad who managed to survive the original outbreak by being a really big wimp (really, you will hate this guy). the army has managed to set up a safe zone, where civies can live (almost) normal lives while, while at the same time continue to clean up the thousands of dead bodies lying all over the place in London (by the way, where did all these bodies come from when in 28 days latter we didn't see any in the streets at all?).<br /><br />Anyway, after about thirty minutes of gawking at all the dead bodies and military build up, we finally get introduced to the infected. A woman is found that carries the rage virus but doesn't suffer from its symptoms. Hurray, now they can finally find a cure for the virus. But... of course the virus manages to break out, call it bad security and horrible luck, but it does. At this point the movie really starts getting good, with tons of gore (oh my god, there wasn't anywhere near this much gore in the first movie), action, and scare your pants off moments. The infection spread like wild fire, and this time WE GET TO SEE IT. Remember in 28 days when that one guy that gets chopped up by the black girl explains how he was in a crowd when the infection spread and that the only way to get out was to go up? Remember? Well that scene is played out in this movie and boy is it creepy. Its great to see how one infected person, just one, can infect hundreds, no, thousands of people. It spreads so fast that in a matter of hours the military is forced to fire bomb the city and use chemical weapons to stop its spread.<br /><br />If you like zombie movies than you will love this one. It beats Romero by a mile (blasphemy I know, but just see the movie) and puts to shame everything else. Finally I got what I wanted to see, a zombie infection as it spread. No other zombie movie I can think of showed the spread of the plague anywhere NEAR as good as this one did. One minute everything is all hunky dory and the next BOOM, everyone's dead, and all because of one person. Wow.<br /><br />So if you like action, see this movie. If you like gore, see this movie. If you don't get embarrassed when others hear you gasp in horror, see this movie (and if you do, just see if by yourself). This is the zombie movie of the century, beating out the Dawn of the Dead remake, Romero's Land of the Dead, and the first 28 movie. I would even go so far as to say it's the best zombie movie ever, period. so if you like zombies, and I'm sure you do if your reading this review, than drop whatever it is your doing and go see 28 weeks latter now. I know the first movie was trash, but this one isn't. if you read this review, please leave a comment.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was a surprisingly great horror treat, and 28 Weeks Later is no different.  Picking up six months after the events of the first film, 28 Weeks Later centers around the United States military helping restore the mainland of Britain after the rage virus has been wiped out.  Cowardly father Don (Robert Carlyle) is re-united with his children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) while everyone else tries to get back to normal.  Unbeknownst to everyone though, is that Don's thought dead wife (Catherine McCormack) is not only immune to the virus, but has become a carrier for it as well.  As you can no doubt guess, it doesn't take too long for things to get very, very bad.  Though I was a little apprehensive upon hearing that Boyle and original writer Alex Garland were only on hand as executive producers, my fears were put aside when the film kicks into high gear during it's opening sequence.  The cast is more than solid, and features Jeremy Renner (SWAT) as a heroic sniper, Rose Byrne (Danny Boyle's Sunshine and FX's Damages), Harold Perrineau (Lost, Oz), and an all too briefly seen Idris Elba (The Wire) as the stoic General Stone.  The gore ante has also been considerably upped from 28 Days Later, with some impressive and brutal effects.  All in all, 28 Weeks Later is a stunning sequel that surprisingly manages to live up to (and in some cases top) the original film, and is more than worth checking out for horror fans, zombie fans (normal or running), and fans of the first film alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>A very good zombie film, it even surpasses its predecessor, the very worthy 28 Days Later. Directed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the movie starts 28 weeks after the first film. With the first outbreak apparently ended, an American led military force arrives at the deserted London (in a not so subtle allusion to the occupation of Iraq), securing certain areas and allowing English citizens who have been abroad during the outbreak to return. Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance. Robert Carlyle does a fine turn here as a survivor of the first outbreak who becomes infected here (and the opening scene is great). Intelligent, very bloody, entertaining, what more can you ask from a horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>. . . and doesn't let you go until you turn into a snarling zombie!

Not for the squeamish, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"28 Weeks Later" picks up where "28 Days Later" left off.  The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic.  One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures.  Or was she?  Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness.  Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.<br /><br />Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore.  Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum.  That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in "Night of the Living Dead" back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme).  The one innovation the original "28 Days Later" came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on.  Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy filmmaking style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience.  Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole.  And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats.  Even the undead can have fun with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>This is the second time this year that a sequel has called on US soldiers to fight off monsters.

It was a watchable movie but I would not rank it as one of the best horror movies of the year. Come to think of it, 2007 wasnt really a great time for horror movies. The only two movies I thought were worth watching was The Mist and 1408. Dont believe the hype though, this movie is alright but the first one was better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>28 Weeks Later boasts a fantastically intense opening sequence, and with it a promise of a relentlessly paced thriller. And director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo delivers exactly that. Outdoing the intensity (and certainly the gore) of its predecessor, the sequel retains much of the jumpy scares and all of the terrifying zombies, but focuses more on visceral action and horrifying violence, and brings a welcome unpredictability to its frenzied survival story. 28 Days Later you may fear those corrupted by chaos. 28 Weeks Later you will fear those infected by Rage.<br /><br />Twenty-eight weeks after the initial Rage Virus outbreak finds London occupied by the American military and a heavy quarantine in place. Those that survived begin to rebuild their world in seclusion, and after several months of no sign of the virus and all those originally infected dead to starvation, hopeful tranquility appears to return. But such serenity was not meant to last, and when a father with a dark past is reunited with his children, tragic events unfold that rapidly lead to another outbreak of the Rage. Once again an epidemic of voracious zombies threatens London, and those trapped between the ruthless military and their drastic precautions will find little solace amongst the carnivorous abominations that roam the streets.<br /><br />When 28 Days Later premiered, horror fans the world over praised it for its new breed of zombie with a familiar penchant for human flesh, but also a new, extremely aggressive and violent temperament. Combined with an enhanced agility and speed, Danny Boyle's unique twist on the undead fiend became far more terrifying than Romero's original design. While Days used his vicious creatures almost as a backdrop for the more diabolical workings of his corrupted military, Weeks takes full advantage of these cannibalistic crazies to produce some truly shocking horror scenes. The opening sequence perfectly outlines just how deadly the infected are as they overwhelm the small group of survivors and dispatch them in a quick and brutal fashion. From there each encounter becomes even more panic-inducing as Fresnadillo utilizes several ingenious tension-building devices, from the shaky handheld cameras to the foreboding music. One standout scene finds the protagonists in a pitch-black subway station with the only light source being a sniper rifle night-vision scope. In a wonderfully chaotic moment all hell breaks loose and we are witness to a riveting fight for survival where we feel as helpless as our heroes thanks to Enrique Chediak's camerawork and the frantic editing.<br /><br />With the increased zombie screen time comes a far higher level of blood and gore and both are handled well to enhance the gravity of the survivors' plight. Throats are torn, eyes are gouged, and heads explode to reveal a sadistic amount of bloodletting that will have gorehounds cheering and the squeamish fleeing. Partway through the film a helicopter decapitation reminiscent of Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror can be found, but here it's no longer an over-the-top splatter of body parts, but rather an exercise in some truly horrific bloodshed.<br /><br />Though different in focus from its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later builds upon Boyle's original concept to create a terrifyingly appropriate sequel that carries on a series of horror films that redefines the zombie. No more are the shambling, brainless denizens of the night - here the undead possess an unparalleled speed and ferocity that only the most heavily armed (and fortunate) can hope to escape. Arguably superior to the original, 28 Weeks Later is a triumphant return to a remarkably frightening world lost to both those in power and those immune to it, where death can descend upon you in the blink of a bloody eye - if you're one of the lucky ones.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Ah, what better way to spend 3 1/2 hours than watching bloody projectile vomiting in high-def?<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by Stephen King's The Stand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169530">The Stand (Signet)</a> where a deadly virus escapes a secret government facility and obliterates the world as we know it, Director Danny Boyle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting</a>  and writer Alex Garland (rumored to be involved with the film adaptation of the video game Halo...sweeeeet!) take the killer virus theme to the next level in 2002 with 28 Days Later.<br /><br />28 Days opens with what happens when animal activists go wild. In a short, violent sequence we see how a voraciously contagious virus that turns people into raging lunatics gets released into society. Flash to pre-Scarecrow Cillian Murphy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a> waking up  several days later in a hospital bed after most of the rest of society has been affected by the germs. (Coincidentally{?} we see this same beginning to a world gone mad in two other recent zombie-type stories: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582406723">The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXZL04">Resident Evil / Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> ).<br /><br />Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world. And it turns out that Murphy and the folks that he bands up with need to fear more than just 'the infected'. 28 Days is frightening, suspenseful, thrilling, disgusting, realistic, emotionally-charging...all the ingredients in the Horror genre that make up a Classic.<br /><br />Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.<br /><br />28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud "PUNG!!!" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect. (Only Blu Ray offers DTS; standard version will still knock you out of your chair with the Dolby 5.1 option.)<br /><br />28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.<br /><br />It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.<br /><br />Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Well...<br /><br />It was with a lot of anticipation that I went to see 28 WEEKS LATER - specially because I believe the first film, 28 DAYS LATER, was a genuine new look at the beloved Zombie genre.<br /><br />But I got a little disappointed with this sequel because it does not offer much. The synopsis looks promising: weeks later, the original infected people on the UK dies... and the country is declared safe. So it is up to the British living abroad to come home and start again. And we meet this guy who has two kids (who were abroad on a school trip).<br /><br />Suddenly, they find his wife (who apparently got attacked and died on the prologue). But she is fine... because she is immune to the disease. But she does has the virus... and it is only a matter of time until the whole thing starts again.<br /><br />The problem with 28 WEEKS LATER is that the audience does not bond with any character. There is nobody there for the audience to empathize with. I feel some lack of focus in those characters... and the whole film becomes a escapist time-passing.<br /><br />It was exactly the huge investment in characters that made the first film so good. But here... It's all missing.<br /><br />That is not to say that there are not great moments. The intro (when the guy loses his wife) is well paced... the scene where the helicopter decapitates (oh, yes!!!) a group of infected is fabulous... and the best sequence is when the survivors drive away from the military dodging poison gas clouds on the streets of London.<br /><br />But that's it.<br /><br />Also... this film contradicts one interesting element presented in the first film. I remember (on 28 DAYS LATER) one character saying the infection had reached other countries. That does not seem to be what we see here.

I felt a bit better about this after hearing that the reason for both was time issues/contractual obligations (both were involved in the much-anticipated Sunshine when this got off the ground). So they brought in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) to both co-write and direct. I was still a touch leery walking into the theater, but the end result is that the movie was not as good as I'd hoped-- but a great deal better than I expected.<br /><br />We start off with a group of survivors holed up in a cottage at the beginning of the outbreak (if you saw the original, the opening scene happens, presumably, while Cillian Murphy's character is still in a coma). Two of the people stuck there are Alice (Catherine McCormack) and Don (Robert Carlyle). During dinner one night, there's a pounding on the door, and they admit a young boy (Gary Robert Kelly's favorite actor, Beans El-Balawi). Unfortunately, the infected are hot on his tail, and you can guess the rest. Don escapes. 28 weeks later, the repatriation of Britain begins, and Don's kids Andy (the similarly wonderfully-named Mackintosh Muggleton in his first screen role) and Tammy (V for Vendetta's Imogen Poots) are reunited with him. But, as you know if you've seen thirty seconds of any trailer to the film, maybe they were a bit hasty in bringing people back to the island...<br /><br />The good news is that Boyle did, in fact, act as second unit director, and directed a few scenes. The bad news, which isn't really so bad, is that it's pretty obvious which scenes they are. While the behind-the-scenes stuff they've been showing on TV singles out Boyle's direction of the opening scene, there are a few others scattered throughout as well. Boyle's adrenaline-rush jump cuts show up now and again, and there's an almost eerie similarity to the first film in those scenes. This is helped along by the fact that the producers used, for all intents and purposes, the same soundtrack John Murphy came up with for the first film, but without the silly happy synthesizer stuff that popped up now and again in that one. (And no uncredited Godspeed You Black Emperor! tracks this time round, either.) That said, Fresnadillo is a strong director in his own right, and he holds his own here. The story is less epic than the first one, with the focus squarely on Don and his kids, along with two army officers who try to help them escape the new outbreak of contagion. This could have easily become a weakness, with such a simple storyline, but Fresnadillo turns it into a strength. There are a lot of places where he could have branched out, and frankly I'd have liked to see some of them, but he kept focus throughout. He also didn't make the usual sequel mistake of showing the monsters too much, sticking to Boyle's original jump-cut plan when the infected get screen time (which is surprisingly little, actually); you get flashes, but with one ugly exception towards the end of the movie, we never get the whole "let's unveil the monster in all its glory" wankery so common in horror films with big effects budgets. (And even in the exception, he keeps it to a minimum and still uses the close-ups that make the infected so scary in the first place.) There were a few times I wished Garland had written the script, but Fresnadillo and his compatriots (who include the BAFTA-nominated Rowan Joffe) did well, for the most part.<br /><br />The one truly weak point in the movie is that it's all set up very conveniently. You have a basic idea of what's coming from the first big plot twist (or, if you're more observant than I am, about ten minutes into the movie). That said, Fresnadillo still has a trick or two up his sleeve for the big payoff at the end of the movie, and oh, the payoff is so very, very worth it. Everything's set up nicely, and then Fresnadillo and co. sweep everything we think we know off the table.<br /><br />Now, I know there are a few people who aren't going to like the sequel no matter what because it's a sequel, but in general, if you liked the first one, I think you'll get a kick out of this one, as well. Certainly worth paying matin&eacute;e price for, even if your matin&eacute;e pricing just skyrocketed like ours did. ****</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>There's always that extra obstacle to conquer when making sequels, for the lovers of the first movie the second needs a reason to exist, it has to be real, strong and carry the story further than one could have imagined. I really enjoyed "28 Days Later" because I got to see it in a half empty theater with a friend, and it felt so real and brutal that I walked out with my knees shaking. Then I saw this movie at home and while it still made me cringe I don't think that it was the lack of super sized screen that made the movie feel smaller than the first, somehow as good as it was there were flaws to it that made it hard for me to give it more stars.<br /><br />Overall I'm glad I saw it, it was scary, bloody, gross, there was lots of close run ins and plenty of super hungry, super fast infected zombies but the little things that allowed the outbreak spread again made me shake my head in disbelief. At one point I was laughing (the scene in the dark at the stadium escalator) because it was so ridiculous and then I was flabbergasted at the bad decisions, like the new kids who arrived at the cleaned now London sneaked out to get something from their old home even thought it was forbidden to leave, they simply took this dramatic stance against everyone's safety as they opened the portals to hell for everyone else. I was surprised to see who was the main carrier of the virus and then who spread it to everyone else, I know the zombies were fast but the so called safe army guarded compound was like kindergarten during an Easter egg hunt, the infected ravaged anyone they pleased and it seemed that even all those weapons and precautions didn't do much to stop the spread.<br /><br />The movie looked good, I liked the eerie and forlorn mood and it was a good chunk of horror watching on a rainy Sunday but the little bits of stupidity that well, allowed for the sequel to exist were little too much. At the end it left me feeling depressed, so I guess goal accomplished! Not bad but not the greatest although worth the watch for horror fans. I am guessing that if there is another entry it will be called 28 months later, now that would be interesting to see...<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I'm always weary of horror sequels...they usually just don't cut the mustard (Loved "The Ring" but its sequel was miserably bad!).  This sequel lives up to its entertaining predecessor and may actually be better than the first!<br /><br />The story picks up six months after the virus ravaged London, with a couple (played by Catherine McCormack and the talented Robert Carlyle) who are living with a group of survivors in a boarded up home.  Soon, however, their quiet hideaway is attacked by a group of blood thirsty "ragers" and Carlyle's character shows his true cowardly nature, leaving behind his wife to be killed and saving himself, above all others.<br /><br />When we next see (Carlyle) he is being reunited with his children in an area sanctioned off by the US government and Nato.  With snipers set up to watch the safe zone and giving complete medical exams to clear the returning citizens, the project looks to be a successful attempt to eradicate the virus infected zombies and the virus itself.  But when the couple's two children escape the safe zone, return to their old home and find their mother, still very much alive, the virus returns.  Though the mother doesn't exhibit the signs of the zombies, she carries the disease and can still transfer it, setting a course for the return of the blood spewing zombies.  However, the mother, because she is genetically immune to the symptoms (and possibly her children as well) is an important key in fighting the virus and the chance of truely stopping it from spreading.<br /><br />Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job of following the lead of the first director but upping the action a bit for the second go around. Robert Carlyle does a great job as a very flawed man who will do anything to survive, including turning his back on his own family.  This is a great horror movie, a good summer action movie and definitely worth seeing!  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>28 Weeks Later / B000TJBN80<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />The tricky thing about sequels is that not only do they have to be good movies in their own right, but they also must weather the inevitable comparisons to the movie that it follows. And, fundamentally, this is the biggest problem with "28 Weeks Later". Following, as it does, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BZJCM">28 Days Later</a>, but with seemingly everyone who was involved with "28 Days" completely replaced, it was inevitable that the resulting sequel would have a largely different tone than the first movie. Whether or not this change is a bad thing will depend on the viewer's expectations.<br /><br />"28 Weeks" starts well enough - a group of survivors are holed up tight in a country house, far away from the cities and the rage virus. It's nice to see variety in a zombie movie, and the ensuing demonstration that frightening situations needn't be restricted to the dead of midnight is welcome. Viewers may reasonably question, however, why the otherwise apparently fairly prudent occupants of the house didn't take a few more steps to ensure their safety in this new, uncertain world - such as emigrating permanently to the second story, which seems to be more than roomy enough (shaky camera notwithstanding) and which - once isolated from the downstairs - would seem to be a permanent safe-haven from the rage victims, given that they aren't lucid enough to scale walls or build ladders.<br /><br />While this may seem like a small point, I feel it neatly underlines the changed between "Days" and "Weeks". The survivors in "Days" were modern 'real' people - in other words, they'd seen a zombie movie or three (as have we all) and subsequently they knew how to protect themselves. Flats barred with impenetrable walls of shopping carts, iron doors, and suits of makeshift armor were the refuge of the besieged in the city. The army out in the country employed round-the-clock shifts, mine fields, and a very prudent once-bit-then-shot policy that prevented serious disaster when one of their own was infected. The point behind all this is that "Days" was not a zombie movie in the traditional sense, but rather a movie about human nature under stressful, end-of-the-world conditions. Realistically, you could have replaced all the zombies with, say, nuclear fallout and you still would have had the same haunting themes in "Days" - namely, where our humanity begins and ends in a struggle for survival.<br /><br />"Weeks", on the other hand, is pretty much a straight-up zombie movie, and in order to facilitate that, the humans have to be a lot less competent than they were in "Days". So we have desperate people failing to fall back to a secure upper story and a military with such poor security measures that it seems almost blind luck that they haven't been overrun yet. (Which isn't to say that "Weeks" doesn't attempt a point at military ethics, but the civilians-are-expendable message is so anvilicious compared to "Days" that it will likely annoy more than thoughtfully provoke.)<br /><br />Once you accept "Weeks" as a straight-up zombie movie, it's not a bad one. There's a living MacGuffin that has to be tracked down, protected, and gotten to safety once the inevitable disaster overruns the safe haven. The biggest problem here, though, is that the build-up to the disaster is long and tedious, with quite a bit of dialogue that sounds like it was meant to be deep and meaningful, but just comes off as the filler dialogue we've all heard before. And once the dying starts, the characters die off so predictably that they might as well all be wearing numbered jerseys.<br /><br />I guess you could say that I really loved "28 Days" because I went into the movie expecting a good, solid zombie flick, and I came out mentally shaken by the moral subtext and end-of-the-world break down of social relationships. But the downside to that meant that I went into "28 Weeks" expecting to be further mentally toyed with and was ultimately let down when the movie turned out to 'merely' be a decent, if predictable zombie flick. There's enough here to be interesting, mostly centering around the infected Typhoid Mary of the plot, but ultimately all that gets tossed down the drain in favor of running around in the dark getting eaten. And while there's nothing wrong with that, per se, "28 Weeks" doesn't end up standing out significantly from the hordes of similar movies on the market, in my opinion.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>I love 28 Weeks Later, the continuation to 28 Days Later. Even with its MANY faults, I can't help but really like this movie.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later starts off during the beginning of the outbreak. Six survivors are hiding out in a cottage, just trying to get by when all hell breaks lose. Honestly it's one of the most intense and amazing intros to a movie I've seen in awhile. There is one scene I can't get out of my head from 28 Days and that's the tunnel scene. One of the best scenes that I always remember from 28 Weeks is what I call the hill scene. When one of the survivors is high tailing it across a field and you see a mass of infected coming over a hill and flocking right to him. Man I love the intro. 28 weeks after the outbreak begins, and the infected have perished from starvation, the military begins to clean up Britain and try to repopulate it. They bring in people from outside (England was quarantined so everyone else was ok) to start their new lives here. A survivor is found later that's infected, but not like `the infected' were. And so begins our cute tale of horror.<br /><br />As for movie itself, I really do like it, but like I said before there are so many faults with it. And it's mainly to make the movie scary or intense I guess. I'll give you an example. When the outbreak begins again (you know it's coming so I am not ruining anything), the military shoves everyone into one big room and then shuts the power off in the city and then turns on the emergency back up lights. Seriously? Why would you do this? That's the kind of thing this movie does a lot, just to add effect to it. It can get pretty eye-rolling for sure. But at the same time, I still can't help but enjoy the movie due to the fun it brings. Like the helicopter scene for instance. Once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. So cool.<br /><br />In the end I would say give it a rent unless you just really like the series like me. I own it and love it but I'm still giving it 3 stars cause of the absurd things that happen.<br /><br />P.S. - Hope that 28 Months Later comes out like planned (supposedly 2011).</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The deadly virus "Rage" comes back in "28 Weeks Later," much-awaited sequel to the hit Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later." Though the basic rules of the film's world - zombies running wild, for example - are the same, the sequel has more actions including shootings, explosions and zombie attacks. The film has many plot holes and shaky camera works (and very shaky at time), but it is entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />After the film's intense opening chapters, "28 Weeks Later" shows us the deserted city of London, where a certain area is now a secure zone for the military and residents. Selected civilians are allowed to return to England and they are informed (by the US army) that the disease is now contained. Of course it is, until someone, or some people, does things that they should not do.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack appear (and they are both very good), but their screen time is comparatively limited. The real stars are no doubt the undead. The zombie attacks have become more fierce and gory this time.<br /><br />The action-packed sequel is helmed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose unique thriller "Intacto" impressed me with its original story. Unfortunately, despite its merits (like terrific opening, impressive shots of the city's landmarks, etc.), "28 Weeks Later" sometime needs better plot devices than what they offer to convince us. I know we should forget such questions as "How can he or she do this or that?" while watching films - any films - but I think "28 Weeks Later" demands too much.<br /><br />Or perhaps I didn't like these two kids, whose actions play an important role in the plot. Here is a new perspective Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has introduced into the overcrowding genre of zombie films. What you do for love does not necessarily mean a good thing. Well, that is the only way I can think of to account for their presence. Or perhaps the script is not that deep and that new viewpoint is just accidental. I don't know. Anyway the film keeps moving, is constantly emotionally charged, and is never boring as long as you ignore certain parts of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>"28 WEEKS LATER" is not only an excellent follow up to the original but speaking for myself, in many ways (especially the end) it's even better than part one. It has a couple of plot holes but nowhere near enough to harm the final outcome. Although I love everything else about part one I never was a big fan of the dull ending...but I really think the way "28 weeks" begins helps to make the dull ending of the original much easier to swallow. All & all I really enjoyed this one and can't wait for another sequel or prequel...wich ever they decide to do. There is potential for either or.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>It's hard to like a zombie movie these days...with the exception of the Rage Virus series (28 Days Later & 28 Weeks Later).<br /><br />28 Weeks Later picks up about 6 months after the first movie.  The American military has taken over to contain the virus in Great Britain as well as monitoring the Brits to return and repopulate back to normalcy.  However, during the "reconstruction", there's a little episode in the countryside.<br /><br />There's a small band of infected zombies that have raided a small house.  In the small house is a family along with some other surviving humans.  When the zombies raid, family man, Don, loses his courages and escapes for his own safety, leaving behind his wife, Alice, and others to zombies.<br /><br />Don escapes to London to be reunited with his 2 children, who were sent to Spain during the initial virus outspread.  However, within days, Alice is discovered alive and brought back to London.  It is discovered that she has immunity to the Rage Virus.<br /><br />Don, feeling guilty, goes to see his wife at the military clinic.  He pleads with his wife to forgive him.  He kisses her and instantly becomes infected with the virus.  Then...all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the military must protect these 2 children as they may possibly carry the immunity just like their mother.  At the same time, the father is out to infect them.<br /><br />Fast-paced, which seems to be the trend, as seen in Transformers and Bourne Ultimatum.  This movie will definitely not bore you but put you on the edge of your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Although they aren't the undead, the ravenous hordes in the "28 Days..." films are close enough to what zombies have come to represent, to be counted as de facto zombies.  And thus what we have here is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made, a horrifying, apocalyptic, well-made, character-rich movie that succeeds brilliantly in both the explosive, action-packed scenes and the character driven, story-building ones.  Twenty-eight weeks after the conclusion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> (I should stop now to point out that if you haven't seen the first one yet, you might not want to read this or any other review of the sequel until you have), the infected hordes in the quarantined United Kingdom have long since perished from hunger and general 'burn-out'.  Plans have been carefully made to begin reintroducing some of the millions of refugees back into England.  A multinational military effort spearheaded by the United States takes charge of clearing out safe zones, transporting the first waves back in, and guarding the 'safe' section of London against the as-yet unsecured rest of the country.  Unbeknownst to anybody, not far from the safe zone, a peculiar survivor remains, one who doesn't seem to be infected....at least not in the way the others were.<br /><br />  When a series of unforseen events, involving - among other things - a previously unknown variant of the infection, results in a breach of the safe zone, things very quickly go from bad to worse, and the military command responds with a shockingly ruthless decision that prompts some of its soldiers to turn and take matters into their own hands to try and save some of London's newly re-introduced inhabitants, who now have multiple problems to worry about.<br /><br />  There's a lot more to it than that, but I'm trying to avoid giving too much of it away, or too much towards the end.  That's the basic scenario, and blurring the lines between the good guys and the bad guys is one of the things that makes "28 Weeks Later" work so well.  Things unfold in unexpected ways, there are some very innovative scenes, and overall it feels very fresh and unpredictable in spite of the 1,273 other zombie movies out there (that's an exageration, but maybe not by much).  Now a lot of those movies are very good (and some are pretty bad) but this is one of the ones that really stands out from the pack. Some have said that the movie's other elements - the extended time before the breakout, the military prescence itself, etc. - took away too much time from the zombies themselves, but I'd disagree.  That was a bit of a problem with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JO16">Land of the Dead (Unrated Edition)</a> (still a good movie) but here they got the balance and the pacing just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />  The ending is a memorable shocker, a should-have-seen-it-coming-but-didn't moment, and casts the whole film in a new light.  Well-acted with great effects and a terrific musical score, 28 Weeks Later succeeds on all levels.<br /><br />If you're looking for more like this, there are lots of great ones out there; among the best are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)</a> (from 1968), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a> (the 1990 Remake) and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> (2004).</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie is bloodier and more brutal than "28 days later".

This centers mainly around a family and how they react to the outbreak getting inside their safe and protected community.  There are some very tough to watch scenes in this early on, but there was a lot of spirit to get the main characters safe.  There is one scene that was so horrifying claustrophobia wise and the music blaring (that famous music from the first one) that will make your heart pound from fear.  I loved the conflict the soldiers had also, when they were forced to gun everything down.  The actor that played Doyle was great at really making you feel for him, he was so conflicted.  I didn't think I'd like this, but they really surprised me.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>The directors and production staff took what could have been just any bad sequel and give it a life of its own.  They managed to turn what could have been a shadow of the first movie into a run little chase movie in its own right.  It was also interesting that they divided the movie into a 28 days/28 weeks later timeline (however briefly) to make the audience understand that the infection was happening in other parts of the country.<br /><br />All of those involved managed to do this by violating zombie movie rule #1 if a family member becomes contaminated destroy and dismember them immediately.  Of course if they did that we wouldn't have much of a movie.  You also can't ask yourself other inconvenient questions like "if you escaped rage infected Brittan why in Gods name would you go back?"<br /><br />The acting from the children was also surprising they in particular did a great job.<br /><br />Overall-If you have a fan of Zombie movies you need to see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Okay, so here's the thing, i really did not like 28 Days Later. I saw it because of all the hype about the film and really, i didn't find it scary that much. So naturally, i was hesitant on seeing the sequel, 28 Weeks Later but after words, i regretted ever saying it.<br />The sequel, i feel, is a vast improvement over the first one. The plot of the film takes place, fittingly, 28 weeks after the first film. By now, all of England has been de-contamined and London has already begun repopulation with the help of the US army. All things seem to be going well but when two kids venture out of the 'safe walls', they inadvertly cause a breach in the defense of London and when night comes, the virus will have begun to spread again.<br />Not only are there some pretty tense moments but there are also some pretty thrilling sequences as well. By far, my favorite scene would have to be the subway sequence, where the film maker uses a very unique film technique that produces a very narrow film view that adds the tension of the whole scene.<br />The film can also be viewed as an allegory to our modern day goverment and how there decisions tend to work in their favor over the general population.<br />A very satisfying sequel and definently a scary movie to watch at night.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Taking a play from the George Romero zombie-movie book, 28 WEEKS LATER--the sequel to the 2002 successful zombie picture 28 DAYS LATER directed by Danny Boyle--has none of the original characters from the original picture.  Instead, the film revolves around new characters living in England in the aftermath of death and destruction caused by the Rage virus.<br /><br />The picture begins during the time period of 28 DAYS LATER with a group of unaffected citizens attempting to survive in the English countryside until those infected with the virus die out.  It looks like they will make it until the cottage they are staying in is attacked by a horde of zombies.  A small battle ensues, but the survivals are outnumbered.  Some of the survivors, including Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormick) try to make it to the escape route, a boat on the river.  Things go terribly wrong and Catherine is attacked and bitten by the creatures.  Thinking only of himself, Donald leaves his wife behind and succeeds in escaping down the river.<br /><br />The movie then fast forwards seven months after the initial outbreak.  The virus was contained and didn't escape the country of England.  Those infected died within a few weeks.  With the help of the United States military, the country is in the very initial stages of rebuilding while scientists attempt to develop an anti-virus should an outbreak of the Rage occur again.  Donald meets his children who had been staying overseas in the U.S. and they attempt to rebuild their lives.  The Harris children soon find themselves feeling like prisoners and unable to understand why they can't return to their old home since the virus is now contained.  They sneak through the safety barrier and return to their old home.  There they discover that their mother is still alive.  It is later discovered that though she has not been affected by the virus, she is carrying it in her blood.  With Mrs. Harris discovery, there is hope that an anti-virus might be developed from her blood.  However, no one suspects how far love and guilt can push a person and London soon finds itself in the middle of another outbreak.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, especially a zombie movie sequel, 28 WEEKS LATER is especially well done.  Starting with the prologue that introduces some of the main characters and ties this film to the events from the original, 28 WEEKS LATER does an excellent job of remaining true to the mood and tone of 28 DAYS LATER, yet, sets up a completely different story that stands strong on its own.  A person doesn't need to see 28 DAYS LATER to be able to enjoy 28 WEEKS LATER.<br /><br />Personally, I was initially reluctant to see 28 WEEKS LATER because it wasn't directed by Danny Boyle (though he did direct some of the second unit filming).  But after hearing positive remarks about the movie from close friends, I'm glad I saw the picture.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has seen 28 DAYS LATER and people who like zombie movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2002), I thought, had all the positive and negative traits of a typical Boyle film. The film had its moments of effective film making. The concept of "28 Days Later," however, is golden. Like George Romero's zombie flicks, the storyline of an incurable virus turning those infected into ravenous zombie-like murderers that is quarantined within the main British isle, is so ripe for possible sequels and spin-offs. As expected, a sequel is made --- grossly entitled "28 Weeks Later" (a sequel would probably be entitled 28 months or years later). It's not directed by Boyle but by director Juan Carlos Fresnadilla.<br /><br />You spot the differences immediately between these two directors. The film opens with Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack holed up in a cottage out in the British countryside. They're preparing a meal and discussing the fate of their kids as they traveled away for vacation just before the outbreak. Their dinner is interrupted by a young boy that has fled from a pack of infected that included his parents trying to kill him. This line of dialogue sets up the film's main theme: reconnection. It's not as eye-catching as Boyle's opening where he had then-newcomer Cillian Murphy alone inside a hospital room, and the moment he steps out of the hospital, an eerily empty London embraces his newly-recovered senses. Fresnadillo clearly doesn't want to dillydally and doesn't see the value of establishment. He throws us the facts right away, clearly banking on his audience's familiarity with Boyle's original work, and takes us straight to the action. A few minutes later, the survivors are in distress.<br /><br />If Fresnadillo's concern is to create a film that is more visceral, more gruesome, more violent than its predecessor, he certainly achieved it. However, I think Fresnadillo belongs to that school of filmmaking wherein cameras are supposed to be in a state of perpetual motion, and a shot should not last more than 2 seconds. The film is edited erratically, and the camera movements are unbearably jerky, that it's almost impossible to tell who's biting who, who's escaping from whom, and so on which was plain torture.<br /><br />It's quite unfortunate that the film suffers from a tired aesthetic style (I would've preferred Boyle who despite his MTV-tendencies still knows when to stop and just enjoy that moment of serenity). The story actually has good moments. Sure, there are certain instances wherein the characters start losing a hold on common sense or logic, but as a sequel to a film that draws its powers from a ridiculous idea to begin with, the writers didn't do that bad. London 28 weeks later looks like a more affluent Baghdad --- surrounded by Americans who are armed and have their own protocols. "28 Weeks Later" exploits that idea slightly through out this film. The themes do not have the philosophical underpinnings or the sophistication of Romero's zombie parables. The allusions are quite plainly mere metaphors that manage to distract me from the film's want of visual quality. That's when I start to miss Boyle who, with all his faults as a filmmaker, still manage to churn out new things and ideas from concepts primarily borrowed from masters of the genre, leaving this movie scary one way but forgettable in the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's film was done in such a way that a sequel was almost bound to fail. Their film was a horror movie alright, but it was really an exercise in experimental filmmaking. Any film that was to follow it up will have to contend with the cool factor of not just a twist on the zombie theme (even they are not zombies) but the choice in music and look of the film. All I can say is that 28 Weeks Later doesn't disappoint and even surpasses the original film in certain aspects.<br /><br />Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a great job of trying to stick to the premise begun by Boyle and Garland in 28 Days Later and adding his own signature to the sequel. The film begins with a scene which encapsulates what someone who never saw the original film needs to know about what to expect with this one. We're introduced to Don (played by a gaunt and quite haunted Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) trying to survive with several others at their English countryside cottage just outside London during the first couple weeks of the Rage-virus outbreak. This prologue shows just how tenuous any form of safe haven can be once sentimentality overrides the primal instinct for self-preservation. Don is given a choice of choosing sentimentality to try and save someone he cares about and maybe die in the process or follow the basic need for self-preservation in time of extreme danger and distress. Don picks the latter and we're shown how horrible his choice was but at the same time how plausible a decision it was when put into context. If we were put in a similar situation could we honestly say that we wouldn't had made the same choice which Don took. The scene with Don running across the open field with dozens upon dozens of Rage-infected people chasing after him was quite chilling.<br /><br />The movie goes through an introductory credit sequence explaining the timeline since Don's escape from the cottage. We're told that the British Isles was quickly quarantined once authorities saw how futile it was to try and save it from the ravages of Rage in the first couple weeks. Following-up on the final scenes in the original film, we know now that those infected by Rage would soon die out due to starvation and that 28 weeks after the first sign of outbreak the world outside of the British Isles have decided that it was now time to clean out the last vestiges of Rage-infected victims who haven't starved to death and begin reconstruction and repopulation of the country. The U.S.-led NATO force in charge of this monumental project is led by U.S. Army general Stone (The Wire's excellent Idris Elba) and have cordoned off a safe sanctuary in London's Isle of Dogs where British citizens who escaped the initial outbreak or were outside the Islands when it began would be housed in while London was slowly sanitized.<br /><br />This is where Don has been sent and given a job as a manager helping with getting London back on its feet. We're shown the arrival of Don's two children who were safely abroad in Spain when the outbreak first hit England. Their reunion is heartfelt though bittersweet as Don must answer his children's questions about what happened to their mother. Let's just say that Don's explanation is not exactly accurate. The Tammy and Andy (played by newcomers Imogen Poot and Mackintosh Muggleton) take his answers at face value but still end up sneaking out of the protected Green Zone to get to their old cottage to pick-up some items of sentimental value. This is the only part of the movie which seemed implausible and made me realize that once again a horror movie ended up with some characters doing dumb things that would lead to nothing but death and destruction. What the two kids find once they get to the cottage marks the beginning of re-infection and the extreme policies enacted by the military to contain the problem. But containment doesn't hold and soon enough a Code Red order is given to all military personnel.<br /><br />It is once the Code Red is given that most filmgoers will see the allegorical similarities of U.S. policies and tactics in their War against Terror, especially in Iraq. While I do not prescribe to this notion, Frescadillo handled the situation well. I say I do not prescribe to the notion that the second-half of the movie is a direct condemnation of U.S. war against terror and occupation of Iraq, because it's a theme in apocalyptic movies that's been used before there was a war on terror. It is in this second-half where 28 Weeks Later reminded me a lot of George A. Romero's underappreciated horror film, The Crazies. Just like in that film, the military in 28 Weeks Later don't seem to be heartless about their reaction to the new outbreak and break of containment. Instead their overreaction to the whole deteriorating situation looks to be born more out of desperation and an inability to comprehend the best and most humane way to combat the crisis. As it's always mentioned in other forms of fiction, the military is a blunt instrument and never a subtle one. The Rage infection and those infected seem to only be stopped when using the most blunt procedures and tactics, but such ways also have a tendency to cause much collateral damage to the innocent.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is much more epic in scope that 28 Days Later and it is in that which it surpasses the original film. While the first film is more the lives of two disparating groups of survivors and how both groups attempts to survive shows how quickly one could fall from civilized behavior while another continues to hold on to it, the sequel shows that in the end even people with the best of intentions will succumb to the basic instinct of survival with any means necessary. The established shots of London overhead and down on the ground empty and lifeless really brings the apocalyptic nature of the movie with the force of a sledgehammer. These scenes followed up with the firebombing of Canary Wharf really highlights just how much more grimmer and nihilistic in tone and scope Fresnadillo's sequel over Boyle's more hopeful one. It is quite a surprise that its the actions of the youngest and most innocent (as children are usually protrayed in horror movies) which causes a new cycle of outbreak and ultimately the fall of the attempt to bring normalcy back to the British Isles.<br /><br />I would say that --- even though the movie doesn't really involve zombies but zombie-like people --- 28 Weeks Later actually resembles George A. Romero's Living Dead films more than Boyle's 28 Days Later. While Boyle's film took some of its basic themes from Romero's work, he still didn't go far enough. Fresnadillo took the theme of humanity being more dangerous than the Rage-infected ones during the original film's third act and expands on it with 28 Weeks Later. There's a deep sense of pessimism and cutthroat survival instincts inherent in the film's themes. The only form of humanity to be seen actually comes from the same Americans whose attempts of reconstruction ends up an exercise in total annihilation of the problem even if it includes the innocent being destroyed in the process.<br /><br />As a sequel to 28 Days Later, Fresnadillo's film shared some stylistic and thematic qualities with the original film, but ends up becoming a wholly independent work (one could watch this sequel without having seen the original and still understand what was going on). Where the original film only touches the surface of the Rage virus doomsday effect on the British Isles and its population, 28 Weeks Later ceases that basic notion and gives the viewer a first-hand look at its aftermath and, later on, how it looks when an outbreak occurs in an area packed with survivors. For a fan of Romero's classic zombie epics I do prefer Fresnadillo's work and the look of his film over the original one, but he does sacrifice some level of characterization to keep the film's tone and frenetic pacing in the latter-half from being bogged down. The film ends on a really downbeat note even as survivors make it to safety. This film really becomes an exercise in nihilism more than what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were willing to do with the original film.<br /><br />In the end, 28 Weeks Later brings over enough of what made the first film such a cult, and later on, a mainstream horror success to be considered a sequel that matches the first one in quality, and at times even surpasses the original in certain aspects. The acting is actually very good despite some characters not being fleshed-out more thoroughly, but I find this understandable to keep the frantic pace of the film from start to finish from being slowed down. For fans of the first film I don't think this sequel will be a disappointment. It may not reach the same creative heights for some fans but it surely won't ruin the experience of having seen the original. The film also introduces a new face to the genre world with the excellent work turned in by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In addition to Alexandre Aja from France and now Fresnadillo, the world of horror is getting a nice infusion of young talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I disagree.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later has such staunch editing that the film seldom allows one to breathe in it's storyline. It is based on a son, a daughter, a mother and a father caught up in the whole virus affecting the world. My only complain and a big flaw in the film is the fact that the characters are not even allowed to grow on you. Before you know anything else, you find characters running and hiding. It's a bit too active and it seems that the director is trying too hard to create an impact.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later does create an impact, in the sense it is still a must watch film but there is nothing about the film that deserves recognition or respect. It tries to incorporate a whole lot in a space of way less than 2hours. A lot of readers/posters/critics on imdb.com wrote this is one of the best films they saw in 2007. I can see what they could have liked about this film but I must say, in my heart of hearts, it is quite underwhelming.<br /><br />Watch [...] and figure out how it had those 4minute action scenes. There were maybe 2 scenes in the film that made me jump from my seat. The film,overall, though would still remain disappointing. However, I would not like to pull you away from it. Watch it cause you might just like it or you might just end up finding I make sense to more than just myself.<br /><br />Try watching "[...]" - a good effort and it doesn't try to change the world.

With a different director and different characters, "28 Weeks Later" is just another zombie movie.  It's predictable, slow and uninteresting.  Sure, the effects are nice, and some of the photography isn't bad.  But in the end, this is a paint-by-numbers B movie that is a relentless downer from start to finish.  Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>This is the sequel to 28 days later, and I thought it was pretty weak. An entirely predictable plot from start to finish, featuring annoyingly silly teenage protagonists, their dad, and a group of somewhat dim NATO soldiers. I was disappointed because the first film was well done, had an interesting plot and was surprising. This film the children take over with their TSTL (too stupid to live) antics, and the plot devolves into horror/slasher formula. The moment the children arrived in the military zone I predicted they'd do something really moronic. I was disappointed to be right.<br /><br />I enabled close captions, which was convenient when I fast forwarded all the chase scenes that the director apparently considered plot development. This way  I could read the sparse dialog without feeling the need to slow down.<br /><br />The ending was almost the only interesting part of the film.

Co-written and directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. The rage outbreak is once again not far away when the search for a vaccine brings a seemingly immune subject into the headquarters of the American forces. Forget all the George Romero's zombies films and all the werewolves flicks, 28 WEEKS LATER is a masterpiece. The spanish director who already gave us a first rate film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJBU">Intacto</a> in 2001 proves here he's a director one will have to count with very soon. The description of a devastated London and of the relations between the members of a devastated family are a pure cinematic delight. Science fiction at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>This movie is by far WAY better then 28 Days Later.

I'm looking forward to its release on dvd, It is truly a MUST own.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>28 Days Later is a terrific movie.  As far as sequels, this is really top notch.  Though I didn't like it quite as much as the original, it does hold up well when placed beside the original film.  The movie starts with a bang during the height of the infection.  It then gives a brief overview of what has happened from then to now 28 weeks later.  Britain has been decimated by the virus, but now all of the Rage infected have died of starvation and the U.S. army has moved in with about 15,000 refugees and set up a safe zone to start over.  But you know things aren't going to go smoothly and another infection breaks out and all hell breaks loose again.  I liked the sense of unknown in the first film.  Had the virus spread across the world, were they the only people left?  The second film doesn't quite convey that.  The army has the jets and helicopters and you don't quite feel overwhelmed by the thought of the world ending.  The last scene of the movie is great though and I hope for a 28 Months Later follow up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Here's a joke in the grim years after the devastation of the Rage Virus was released from a London biological research lab, ripping through the population like a blood-engrimed scythe & devastating the UK---you ready?<br /><br />OK, here goes: two guys are chilling outside of the Safe Zone, right? And one guy looks over this brick wall they're standing next to, freaks out, and yells "Oh my God, it's one of the Infected---he's coming this way!"<br /><br />And the other guy, he doesn't say anything, but he gets these brand new running shoes out of his rucksack and starts putting them on, tying up the shoelaces, the works, right? And the other guy is looking at him like he's gone crazy, and he says "what the bleeding 'Ell are you doing? Those things have Rage---they run like they've got a howitzer mounted in their [EXPLETIVES]! You can't outrun those zombies!"<br /><br />And the other guy just smiles and takes off, saying: "I don't have to outrun the zombies. I just have to outrun you."<br /><br />I made that joke up about 15 minutes in to watching "28 Weeks Later", the utterly uninspired sequel to one of the most nightmarish flicks I have ever seen, Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later".<br /><br />Now it's true that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo had some mighty big directorial Wellingtons to fill: Boyle is a demented visionary and an absolute guerrilla warrior with his directing. Boyle's "28 Days Later" could have been a dippy little coda or sideshow to the 2002 onslaught of zombie flicks.<br /><br />But Boyle brought a silver ewer brimming with gory cinematic deviltry and---of all things!---dignity, to his End of the World flick. The result was brooding, elegant, gory, nasty, & insanely scary, a throbbing mainline right to the jugular of post-9/11's deepest, darkest fears.<br /><br />The sequel has the same trappings: the Sprinting Dead, zombies who do wind sprints to get you, tear your guts out, and then try out for the Iron Man triathlon afterwards. It has the Military, with their nifty gas masks & black battle armor & Happy Thoughts amped through the City of London, where evacuees have finally been allowed to return, 28 months later, after the American military has cleared the City of the Rage virus.<br /><br />You've also got the trademark Big Red Clotted Gory Puke Sequences (tm), where the jetting spew is of the extra-chunky Vegetable Soup variety. And there is a sweet, razor-blade instant of pure shrill terror during a sequence of rampant pre-quarantine madness at an English cottage which lopes along after the film's intro credits (though Boyle directed it, surprise!).<br /><br />Bottom-line, "28 Weeks Later" is like a bunch of grad students messing around with lab rats. Dump the Brits back in London; have a few grunts play peeping Tom with the starlight scope; wait for, as they say in Jurassic Park, "life to find a way." Life does, the Military uber-FUBARS it, & before you can say "would you like a side-order of red puke with your order, Sir?" London is, yet again, crawling with the wild-eyed infected, doing their yark-yarking thing all over again. Ugh.<br /><br />It's watchable, but only just. Amazingly, the sequel manages to take all that awesome fear, tension, and terror and totally jettison it out the airlock.<br /><br />But the concept still has promise, which is why I hope Boyle takes a final cut at this thing. However you want to frame it, Boyle's monsters, running zombies are utterly terrifying. The regular Romero-style lumbering dead are bad enough: given enough time & ample exhaustion on your part, they'll get you. But the sprinting dead---these zombies that run after you---that's just too much.<br /><br />If you don't agree, if you're not feeling it right now, then take a second and just think about the prospect. I just walked through my empty office this evening, out to the foyer, and into the can. I was in there about 2 minutes. I walked back out & the elevator slid open, and two guys---two mechanics, techs for the ventilation system---jogged out, totally spooked me flat-out bugshxt.<br /><br />I gotta admit, man, it kinda unnerved me. If those dudes had been infected?---OK, you're with me.<br /><br />Cool. Let's move on.<br /><br />That's what works about the whole 28 days later thing, what worked about the original, what even worked about Zach Tyler's terminally unsettling reworking of "Dawn of the Dead": these undead, hungry, hateful, baleful, gibbering things running at you with murder in their eyes and a-growling in the belly, before you can prepare. That's it, isn't it? You're not ready.<br /><br />The Running Zombie doesn't give a man a decent getting-ready time. It's like the [NAUGHTY WORD] in hide-n-seek years ago who would pretend to be counting to 100 and then go "38, 37, 36,---3, 2, 1 HERE I COME!" and everyone would panic. With a [EXPLETIVE] like that on board, those hide & seeks would become bloodbaths.<br /><br />So I guess what it all boils down to is this: quarantine this flick. Numero 2 doesn't move, it doesn't groove, it doesn't boogy, it doesn't scare me, & I can't dance to it.<br /><br />And pray for a follow-up that shows us something *really* scary.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>You know, "Night of the Living Dead," "Resident Evil," and too many more to count, including this one's prequel (which I didn't see). It's been done so many times, with pretty much interchangeable plots, that any new one had better be something different.<br /><br />This one is. The "Rage" virus has depopulated England, down to the last howling bloodsucker - as far as the authorities can tell. So, once it looks like all's clear, they start shipping planeloads of tasty expatriots back into the most undefendable, unsecurable part of the UK: downtown London. You can pretty much guess the rest.<br /><br />Given that everything else in this movie is recycled, novel (or at least well-done) effects distinguish this one. There's a fair bit of red spatter, if that's the kind of thing you like. There are also some great CGI scenes of the military trying their military solutions throughout London - some of the coolest since that big ending scene in "V for Vendetta". And, since this flick is really just there to manipulate your nerves, it does a great job with flashing lights, blinding glare, and bouncy camera stuff. One other thing worked pretty well - it looks as if the current generation of cameras has shutter speeds so high that motion blur essentially doesn't exist. Instead, action scenes have a jaggedness that grates on the eye in a way completely suited to the jagged mood.<br /><br />So that's about it. A plain old contagious-zombie movie with above average effects. I give it four stars for staying loyally true to its genre, not trying to be anything else. If you have an evening to kill, these virus-driven maniacs will take care of it for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Ah, what better way to spend 3 1/2 hours than watching bloody projectile vomiting in high-def?<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by Stephen King's The Stand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169530">The Stand (Signet)</a> where a deadly virus escapes a secret government facility and obliterates the world as we know it, Director Danny Boyle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting</a>  and writer Alex Garland (rumored to be involved with the film adaptation of the video game Halo...sweeeeet!) take the killer virus theme to the next level in 2002 with 28 Days Later.<br /><br />28 Days opens with what happens when animal activists go wild. In a short, violent sequence we see how a voraciously contagious virus that turns people into raging lunatics gets released into society. Flash to pre-Scarecrow Cillian Murphy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a> waking up  several days later in a hospital bed after most of the rest of society has been affected by the germs. (Coincidentally{?} we see this same beginning to a world gone mad in two other recent zombie-type stories: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582406723">The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXZL04">Resident Evil / Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> ).<br /><br />Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world. And it turns out that Murphy and the folks that he bands up with need to fear more than just 'the infected'. 28 Days is frightening, suspenseful, thrilling, disgusting, realistic, emotionally-charging...all the ingredients in the Horror genre that make up a Classic.<br /><br />Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.<br /><br />28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud "PUNG!!!" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect.<br /><br />28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.<br /><br />It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.<br /><br />Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Out of a million zombies, one, known to our heroes, chases them thru London.

We see that when it comes to 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the stylishly original 28 Days Later. It's a solid effot and packed with entertainment, but falls short in terms of the longevity category. When I think longevity, I think of films that stand alone. This is not one of those films.<br /><br />The concept is nice. As viewers, we visit London 28 weeks after the outbreak and roughly two months after the last incident of infection. The US military is in the process of bringing civilization back to London, as they've sealed off a protected area in the heart of London that has everything from running water to electricity. On nearly every rooftop there is a sniper, prepared for the worse. It seems that the powers that be have thought of everything and are ready for any situation. That's until, of course, SHE shows up.<br /><br />"She" is a mother played by the always-gorgeous Catherine McCormack. She is seemingly infected, but at the same time immune. In other words, she doesn't show signs of the disease - like rage - but if, say, someone like her husband were to kiss her, he would become infected and all hell might break lose. And guess what happens?<br /><br />It's 10 minutes into such a catastrophic levy being openened that I found myself being extremely entertained. I cannot, however, say that the last half-hour of the film was satisfying. As a viewer, I wanted the film to go in certain directions and found that in almost each case (except for a brilliantly executed final 5 minutes of the film), the director had other ideas.<br /><br />This is not your father's 28 Days Later.

The most interesting stab at character and plot development -- a father's lie to his children about the fate of their mother -- seems full of promise, but ends shortly after take off with a crashing, blood-soaked, and, finally, charred finish. Rather than employing the time-honored idea of a character arc (in which, perhaps, the father ultimately redeems himself through some act of heroism), the father becomes this incredibly controlled killing machine (unlike all of the other infected), which then leads to random, semi-plausible people being chased from one place to the next and dying here and there, all the while haunted a foreshadowed ending that, early in Act I, hits you between the eyes (literally) like a two-by-four.<br /><br />Let me be very clear, however. 28 Weeks Later has some incredibly scary moments that will stick with you, courtesy of some terrific cinematography and post-production. The "zombies" in the film seem real, ravenous, and frightening. The opening sequences of the film are terrific for all of these reasons. And, if that's what floats your boat, and you don't really need much more, you'll likely enjoy this film. Frankly, I found it more oppressive and, at times, boring than genuinely engaging.<br /><br />I, too, am a life long horror (but not slasher) movie lover, and, in particular, a fan of apocalyptic films like this. But I prefer my horror films to be intelligent and plot-driven, not merely a bag of frights (no matter how effective). In the end, 28 Days Later was superior to this sequel in just about every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>28 Weeks Later is a sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, which was a refreshing zombie film that took itself very seriously and arguably reinvigorated the sub-genre for bloodthirsty audiences around the world...I consider myself among them.  Danny Boyle steps back as director but his influence is intact as he produces this film.  Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, a Spanish filmmaker recently nominated for an Academy Award for his short film Esposados (released in the US as Linked), directs this sequel but maintains many of the stylistic standards of the first film.  Like 28 Days Later the cinematography is digital, and it is in 35mm format with some shaky camera work and some very quick edits.  I have to admit that at times the attack scenes seemed a little over-stylized and one scene was derivative enough from the Blair Witch Project that it came off as an intentional tribute.  Not to say that bothers me much, I'm just pointing it out.<br /><br />The first film was about a virus called "Rage" that quickly turns it's victims into fast-moving cannibals that are a bit more real and scary than the mindless traditional zombies of George Romero's films.  After a while the first film ended with all the infected people starving to death. The second film starts off with a thorough American occupation of London that works to contain and prevent another outbreak while at the same time re-introducing British civilians.  We are then introduced to a family of characters, some of which have a genetic abnormality that allows them to remain healthy with the virus.  They are un-effected carriers of "Rage".  This of course leads to another outbreak in the setting of a military occupied London.  And so we sit back and watch as the zombified shenanigans ensue.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is extremely violent but it's even more brutal than many films of this sub-genre because it takes itself so seriously and it actually works effectively for that.  We are introduced to several would-be protagonists, two of which are deeply riddled with guilt and that makes the characters three-dimensional which allows us to actually care about them.  But by the same token, the movie doesn't pull punches and the zombies get their way more often than not.  That means the violent tone in general was a bit more real for me.  There is also an incredibly gory sequence that is identical to a scene in Planet Terror, the first feature in the recent collaboration Grindhouse.  It's interesting to compare the two scenes, because in Planet Terror the scene is so amusing and slapsticky while essentially the same scene here in 28 Weeks Later comes off as shocking and disgusting. It is an interesting comparison that compliments the refined style of both movies.<br /><br />The middle acts of 28 Weeks Later serve as a political allegory of sorts, in terms of the war in Iraq, although I couldn't perceive which side the film is actually taking.  It seemed to suggest both judgements of ineptitude and sympathy toward the American military.  So the commentary seemed kind of inconsequential other than to reflect our modern cultural and political climate, which is firmly in the tradition of George Romero's early zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead.  I must say that the commentary itself was so heavy-handed at times that I was really keeping my fingers crossed for that fast-moving Saddam Hussein zombie...oh well, perhaps I'll have to wait for 28 months.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i have to say,i was disappointed in this follow up to "28 Days Later".don't get me wrong,there were some great moments in this movie,particularly the action scenes,which were frenetic and relentless.the problem i found is there weren't enough of these intense scenes.i felt the movie had too many slow spots.i did however like the look of the "infected".they looked much more enraged than in the first movie.the action scenes,when they occurred,were better than the first one,but overall,the movie did not quite meet my expectations.i give "28 Weeks Later" 2.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>If the first film took its theme to be the collective inheritance of a militaristic and violent culture, this film is about the effects upon a family of personal guilt.  But the theme is pounded in a bit too strongly by a series of coincidences and implausible developments, especially when one of the zombies (I mean "infected") develops a personal vendetta and somehow seems to already be waiting for the main characters everywhere they happen to decide to go.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of the first film was that once the sci-fi/horror premise was established events unfolded very realistically and unpredictably.  In this film events seem clearly designed to fulfill a symbolic role in the working out of one man's attempt to run from the past, and of the effects of this evasion upon his family.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film seemed intriguing to begin with, and the opening scene was quite strong: in an act of cowardice and self-preservation a man abandons his wife to the advancing hordes of infected; this situation raises interesting questions and sets up an intriguing conflict at the heart of the film: now that he has survived how can he live with himself, and how can he face his children, who will not understand the fear that led him to such a dreadful decision?  28 Weeks Later everything looks to be under control and the survivors in London are being "protected" by American soldiers, against the possibility that the virus might still exist -- but of course it does or we wouldn't have a movie.<br /><br />Apart from the story I also found the execution of this film to be lacking.  It is obviously a bigger film than the first, with a bigger budget -- spent mostly on military action and explosions and a bigger vision of an empty and desolate London -- but this one lacks the inventiveness of the first film.  What was fresh in 28 Days Later feels gimmicky here -- okay, the zombies  can run, but does that mean that they must always be running?  Can't they ever slow down and give us time to look at the action?  The video documentary style footage here also seems just like a less effective duplicate of the style of the first one, and not so much an exciting new look -- and the frenetic editing of the zombie attacks and killings doesn't feel inventive but overdone and done to death.  It sounds odd, but after several bouts of kinetic mayhem with sprinting dead I began to find it quite boring and repetitive -- and that definitely wasn't my experience with the first film, where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (both in the theater and when I brought it home on dvd).  The first film I would recommend to anyone who likes film (and doesn't mind a bit of blood and gore and zombie violence).  This film I would only recommend for fans of horror and zombie flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>28 Days Later was an excellent horror movie that revived the zombie genre (before 14 year old kids who laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and masturbate to 300 killed it again) similar to Romero's Night of the Living Dead. So director Juan Tacos Burritos took the next logical step in the story and centered it around the military trying to re-establish civilization in a small sect in London called district 1, even though London all around them still rots with dead bodies and likely still harbors the infection.<br /><br />Anyways one of the characters played by Robert Caryle survived the outbreak and is given the job of caretaker, where he has access to everywhere inside the district assigned by the military... why? The movie never hints that he was in the military, he doesn't act like a military man and sure doesn't walk like one, so either the army is handing out these extrodinarily private security tasks to random civilians or the movie needs plot convenience to move along.<br /><br />So Robert Caryle's two kids Maggintoggle Poots and Imogen Toots reunite with him and miss their mother, so they decide to sneak back into infected unsafe London to grab memorabillia and pictures, because patience is for suckaz. So two little kids sneak out of a heavily armed and guarded military base that is under heavy survellience by going on the side of one of the bridges, don't worry as the movie progresses you'll come to realize this is the most inept militia ever. Eventually they discover their mother in their old house, who's still alive and dormantly carries the infection in her. But if she can do that, other people presumably can too, but you never see them in 28 Days Later, so I just presumed that they got beaten to death or something when this plot point came up. However the mother who was in a house in the excellent opening sequence got trapped in a room with the infected flooding in, they didn't beat her to death? Did they leave her alone, because they could sense the infection or something? Did they just puke blood on her and leave? Not really a plot hole but something that bothered me.<br /><br />So the military scientist's find out about the mom's situation and leave her restrained in a room with 0 guards and non-monitered survellience. Robert Caryle, using his handy dandy plot inconvienience card get past all the sercurity to the detained rare subject who can be the cure to infection, and after leaving her to die decides to start macking on her, knowing fully well about the infection, that she was left out in the infected London wastes, and not even asking what she went through, decides to start sharing saliva with her, until suprise suprise, he gets infected. Now many of my friends have argued whether or not she did that on purpose to get revenge, but if she indeed infect her husband out of revenge she got brutally killed afterwards, hundreds of people died, and her kids lives were in peril, so yeah, great revenge plan mom.<br /><br />So the now-infected Robert Caryle (probably still weilding his access card) runs around the military compound and kills multiple soldier's who were presumably trained to deal with the infected, and ends up killing all of them. One unarmed infected man without armor vs approximately twenty armed guards. Hm. The rest of the military is alerted and stuffs all of the civillians in a dark cramped basement for their safety, forgetting that the back door is unlocked and Robert Caryle-zombie has apparently found it and broke in. Now people have compared this level of military incompetance to the American troops in the Middle East, politics aside that sounds like a slap-dash excuse of "oh yeah, we meant for those soldiers to be s***ty at their jobs, see it's like topical and current!" I don't buy it.<br /><br />So the people start pouring out of the basement out into the streets were snipers are poised, and chaos breaks out via shakey cam and the snipers shoot to kill everyone basically, wait are the military guys incompetent fools? I don't understand, please movie, spell that point out for me more. So the people in hiding are intercepted by two soldiers, Jermey Renner and Rose Byrne who try to protect the people and escort them out. Eventually the group is literally chased out of the city by an explosion and into the outskirts while the city is being firebombed (and Robert Caryle-zombie avoids inceneration by ducking in an alleyway, whatever I don't care anymore).<br /><br />So Jermey Renner's token black friend lands in his helicoptor and says he's only taking his friend, not anyone else or else he'll get shot down. A bunch of infected show up that survived the fireblast and are coming towards the survivors (I wonder if the big loud helicoptor had anything to do with it) and in true action stupidity token uses his helicoptor propellers to slice up the horde, spraying blood all over his helicoptor. Yeah carrying a few kids on your helicoptor will get you shot down but infected blood painted all over your helicoptor won't. Again, the helicoptor couldn't carry the kids until one of them was infected, for sequel purposes defy consistency and logic. (P.S. interesting how Planet Terror and 28 Weeks Later came out in the same month and had the same stunt, anyone know which came up with the idea?)<br /><br />So the helicoptor leaves them and they're running away from even MORE remaining infected that survived firebombing and helicoptor slicing, and they run into the city, which is now being gassed (for all the military's thorough efforts, Robert Caryle-zombie can survive them all). So the survivors minus Jeremy Renner are driving through desolate London when an attack helicoptor comes, sees a car driving, and starts blasting at it with miniguns. Not only are they taking 'Code Red' to laughable extremes, but how do those fools in the helicoptor miss a lone vechicle, it's like shooting at that car for about a minute or two and can't hit the damn thing.<br /><br />So the car goes into the subway and there's only 1 zombie alive, of course it's Robert Caryle, for DRAMA! So he offs Rose Byrne in a shot that Quarantine later ripped off without shame then bites Muggleton Poots or something until Imogen Toots through tears shoots him off with loud soap-opera music blaring to remind you that this is really a family drama. So now Poots (or was it Toots?) is dormantly infected, and so NOW the helicoptor pilot will take them up, and there's no apparent sign that token black pilot will get shot down. Hm.<br /><br />So 28 Weeks Later was entertaining and had high ambitions, the acting was good and the whole story was pretty interesting, it just had so many plot holes glaring me in the face that I couldn't come to enjoy it as much as 28 Days Later. Sure Days had some plot holes too, but they were fewer and far between and were more ambigious instead of just plain vanilla stupid like the holes in Weeks. So some great scenes that are few and far inbetween don't make up for an overall jarring and bumpy experience of a movie. If you must watch this open a few beers first so you don't have to think very much about all the dumb crap this movie tries to get away with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>28 WEEKS LATER<br /><br />I was extremely excited about this movie when it was first announced because one of my favorite actors ever Jeremy Renner. I have always liked him especially his performance in the great flick Dahmer. So when this first came out I was really excited but this did not turn out as great as I thought. Still the movie was fun and had a bit of that appeal that the first did although I think it was trying to hard to live up to the first. Renner definitely is what makes this movie for me, and once again they are infected not zombies.<br /><br />The second film follows a some people who get stuck within an infected zone after an infected gets loose, the husband and wife. These people are being lead by a solider who feels sorry for them and disobeys orders and even shoots his fellow soldiers. They have to make it all the way across town to try to get a lift out of the quarantined zone. They have to out last a lot of infected, soldiers, napalm and all kinds of things. This one unlike the last film is a straight survival film were as the last was a mix of all kinds.<br /><br />This movie seemed well directed and written for the most part but it seemed like they were trying to out do the last film more so than further the story. Don't get me wrong I love when the helicopter starts to chop away at the infected but did it feel a little like the studio was involved in stuff like that. To me the story seemed great at first but towards the last half it did not seem as developed. In fact the first half felt very much like the first film but it started to falter towards the end a little. Acting wise Jeremy Renner is brilliant but I was a little disappointed with the fate of his character, Robert Carlyle is also great in this.<br /><br />I liked this second film and found it to be a fun flick but it did not seem as real as the first or even as fun. The story was good and the acting was good but it just fell a little short in my opinion. I would still recommend a purchase especially if you have the first one but a rental at least could be good for this one. Look for the two pack if you do not already own these because it is a good deal for the two films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>this movie was better than i thought it would be! the first one was terrible,but this one had a little bit of eveything in it! these zombies were pretty pissed off in this movie, all of the beating the people up then biting them had me laughing in my seat!

The existence of this sequel testifies to the fact that this does not go smoothly.<br /><br />This ultraviolent film is superior to the first, which had a very lackluster ending.  The vision of director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and co-writers Rowan Joffe, E.L. Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo is bleak, uncompromising, and even heart-breaking.  There are many sympathetic characters, but every act of tenderness results in disaster, resulting in a world where humanity's better nature actually works against it, possibly resulting in its ultimate destruction.  The movie falters a bit at the end when it reintroduces a character in a very contrived manner, but it is not enough to derail this powerful film.  Robert Carlyle stands out in the excellent cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>It goes without saying that most good zombie flicks splatter blood by the gallon ("Cronos" being a notable exception).  "28 Weeks Later," sequel to the breakout smash "28 Days Later" follows that rule with gusto, but the movie emerges as a surprisingly thoughtful-yet-action-packed entry into a crowded genre.<br /><br />Helmed by relative newcomer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo - a hot young talent from Spain - "28 Weeks Later" stays true with what worked in the first movie- realistic yet gory violence capped only by virtuoso special effects showing a London decimated by the zombie horde.  The "ragers" unleashed in the first movie are up to their old tricks, running down anyone with a pulse and "converting" them into ragers (or lunch) through bodily fluids and nasty bites.  A terrifying opening sequence sees our "hero," Don (Robert Carlyle of "Full Monty" fame) abandon his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack of "Dangerous Beauty") to be mauled by the ragers.  He barely escapes with his life back to safety - London ruled by the U.S. Army.<br /><br />But the city ain't safe for long.  Alice shows up from beyond the grave, and she's a "carrier" of the rage virus.  Before long (and I don't think I'm giving anything away here, since the ads show the ragers taking over London) there's another outbreak.  An intrepid band of survivors must get to safety.  But where is it?<br /><br />One of the strengths of this movie is that nobody is safe - often a character will get identified as a "safe hero" whom you think will survive all the carnage, only to get offed in spectacular fashion.  The result is a terrifying, edge-of-your-seat movie.  A bare-bones plot - survive - adds to the terror, as does the quip-free dialogue.  This is a strong, intelligent movie, not a clever, hip one that will be dated six weeks after release.  And the movie is mercifully free of gratuitous sex and shower scenes - this is a movie that focuses on the frightening, not the titilation.<br /><br />If you're a fan of horror films, you've probably already seen this movie.  If not, get "28 Days Later" first - you'll need the limited back story to really appreciate this movie.  The DVD extras are also well-worth the investment.<br /><br />Not a Great Movie, by any means, but a darn good one.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>One week later after watching this movie and I am still disappointed in it. Although I should have known it would be bad, because the first one was so freaking good. This movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, has too many points in it that I you are saying "no way that would happen" and you are too preoccupied about that to even care about what is happening on screen with the characters or plot. I didn't care about anyone surviving, because they were all idiots. The Father who kisses his obviously infected exposed wife, the two kids who sneak out to get photographs knowing that in time they would probably get them anyway, the soldiers and the doctor who have no common sense between them. I think I was harboring a secret fantasy that the little boy would get torn to shreds, because his behavior and downright stupidity made me frustrated. Who falls down stairs/escalators and just gets up and wanders off from there? Wouldn't you stay where you fell? The same "Godspeed you black emperor" song from the first movie, also made me mad, I guess they had to use it to tie it to the first, but to me it only reminded me how UNLIKE the first movie it really was! I actually snickered when the infected were running around France at the end, Le Rage Oui Oui!  I really want to one day take all the over acting infected shots and set them to music, maybe Barry Mani lows Copacabana?<br />I would say only see this movie, to appreciate how awesome the first one was all over again, and than go watch the first one to erase the memory of this sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_28 Weeks Later_ (2007) is a post-apocalyptic science fiction film which is a sequel to _28 Days Later_ (2002) which features the response of the British government to an outbreak of the rage virus which turns men into mad zombies.  This film asks the difficult question as to how disasters should be prepared for and as to what role government should play in restoring order.  The government in this film (run by the American army) is given an ambiguous role to play.  Difficult decisions are required which often lead to the loss of life.  In one particularly disturbing scene, the rage virus breaks out and a crowd of people flee a building as the army officers are forced to shoot randomly into the crowd.  The moral question involves whether such actions are justified in light of the fact that the rage virus is spreading through human contact and that once contracted it leads to blind madness.<br /><br />This film begins with a group of survivors who are hiding out in an old house.  A husband and wife live together with an older family, hiding from the rage infested zombies.  However, one day a young boy comes to the house and is followed by the zombies.  The husband manages to escape but is forced to let his wife be overtaken by the virus.  The movie then focuses on the man and his children who are being brought back into the country.  The country now exists under martial law controlled by the United States military.  As it turns out however, the man's wife had a special genetic eye condition that enabled her to survive the rage virus, but she still remains a carrier of the infestation.  This leads to her infecting the populace.  The rest of the movie features the man's children and a few others trying to flee the virus as it spreads throughout the people.  Unfortunately, the man himself after making contact with his wife quickly becomes infested with the rage virus.  His children along with an army officer and a medical officer must flee the rage infested zombies.  The movie ends on a highly disturbing note.<br /><br />This film is good entertainment, but also raises disturbing questions concerning military preparedness and the role of government.  It is recommended for those who like such films and who would consider these issues while watching a movie of this type.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>Taking place 28 weeks after the events in "28 Days Later", "28 Weeks Later" is a good sequel that is hobbled a bit by knowing how the infected act, react, what they do, and how they do it.<br /><br />That's to be expected.  After all, we know who Batman is, and what powers Superman has, yet there is potential for a very good film to be made from familiar material.<br /><br />Several people have mentioned the huge plot holes.  For instance, here is a woman who has survived for 28 weeks, yet is infected.  Somehow, she is immune to the ravages of the 'Rage' virus, yet is a carrier.  That's possible (see 'Typhoid Mary').  This is the only person ever discovered to have this trait (at least so far).  Yet they strap her into a bed...and disappear!  No patient in real life is strapped into a bed and then just ignored.  And this is no regular patient.  She may represent a cure for a terrible, terrible disease.<br /><br />And then there is the question, why bring back people at all?  They bring something like 15,000 people back, put them on an island, connected by bridges loosely guarded, and expect nothing to happen?  Why not wait for, say, a couple of years?  Or, perhaps, until they discover a cure for the virus, or a vaccine?<br /><br />OK, the premise of the movie is what it is.  The question is, is the movie worth seeing?  I'd say YES.<br /><br />It's scary.  We know what the infected are capable of.  The can do superhuman feats of destruction, trying to kill whatever they can kill.  They are gruesome, they are bloody, they are fast, and they are uncontrollable.<br /><br />The movie made me jump several times, and held my interest during the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is all the more frightening when you consider that we have a threat that is facing us right now, that is all too real - bird flu.  The bad thing?  The incubation period is not seconds as it is with the rage flu (handy to tell if your patient is now infected), but days or perhaps weeks.  The infection could spread around the world before we even know it is there.<br /><br />Be afraid.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is recommended.  BTW, the extra features on the DVD are interesting and informative.  All of the actors playing the infected have dance backgrounds, and their movements were carefully choreographed.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>When I heard there would be a sequel to 28 Days Later sans Danny Boyle I was deeply dissapointed.  For one, a sequel to suck a great film just seemed to be a cheap cash in on the successful low budget first film.  For two, the talent was gone.  The first one had such a good conclusion, that a sequel seemed like it would just sully the original's story.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later doesn't fall victim to the folly of most sequels, however.  It also doesn't follow standard horror formula, as per the first film.  It's frightening, yes, but this is a film hardly chock full of idiotic one dimensional characters.  At the center is a family - part of one anyway.  Two children just return to see their father after mainland England has been all but wiped out by the rage virus.  They believe their mom is dead and soon discover she is still alive, with infection but without the symptoms.  The tension within the family sets off a series of events that allow the rage to take over once more.<br /><br />What makes the film successful is that this is not just a cheapened version of the first. It has first rate characters played by first rate actors.  Most notable is Robert Carlyle, as the father who's fear, regret, and lies lead to the virus being unleashed again.  One one side, we're feeling sorry for him, but also want to condemn his actions.  The children are the real central characters as we follow them through the film trying to survive. The actors are incredibly believable in their roles, with the characters continually making more realistic choices than you'd see in a standard horror film.<br /><br />Largely absent from this film that was in the first are the grander themes that made the first film so great.  There are still some rather intelligent observations on how the government reacts to the outbreak, where the military is seen taking all lives, including civilians.  Throughout the film, we are questioning their tactics and morality.<br /><br />The only dissapointment falls in probably the last few minutes of the film.  They obviously intend to spin this off into a franchise, but the last moments of the film make me feel like they may ruin what they have by creating run of the mill zombie pics.  However, it's only a few minutes we're talking about.  The rest of the film is dazzling, down to the attention taken to effects, music, and ambience.  It may turn out to be the next 'Living Dead' type horror franchise, continually pleasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>I am sometimes a little iffy when it comes to naughty movies.

A gory scarefest like "28 Weeks Later" qualifies, at least in their eyes.<br /><br />But as you regular readers know, I have a checkered past and have run with some pretty hedonistic crowds in my day.  I had to keep it a secret from my church group that I watched "28 Days Later" - which wasn't hard because as a rather blatant amalgam of many superior movies, I was underwhelmed.  Though at least we got a brief glimpse of Cillian Murphy's pee pee.  No such luck with Robert Carlyle in the sequel.  But in every other department this sequel outdoes the original.<br /><br />This was definitely a slow-builder but once it got going, it didn't let up until the end.  It's only 90 minutes long, but feels more like 50 minutes given that the chills and thrills come fast and steady.  Not for the very squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Most sequels are the cud that cattle spit up and chew again before digesting it in their second stomach--a rehash that takes all the best elements of the first film and robs them of flavor. This sequel is quite good at avoiding the cliches that dog most films of this type and the writer/director avoids rehashing the first film taking an original story related to the first and exploring the aftermath of the viral outbreak. The director uses many of the same techniques that director Danny Boyle used on the first to create a vibe of immediacy and reality in the action that we see and expands on this creating a sense of quiet dread.<br /><br />The film follows two children who are returned to a "safe haven" community established by the military in London. It seems that one of the children (Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots) may have some sort of genetic immunity to the virus which interests of a military scientist (Rose Byrne also in Boyle's "Sunshine"). Their father (Robert Carlyle)survived but their mother may still be out there with the infected. When the children disappear outside the city's safe area to look for their mother they risk infection and death prompting the military to look for the children.<br /><br />We get a commentary track from the director and producer. Deleted scenes with commentary by the director, an animated short that acts as a prequel to "28 Days Later" and one that acts as a bridge between that film and the sequel as well as a multi-part featurette on the making of the film.<br />Fox has done a nice job with the extras. The screener I received suffers from digital compression problems but I suspect Fox will solve those before the finished product hits the street on 10/8 (edit: 10/13as a follow up--the final DVD version released looks just fine).<br /><br />Let's be honest here if you watched the first film and didn't like it or thought it was no big deal chances are you won't enjoy the second film. "28 Weeks Later" doesn't just try to replicate the first film but expand on its story in a meaningful way. The filmmakers are pretty successful in what they try and accomplish with this imaginative sequel. It's not a radical departure nor is it a rehash of the first film. Fans who enjoyed the first film will enjoy "28 Weeks Later" although the characters aren't quite as well drawn as in the original film.<br /><br />Both this film 28 Weeks Later [Blu-ray]and 28 Days Later [Blu-ray]are available in the Blu-ray high definition format as well with similar features. I'd recommend this as it is a entertaining thriller with some fine performances.<br /><br />Remember votes aren't about if you "agree" or "disagree" with the reviewer but if the review was helpful in your decision to watch/buy/listen/read the product listed.

He quickly learns the "Rage Virus" has swept through the country changing the infected to zombies who hunt for humans to feed on. There are a handful of uninfected people, but their numbers are dwindling fast. He joins up with a group of the survivors and attempts to get out of the city, where the concentrations of diseased are, to the countryside. He and the survivors hope they will be able to wait for help and rescue.<br /><br />Written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle ("Trainspotting"), "28 Days Later" proved to be an example of what could go write in a suspenseful, well-made horror film. The filmmakers realized the key to success in this genre is to give the audience little glimpses of blood and gore and concentrate more heavily on suspense. It worked and "28 Days Later" was a cult success.<br /><br />I was worried to learn of the sequel "28 Weeks Later". In this day and age of `horror films' depicting the most gruesome acts in vivid, lurid detail, I was afraid "Weeks" would fall victim to this. I was even more worried when I learned the sequel would be released by Fox Atomic, the genre picture division of 20th Century Fox, whose most famous release to date has been the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" and it's recent sequel. "Weeks" seemed destined to be a blood bath and gore fest, losing all the elements of suspense that made the first film work so well.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by "Weeks". Surprised in a good way. Director and co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo ("Intacto", a film I am not familiar with) has kept much of what made "Days" work intact. With the lone exception of one scene in which the blood and gore fly with unnecessary abandon, the film is surprisingly suspenseful.<br /><br />"Weeks" begins a few days after the outbreak. Don (Robert Carlyle) and his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack) have holed up in a small country house with the two elderly owners and three other survivors. With all of the windows boarded up, they seem to be relatively safe, trying to deal with the shock of recent events as they eke out a living. Then, a little boy bangs on the door and they let him in, just before a hoard of the infected zombies attack the house. Don and Alice make it to the roof, but Alice is soon surrounded. Rather than risk his life, Don runs and manages to escape, turning back to see the look of disbelief on his wife's face just before they descend on her. Six months later, the US Army has secured a small area in the middle of London and are confident they have things under control. So they let some British survivors back, to begin repopulation. Don, in charge of the water and electricity of the area, anxiously awaits his children's return. They were on a school trip when the outbreak started and have spent the last six months in Spain. Tammy (Imogen Poots), 15 or 16, and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), 8 or 9, run up to their dad, excited to see him after so long. They naturally want to know what happened to mom and Don tells them a slightly different story. Tammy and Andy want to go home, to retrieve some lost possessions, so they sneak off the island and commandeer a motor scooter. Searching through their home, they are surprised to find Alice holed up in the attic. An army doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne) runs some tests and realizes Alice is infected with the virus, but is not affected by it; she is a host and can transmit the virus through her blood or saliva. Don learns of Alice's return and goes to see her. Then, all hell breaks lose as the Rage Virus starts to infect again. The army attempts to eradicate the virus, but can't control it. Tammy and Andy manage to escape with the help of Scarlet and another soldier, Doyle (Jeremy Renner). Escape is relatively easy, then they have to stay alive.<br /><br />It's a nice touch the film starts during the same timeframe of the original, introducing us to a new set of characters living through a different version of the same horror Jim experienced.<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Fresnadillo, "Weeks" takes a while to set-up the environment of the story. As Tammy and Andy arrive at the airport, vacant except for the one plane, they make the journey to the secure area on board the Tube, protected by soldiers, riding past soldiers standing sentry, listening to a soldier tell them about living in the new zone. As the subway car travels along the tracks, we see the evidence of the virus as soldiers remove the bodies from homes, stacking them in the middle of the street for disposal. But the remainder of the area is vacant. No people, no cars, no boats on the Thames, no movement of any kind. Once this is done, the film has established the environment the two kids will be living in and the difficulty they will have moving about, surviving, and making their way to safety. This is a necessary, welcome step in the process of establishing a successful suspense film. If we believe the surroundings, or environment the characters are living in, have to escape, we feel every moment of their journey.<br /><br />How they were able to accomplish the establishing shots of London is beyond me. Street after street is empty of human life. There is no point of the day, except maybe the middle of the night, when any London street has no one or nothing moving along. As the two kids ride the Tube to the protected area, we see street after street, building after building, empty. The city is deserted. The River Thames is vacant.<br /><br />The US Army is presented as a necessary evil at first. Naturally, there are no British soldiers to help with the containment; the virus has wiped all of them out, leading to the establishment of a "US-led Nato Force". Led by Stone (Idris Elba, HBO's "The Wire"), the force is very efficient and very careful to make sure everyone is safe. Some of the soldiers, Flynn (Harold Perinneau, TV's "Lost"), a chopper pilot, and Doyle (Jeremy Renner) are bored and get up to some antics, but they are going about their duties. Then, when things start to go wrong, they naturally take the most extreme route and try to contain the problem.<br /><br />The film uses a series of techniques to show quick flashes of the action, lingering on most for only a few seconds. There is a lot of handheld camera work, most of the cinematography is almost monochromatic in shades of brown, and the editing is fast and furious. The combination of these techniques help to create a unique look, giving the film a bleak, cinema verite quality which also helps to create suspense. As we never linger on any shot for very long, there are brief moments when the camera reveals a little shot of horror. Will an infected person appear at any moment and attack on of our characters? We never know because our perspective is always shifting.<br /><br />With the lone exception of one scene, the film concentrates more on building suspense than reveling in blood and gore. The majority of the shots revealing blood or violence are just enough to get our mind thinking about it and in many, the blood is black or brown. Horror is always more memorable when our own mind starts to fill in the blanks and connect the dots.<br /><br />This one scene, just before the virus breaks out again, is bloody and gory and excessive. It almost feels as thought Fresnadillo let's his better judgment lapse and lingers on some of the elements of this tableau too long. We get the idea, yet he holds the camera over parts for what is relatively a long, long time.<br /><br />That said, as much as I was grossed out, this same scene almost seems necessary. Because so many of the other shots are fleeting, giving us very brief shots of the horror, we almost need something like this to fuel the flames, to provide material for the future brief shots of people afflicted by the Rage virus featured throughout the film.<br /><br />Yes, there will likely be a "28 Months Later". The filmmakers have included a brief scene at the end of the film allowing the story to continue. Hopefully, the next film will be as successful as the first two.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>First off, if you liked "28 Days Later" then you will love "28 Weeks Later"!<br /><br />Secondly, this movie on its own, for those new to the franchise, is just flat-out awesome! The larger budget is well made use of, and what an effective sequel this is.<br /><br />There are a few of the most absolutely gruesome, and incredibly large, magnificent effects you'll ever see in this type of movie right here. You'll just flip. If you can wait until you're able to watch it in high def with 5.1 and a subwoofer, even if it's years down the road, then do so. Don't ruin it by watching it online or on a PSP or on a standard def monaural set or something...this one's a saver to savor!<br /><br />This review reflects my reaction to the film, along with my highest recommendation to others who might enjoy a nice, shocking epidemic movie.<br /><br />If you want the synopsis to the story, check it out in the product description. Otherwise..."28 Weeks Later" is freakin' hardcore outstanding! And it ties in both perfectly and sensibly to "28 Days Later" as well.<br /><br />This Blu-ray version looks and sounds absolutely incredible!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>six months after the incidents of the first movie, the mutant infected i have died of starvation and the U.S. Military decides to repopulate London where Refugees that have escaped the outbreak return to reclaim their home. a widowed father (Robert Carlyle) is reunited with his son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and daughter (Imogen Poots), all this seems nice for London's residents but a carrier of the virus soon infects some of the residents and starts to make more zombie-like rage mutants again, can some of the soldiers survive this deadly onslaught?<br /><br />A great and exciting sequel to the excellent 2002 British Sci-fi horror hit that just could be better then the original. Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and producer Danny Boyle have conjour up a sequel with  tons of action and graphic violence & more gore then the original, very nice cinematography, a well written story and of course some social commentary that made Romero's zombie movies such great classics. It's a thrilling and blood curdling apocalyptic scare-feast that is a must see for fans of the original modern classic.<br /><br />This DVD contains cool extras like commentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a "Making of" documentary, two featurettes, a 2 part look at the "28 Days Later-The Aftermath" graphic novel and theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I find myself kind of confused in regards to a couple scenes in 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the hit 28 Days Later, in where there's quite a bit of gore thrown around. Normally I would chuckle that the filmmakers feel gore will scare rather than disgust and that we will lose sleep at night because of it. Yet I didn't mind it in 28 Weeks Later and even more still, I actually liked the movie as a whole. Wonder what happened here?<br /><br />About 2 months after the events of the first film, we find that the contagious disease which turns people into mindless rampagers has been contained and there's hope as well with civilians now returning to a selected area of London. But when the virus spreads, scientist Scarlet and military sniper Doyle have to take siblings Tammy and Andy, who might carry a genetic anamoly making them immune of the virus, to safety.<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the original. Sure it had a good opening, what with a guy waking up to a deserted London, but after that it felt kind of downhill and when they got to the military compound, I got kinda bored. This film manages to keep up its tension and keeps the atmosphere uneasy and creepy so even if the characters are safe, they probably won't be for long. It's also a bit more ambitious scale-wise than the original and while that makes it feel less indie-horror and more studio horror, it still stands on its own.<br /><br />The problem with a film in the horror genre is that it doesn't really allow the characters to feel like characters but merely munchies for whatever beast is after them. Here it's a little bit different so when a character gets killed off, we actually feel sad they're gone and not just "oop, there they go". The film's grounded by Robert Carlyle as the dad who can lie and feel emotional and feels real. Then there's also Rose Byrne who must have a natural sympathizing quality because I never get the feeling she's just going through the motions in anything.<br /><br />It might not light your world on fire and be your favorite horror film ever (or zombie film for that matter) but it can probably freak you out if it can.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>As most series go, the second is usually better than the first, and 28 Weeks Later... is no exception. The rage virus is out and about again, but this time the main character is a 12-year old kid, not a middle-aged man (although he does play a big role in this movie also). Opening up with a flashback scene from 28 Days Later, this wild little thrill ride doesn't let up for the rest of the movie. Very good and gets my highest horror recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Adrenalized charged follow up to "28 Days Later, "28 Weeks Later" may not have the formers stark eeriness of waking up to a empty London, or at least what is thought as a empty London, but it more than makes up for it in action. It more than makes up for it in terror. It may not have the character development of the former, but it's storyline of a family tore apart from the "Rage" virus is definitely heartening & angering at the same time. It's story of the bond of a brother & sister is very moving, well acted & executed.<br /><br />Yes, the two movies are different, but in many ways equal. Danny Boyle is not at the directors helm for this one, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo infuses the film with his own brand of maniacal mayhem. The editing is fasted paced, more so than the first. The storyline of the US Military overseeing the survivors of the virus is a interesting & logical one. The sense of fear & terror are well done, especially the subway scene.<br /><br />All in all this film stands on it's own very well as a major contribution to it's genre. When all it's parts are summed up, it's a great sequel, though not quite as profound as "28 Days Later," nor anywhere as complex in charcter development, hence just a tad inferior, but in a oversaturated genre of Zombies & Zombie like humans, "28 Weeks Later" is a highly recommended terror fest!<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" 2007</p></br></body></html>

The $13 million budget meant that certain sacrifices had to be made, but the result is still a film of high quality.<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />Black Swan is a psychological drama along the lines of Psycho, rather than a film about dance. Nina (Portman) is a ballet dancer who wants the leading role in a new adaptation of Swan Lake. The role consists of two elements; the white swan and the black swan. She's apparently the best candidate for the role and performs the white swan better than anyone, but is encouraged to abandon her self control in order to access the emotions needed to dance the black swan role. In order to do so, she toughens up mentally, becomes more assertive and confrontational and explores her sexuality.<br /><br />Like Mulholland Dr. and Fight Club, the line between what is real and what is imagined is not obvious on first viewing. Nina is a disturbed young woman who has trouble staying grounded in reality. She imagines terrible things and obsesses about winning the role. Her duality is gradually revealed throughout the film and will frighten some people who allow themselves to become fully involved with the story.<br /><br />I won't spoil things further, but Black Swan is an interesting tale of Nina's search for perfection in her art.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are superb. The camera is frequently used to follow the dancers on stage and puts the viewer among the action. It's quite breathtaking in places. The editing and digital manipulation both convince the audience that Portman is performing all of the moves a ballet dancer might make.<br /><br />Shot partially in 16mm and also digitally, Black Swan lacks the level of detail normally associated with a modern Blu-ray presentation. Many of the scenes are dark, while others are stylistic and intentionally soft. Heavy grain is present, but the look is very similar to the theatrical presentation. This is not a poor transfer; it's an accurate reproduction of the film's original look. Don't expect to be blown away. This isn't Avatar.<br /><br />Portman trained for 10 months to learn how to move like a dancer. She also dieted so that her body fit the part. She fully deserved her Oscar nod for this performance. The supporting cast is strong in all areas, with her mother (Hershey), and her closest rival for the part of the swan queen, Lily (Kunis) both doing good work.<br /><br />The special features offer interviews with Aronofsky, Portman, Hershey, Cassel and Ryder. There's a 49-minute featurette on how the film was made, including the music, cinematography and special effects. Well worth a look if you're a fan.<br /><br />Black Swan draws you into its world. If you let it happen, you will be affected emotionally. The score enhances the experience considerably and the whole package is pleasing. It was one of the best five films of 2010.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw this movie not less than 20 minutes ago with XFinity OnDemand.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of brilliant. Captivating from the opening shot until the end credits fade out, Darren Aronofsky's latest movie is a masterpiece, and may serve to boost interest in Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, if not only for the beautiful music, than to see it performed live. Ms. Portman gives an electrifying performance. You feel as if you are drawn in, resisting the impulse to draw back because you find yourself wanting more...and you know you do. Ms. Portman is sheer perfection here. I highly recommend this movie based on Ms. Portman's performance. See this film, you will not regret it. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This film received an AA nomination for Best Picture. Tale focuses on a young ballerina who gets the major part as the Swan Queen (in Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE) but there is an issue as to whether she has the personality for the Black Swan. The stress only increases her mental illness which leads to a sometimes wonderfully creepy experience. Cassel does a great job as the head honcho of the studio, exhibiting a difficulty artist personality who you have to listen to if you want to have a career.<br /><br />Good focus on the subcultural life of ballet, especially in body expressions. Winona Ryder has a small part in this film (yes, she's still around). I thought they were going to ruin the ending but they pulled it off. Portman won Best Actress for this picture and the director was nominated.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; BALLET SUBCULTURE: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2011.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Black Swan' is the acclaimed psychological drama starring Natalie Portman as an over-stretched, tense and neurotic ballerina.<br /><br />When Nina (played by Portman) wins the star role in the ballet Swan Lake she is informed she will also have to play the role of the black swan as well. Whilst she is well suited for the Queen swan role, she finds it harder to access the emotions needed for the black swan role. This film follows her as she searches for this character within her, whilst dealing with an over-bearing mother, a sexual predator dance director and a jealous fellow dancer. Soon the cracks begin to show and her neurosis' come flooding out.<br /><br />It is shocking to see the lengths the ballet dancers go to in the name of perfection and whilst some of the behaviours are nothing new (like starving oneself, vomiting, excessive work loads and colleague animosity), they are still disturbing to watch. You feel that although Nina is a very fragile and neurotic person, she also doesn't get any type of support either.<br /><br />This film feels very weird at times as Nina loses herself in her role, which only heightens the sense of Nina's breakdown and her fragile mental state. There are lots of minor hallucinations throughout which lead up to the films crescendo and the ending, despite being mildly clich&eacute;d, does have an impact.<br /><br />Portman acts very well and gives this film it's required edge and Kunis is great as the self assured jealous dancer. Winona Ryder shows up briefly as the outgoing ballet star and overall all three actresses give top performances. The direction is also very good and you can see why this film was so lauded at it's cinematic release.<br /><br />This is a very good film and whilst it feels disjointed and confusing at times, this is all part of the plot and keeps the film edgy and tense. This is well worth a watch and while I won't be watching it again anytime soon, I am glad I took the time to view it now.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>Natalie's performance was very well done. I thought this was one of her best roles as far as showing her depth. I liked how the story reflected how people all have different parts, some clearly present and some repressed. I loved the flow of the ballet. I would like to learn how to dance like this. The workouts seemed repetitive, yet it seemed as if it would feel good to the body. Performing in front of an audience seems daunting. Natalie's repressed emotions came out with intensity only with herself. She struggled alone without real understanding. I loved the beautiful cake, I would like to make it and to eat it. Her relationship with her mother went from nurturing to controlling and you felt her underneath emotions want to release. Her letting go with her role on stage was awesome. The whole sequence was riveting. I loved how she made her ballet shoes and I loved her and the dark swans beauty, Natalie's and the other actress. The other actress showed her gusto with the air of deviousness. I loved they way she tucked into the cheeseburger and her sauciness with others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This psychological thriller is almost a horror film as we see a talented young woman totally fall apart under pressure. The film is brilliant and was able to have me feeling extreme sympathy for an unprepared young woman one minute and then to be jumping out of my seat at her dark hallucinations and then feeling mystified as to how much of what we are seeing is reality and how much is in the mind of our poor deranged young ballerina. Any film that keeps me bouncing back and forth between reality and hallucination for two hours without becoming trite is certainly well made and strategized.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky does an exceptional job with this psychological thriller that reminded me of the breakdown experienced by the surgeon played by Jeremy Irons in Dead Ringers. Natalie Portman is beyond exceptional as she plays Nina, a ballerina who has exceptional skills but who has been infantilized for so long by her overbearing mother, played by Barbara Hersey, that she has no survival skills. This is actually a key to understanding the film for a young woman who lives in a completely controlled world of stuffed animals and princess bedspreads is not prepared for the pressures of competition or for stretching herself artistically to achieve expressive goals. It is the ability to play both the White and Black swans that the artistic director, played by Vincent Cassel, is challenging Nina to achieve. Competition, especially from an attractive unorthodox dancer Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is too much for Nina to navigate. As Nina decompensates and becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive, she has considerable struggles to control the darker side of her nature that she is allowing to emerge to portray the Black Swan. Portman is brilliant as she sways from reality to hallucination and from one dark influence to another.<br /><br />There is a final reason I was highly impressed with this film. Darren Aronofsky decided to use much of the music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as background music throughout non-ballet scenes. The music is full of suspense and tension and it was brilliant to use so much of the original ballet score throughout the film. Overall , this film gets an A+.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>In `Black Swan' Darren Aronofsky depicts the pain a ballerina has to endure to successfully rise to the top of the profession, a similar theme which he had explored earlier in the film ` The Wrestler', this includes little food consumption, lot of body aches and of course sometimes bleeding toenails. Natalie Portman is the ballet dancer who is selected by the director as she embodies the character of the white swan that is innocence but he wants her to play the role of the black swan as well, of deception and intrigue. As she channels her psyche for the black swan, Portman finds that the black swan is taking over her entire persona. Acting by all the leads and supporting cast members was exemplary, Natalie Portman is truly a great actress and Mila Kunis is a revelation. Winona Ryder is surprisingly in form. The movie gathered so many accolades but I found it enjoyable but not great. Three stars. 3/30/2011</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky never fails to provoke audiences. From his 1998 film debut, Pi, to his powerful sophomore feature, Requiem for a Dream, it was clear from the start that Aronofsky was a serious filmmaker, willing to take his audiences to places they would rather not go, in order to reveal a specific truth. To this day, his films are extremely cerebral and unflinching. While Black Swan is a change of pace for Aronofsky, it is no less brutal than any of his previous works.<br /><br />Black Swan is a dark fairy tale and a psychological thriller, as well as a cautionary tale about the pursuit of artistic perfection. Natalie Portman steals the show as Nina Sairs, a young, ambitious dancer at a prestigious academy, who has just been chosen for the dual role of the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. While Nina's virginal innocence lends itself to the role of the White Swan, her instructor, the womanizing Leroy, insists that she will have to "lose herself" in order to accurately represent the openly sensual nature of the Black Swan. Suddenly, Nina begins to face corruption at every turn, coupled with what can only be described as a mental unraveling. The line between dreams and reality becomes horrifyingly blurred, as Nina tries to "find" her Black Swan.<br /><br />From the very start of the film, you feel for Nina Sairs. Natalie Portman's portrayal is a perfect balance of na?vet&eacute; and blossoming sexuality. Her transformation is heartbreaking and powerful, and by the time the credits roll, you will be speechless. This is Portman's best performance to date, for which she won an Oscar this year.<br /><br />Black Swan is a film that will swallow you whole; unfortunately, Aronofsky has included two indulgent, unnecessarily graphic sexual scenes in this otherwise flawless film. Granted, sexuality is a major theme in this film and serves the story in its own right, but there is something to be said for subtlety. The two scenes in question seem as though they were added for mere shock value alone, and in these instances, art becomes exploitation. With that being said, while I believe that Black Swan is one of the best films of the year, I must recommend it with caution. If you are easily offended, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Featuring amazing performances from all involved, including Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis, as well as an incredible Barbara Hershey as Nina's unstable and controlling mother, this is a film that demands to be seen, and is Aronofsky's best film since The Fountain.<br /><br />Black Swan is 108 minutes, and is rated R for strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language, and some drug use. Released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This film would appear to be based on mental illness. A disease that most of the times goes untreated and ignored until it is too late. In this story we meet Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She has been working very hard at becoming the prima ballerina in her New York City Ballet company.<br /><br />However, underneath that determined facade, there is a load of guilt placed there by her mother, who gave up such an opportunity in order to give birth to Nina. A side spin off of her mother's over-controlling ways is that Nina has become sexually repressed, and is not in touch with her sexuality, neither has she fully come to terms with being a young adult female. As a result, she is innocently led into some sexual experiences.<br /><br />The main concept in this movie is that it attempts to deal with parallels and opposites:<br /><br />[1] In the Ballet production, there is the White swan and the Black Swan, which for this production must both be played by Nina.<br /><br />[2] In her personal life, she begins also to display a split personality, and at times it would appear that she deliberately cuts herself. In her "white" personality, she is a virgin, and does everything to please and obey her mother, on the other hand, her "black" personality is defiant, and is sexually promiscuous.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Nina, is in desperate need of help. Everyone else seems just too busy with their own ambitions and personal goals to really notice. She is haunted by visions of her very own self. A self that is tired of all the rules and tired of all the pressure.<br /><br />The big question is, who will really win: Nina or the phantom of herself that haunts her?<br /><br />2011 Best Actress Nominee:<br /><br />It should be noted that Natalie Portman has been nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress because of this role. Her role was quite demanding, physically in terms of the dancing involved, emotionally in terms of duality of the roles that she had to play, and then there was the simulated sexual content (which I personally did not care for).</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman is compelling as a ballerina who finally comes into her own in winning the principal role in her company's production of the famous ballet "Swan Lake."  Even so, the director has his doubts regarding her suitability for this role, as the virginal and narrowly-focused perfectionist played by Portman (who even lives with her controlling mother) seems unable to "loose herself in the role."  Although she seems perfect for the "White Swan" half of the role, she lacks the sensuality and seductive powers of the "Dark Swan" that she must also play.  Enter Mila Kunis, who plays the spontaneous and worldly understudy who befriends Portman's sheltered character and eventually acts as kind of muse for the freshly-minted prima ballerina.<br /><br />As Portman's troubled ballerina struggles to find the artistic voice she needs in order to succeed in this challenging role, she is driven to the brink of insanity.  It is through this painful journey, however, that she is able to open herself to a series of creative epiphanies.  The viewer who has had to stretch and reach in a creative endeavor can identify with her plight--and with the self-doubts and distorted view of reality that come with such anxious quests for perfection, achievement, and enlightenment!  This sort of maddening creative challenge while under the control of an exacting taskmaster should be familiar to anybody who has had to write a graduate thesis!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Black Swan starring Natalie Portman is a very intense and interesting film. I've never really cared for any of Portman's performance prior to Black Swan, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and why she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Surprise, surpise...Portman is absolutely stellar in this film! Her facial expressions and dancing are what carries this film. Barbara Hershey is also fabulous as Portman's controlling mother. The only performance I found awkward and stiff was Mila Kunis's. Kunis is a beautiful woman but she doesn't have a lot of depth to pull off such a complex character. Black Swan was definitely worth all the hype, has some odd moments but overall...I'd watch it again!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar for this role.<br /><br />Other than that, my brain was a little squirmy after sitting through Black Swan.<br /><br />Portman plays Nina who has been dancing ballet for quite a long time. Her troupe is going to put on a "fresh take" version of Swan Lake and she has been chosen to star as The Swan Queen. This role is actually two as she will be the White and Black swans.<br /><br />The biggest trip of this film is that you don't ever really know what is real and what is inside Nina's mind. (She goes a little trippy with the stress of starring in such a huge production)<br /><br />Her mother is a nag, she tends to be a little OCD, Nina is majorly paranoid that a new dancer is there to take her place and all the while she needs to find some dark aspect within herself to dance the Black Swan.<br /><br />This rings out Independent Film all the way through the shoot. So if you are into that kind of feel, this will be one of your favorite movies. If you like stories where you will sit and think about the story long after the credits, you will want to talk about this with everyone you text.<br /><br />Beware as there are some strong sexual scenes and other uncomfortable moments. I'm thinking of the hangnail part and the file-through-the-face scene.<br /><br />Dark, disturbing and very artistic.<br /><br />My favorite part was the very end when we finally get to see the dance of the Black Swan.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" ingeniously merges the spectacle of dance with the base emotions of melodrama, two schools of theatricality that, if done right, are equally demanding. The result is a lurid, daring, and mesmerizing psychological thriller, one that's founded on the idea that the pursuit of perfection is not a matter of time or effort but of sanity. The line between reality and fantasy is at times easily distinguishable, but at other times is blurred to the point of sheer confusion. It challenges perceptions with questionable events and unreliable characterizations - which, I have no doubt whatsoever, were intentionally written that way. It continuously frightens us, and yet it lures us in with disturbing but beautiful imagery. This is the kind of film you don't simply watch. You experience it.<br /><br />This could not have been an easy ride for star Natalie Portman. She and Aronofsky must have known that the film's success would depend entirely on her, for her character doesn't merely drive the plot but is in fact the plot itself. Not only would she have to be believable, she would also have to be willing to tax herself physically and emotionally - and numerically, assuming you choose to interpret her work as a duel role. She would have to endure six months of ballet training and body toning. It would be a commitment, not an acting job. She was clearly more than qualified to meet these demands; her performance is brave, complex, stirring, and nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />Portman plays Nina Sayers, a New York ballet dancer driven by the need to be perfect. She practices rigorously. She rarely eats, and what little she does eat, she throws up. She auditions for the role of the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," which would require her to give a duel performance. The director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has already told her that he would be featuring her more this season. Still, there seems to be room for improvement; while he sees nothing wrong with her interpretation of the innocent and elegant White Swan, he sees all technique and no passion with the devious and sensual Black Swan. More suited for the latter is Lily (Mila Kunis) a new dancer from San Francisco. She's everything Nina is not: Relaxed, outgoing, a little bawdy, and embracing of her imperfections.<br /><br />Leroy, lecherous and creepy, tells Nina that she must be seductive as the Black Swan. She must lose herself in the role. She must be in touch with her own body. Nina would know nothing about this. She's cared for and encouraged by her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer whose expressions of love mask an alarming psychological fixation, one that fuels her artistic abilities and gives no latitude for privacy or trust. Into Nina's life enters Lily, who seems friendly enough but may actually be plotting to take over the duel role in "Swan Lake." She eventually understands the plight of Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging ballerina who was once a great star but has now been replaced.<br /><br />Nina, her rivalry with Lily doubling as a strange friendship, is ultimately consumed with revenge fantasies, ones that get increasingly shocking as the opening night of "Swan Lake" approaches. Little by little, her grasp on reality slips. For no apparent reason, a rash on her shoulder turns into a wound. Does she deal with the stress of attaining perfection by mutilating herself? Her reflection isn't quite in sync with her body - or perhaps it's the other way around. Events that seem to have taken place may not have. People who appear may not actually be there, and vice versa. The more Nina's world unravels, the more we can't stop watching; reality fades into a hypnotic dreamscape of primal urges. Some are deeply unsettling. Others include a lesbian love scene that would be frightening were it not so sexy.<br /><br />Aronofsky visualizes Nina's descent in two distinct ways. One is through the use of computer-generated imagery, and while that may be expected in this day and age (perhaps even required), it allows for the inclusion of specific symbols that are necessary to advance the story. The other is through the handheld camera work, giving the film an unsteady look. Close up shots are naturally jerky. He follows characters as they walk from one room to another. He circles dancers in broad, dramatic sweeps during major dance sequences. The images literally move along with the plot. This is what makes "Black Swan" some kind of bizarre masterpiece. It's a dark and shocking drama that stimulates the senses and plays on emotions.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Everyone who wants to see "Black Swan" asks recent viewers the same question: "Did you like it?" The answers are guarded, focusing on the film's quality acting and cinematography. But did I like it?<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Nina, a 28-year-old ballerina who is desperate to act in a new and controversial production of Swan Lake. Nina is a shy, mousy-voiced young woman who rarely goes out and who lives with her ex-ballerina mother in a New York apartment. Her mom seems strangely intent on keeping Nina secluded, setting up the movie to appear as a coming of age drama in which a talented young person needs to break away from home to become a star. But there's more than meets the eye - there's something off about the way Nina experiences the world. Meanwhile the ballet's imperious director is pushing her to "let go" of her inhibitions so she can better inhabit the role of the Black Swan, the demonic twin of the beautiful and delicate White Swan that Nina can play with her eyes closed. The tensions between Mom's protectiveness, her director's haranguing and Nina's own repressed desires perfectly propel the story.<br /><br />This ain't your ordinary ballet story. It richly deserves its "R" rating for scenes of sexuality and violence, so leave the pre-teens at home and think twice about bringing the high-schoolers. But it is a visually compelling film. The ballet scenes are gorgeously choreographed, with sound effects added (needlessly?) to enhance ballet's silent movements. Natalie Portman easily deserves an Oscar for her performance, even if the film might not. She is the desperately shy na?f, haunted by visions and fears. The rest of the cast was wonderful. As for the film itself, I am torn. The story was compelling, and far from formulaic. The scenes portraying Nina's inner life - especially her dreams - are rightly frightening, disturbing and confusing. The Jungian theme of wrestling with one's shadow -- one's denied and hated side -- prevails over everything. But "Black Swan" really only works on one level - maybe one and a half. It is often little more than a story of a woman trying to break out of her own shell, one that has both constricted and protected her. The easy message - that freedom is always and necessarily positive - is belied by the crisis that ends the film.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is interesting, intense, beautiful and disturbing. But as being neither an allegory nor a cautionary tale, it seems to have nothing to say beyond itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>When we tried to see this, every showing was sold out -except for the very last one of the evening. So we bought our tickets, strolled around a mall, and waited eagerly to view the film. It was worth the wait even though the movie had some significant flaws (more about that soon). I do understand why Natalie Portman has gotten much acclaim for her role as Nina, a young ballerina who seems to be on the rise to stardom. She might even win an Oscar for her performance. The role is extremely demanding and it is clear that she worked hard to get her body to fit the part, looking particularly thin (as many ballerinas do, almost anorexic). She also stretched her acting chops and took significant risks, including some fairly graphic sexual scenes as well as a believable depiction of a young woman with an unhinged mind.<br /><br />However, I felt very ambivalent about this film and wasn't the only one. Audiences leaving the theater were either talking positively about the film or giving it a thumbs down. Portman is superb when revealing how she tries to dig deeply within herself to portray both the White and Black Swan. The part of the White Swan comes easily to her but the darker, riskier role of the Black Swan taxes her emotionally. Nina is assured that she has the moves of an experienced ballerina. But she is criticized by the ballet company's director for her inability to bring passion to the role of the Black Swan.<br /><br />Dance fans will find a wealth of stunning choreography and insight into some parts of the world of ballet. Even those who aren't fond of ballet should be entranced by the dance scenes. I certainly was. But there seemed to be too many stereotypes. Barbara Hershey is usually a reliable actress but she seems to be off kilter here, being the overprotective mother. Nina's desire to be "perfect" resonates beyond the movie and serves as a reminder of how dancers often turn to self-destructive acts to stay in shape - throwing up, being anorexic or bulemic and more. In that regard, Nina could be at an extreme end of a spectrum of mental illness that may be all too prevalent in the dance world...although not as over the top as Nina (or let's hope not).<br /><br />Suspense is definitely created during scenes when it is hard to separate Nina's truth from fantasy. What is Nina actually seeing and what is an illusion? In some parts of the movie it is clear that she is hallucinating...in others, not so much so. In the end, I couldn't quite buy this as a psychological drama but thought it veered closer to a horror movie. Parts of this film were extremely painful to watch and if you have trouble watching someone in physical pain, including plenty of blood, consider yourself forewarned. There were plenty of gasps and moans from the audience during the particularly gruesome scenes.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't help wondering: will this movie stand the test of time? Odds are high that viewers will always be entranced by the very lovely Natalie Portman. But will the movie's theme and plot development seem credible during repeat viewings? Only time will tell whether this becomes a classic dance and psychological/horror film or simply a temporary sensation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning performance dominates this delirious psychodrama from director Darren Aronofsky. However, for all its visual bravura, "Black Swan" (2010) has little resonance. The predictable screenplay is derivative of superior films such as "The Red Shoes," "All About Eve" and Aronofsky's own "The Wrestler." A fine supporting cast (Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey) and Portman's intensity sustain your interest, yet this balletic nightmare remains decidedly overrated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A lacerating, sometimes hard-to-watch meditation on art and the artist, Black Swan is one of the most unsettling movies to gain a Best Picture nomination in some time and certainly one of the most deserving: well-acted (especially by the hit-or-miss Portman), with astonishing cinematography and masterful direction, Black Swan might be slightly below the bar Aronofky set for himself with Requiem for a Dream, but it's a modern masterpiece.<br /><br />4/4</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>I have to say that Black Swan caught me completely off guard. Watching the trailers I thought it was the typical underdog movie where a ballerina overcomes the obstacles and becomes the "Swan Queen". When I saw it in theaters, it was a completely a different experience. Black Swan is about a ballet ballerina but her biggest obstacle is herself. Being raised by an over-protective mother and being treated like a child, poor Nina never has "loosen herself". Her primal goal it's to be perfect and when her director casts her as the Swan Queen in the new production of Swan Lake she pushes herself to the limit both physically and mentally to be able to transform herself into the virginal White Swan and the seductive Black Swan effortlessly. This will cost her sanity and ultimately she succumbs to dementia.<br /><br />Black Swan is such a crazy film in the good sense of the world. It's a psychological thiller that captures you since the very beginning and never let you go until the very end. Aronofsky's direction is bold and masterful and the cast is superb. Natalie Portman carries the picture spectacularly and the film wouldn't have the same impact if it weren't for her masterful performance. She really earned her Oscar.<br /><br />Black Swan is without a doubt one of the best pictures of last year and with an excellent direction, wonderful score and spectacular performances this thriller will take you in a roller coaster of high quality entertinment.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Black Swan arrives on BD with a great transfe. Filmed with a variety of cameras, the film has a thick grain structure and skin tones are really detailed. Blacks are solid and there are no signs of compression artifacts or other anormalities. A great picture transfer by Fox. Likewise the 5.1 DTS-HD MA  is a great companion to the picture enhancing the score and providing a solid audio presentation. Dialogues are crisp and clear. Well done Fox.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />You have some goodies in the bonus features department. First and most important is the documentary "Black Swan Metamorphosis" which deals with all the aspects of the production of the film. It's a great documentary. Then also you have short promotional featurettes dealing with the ballet, production design, costumes, cast profiles and interviews and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />A digital copy is also offered.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Black Swan is an instant classic and has a lot of good qualities that makes this film a must-own title. With great video and audio and a good quality of bonus features this BD is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The black swan is probably the most original script of the year. Art and reality shake hands in this complex psychological study of a shy and dominated girl (a suffocating mother and a very exigent dance teacher) whose repressed sexual life and the excessive tension caused by intern rivalries of the cast who ardently are trying to beat her to get this first -rate role will origin a very hazardous cocktail of immeasurable dimensions that sooner or later,  will lead her to experience a set of  tense situations, unbearable stress which will conform a web of majuscule proportions and an unexpected finale.<br /><br />The "somber" was a term designed by Jung to label all of those repressions and dark labyrinths of the human soul and encloses all sort of hidden dragons who nestle into our unconscious.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is outstanding in the role of her lifetime. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman is one of those stars who has been with us since she was a child.  The usual scenario is that these child actors are history the minute they become adults.  Some of them, for one, were cute children and are not especially attractive adults yet they are caught in an image business.  Natalie Portman did not have this problem.  She grew into a beautiful woman with her acting skills finely honed as she came into adulthood.  She also studied ballet until she was 12 so this role was especially well suited for her.  I think she may well get the Oscar for it because she is able to inhabit both parts of the swan from Swan Lake, the ballet. When we first meet her she is the virginal, pristine, rigid princess type white swan.  The black swan is the evil swan so she has to bring out a whole other side of herself in order to dance the black swan.  Her sequences onstage as the black swan are some of the very best in the entire film.<br /><br />The plot is very simple and hinges entirely on the Natalie Portman swans.  It is that she starts cracking up as she pushes herself to become both swans.  This going nuts aspect of the movie is a bit over the top. I almost would have preferred a supernatural basis to her becoming the black swan. As we hurtle towards the ending, I'm reminded of the all time weeper of ballet movies, "The Red Shoes." This is not a weeper like that film but they both deal with the passion and obsession of the dance over the dancer.<br /><br />I've always liked Darren Aronofsky's work and this film is no exception. One warning: if you hate ballet, this movie may not be for you.  There are very few moments in the movie where there isn't some aspect of ballet going on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Vincent Cassel said in a recent 'Fresh Air' interview that there are a couple of roles in one's lifetime that require you to make a physical transformation.  He mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OZ2KB0">Mesrine 1 & 2 (2008, France) *ULTIMATE* 4 Disc Set (R0)</a> for him - he took on considerable weight for Part II of that film.  Here so, in 'Black Swan,' it was for Natalie Portman.  She's riveting as ballerina Nina Sayers - the once gamine Portman is all sinew, bone and iron here.  She'll get a well-deserved Oscar nomination for sure.<br /><br />Beyond Natalie, Darren Aronofsky's casting choices are excellent.  Barbara Hershey's brittle face (the result of one-too-many scalpels) give her the perfect countenance for someone with her character's infantilizing tendencies (Nina's stuffed animal-laden bedroom is a set designer's delight).  Vincent Cassel was a dancer throughout his youth - his posture, carriage and air of authority all ring true here.  Aronofsky's choice of Winona Ryder as the soloist Portman's character is replacing is his most inspired choice (there's a whiff of Mickey Rourke in that one). Her fallen star and push from the limelight trades a bit on the public's perception of her as a fallen-from-grace starlet.  Ukraine's own Mila Kunis is good here, too - her lithe physique and hard body make her a believable threat to stand in the way of Nina's dreams.<br /><br />There's a joke here about how you get guys to attend a movie about ballet: you put Portman and Kunis in bed together.  It's that scene that have led some reviewers to call this Aronofsky's "psychosexual thriller."  Whether that attracts the wrong type of crowd, I don't know.  But I will say that the scene isn't gratuitous.  It figures heavily in Nina's mental meltdown: did she dream that event?  Probably so, but even the audience is left not knowing for sure given Kunis' character's little head game.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Nina (Natalie Portman), a repressed ballet dancer, experiences breaks from reality when she lands the lead role in "Swan Lake," which requires her to explore her dark side in order to dance the part of the sensual Black Swan.<br /><br />Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance in this intense film, definitely deserving of a best actress nomination.  She is completely natural in a very demanding role that included doing much of her own dancing.  Director Darren Aronofsky reveals Nina's character to us gradually.  At first, she seems like a very together young lady with a supportive mother (Barbara Hershey) and a dream job, but we soon begin to learn that there is much more going on beneath the surface.  Aronofsky's approach allows us to make these discoveries for ourselves rather than laying it all out for us.  At times, we are not sure what is fantasy and what reality.  I felt he stumbled a bit at times (possible minor spoilers here) with some scenes of physical transformation and some business with her mother's paintings that contrasted in a jarring fashion with an otherwise subtle yet devastating portrait of obsession.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>If  you are not a fan of psychological thrillers and such then this may not be your cup of tea, obviously the shallow minded one star reviewers mostly don't like this type of flick. (other than those who though this was a movie about the love of dance! and were shocked to get this type of movie) but ignore them anyways this is a great movie about the psychological dance that we must all face in life. Only this is even more extreme in that it's about a woman pushed over the edge to succeed.  She has to deal with a overbearing mother among other things and that's never a good thing. THe blu ray looks great and Natalie deserved best actress all the way for this  movie. It's not a easy  movie to watch , nor should it be as movies about mental illness are never pleasant. Still it's worth the effort because of the story of how this dancer is consumed by her artform among other things. You must watch this with that attitude or perhaps get lost. This isn't a feel good movie but it's a intriguing one and that's well acted and it is not traditional hollywood fair in the least. Which is why those with small attention spans need look elsewhere.  Get the blu ray if you want this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This is certainly original:  it is about ballet, about a very trouble and self-destructive young woman under enormous pressure from her artistic director and herself, as well as her controlling mother, who treats her like a child; there are some weird moments when Nina thinks she is morphing into a real black swan.  Leave it to the director and writers to come up with something bizarre yet very memorable and mesmerizing to watch.<br /><br />Natalie Portman gives the physical and emotional performance of a lifetime as the bulimic dancer who wants to be perfect but will pay a terrible price for it.  Mila Kunis is fascinating as a rival dancer for whom Nina has an attraction (if you don't want to see girl on girl action, just fast forward a bit), while Barbara Hershey is in full form as Nina's pushy, infantilizing mother.<br /><br />Great choreography and photography too, and a nice soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>A-<br /><br />A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us.<br /><br />Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime - that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of "Swan Lake." Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film - reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, "Black Swan" borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of "All About Eve" in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of "Carrie" in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film "Repulsion" from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her?<br /><br />The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina?<br /><br />To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time.<br /><br />Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide - whether consciously or unconsciously - the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence.<br /><br />Freud would have had a field day with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I really looked forward to this movie, hoping it would be Natalie Portman's break out role, but alas it was little more than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD92C">The Wrestler</a> with ballerinas.  Aranofsky has no knowledge of how the ballet, much less the creative process, functions.  What he tries to create is another visceral experience, filled more with "wet dreams" than any sense of dance or the stage.  Since Natalie is obviously not much of a dancer, we see this production almost entirely from behind her right shoulder.  Symbolic perhaps, but downright annoying when it comes to seeing any dance.  Of course this movie is not about dance, it is about poor Nina's painful metamorphosis, as she tries to shake the claustrophobic world of her mother (Barbara Hershey), who had forsaken dance to have her, and get past her own limitations of "perfection."<br /><br />Mila Kunis adds a little intrigue as Lily, but Aronofsky uses her as little more than a sexual foil to Nina's growing ambitions.  The ballet master might as well have been played by Piers Morgan, as he does little more than frown and genuflect when Nina fails to give him the "black swan" he so much desires.  He taunts her into masturbating, supposedly to unleash the sexual energy he is looking for in the role.  Portman spends most of the time looking lost and confused, not sure where Thomas (Seymour Kassel) is going to go next, until she finally gets her moment on stage and literally becomes the black swan.  Although I have to say I was impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Beth.  Ryder is virtually unrecognizable, and gave the character more emotional energy than any of the other actors did their characters.  In the end this is little more than a children's story with some steamy scenes for adults, fading out exactly as had The Wrestler.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky has been circling movie news sites pretty frequently as of late. He recently signed on to direct the stand-alone sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (appropriately titled The Wolverine). He also developed a rather large and devoted fanbase over the course of directing fantastically surreal films such as Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler, but his psychological thriller Black Swan has also been gaining quite a bit of steam leading up to its December 3rd release. Despite Aronofsky's already well-established reputation and the rather high anticipation for the film, Black Swan still delivers a product that is even better than expected.<br /><br />Like most ballerinas, Nina (Portman) lives, breathes, and is completely devoted to dance. Artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) is preparing a new spring production of his interpretation of Swan Lake. Nina is next in line to become prima ballerina after the former dancer to hold that spot, Beth Macintyre (Ryder), reluctantly retires. Everything seems to be shifting in that direction until a rather unorthodox, provocative, and unstable (in a dangerous kind of way) dancer named Lily (Kunis) arrives. Lily seems to have an eye for Nina's spot as soon as she walks through the door. Thomas begins to see Nina as the White Swan, which signifies innocence and perfection and Lily as the Black Swan, which is more sensual and deceptive. The problem is that one dancer is required to play both parts. Other than the stiff competition she has to deal with, The Swan Queen role begins to take its toll on Nina who begins to think Lily wants even more than her spot in the production. Nina's obsessive behavior leads to her releasing her dark side that she must now struggle to control.<br /><br />Aronofsky has always had an exceptional eye for cinematography in his films. His use of micro-photography in The Fountain made the entire film a visually stunning spectacle that will stand the test of time while something like a someone's pupil dilating or a drug deal gone bad in Requiem for a Dream is memorable because of the way and angle Aronofsky shot it rather than relying on its disturbing content to make the scene a classic. Black Swan is no different. Being placed behind Nina whenever she heads to the dance venue gives the viewer a rather unique third person perspective that also gives the impression that you're walking right behind the main character of the film. The intense dream sequences are also shot in a way that flawlessly blur the line between reality and hallucination. Is this really happening or is it all a figment of Nina's deteriorating imagination? Figuring that out is half the film's charm.<br /><br />The extraordinary main cast is the main ingredient to the film being as great as it is though. The key players all seem to have this twisted side to them that is nearly the exact opposite of the way they first appear to be, which coincides with the Swan Lake theme. Winona Ryder steals most of the screen time she's given whether she's trashing her dressing room, yelling obscenities in Portman's face, or sitting in a hospital room. Even though Mila Kunis seems to play nothing more than her role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall to the most extreme degree on the surface, it's the edge she's given that results in unpredictability for her character. While Vincent Cassel's performance is strong thanks to his sensual reputation with his dancers and Barbara Hersey is both charming and disturbing as Nina's mother who seems to secretly be trying to live in her daughter's dance shoes after a missed opportunity in her past, it's no surprise to hear that Natalie Portman is the heart of the film. Nina is so consumed with dance that she keeps pushing herself even when her mind and body begin to show her that she's had enough. Her breakdowns are heartbreaking and engaging to watch while her transformation by the end of the film can best be described as a monstrous beauty. It's all thanks to Portman's powerful, phenomenal, tour de force performance.<br /><br />While some might not be surprised that Aronofsky has created yet another masterpiece, this may be his most solid and well-rounded film to date. Black Swan is a beautiful, disturbing, and captivating work of art that features gorgeous camera work, an excellent and mindbending story, and what is perhaps the performance of Natalie Portman's career. It's hard to argue with Black Swan being the best film of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>With this dark and audacious look at artistry and dance, bad boy auteur Darren Aronofsky once again pushes a film's intensity past all point of reason.  "Black Swan" will be alternately hailed a masterpiece and an over-indulgent piece of excess.  Or, more appropriately, perhaps it is a masterpiece of excess.  More akin to the fantastical setting of "The Fountain" than to the confrontational realism of "The Wrestler," Aronofsky has created a remarkably vivid bit of lunacy with "Black Swan."  And to be fair, I think he absolutely succeeds in what he has set out to do--creating a hyper dramatic nightmare that blurs the lines between reality and madness.  Thematically, many films have covered the same ground--but few so visually, stylishly, or in so unapologetic a way.  No matter how many films Aronofsky unleashes on the world, I will always hold the feverish "Requiem For a Dream" closest to my heart--but for visceral thrills, "Black Swan" rates a very high second.<br /><br />Equal parts "The Turning Point," "All About Eve," and "Repulsion," "Black Swan" tells the story of a ballerina struggling for perfection.  Natalie Portman is cast as the dancer given the shot of a lifetime--to play the lead in a new revival of "Swan Lake."  It's a dream part, but one that is fraught with peril.  The director, Vincent Cassel, thinks Portman is perfect for the technical aloofness of the program's White Swan but lacks the fire and abandon when the dance transforms her into the Black Swan.  And Portman pushes herself and pushes herself, to the point that her body is manifesting strange physical trauma.  Cassel tries to unleash the passion of the Black Swan while the company's newest dancer (Mila Kunis) seems to embody the darker freedoms that Portman needs to embrace to be successful.  And the more Portman throws herself into the role mentally and physically, the film starts to push into the territory of unrepentant psychological thriller.<br /><br />Portman's descent into madness is exquisitely uncomfortable and off kilter.  As the film becomes progressively violent and unpredictable, the lines between what is real and what is imagined become impossible to untangle.  Aronofsky stages it all like a brilliantly choreographed high wire act.  If you go with the flow, you'll be caught up in a thrillingly original nightmare.  Portman has never been better.  She pushes herself both physically and psychologically here, and hers is surely one of the most heartrending and affecting performances of the year.  Cassel is perfect straddling the line between mentor and villain,  Kunis has just the requisite wildness, and Barbara Hershey goes for broke as Portman's domineering mother.  However, in approximately three minutes of screen time, it is Winona Ryder (as an aging dancer replaced by Portman) that provides one of the film's most indelible performances.<br /><br />That said, I did love "Black Swan."  I won't say that it's brilliantly filled with deep meaning--but I will say that it's brilliantly entertaining.  The dancing is perfection and the final performance is absolutely chilling, truly not something to be forgotten!  A great score (it's hard to go wrong using Tchaikovsky), dynamic cinematography, top notch performances, fantastic visual effects all combine to make this one of the truly memorable films of 2010.  Let's hope Aronofsky never loses his touch for demented fever dreams--even as he's moving into Wolverine territory.  KGHarris, 12/10.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Possible Spoliers<br /><br />What happens when you work so hard for a part and you finally get it? Well for a ballerina named Nina (Natalie Portman, "The Professional") it starts as a great wonderful feeling but jealousy and perhaps some insanity leads to her feeling everyone is out to get her. Once she lands the role in a retelling of Black Swan her director (Vincent Cassel, "Brotherhood of the Wolf") seems to take even more of a liking to her, which a former ballerina (Winona Ryder) tries to warn Nina about. Of course a new upstart comes in (Mila Kunis, "Friends With Benefits") and Nina's obvious mental grip loosens as she is determined to make this role happen and give her greatest performance.<br /><br />While this sounds like fairly typical writing in normal circumstances, director Darren Aronofsky ("The Wrestler") handles it quite well as he presents a true obsession by nina gone horribly wrong as it all seems to be in her head, or is it? It is quite creepy in parts, there is the much talked about scene between Kunis and Portman which doesn't actually take away from the film like some of those type of scenes do.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about Black Swan was it was fairly relentless in it's portaying of Nina's descent into madness, also showing some aspects of her life that show how it isn't too shocking she was mentally unstable even more so as the movie went along. The performances are great, Cassel does well as the director, Kunis does well also as does Ryder but to me the two standout performances are by Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom and of course by Portman herself as this is a career defining role for her. Its well worth watching and doesn't disappoint. **** out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>With a story based on Russian folk tales, Pyotr Tchaikovsky composed SWAN LAKE about 1875.  Although it was not well received on its debut, over time the ballet has become a world-wide favorite, and it is particularly noted for the fact that the prima ballerina must play both the virginal White Swan "Odette" and her alter ego, the wanton and evil Black Swan "Odile."  Directed by Darren Aronofsky and with story and script fashioned by writers Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin, BLACK SWAN pivots on this schism--and owes a significant debt to three other notable films: PERSONA, in which two women have a relationship that confuses their personalities; THE RED SHOES, in which a ballerina becomes excessively involved in her role; and REPULSION, in which a sexually disturbed young woman collapses into insanity.  The film also owes a debt to such films as MULHOLLAND DR in the sense that it is difficult to know what is really happening to the ballerina and what is only occurring in her own mind.<br /><br />In a general sense, the story concerns ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), who has spent her career in the corps de ballet and whose great ambition as a dancer is to be absolutely perfect--an ambition that has rendered her flawless in precision but a shade lacking in passion.  When the company's leading ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) is essentially dismissed due to increasing age and an unstable temperment, Nina is announced as the star of a new production of SWAN LAKE.  Her confidence, however, is undermined by competing ballerina Lily (Mila Kunis), her suffocating mother (Barbara Hershey), and her choreographer (Vincent Cassel.) Under the pressure, and repeatedly told that she lacks the passion for the Black Swan, Nina begins to descend into a series of delusions that may be stress, personal fantasy, or flat out schizophrenia.  All of the moments are presented with remarkable power, and they lead to an uncertain but powerful conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is memorable throughout, and Natalie Portman justly walked away with an Oscar for her performance.  At the same time, the film is not without flaws.  The first half of the film feels somewhat slow and overall the movie is icy cold.  Since every one of them deeply competitive and resorts to manipulation in an effort to dominate others, none of the characters are likeable or sympathetic, and the progression of the film seemed a bit spotty to me, skipping from one point to another without always connecting the dots.  Even so, it is a truly intriguing film, wildly Freudian, intensely paranoid, and unusual in every way.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Black Swan has been receiving a lot of acclaim since its theatrical release but it is also subject to a lot of criticism. Those who have enjoyed the movie consider it nothing short of brilliant while some other viewers were simply disgusted by it. It just shows how divided people can be over a movie. I can clearly see why some viewers disliked it: not enough dancing, the sexual scenes, some disliked Natalie Portman's acting, the movie was too weird and so on. I am one of those who really enjoyed Black Swan, at first I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be an excellent film and one that I consider to be in the top movies of 2010. It was very different from other movies I've seen this past year. I loved the tone and direction taken by Darren Aronofski, Black Swan is easily distinguishable from the other movies of 2010.<br /><br />Nina Sayers is a Ballet dancer living with her mother in New York who lands the main role in an upcoming production of "Black Swan". At first Nina seems too sweet an innocent to play the Black Swan although she does seem to have the perfect characteristics for the White Swan. The director of the production doesn't see her as able to portray the role of the Black Swan even if sees her as the White Swan. Her forces and provokes her to see that passion and desire to be the Black Swan. Nina struggles with the pressure of the role and this is where the psychological part of the movie beings. The role makes her do things and act certain ways that she normally would not, it's almost as if she becomes the role.<br /><br />Black Swan is a psychological thriller, right there this is an indication that it is not for everyone. Those expecting a nice and innocent movie about Ballet will be deceived as there are some twists and it goes further and more deeply than Ballet itself. I thought it was brilliant how they showed Nina's inner psychological struggles with herself and the pressure that comes from playing the main role in the production of Black Swan.<br /><br />The hallucinations from which she suffers, her paranoid behavior and inner struggles were very well displayed.  Much of the criticism addressed at the film is due to the self-mutilation and touching and the girl on girl action scenes and I can understand how some found this disgusting and of a lack of taste.I don't think this ruined the movie but such displays on screen are very unappealing to plenty of viewers. It's interesting to watch the transition from the angelic and innocent Nina to what she eventually becomes, yet we also have the feeling that she's the same person all along but the role changed her somehow. Her relationship with her mother is an excellent example of this and the emotions displayed in the movie are very easy to relate to (I know for me it was). Also interesting to consider that the movie had a relatively low budget of 13 millions, it goes to show that movies with low budget can be successful and be acclaimed just as much if not more than big budget productions.<br /><br />Natalie Portman delivered a solid performance as Nina, I believe she was a perfect choice to play the lead role. Yes, Portman did not do all of the dancing and a double was used. But what did you expect? It takes years to be a ballerina so it was obvious that she was not going to do all of the dancing. She won an Academy award and a few other awards for best actress for her performance.  Mila Kunis also gave a solid performance as Lily. French actor Vincent Cassel did a job as Thomas Leroy, the director of the production, effective to say the least. I'm not a fan of Ballet but I do consider an art and a beautiful one at that, that's exactly what the dancing was: beautiful.<br /><br />Black Swan is brilliant, intriguing and very well made but it obviously won't be everybody's cup of tea but we're all allowed to have our own opinions aren't we? I love Black Swan because it delivers what it promised a psychological, interesting and a times complex movie, it's an experience. As much as I liked it I have to say it's a love or hate it movie, barely any middle ground. Viewers will either love and be captivated by Black Swan or absolutely hate it, as simple as that. I was pleasantly surprised and have to say I was certainly not deceived and it surpassed all the expectations I had. 5/5 from me, but that's just my 2 cents on the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Black Swan took a turn I did not expect. I knew Nina was a disturbed soul but not to this extent!  Talk about haalucinations.  She had the grand mal seizures of hallucionations!  It was fascinating to watch this film unfold and watch as Nina slowly slips into the grasps of insanity.  Everyone can relate to her on some level.  natalie Portman was fantastic and I feel that she deserved the oscar, hands down.  Winona Ryder was barely in the film but it was nice to see her acting again. I also enjoyed the perfromance by Mila Kunich.  Black Swan is a fantastic dark thriller with a great story and superb acting.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>As one brilliant reviewer put it, this movie stays with you long afterward and that, to me, is the hallmark of an extraordinary experience. I will be dreaming about and thinking about this fantastic movie for days and would happily pay box office prices to see it again.<br />Natalie Portman - an actress I'm not that enamored with - gives the performance of a lifetime as the ballerina who is steadily and rapidly breaking down psychologically. The movie joyfully toys with what is real and what is her illusion and, even though the black swan/white swan concept is somewhat in your face, the twists and surprises kept me guessing as to what was real and what was not. The supporting cast does stellar work, particularly Barbara Hershey as Portman's controlling mother and fading prima ballerina Winona Ryder. But it's the vision and Portman's riveting performance that were so compelling and captivating.<br />I recommend the theater if possible as the experience is so much greater when you find yourself lost in this oft-surreal world. For what it's worth, I saw True Grit and enjoyed it. Black Swan was immensely better. This is one I will surely buy when it comes out on dvd. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)<br /><br />There are professions where, while people claim to look on in horror, it is an accepted tradition that young girls are, for all intents and purposes, locked away and made slaves in service of their craft. Gymnastics is the classic, and most widely-publicized, example thanks to a few Eastern European tyrant coaches, but figure skating and ballet are two others that come to mind pretty readily. You have to wonder how much Andres Heinz (whose only previous credit is as director; he was responsible for the highly underrated 1998 film The Origin of the Species), who wrote both the original story upon which this film is based and co-wrote the screenplay adapted from it, was thinking of Bela Karolyi when creating the character of Tomas. Vincent Cassel, who plays Tomas, has said in interviews he was thinking Balanchine, natch, but IMDB reports the original script was theatrical, not ballet-based, so I'm giving Heinz a little more leeway in his influences. One way or the other, what we have here in Black Swan is a typical "girl coming out of her shell" script... but then, nothing is typical in the world of Darren Aronofsky. The word "visionary" is overused indeed when it comes to directors, but look at what Aronofsky and the stable he keeps close around him (most notably composer Clint Mansell, who once again turns in a top-notch score) have accomplished in the past ten years and tell me it doesn't apply. Where body-horror auteur David Cronenberg abandoned body horror when he moved onto his brilliant realist films of the past decade, Aronofsky has spent the same decade figuring out how to integrate Cronenberg's vision of body horror into realistic movies. (Think about Jared Leto's arm during the last half-hour of Requiem for a Dream.) Black Swan, with everything from its depictions of common ballet injuries to the infamous final scene of the trailer, is his fullest realization of Cronenberg's tradition yet. And yet no one could ever possibly mistake this for a David Cronenberg film; it is Darren Aronofsky through and through.<br /><br />Nina Sayers (The Professional's Natalie Portman, recently of The Other Boleyn Girl) is a ballet dancer. She's dedicated, but she hasn't garnered the respect that her mother (The Last Temptation of Christ's Barbara Hershey) thinks she deserves. Is she right? (Note that she says Nina is the company's most dedicated dancer, not their most talented.) We don't know, not really. I'm assuming you, like me, are not a ballet dancer yourself. One way or the other, though, Tomas (Cassel, recently of Cronenberg's Eastern Promises), the tyrannical head of the company, decides to cast Nina in the lead role in his new, "stripped down, real" production of Swan Lake over the girl he'd previously chosen, Veronica (the gorgeous Ksenia Solo, in her first big-screen role since 2003's The Republic of Love). We find out quickly enough that he has a number of reasons for this, very few of which seem to have to do with Nina's innate talent. In fact, he tells her on a number of occasions that while her icy control is perfect for the role of the white swan, there's not enough true passion in her to correctly dance the role of the evil-twin black swan. And thus, as I said at the beginning, the story of the girl coming out of her shell. She's helped along by Lilly (The Book of Eli's Mila Kunis), the troupe's newest member, as well as by Tomas' attempts at seduction and her finally deciding that her mother's stifling her. But as the pressure mounts, Nina finds herself moving farther and farther from the world of the stripped-down and the real...<br /><br />Fifteen year ago, Vincent Cassel--son of the great French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel--popped up in Mathieu Kassovitz' first film, La Haine, playing a wannabe gangster, racist, and all-around scummy guy. He was absolutely brilliant, and it was obvious that of the trio of leads from that movie, Cassel was going to be the one who would go on to at least indie stardom. (Hubert Kounde is doing a successful turn in French television these days, while Said Tagmoui has become a reliable character actor). Since then, Cassel has made some resounding successes (Sheitan, Eastern Promises) and some dismal failures (Derailed, anything with the word "Ocean's" in its title), but never has he owned a role the way he did Vinz... up to now. Tomas is slick where Vinz was rough, but the same snake writhes under the surface, and Vincent Cassel knows how to play that snake. Moreover, Cassel was about as perfect a choice for the role as one could get; he's sexy, but in that low-rent way that turns so well into disgusting-homeless-guy (viz. Sheitan). He's not a classy seducer, he's rough sex in smoke-filled bathrooms (viz. Irreversible, and I will leave you to decide whether that was a success or a failure). But Tomas is, in the small world of his ballet company, a rock star, and Nina sees none of that griminess both inherent in Tomas and that Cassel brings to the role. On the other side of the coin you have Lilly, for whom the term "low rent" could have been coined. She says "bad influence" from the moment you meet her, with those big black wings tattooed on her back, and you know that if Nina gets tangled up with her, things will not end well. But you also know that Nina, so desperate to get out from under her mother's thumb, is absolutely going to get tangled up with Lilly.<br /><br />What I'm telling you here, other than that if Vincent Cassel doesn't pick up a Best Actor nom a lot of people in the Academy should be dropped off moving buses, is that there's nothing here you haven't seen before, nothing you haven't read in a dozen Angela Carter fairy-tale retellings. Hell, nothing you don't know from Swan Lake, except that it would be quite a stretch of the imagination to cast either Tomas or Lilly in anything other than a shade of grey far deeper than that to which Nina's clothes have progressed by the end of the film. This movie doesn't deserve the slew of Oscars it should get because it's telling you an original story. It deserves them because of how Aronofsky is telling you that story, because of all the little touches far more subtle than split toenails and tattoos of black wings. Because, according to IMDB, Aronofsky was actively pitting Portman and Kunis against one another backstage to heighten tension on the set. Because the physical-therapy scene was real (Portman dislocated a rib onset). Because everyone in this movie nails their roles (and did I neglect to mention Winona Ryder as the bitter drunk ex-principal, and all the glorious meta under the hood there?). Because even though you have to know what's coming on some level, especially after that last scene in the hospital where Aronofsky comes so dangerously close to overplaying his hand, that last scene in the dressing room still comes as enough of a surprise that you realize that, as in all the best films of this type, you were hoping Aronofsky would cheat and hand you a different climax, even though that would have made this not nearly as good a film as it is. (And come on, did you really expect the guy who gave you Jennifer Connelly cuddling with a bag of heroin, blissful expression on her face, at the end of Requiem for a Dream--and the dirty, disgusting, utterly sexy scene before it--to pull a single punch anywhere in this film? It is testament to the greatness of Darren Aronofsky that I most certainly did.) Because of the delicious little details. ("What happened?" "[sigh] I have a life. You work too hard.") Because Black Swan is the best thing I've seen on the big screen in first run since El Laberinto del Fauno four years ago, and the best film I've seen in any format from 2010 (to be fair, as of this writing, I haven't yet seen the two films that word on the street says may beat it for the Oscar, The King's Speech and Blue Valentine, nor have I seen Poetry). Because Darren Aronofsky did what I didn't think he could: he made a better film than Requiem for a Dream. It is not a perfect film, but it's as close to it as America has seen in ten years. It is beautiful and brutal and deeply, deeply affecting, and you must see it. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Black Swan", the new film from director Darren Aronofsky ("The Wrestler". "Requiem for a Dream", "Pi") tells the story of a young ballerina desperate to play the lead in the company's new production of "Swan Lake". The film provides the opportunity for Natalie Portman to turn in a tour-de-force performance, easily the best in her career/<br /><br />When actors take on new roles, my romantic notions of the film industry try to take over and I like to think they do so for "the challenge". They want to try something new, to challenge themselves to create a completely different character. Hopefully, they will lose themselves in the role and come close to making something they are proud of, something the public will remember for the ages. Obviously, this rarely happens, but it is an ideal a lot of actors strive for. But the very concept of "Movie Star" works against the possibility. As an actor's star rises, they become more and more recognizable, making it more difficult for them to lose themselves in a particular role. Fame steps in and it becomes all about opening your film at #1 to justify your next $20 million paycheck. It becomes all about becoming the next Will Smith or Bruce Willis. Then it all becomes about maintaining that status with one blockbuster after another.<br /><br />It is, at first, refreshing to watch "Black Swan" and watch Natalie Portman lose herself as she portrays Nina Sayers, the young ballerina. As you watch Nina deal with all of the pressure in her life, you frequently forget you are watching the actress, she goes through so many difficult emotions it is almost remarkable we believe in her portrayal of this character. The role could easily shift into "over the top" mode, but Portman shows a fine restraint.<br /><br />Then, as we begin to get lost in the role with her, and we begin to share her feelings and experience what she is going through, we begin to feel unsettled. We feel her pain, her desperation, her paranoia and we realize the film is pushing us into this unsettling world, making us a bigger part of Nina's life.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is about Sayer's obsessions. She has worked all of her life as a ballerina and desperately wants to play the lead. She is the most dedicated dancer, as her mother (Barbara Hershey) comments, and can perform all of the moves perfectly, as Tomas (Vincent Cassel), the company's director notes frequently, but he wants a lead who can also portray the passion necessary for the role. He wants someone who can play both the White Swan and her evil twin, the Black Swan. And to get the performance he wants, he is willing to go employ some unorthodox methods. Can he control her? Can he coax the right performance from her? Can he seduce her? Can he awaken her passion, sensuality and sexuality?<br /><br />As the pressure on Nina increases, her fears and paranoia grow. A new girl arrives at the company just before Nina wins the coveted role. But Nina notices Lily right away; shortly after she arrives, Nina and Tomas watch Lily practice and she exhibits exactly the type of uninhibited moves the director wants. From that moment, Lily appears to be both supportive and a back-stabber, her attitude and manner seem to change every moment.<br /><br />Nina still lives with her mom (Hershey) who is extremely supportive and protective, maybe too supportive and protective.  She dotes on her daughter because she has the chance she never had as a ballerina. Nina lives in her childhood bedroom and it looks like it could be a time capsule, twin bed, flowery sheets, and stuffed animals. All of this points to a young woman who has a lack of maturity and this will help lead to her paranoia.<br /><br />And Nina also becomes a little unhinged when she witnesses the treatment of Beth McIntyre (Winona Ryder), the previous star of the company. It is very clear Beth doesn't want to relinquish the starring role in any production, but she doesn't have any say in the matter. Nina recognizes that she is ascending because Beth is on the way out, but she still idolizes the older ballerina, to a certain extent. Beth's life enters a downward spiral and Nina watches everything with great interest. At first, she is fascinated by Beth's actions and then she quickly becomes alarmed.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky is a unique director. He clearly works on projects that interest him and he creates unusual, intense films, films that may not be everyone's cup of tea or reach a large audience. Good for him. If every director only worked on projects that inspire them, films would be a lot better. If people are working on projects that impassion them, they are bound to make a better film.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is not a film that everyone will want to see. The film's backdrop of a ballet company is sure to turn away many potential fans. But Aronofsky uses this as the perfect backdrop for his portrait of obsession and claustrophobia. As we get to know Nina, see her watch everyone else, it becomes pretty clear that she is pretty nervous. She wants and needs to become the star, but once she does, she becomes afraid of losing this role to the new girl in the company. Every time she turns around, she senses Lily is watching her. Is she laughing at her? Does she want the lead in the production? Nina decides Lily is someone she should watch, to be aware of her, but also because she is someone who intrigues the young ballerina.<br /><br />Because the company is small, most of the practice space and backstage area is also small. The bulk of the property is for the theater. So the ballerina's spend a lot of time in very little space, practicing their moves, learning the roles. As Nina becomes more obsessed and consumed, the walls seem to close in on her. It doesn't help that she lives in a small apartment with her mother, sometimes confining herself to her own small room. And because they live in New York, everything seems pushed in. To further emphasize the point, the camera always seems close to people and even then, a lot of people seem to be fluttering around the edges.<br /><br />As Nina becomes more unhinged, Lily suggests she let herself go, experience a little sexual awakening. Nina seems to latch on this as a way of helping her become the Black Swan, to help her become less inhibited. Tomas seems to tell her as much. So as she becomes obsessive about the role, about the performance, she also starts to unleash this part of her personality, underdeveloped as it is, and this only adds to the confusion and stress her character experiences.<br /><br />I really liked "Black Swan". The director and lead were able to do something few can, fully immerse the viewer in the life of a character. It has some problems, most notably a couple of scenes in which Winona Ryder chews the scenery, but they aren't enough to detract from the overall experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>BLACK SWAN is the story of a ballerina driven to insanity by her drive to succeed and to be perfect.  It's also one of the more purely fascinating movies of 2010.  Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career as Nina, the dancer.  Nina has been with the professional ballet company headed by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) for a number of years, and she's hoping this will be the year she gets a lead role.  He's reviving SWAN LAKE, and needs a new White Swan/Black Swan.  Nina is a technically proficient dancer who will do well as the prim, proper, chaste White Swan.  But where is her fiery passion and urgency that will be needed to play the Black Swan?  She doesn't dance with the lack of self-control that his character calls for.<br /><br />Portman's character is something of a clich&eacute;.  How many times do we see the driven perfectionist who can't let go and allow herself to let her feelings show because she's so concerned with getting the technical aspects perfect?  It's hardly a new idea.  Neither is the introduction of the character Lily (Mila Kunis), a carefree, full-of-smiles dancer who joins the company.  She isn't so dedicated to her art that she can't go out and party.  But she dances with the ease and passion that Portman cannot muster.  The two develop a tentative relationship...but is Lily really a fierce competitor, trying to psyche out Nina?<br /><br />And Nina doesn't need much mental manipulation.  She lives with her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who babies and controls her daughter to the point of suffocation.  Nina is also mentally teased by Thomas...who tries to trick and manipulate his dancer into showing something new on stage.  To say that Nina puts tremendous pressure on herself would be an understatement.  She chews her nails and compulsively scratches herself, leaving tears in her skin.  And she sometimes sees things that aren't there.  Nina is tightly wound, neurotic and obsessive when the film begins.  As things progress, we can see, with great clarity, how she begins to lose herself more and more.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more, because the journey Nina takes is fascinating.  What's amazing to me is that this movie is really a potboiler or melodrama.  It follows a clich&eacute;d path, treads familiar ground.  Yet every moment of it feels new and real and dangerous.  Director Darrin Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER) has done an amazing job of constructing the film to feel like a deep psychological study and a period thriller at the same time.  It feels like something from the `60s or `70s and like something modern and edgy at the same time.  He has chosen to film in digital video, and for once, the low budget choice works.  The film has a slight darkness and fuzziness to it that only helps the mood.<br /><br />The screenwriters have also written about the details of ballet and SWAN LAKE in a way that lets viewers totally unfamiliar with the story have a good sense of what is going on.  We understand the show and what Nina is trying to achieve.  And for those many folks who say the ending is hard to figure out, I can only say, "you're trying too hard."  It is a fascinating and gripping ending...but it is quite clear.  Don't be turned away because you think you won't be able to "get" the film.  I found it surprisingly accessible.  My 18 year-old daughter had no trouble grasping it. (Although there was enough sexuality in the film to make me uncomfortable at having brought her.)  I didn't hear people grumbling on the way out of the theater either (and the place was packed, by the way...I think this little art film is going to make some pretty decent money.)<br /><br />And please don't miss it, because you'll miss some good (even great) performances.  Cassel is perfectly cast in the very clich&eacute;d role of the artistic director.  Pompous, self-centered and yet somehow alluring...we see the creative side along with his cruelty.  Hershey is frightening in her role...reminding me of Bette Davis in her BABY JANE days.  And Mila Kunis continues to tackle unexpected and challenging roles...and with BLACK SWAN, she has put her days as Jackie on THAT `70S SHOW behind her.  And Natalie Portman is a slam dunk for an Oscar nomination with her riveting performance.  She's on screen for the entire film, and must accomplish much of the dancing herself.  She looks weary, frightened, fragile, strong and dedicated.  Her work here is so accomplished and takes us on such a journey; I was exhausted by the end because the ferocity of her work gripped me so tightly.  It's easily the best female performance of the year.  For her work alone, the movie is worth seeing.  Fortunately, there's plenty else to enjoy in the gripping, highly-recommended BLACK SWAN.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Black Swan" is a fantastic psychological thriller that chronicles one determined ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman), as she rises to the top of her craft, landing the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan in her company's production of "Swan Lake." Nina has a hard time letting loose and finding the passion needed to portray the Black Swan. The stress of the production leads her to experience physical ailments, engage in wicked banter with her mother (Barbara Hershey), and become paranoid about a perceived rivalry with a new dancer (Mila Kunis). This is a terrifying movie, far scarier than most horror movies that have emerged in the last decade. Portman's performance is astonishing and all but guarantees her an Oscar nod. The final dance sequence in the film is unbelievable, and I literally got chills at the end of the movie, which never happens.

It's a downer, but knowing that from the get-go, there's little to interest besides the sex scene. The acting is good, but Mila Kunis is the real gem here. I said it after Closer and I still believe it today - Natalie Portman is not much of an actress. She peaked with The Professional. She has a cute face, but carries no dramatic weight. Isn't that what we have Sandra Bullock for?<br /><br />Here would be a twist for Aronofsky, recast the Natalie Portman role with Mickey Rourke.

Portman stars as Nina, a ballet dancer who must compete for the main lead in the Swan Lake play. Nina's mother is very controlling and treats her like a child. (Similar to Carrie White's mother) Nina starts having hallucinations and becomes paranoid because she really wants the part of both the White and Black Swan. I would recommend BLACK SWAN!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.

The film succeeds at thrusting the viewer into the world of a woman who is achieving her dream, which turns out to be more of a nightmare. The strange psychotic episodes that she endures blur the line between fantasy and reality for not only her, but the audience. This film is a very strong effort that will capture the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Every year I have one movie that just surprises me - a movie that blows away all my expectations.  2009 it was The Hurt Locker.  For 2010 that movie that defied all my pre-conceived notions was director Darren Aronofsky's glimpse into insanity known simply as Black Swan.<br /><br />If you hadn't already learned, 2010's highly acclaimed drama Black Swan is about ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman).  After four years in a prestigious New York City ballet studio (I don't remember the title of the company ever being given within the film) Nina tries desperately for the part of the Swan Queen in the year's production of Swan Lake.  The company leader, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), is a strong willed man who lets no boundaries come between him and his vision, willing to make aggressive, sexual advances solely to make a point on how he wants a performance to be done.  When Nina auditions she perfects the routine for the White Swan, but is told by Leroy that she simply is too uptight and controlled to play the White Swan's evil doppelganger, the Black Swan.  After biting the Leroy's lip when he attempts to sexually assault her Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen with Leroy claiming that the biting incident was the spark he needed to show she was capable of the role.<br /><br />Nina is a goody-two-shoes having the color pink enshrouding her entire room and living under the care of her overbearing mother (note that Nina is clearly out of her teens) who wishes for the best but also causes Nina to be incapable of truly living outside of the ballet.  Her mother wishes the best for her daughter, but it is clear she's been too controlling of her daughter's life, which in part is the cause of the Nina's tragic downward spiral.  At first glance she is a caring mother, but as the plot progresses it is clear her control reaches far too deep into Nina's life<br /><br />Nina at the same time meets with a new dancer, Lilly (Mila Kunis), who unlike Nina isn't a perfectionist, but comes across as very natural.  Lilly is also an outgoing girl, smoking in the studio, taking drugs, and filling her evenings with wild sexual exploits.  Eventually, Nina is brought in by Lilly's advances and begins a descent into darkness.  But as the plot progresses further towards its destructive climax Nina begins to believe that Lilly is not out to befriend her, but instead attempting to steal from her the role of Swan Queen which she had worked so very hard to achieve.  The film ends with the opening night of Swan Lake where everything ties together in a special effects fueled finale.<br /><br />The trailers in no way prepared me for the nightmare that is Black Swan.  Black Swan is perhaps the best psychological horror film of the last five years, if not the decade!  I knew nothing about ballet (except a few holiday visits to the Nutcracker), but this movie made sure it was all easy to follow for those uninitiated in the art.  Easily understood is the common notion of an individual seeking perfection, and that is Nina's flaw.  Perfection is what she seeks and with her good nature taking the role of the Black Swan begins to drive her mad and Natalie Portman plays the part pitch-perfect!<br /><br />I knew the buzz, knew that Aronofsky is one of the great directors currently working, yet up until I arrived at the theater I doubted that a movie centered on ballet would entertain me as a male member of the audience.  By the end of the movie I realize this could have been about anything, but the ballet allows for majestic, dark imagery mixed with classical music (alongside another great score from Clint Mansell who also did the infamous score for Requiem for a Dream with Aronofsky).  This is the first movie in years, and I do mean years, that has made me cringe in my seat.  The violence is minimum, but what it has I found far more frightening than any today's "torture porn" films (see: Saw franchise).  Aronofsky knows how to make the most out of the violence in his film and each time it left an impact on me as a viewer.<br /><br />There will always be that stuck-up portion of the population (particularly guys) who will avoid this movie being "Yo, this ballet stuff is so gay!" and trust me, I going into the theater alone, as a young man to see a movie about a ballet dancer, I was rather uncomfortable...But once the movie started all those thoughts were left behind!  I couldn't believe it!  Aronofsky made a great movie mixing ballet with psychological horror!  There is nothing stupid or girly about this movie.  In fact, this is far more disturbing material than three fourths of the films released in the few years.<br /><br />You'll have to be into movies that tell movies through surreal imagery to really enjoy Black Swan, because the one flaw is that some of the events make no sense if you try to put it under the scrutiny of logic.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great movie, but one thing in its climax takes a great deal of suspension of disbelief (if you're like me you were too blown away by how awesome the climax is to notice this leap of logic until after you've left the theater).<br /><br />If you're into surreal movies, or psychological horror films dealing with an individuals descent into insanity than I couldn't recommend this movie enough.  If you're some "macho, macho man" or think all films have to make perfect sense than you might want to skip it.<br /><br />I personally say Black Swan easily in the top five films of 2010!</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Black Swan is an imaginative thriller that keeps one on the edge of their seat.  The success of the film is due to the remarkable performance of Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers.  Her character is always on the edge, first to win the role of the Swan Queen, then to translate her cool perfection into the more passionate role of the Black Swan.  Her character is unsettled and going through a nervous breakdown as she tries to be the perfect dancer and cope with her own feelings of failure and that, once she s a success, that her life will go downhill until she is discarded.<br /><br />It is interesting to compare Black Swan to the ballet Swan Lake. The original libretto of Swan Lake ballet had Prince Siegfried and Odette (the Swan Queen) die together, thus releasing the handmaidens from the sorcerer's curse.  However, the ending was considered too sad so the ballet was changed to allow the prince and Odette live and break the spell.  The film goes back to the more tragic ending.  The threatening bird-like dancer who appears at the beginning of the film is the sorcerer responsible for the curse in the ballet.  So Nina is cursed herself into striving for perfection that is her own undoing<br /><br />The film plays off Nina's fears that someone will take her place in the role of the Black Swan; her represses sexual nature and fears that she will be discarded like the former prima ballerina Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder).  Adding to Nina's insecurity is Lily who appears to want to thwart Nina to claim the role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan while professing to admire her.  Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey) is pushing her daughter into the spotlight from her own failure to become a ballet star.<br /><br />Natalie Portman's performance is remarkable for the range of emotions she displays. She is on screen for almost all of the film, and it is her performance that makes the film. The supporting cast is also excellent: Barbara Hershey is obsessive in subtitle ways about her daughter's success down to a ballerina music box that plays music from Swan Lake. Mila Kunis was convincing as her rival, down the wings tattooed on her back and Winona Ryder turns in a solid performance as the spurred Beth.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed and the ballet scenes are nicely choreographed.  Potential viewers should be aware that the film is very intense at times as we are drawn into Nina's hallucinations.  Black Swan is also among the most creative films in recent memory and is certainly a film that cannot be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>What is it about the life of a dancer? They endure extreme physical discomfort bordering on torture. Their life is one of discipline, relentless hard work, and sacrifice, all for the sake of a career that has, in most cases, a very short shelf life. What drives them?<br /><br />"Black Swan" attempts to get inside the mind of a ballerina, while also creating a trippy, often erotic thriller that even mainstream audiences (not just art movie snobs) can enjoy. It's a tightrope, but Darren Aronofsky pulls it all off brilliantly, making his best film since "Requiem for a Dream", with the help of lead actress Natalie Portman, who gives the most impressive performance in her young career (already full of some impressive performances).<br /><br />Portman plays Nina, a workaholic ballerina who seems finally ready to ascend to the lead role in "Swan Lake". Although, with her virginal demeanor, the slightly sadistic director thinks she'll make a perfect White Swan, he criticizes her for lacking the darkness and sexuality needed to play the role of the Black Swan. In order to give the perfect performance, tightly wound Nina needs to find the Black Swan in her, and she knows she won't find it through the hard work and discipline she usually employs.<br /><br />And so it begins. The stress of finally dancing the lead in a production, coupled with Nina's drive to find the darkness within herself that she's been repressing her entire life, send her on a mental downward spiral. The film plays it all ambiguously, and it's often not clear whether what is happening is real or all in Nina's head. Even the characters around her (her stage mother, the free-spirited rival ballerina, the enraged elder ballerina Nina is replacing) can often be interpreted not as real people but as personifications of parts of Nina's own fractured psyche.<br /><br />Part portrait of a tortured young artist, part erotic thriller, and part head trip, "Black Swan" is one of the best films of the year, and the best thriller I've seen in a long time. Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We went expecting the absolute worst, having been fully briefed ahead of time about the film's misogyny and the plain blank ridiculousness of its plot and its various setups.<br /><br />All ballet movies are somewhat silly, though this one makes something like CENTER STAGE seem like a hard-hitting documentary; and yet I wouldn't hesitate to recommend BLACK SWAN even to Moira Shearer herself if she rose up from her grave and asked what was playing at the movies.  It has something, perhaps the tremendous conviction of the director and his lead actress, that makes its watchable at all times, even when the sheer level of camp rises to over your head, which is often believe me.  Someone said that Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, wears one expression on her face through the whole movie--that's not quite true, but BS veterans will know which expression my catty friend was speaking of.  She is extraordinarily disciplined in the part, and it looks crazy difficult, so I predict that she will get the award for this, that Catherine Deneuve should have gotten for REPULSION, the movie this mimics in many ways.  Some have compared BS to SHOWGIRLS, except while that Gina Gershon is miles better than Mila Kunis at playing the sensual, careless rival, Portman seems really to believe in Nina in a way that Elizabeth Berkley always seemed too timid too really go there.  Plus, the costumes and the hair and the makeup (in BS) are all astonishing, probably as good as the ones in the original RED SHOES.<br /><br />The problem with BLACK SWAN, finally, is that the cards seem stacked from the beginning against poor Nina.  She has nothing from the beginning of the movie, and never gets anything (except briefly, she gets to replace Beth MacIntyre)--(and Winona Ryder makes sure Nina never gets to enjoy a moment of that victory).  She has no men, no friends, no fun, a horrible mother and a lousy life.  She has Portman's beauty and grace, but not 15 minutes into the picture she has that rash on her back where it almost seems wings are going to grow.  The movie makes sure that Nina suffers with an almost obscene glory.  In casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder as look-alike avatars for Nina, Aronofsky insures that we will (perhaps subconsciously) pity Portman for her present-day good looks, so like Audrey Hepburn's in some shots), because we see what happened to Hershey and Ryder and conclude that time eats away at beauty just like the garbage can opening up its yawning mouth to accept the whole giant cake Hershey orders for Portman in the film's cruelest scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Okay, I've let Black Swan sink in for about half a day now before writing my review, which needed to be done. The more I think back on it, the better it becomes. Yes, this is an art-house type of film and like the other movies from director, Darren Aronofsky, it has no problem strolling into some very weird territory. The Wrestler is the most mainstream we have gotten from Aronofsky so far and it was my favorite movie of his until today. I know Requiem for a Dream has a lot of fans and I admire the it, though watching it is close to torture because it's just that realistic and disturbing, but Black Swan is head and shoulders above everything I have seen so far this year, save for Inception.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional all around. Everybody just fits into place perfectly. Natalie Portman is flat out jaw dropping as the obsessive and uptight Nina. Not only is her acting better than any other actress I've seen in a long time, but her physical transformation is just as astonishing. Dropping 20 pounds off an already small frame and doing 90% of the dancing is no small feat. She better get an Oscar! Mila Kunis is also good in a smaller than expected role as her rival. Portman's Nina is cold and childish, while Kunis brings sensuality and seductiveness to her part. Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Winona Ryder make up the rest of the strong supporting cast.<br /><br />Other than the acting, the cinematography and music elevate what would normally be rather boring scenes into something unique and interesting.<br /><br />If you are anything like I was when I first heard about Black Swan and the ballet setting, you'll be missing out on the thriller/horror elements that turn this thing dark and messy. Sure the ballet is a major part of the film, but there are many other layers.<br /><br />Black Swan has regained my faith in modern cinema. It's so nice to have an original filmmaker with new ideas in the age of something as awful as Little Fockers. I'm looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve for us next.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well.  It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andr&eacute;s Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes.<br /><br />The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried.  The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen.  The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan.  Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina.  Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize.  Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality.  Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she...  The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina.  Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant.  Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle.  Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits.  But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman.

The physical demands placed on the dancers are enormous (I recall reading a book that described ballet dancers as all being "half-crazed with hunger"), and I can only imagine how heavy the psychological burden must be, especially if you're not the most stable person in the world to begin with. That's situation in which a young dancer (Natalie Portman), finds herself in Black Swan.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a New York ballet company's production of Swan Lake. Never seen it performed? Me, either. Thankfully the movie tells you the story of ballet so you're pretty well-prepared for what's going on and the eventual overlap between the ballet's story and the movie's story.<br /><br />Anyhow, Portman's character really, really wants to dance the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan. She eventually lands the role, but as she does her levels of stability begin to decrease dramatically. She starts hallucinating, scratches her back to the point of bleeding, begins interacting with another dancer who is everything she isn't, deals with a very unstable mother who clearly wishes she was the one dancing the role, and has a crush on the ballet company's director.<br /><br />There's a lot of psychological drama in this movie; a lot of times when you're not sure if what you're seeing is real or just happening in the main character's mind. I like that in films, when it's done well (it is here). It's also fascinating from a technical aspect to watch the way color is used. The ballet world is one of heavy blacks and greys. Portman's character's bedroom is a place of white and pink. Her clothes start out white but by the end of the movie there's a lot of black and grey in them.<br /><br />And not enough can be said about Portman's performance. She really is very good in a movie that demands quite a lot of her (she apparently spent 10 months training as a dancer to do the role). She does an excellent job of conveying the mental state of someone who isn't really that well connected to reality, and she definitely earns every accolade she's received.<br /><br />This isn't the best film of 2010, but I would put it in the lower-half of the top 10.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>BLACK SWAN<br /><br />STARRING: Natalie Portman, Milla Kunis, Vincent Castle, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama / Thriller<br />Release Date: 17 December 2011<br />Review Date: 14 January 2011<br /><br />Black Swan was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as everyone's making it out to be and it certainly wasn't filled with all the risqu&eacute; sex you've been hearing about. I'll go on record saying - there is no sex in the movie at all.  There are some pretty steamy close calls and a very erotic moment of Natalie Portman alone in her bedroom - but no sex. What a bummer.<br /><br />I only mention this because the movie is oozing with sex appeal and it is drenched with the anticipation of sex to come, without the payoff. This is something that the film forced me to expect Portman's character to embellish in. Luckily it makes up for this with an Oscar worthy performance by Portman (for which I'm sure she'll win), and an equally amazing directorial consummation by Darren Aronofsky who also brought us 2008's The Wrestler.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I refuse to jump on the band wagon of those who claim Milla Kunis is warranted a nod as well; my gut tells me the bitchy role comes pretty natural to her, and if I'm wrong, it's nothing we haven't already seen her do once or twice.<br /><br />So I'll continue by stating that Portman stars as our lead character Nina and Kunis is her costar, Lilly. Nina is the nice girl; Lilly, the bitch. They both are interested in the same lead role in a ballet play called Black Swan. When Nina wins the role over Lilly and everyone else, there is some hostility to say the least.<br /><br />Nina is very grateful to be given a shot as prestigious as this, and she shows this to us in an instant flood of tears in a private bathroom stall. Lilly matches Nina's gratefulness, with endless looks of cold jealousy, to which Nina seems to not know what to do with, nor does she really sense the girl that Lilly really is, when they begin to hang out together.<br /><br />This is what draws us in to Portman's portrayal of Nina. She's shy, timid, probably a virgin, and we get the sense that she's uncomfortable in her own skin. So much in fact, that she often picks at it, to the point of drawing blood. She lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) who is smothering and controlling nearly to the extent of a villain in any number of Disney classic evil step mothers.<br /><br />Everything in Nina's world evolves around her work as a ballet dancer. Her mother is infatuated with the details of her long days in rehearsals, as she gave up a similar dream years ago, to take care of Nina. For that there is some bitter resentment.<br /><br />Nina is a grown woman, but her mother does not like the idea of locked doors, and we get the notion that she cleans Nina's room for her too, which is overly stocked with stuffed animals and child like trinkets. There has been no sex in this room, and there shant ever be. So you can imagine the shock of Nina's mother when she brings someone home with her after a night of drinking, and jerry-rigs the door shut.<br /><br />Nina has done this because she is becoming invested in her character to the point of mad obsession. The play calls for Nina to begin the first act as a `white swan' who is an innocent, to which she will transform into a `black swan' who is evil, and then kill herself when her lover has betrayed her for another woman.<br /><br />This movie is very bizarre and I liked it; particularly trying to figure out just what the hell was going on. It's twisted and dark and will only continue to gain more popularity as the word of so spreads.<br /><br />Credit is due to Darren Aronofsky, because now that I think about it, I'm never a fan of the subject matter in any of his films: professional wrestling in The Wrestler, drug addiction in Requiem for a Dream, and ballet dancing here; but yet I found all three films entertaining to include their subject matter.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Black Swan is one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2010.  Natalie Portman plays the ballerina Nina Sayers, the vexing main character who is overly obsessed with perfectionism and landing the lead in a revamped version of "Swan Lake." The film is enthralling and thrilling to watch because of the dramatically intense expressions, dialogue, and sensuality displayed by each character within each particular scene.  And there is also the relentless images throughout the film that will make viewers cringe as they see Nina gripping and peeling away what appears to be a struggle between imagination and reality.<br /><br />Indeed, it is the coupling of Nina's ballerina nemesis Lily (Mila Kunis), a somewhat rock and roller type of character who adds a bit of the hard-edge elements to the film and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who attempt to dispense the freedom that is lacking in Nina's ballet routine as well as to unleash her inexperience and insecurities so that she could play the part of the Black Swan.  But in the process, it is her own personal dilemmas, immaturity, and overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey) who appears much more as a coach rather than a nurturing figure that suggests origins of where Nina's stagnant personal and professional growth may derive from.  And as the film progresses, Nina grapples with expectations that eventually collide with her perfectionism.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler) and screenplay writers Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz are attributed to providing the artistry and intensity to the character of Nina.  What appears to be a typical storyline of an over ambitious dancer hungry to the play the lead part of the White and Black Swan within the first 30 minutes of the film, transforms to a downward spiral of hallucinogenic and psychological proportions within the last hour that are highly thought-provoking and shows Nina shockingly unraveling to deterioration right before the viewers' eyes; the climax of the film is deserving of an Academy Award nomination for Portman.<br /><br />Overall, Black Swan is a film filled with unpredictable twists and turns.  And one does not have to enjoy or have an interest of the ballet in order to understand the storyline that speaks for itself because of the artistic and dramatic contributions of the characters.  It is a film worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Who knew? Rather than a profession peopled with a crew of dedicated professionals, the ballet world, according to director Darren Aronofsky, really consists of a bunch of back-stabbing bitches, self-mutilating neurotics, sleazy artistic directors and a 'Stage Mom' from hell.<br /><br />Black Swan has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this one-note tale of a dancer's quest to come out on top as she pursues the lead role in Swan Lake for a prominent (unnamed) NYC ballet company. The film is really supposed to be a cautionary tale about people who will stop at nothing to further their careers. Ironically, Natalie Portman (as the protagonist, Nina Sayers) worked herself out like a dog in order to replicate the look of a full-time ballet dancer; many internet posters have commented how unhealthy she looks on screen and seems to be just as guilty as the character she plays (where Nina will stop at nothing to become the so-called 'Swan Queen', Ms. Portman has worked herself to the bone in the quest for Oscar Gold!).<br /><br />Vincent Cassell plays the sleazy artistic director of the company, Thomas Leroy. Leroy has no qualms about throwing the over-the-hill principal dancer, Beth Macintrye (played by a way over the top Winona Ryder) under the bus after deciding that the younger Nina must now carry the torch. His decision is not immediate as he has reservations about whether Nina can actually play the darker 'Black Swan' part. He senses that things aren't right with Nina as she is unable to 'let herself go'. The consummate professional that he is, Leroy instructs Nina to go home and masturbate which will help her to get in touch with her more spontaneous self. When he gives her pointers on the dance floor, he says things like, "Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!" Nina finally gets the role when Leroy tests her by attempting to kiss her while they're alone--in response, Nina bites him on the lip (that proves to Leroy, believe it or not, that Nina has what it takes!).<br /><br />Also in the mix is Nina's pushy mother, Erica, who she lives with in a small, unattractive apartment. The mother wanted to be a ballet dancer but never made it and ended up pushing Nina to become the driven artiste she has become. It's clear that Erica is unconsciously jealous of her daughter's success but I can't agree with others who have suggested there is an incestuous sub-text here. If anything, Nina's mother is extremely upset over the evidence that Nina has been self-mutilating and is now trying to get her to slow down and take care of herself.<br /><br />Finally, there's Lily, Nina's rival from San Francisco who Leroy names as alternate in the Swan Lake production. Lily sports a bunch of tattoos and has a mouth like one of the performers you might find on 'Jersey Shore'. Nina hallucinates having a steamy sexual encounter with Lily but soon finds out that it was all in her mind.<br /><br />Throughout 'Black Swan', Nina keeps imagining seeing her double which unnerves her no end. Aronofsky deceptively leads us to believe that Nina harbors murderous impulses. Prior to the climax, Nina fights with her double who morphs into Lily. It then appears that Nina stabs Lily to death just prior to the opening night performance. But during intermission, Lily knocks on Nina's dressing room door making it quite clear that Lily's murder was just another one of Nina's hallucinations. It turns out that Lily is not a murderer at all--rather, the murderous impulses were simply a reflection of Nina's own self-hatred. She ends up stabbing herself prior to going back out for the second act and presumably is found bleeding to death as the curtain descends and the oblivious audience roars their approval.<br /><br />Nina's last words regarding her performance was that "it was perfect". The irony of course is that although achieving her goal of mastering the role of the 'Black Swan', she sacrifices her life. In real life, those who give up a piece of themselves for their ambition, don't usually kill themselves. Rather, they end up with a feeling of a self-satisfaction and achievement of their goals. It's of course for others to judge them whether their rise to the top was conducted with a modicum of moral integrity.<br /><br />In the end, there are few surprises here as Nina's self-destructive internal arc is played out as if someone kept hitting the repeat button on a video monitor. All those scratch marks and peeling toenails become tedious after awhile and the potential tempting plot that Nina's actions might lead to a murder investigation turns out to be nothing more than a big tease on the part of director Aronofsky.<br /><br />Some may feel that Nina is the epitome of a tragic heroine--she accomplishes her goal of mastering a difficult dramatic part but throws away her life at the same time. If you are going to have a heroine who is self-destructive, why not model your character on Tennessee Wiliam's Blanche Dubois? Her back story is a real one as opposed to the one-note Nina, molded by a stereotyped Stage Mother from hell.<br /><br />The frenetic pacing of the Black Swan narrative will hold your interest to the end but the ride is decisively creepy. Has Aronofsky created a true cautionary tale on the dangers of careerism? Or does he revel in the excesses that he is supposedly criticizing? Somehow, all the gory goings on in The Black Swan don't seem to be a very appropriate venue for the dignified world of ballet. Better to catch a young Mickey Rourke in 'Angel Heart' if you desire a blood-fest that's a tad bit more creative.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>The ratings for this movie have a U-shaped distribution, which means that it's largely a "love it or hate it" experience.  I'm sincerely glad that some people enjoyed it, but unfortunately I have to be counted more in the "hated it" group.  Up to about 2/3 of the way into the movie, I still had hope that it could be a winner, since the movie at least had some intensity and sexual tension, but alas when it was over I felt that it had all been a waste of time.<br /><br />Why so harsh?  Well, none of the characters are well developed, none of the relationships are well developed, not much really happens in the movie, and most importantly it never becomes clear what the lead character's problem is.  Was she always mentally ill?  What kind of mental illness did she have?  What was the cause?  Why was she not receiving any form of treatment?  Why did her mother allow her to pursue the rigors of ballet despite her condition?  There are no answers to be found in this movie.  In the end, I felt that shallow intrigue and gimmicks had been substituted for substance, with a big-name actress used to lure us in.<br /><br />Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie (even if you're a ballet fan), but I'll now have a look at some of the favorable reviews to see why some people liked it.<br /><br />Addendum: I've now finished reading several of the favorable reviews, and it seems that those reviewers tend to take this as a relatively abstract movie and often apply a psychoanalytic perspective.  Again, good for them, but I think that asks viewers to fill in too many blanks.  A movie should meet the viewer at least half way, and I don't think this one does.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Nina (Natalie Portman) is a troubled, young ballerina who lives her life in an endless and hopeless pursuit of perfection.  When the company's lecherous director gives her the star role of the Swan Queen,  he expects her to put out and be more like the sensuous Black Swan character and less like the demure White Swan.  Her deeply conflicted psyche creates a world of illusion, chaos, and terror as she gives in to her dark side.<br /><br />We know early on that Nina has a loose grip on reality and that nothing we see is real.  Given the dark storyline, one would expect an exciting movie, but I actually found it predictable.  Portman gives a one-note performance, always frightened and helpless but never showing a range of emotions until the very end.  There are several violent and sexual scenes intended to show her fragile state of mind, but they are often over-the-top and downright gross.  While rail-thin Portman does convince us she's a ballerina and the dance sequences are lovely, the other characters are unlikable and rather stereotypical.  Barbara Hershey is repellant as Nina's disturbed mother and sassy Mila Kunis, as Nina's rival, is also fairly loathsome.<br /><br />This psychological thriller is more off-putting than entertaining and frankly, I was glad when it was over.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>With this dark and audacious look at artistry and dance, bad boy auteur Darren Aronofsky once again pushes a film's intensity past all point of reason. "Black Swan" will be alternately hailed a masterpiece and an over-indulgent piece of excess. Or, more appropriately, perhaps it is a masterpiece of excess. More akin to the fantastical setting of "The Fountain" than to the confrontational realism of "The Wrestler," Aronofsky has created a remarkably vivid bit of lunacy with "Black Swan." And to be fair, I think he absolutely succeeds in what he has set out to do--creating a hyper dramatic nightmare that blurs the lines between reality and madness. Thematically, many films have covered the same ground--but few so visually, stylishly, or in so unapologetic a way. No matter how many films Aronofsky unleashes on the world, I will always hold the feverish "Requiem For a Dream" closest to my heart--but for visceral thrills, "Black Swan" rates a very high second.<br /><br />Equal parts "The Turning Point," "All About Eve," and "Repulsion," "Black Swan" tells the story of a ballerina struggling for perfection. Natalie Portman is cast as the dancer given the shot of a lifetime--to play the lead in a new revival of "Swan Lake." It's a dream part, but one that is fraught with peril. The director, Vincent Cassel, thinks Portman is perfect for the technical aloofness of the program's White Swan but lacks the fire and abandon when the dance transforms her into the Black Swan. And Portman pushes herself and pushes herself, to the point that her body is manifesting strange physical trauma. Cassel tries to unleash the passion of the Black Swan while the company's newest dancer (Mila Kunis) seems to embody the darker freedoms that Portman needs to embrace to be successful. And the more Portman throws herself into the role mentally and physically, the film starts to push into the territory of unrepentant psychological thriller.<br /><br />Portman's descent into madness is exquisitely uncomfortable and off kilter. As the film becomes progressively violent and unpredictable, the lines between what is real and what is imagined become impossible to untangle. Aronofsky stages it all like a brilliantly choreographed high wire act. If you go with the flow, you'll be caught up in a thrillingly original nightmare. Portman has never been better. She pushes herself both physically and psychologically here, and hers is surely one of the most heartrending and affecting performances of the year. Cassel is perfect straddling the line between mentor and villain, Kunis has just the requisite wildness, and Barbara Hershey goes for broke as Portman's domineering mother. However, in approximately three minutes of screen time, it is Winona Ryder (as an aging dancer replaced by Portman) that provides one of the film's most indelible performances.<br /><br />That said, I did love "Black Swan." I won't say that it's brilliantly filled with deep meaning--but I will say that it's brilliantly entertaining. The dancing is perfection and the final performance is absolutely chilling, truly not something to be forgotten! A great score (it's hard to go wrong using Tchaikovsky), dynamic cinematography, top notch performances, fantastic visual effects all combine to make this one of the truly memorable films of 2010. Let's hope Aronofsky never loses his touch for demented fever dreams--even as he's moving into Wolverine territory. KGHarris, 12/10.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Director Darren Aronofsky brilliantly explores the psychological landscape of one Nina Sayres (a perfect name for a ballet star) in his grand opus, "Swan Lake." I give a standing ovation and five stars (actually four and one half but clicking five out of necessity)!<br /><br />This is a film seemingly about ballet, the ballet world and its backstabbing and jealousies. It's a film about competition, both individual and between individuals. It's about mother-daughter conflicts. It's about the power of a male boss over his female employees.<br /><br />However, "Swan Lake" is, foremost, the setting for a psychological thriller which details the mind of one character, Nina. She is the unfortunate daughter of a former ballet dancer who had to quit the business because of pregnancy. What this mother did was shift her failed dreams upon her hapless and weak daughter. Nina is not normal. It doesn't take the audience long to understand why and how.<br /><br />The star of the ballet "Swan Lake" can be danced by two women or by one with dual roles. The swans are dichotomous: one pure, virginal, innocent; the other evil, passionate, sensual. Nina is the perfect white swam, but the director wants to choose someone to dance both roles. Because of her perfect technique, Nina finally wins the role with a promise to the director and his own determination that she will, indeed, be a great black swan and all it implies.<br /><br />But, alas, Nina is sooooo conflicted, so conflicted, in fact, that she is hallucinating. That old man on the subway is not making lewd gestures toward her.  Because her single focus in life is ballet, she has repressed, unknowingly, her needs and desires. Repression can behave in bizarre ways.<br /><br />Once she earns the role, Nina's repression causes more problems than hallucinations. A rash breaks out. She peels pieces of flesh from her fingers, only to discover that she didn't. A new dancer tries to befriend Nina. Finally, in a confrontation with her mother, she chooses the friend and goes out to party. Influenced by drugs and alcohol and a loosening of her inhibitions, Nina hallucinates a big one: She and the friend have a passionate sex scene.<br /><br />And so it goes. This is Nina, reaching the climax of her life--the epitome. She has already watched what happens to an aging star who previously danced this role. It's an ugly scenario. She lives with a mother who is bitter because she could no longer dance. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Nina finally pierces her core to find what it takes to dance the Black Swan and wins a standing ovation. At what cost?<br /><br />I would like to leave my review at the previous paragraph, but I cannot. I accepted the director's use of surreal hallucinations as realistic, coming from a very repressed, rigid mindset with one single purpose in life: to dance. What I cannot accept is the act that pulls the passion from Nina's deepest self to win highest accolades from the director and the audience. Aronofsky made me accept Nina's pitiful existence and the deranged visions, but not the final physical act. Nope.<br /><br />Does Natalie Portman deserve her Academy award? It is certainly a performance worthy of the award. To maintain that magnitude of fear and even terror and repression and uncertainty over the weeks of filming is surely a feat of willpower in itself. In today's market of many very talented female actors, I don't know if Portman is THE one. Not having seen the other movies yet, I cannot be definitive, but Portman as Nina is certainly a contender.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Tchaikovsky composed one of his most beautiful musics for that old tale in which a prince will come to free the white swan who is a princess but the prince will fall in love with the adventurous and enterprising black swan and that will cause the death, the suicide of the white swan. Charming Princes are no longer what they used to be: they want to choose their princesses. Princes have been liberated from simple predetermined stories, especially when there is un ugly black duckling in the flock.<br /><br />The cruelty and the difficulty of the choreography is that the same dancer is supposed to be both the white and the black swans. Two styles, two genres, two universes that are so antagonistic and so mutually hostile, that it leads to a drama every night. If the dancer identifies with that impossible and schizophrenic situation it is more than a drama, it becomes a tragedy.<br /><br />The genius of this film is to invest and embed the dancer in a personal situation that leads to death in a way or another. She is the daughter of a dancer who stopped dancing at the age of twenty-eight when she got pregnant, without a father and twenty-eight is old for a dancer. She never was anything but a member of the chorus line. She carries her daughter at arm's length into realizing the dream she has never been able to realize herself: to become the Swan Queen. She supports her, helps her, takes care of her in the most stifling way imaginable.<br /><br />She thus stifles in her any kind of personal libido, love instinct. That makes the daughter awkwardly constantly scratch her shoulders. But when she starts embodying the Janus double-face Sawn Queen, the darkest impulses surge up and find their way out in a fantasy-driven nightmare. She explodes in unsatisfied or self-satisfied sexual impulses. She develops a strong hatred for her body-double, a body-double which is normal practice with ballet stars.<br /><br />The worst is till to come because her mother who wanted her to be what she herself has not been able to be is also the one who wants to prevent her daughter to do what she has not herself done, hence to succeed better than her. This conflict between the mother and the daughter is also schizophrenic. The dancer can identify perfectly with the paranoid psychotic Swan Queen and live the fate of the white swan right to the bitter end of its death.<br /><br />The music is the most beautiful music you will ever hear but do not get trapped by the poisonous syrup that flows from the notes. The candy is laced with ecstasy if you are lucky, more probably with arsenic if you are really lucky, because then you can evade this unbearable world. And that is a phenomenal liberation, to die when the audience in the house is frantically calling for you after the show.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I suppose it was inevitable that someone would make a movie about the seamier side of ballet dancing, since everything else has been tried. What's next, the lustier side of chess tournaments? Now THAT would be interesting. ;- But to give one example of how the movie unsuccessfully tries to ratchet up the seamy and sensuous side of things, the scene where the ballet master is groping Natalie Portman to show her that she is supposed to seduce him during that dance and then tells her that she should go home and masturbate was ludicrous in the extreme. Yeesh. I'm certainly no prude but who comes up with these ideas, anyway? First-year movie-script writing students who think a little sex will sell even the worst turkey of a movie?<br /><br />To be fair, the movie does has its moments and the acting is more than competent; I just wish it was in the service of a better movie. Natalie Portman is always good of course even if the movie itself is less than stellar. I suppose there has to be some truth to it what with all those young, perfectly toned bodies running around. But for me, a movie about the steamier side of ballet (however true or not) just didn't work very well. I'm not a ballet fan (although I know it takes extreme athletic abilities) so maybe that's the problem. Others mileage may vary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i wasn't blown away by this film,but i did enjoy it.for me,it was well acted,creepy and bizarre. i guess you could classify it a horror/thriller.it might make you cringe in some spots.if you're squeamish,this might not be the best movie for you.but this is also a movie that really makes you think.you never really knew what's real and what's fantasy.Natalie Portman really immerse herself in the role and is very convincing.and the film is never boring.there is always something going on.if you like your movies straight forward with everything laid out neatly,this probably isn't the movie for you.otherwise,i'd say give it shot.for me, The Black Swan is a 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Ok the movie is certainly a masterpiece, but it was also very disturbing at most scenes. This fact is actually good, because it gets the viewer inside the mind of psychologically disturbed people. This movie is about a psychotic ballerina, and it certainly got the viewer acquainted with her hurt and struggle. Just being able to make the viewer lose knowing the difference between dream and reality in the movie explains why this movie is a masterpiece, because it got you extremely acquainted with the star of the movie, a psychotic ballerina.<br /><br />This could be Natalie Portman's best performance till date, her performance in this film was simply breath taking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>From my neanderthal pespective, I attentively watched this movie and felt "much ado about nothing".<br /><br />I was expecting more because of the ridiculous hype of this movie. What I have learned is that intense director, Darren Aronofsky, makes little, indie-resembling personal movies and then they get widespread acclaim ( I also thought "The Wrestler" was overrated). This was a passable piece of eccentric entertainment yet the premise of the story was not that compelling. The simple premise can almost be adapted into a play.<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays a [way over dedicated] ballerina where she has the talent to portray the angelic aspect of the role in "Swan Lake" but is missing the "soul" to play the emotional aspect of the role. Her overbearing mother, Barbera Hershey completely embarrassing herself playing a modern day Piper Laurie's charactor from "Carrie", developing rival, Mila Kunis, and passionate/perverted director all pull on her as she unravels.<br /><br />Portman's performance is interesting...if I was a 12 year old girl. The interaction is too catty for a viewer that doesn't understand the nuances of ballet to have empathy towards what is going on. This in ot only a "chick" flick but a "chick flick" for a drama queen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Black Swan" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth Macintyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.<br /><br />The cast led by Natalie Portman (in her superb, Oscar-winning performance as Nina), Vincent Cassel (as Thomas Leroy) & Mila Kunis (in a solid performance as Lily) is brilliant! The directing by Darren Aronofsky (he also directed "Pi" (1998, also wrote the story & screenplay), "Requiem For A Dream" (2000, also wrote the screenplay), "The Fountain" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay) & "The Wrestler" (2008, also produced), he is also directing the upcoming "The Wolverine" (2011), he also executive produced "The Fighter" (2010) is brilliant!

The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who, recently did the cinematography to "Iron Man 2" (2010), its original (2008), the upcoming "Cowboys & Aliens" (2011) & "The Wolverine", he has done the cinematography to all Aronofsky's films, with the expectation of "The Wrestler") is brilliant! The film editing by Andrew Weisblum (who also did the film editing to "The Darjeeling Limited" (2007), "The Wrestler" & "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (2009) is brilliant!

Darren Aronofsky has got another brilliant film on his hands. Natalie Portman gives a superb, Oscar-winning performance and Mila Kunis is just as impressive as her exact opposite. This is one of the best films of last year and it will be remembered when the Oscars are eventually announced.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.<br /><br />The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise. He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. It's hard to believe that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to face the demands of the ballet world. However, he's excellent in his role, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.<br /><br />Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.<br /><br />Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.<br /><br />Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN isn't an original film.  Its premise--a young woman experiencing a breakdown amid potentially supernatural occurrences--is a staple of the horror genre.  This is, however, Aronofsky's take on such a film, his personal stamp on a certain style (much as he did with the superior film THE WRESTLER and the sports genre in general).<br /><br />BLACK SWAN follows a ballerina's embrace of "Swan Lake."  Nina Sayers has the White Swan role down pat; but she has never really let loose enough to take on the role of the Black Swan.  Thus, her understudy, Lily, comes into the picture.  But the relationship between the two is complicated: part friendship, part rivalry, part sexual attraction, and the tension escalates into a breathtaking finale that is predictable but nevertheless stunning.<br /><br />Natalie Portman easily deserves her Oscar; her performance is on-pitch and captivating.  Mila Kunis, who has never truly overwhelmed in a serious role, is surprisingly adept here; she manages to be seductive, charming, and scary, all in one scene.  Winona Ryder, as the "older" ballerina Portman is replacing, is equally chilling, as is Vincent Cassel as the stereotypical demanding boss (though his performance is anything but cliched).  Barbara Hershey is a surprise delight as Nina's caring-possibly-psychotic mother.<br /><br />The script is a little flat, which is intentional; this film is as much an homage as it is a stand-alone piece.  Aronofsky isn't aiming for the skies, and that is what makes BLACK SWAN so compelling: it's a small slice of insanity, with some truly disturbing scenes and some fantastic performances.  If it isn't the best expression of Aronofsky's artistic vision, it certainly deserves status as a "personal favorite" among his fans; either way, it is an above-par psychological thriller that deserves most of the praise that has been heaped upon it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It has taken me a while to see Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed 2010 psychological thriller probably because the marketing campaign at the time of its December release focused more on the film's sensationalistic, horror-film elements. In the meantime, Natalie Portman collected a truckload of awards for her searing portrayal of Nina Sayers, a talented ballerina whose mental state declines as pressure mounts around her starring performance in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" by a prestigious New York City ballet company. She is quite good, although I am less relatively enamored by the film itself, especially toward the end, which beyond recalling Aronofsky's earlier work, 2000's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4CS">Requiem for a Dream</a>, comes across as an intensely kinetic albeit derivative hybrid of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ICZW8M">The Red Shoes</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K3NR">Carrie</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802616">Single White Female</a>.<br /><br />Co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin, the screenplay melds Nina's reality, dreams, and hallucinations into quite a ripe melodrama. Nina has long dreamed about playing the lead in "Swan Lake", and her fantasy comes true in a moment of pure bliss before her descent into madness. The ballet troupe's manipulative director Thomas Leroy picks Nina to replace aging prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre to play the Swan Queen, which is two roles in one - Odette, the virginal White Swan awaiting a kiss from the Prince, and her heartless twin, Odile, the sexually predatory Black Swan who lures the prince away. Leroy knows Nina is fully capable of playing the former but remains unconvinced she could exude the sensuality needed to play the latter. While she has trained her whole life for this opportunity, she remains an insecure, emotionally bruised woman still living with her overbearing mother Erica, a former ballerina who never reached the rarefied heights her daughter is about to enter.<br /><br />Complicating matters is Lily, a new arrival to the company from San Francisco and as liberated a free spirit as Nina is sexually repressed. Meanwhile, as Nina performs to the demands of the role, she crumbles in hidden ways that have her start imagining herself transforming into a swan. Present in almost every frame of the film, Portman is terrific conveying Nina's tentative nature in a way that makes her dedicated training all the more haunting for the sacrifices she makes to achieve her goal of artistic perfection. Within the confines of his predictable role, Vincent Cassel is malevolent enough as the autocratic Leroy, and Barbara Hershey really excels in her few scenes as Erica, showing why Nina's self-esteem has become practically nil. With her haughty manner and skeletal frame, Winona Ryder has more of an extended cameo as Beth, but she makes her fatalistic sense palpable. As Lily, Mila Kunis is almost effortless as Nina's saucy, distrustful competitor.<br /><br />Compounded by Matthew Labatique's constantly moving camera, Aronofsky's florid direction works on an almost surreal level for about the first three-quarters of the film's 108-minute running time, but his lurid horror-film approach gets excessive toward the end when Nina's confusion between reality and fantasy signals an inability to deal with the life she thought she wanted. The 2011 DVD/BluRay offers an extensive, 49-minute making-of documentary, "Black Swan Metamorphosis" which includes on-set footage and interviews with cast and crew. In addition, there are short featurettes focusing on the ballet sequences, the production design, the costumes, Portman's preparation for the role and Aronofsky's creative process. There are also interviews of the principals from Fox Movie Channel Presents, as well as the theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*<br /><br />Look guys, I do "get it". Before you tell me to "go watch a Die Hard box set", let me say that I am an adult moviegoer and I see at least 50 smaller/indie/foreign/what have you movies a year. So therefore that defense it totally useless. OK, now let's get on with the review.<br /><br />I'm not really down with Darren Aronofsky to begin with. I saw Requiem For A Dream When I was teen and boy, that film messed me up good. I was compelled to watch it after being shown a compilation of clips in an anti-drug presentation, so I sought out my friend, who has quite possibly the biggest DVD collection ever. After it was done... well let's say that movie taught me my lesson about drugs well enough. In the following years his films didn't really do much- Pi was an incomprehensible mess, The Fountain I watched 3 times and didn't get, and The Wrestler started off nice but ended poorly. However, I was interested in Black Swan when I saw the trailer with Paranormal Activity 2, so tonight I finally saw it.<br /><br />About the dancing scenes, as much as I actively participate in dance but know nothing about ballet, I thought they were well done. Like I said, I know absolutely nothing about ballet, so you best not trust my judgment. I thought Natalie Portman did a fantastic job, and I totally believed that Natalie did her own dancing. I thought the cast did pretty good jobs considering they were not dancers to begin with. Natalie's performance is, of course, the reason to see the movie. She is pure cash money with each performance, and this movie shows. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey were good too. Oh and the movie looked pretty too. That's where the praise unfortunately stops.<br /><br />Basically people seem to be raving over nothing but just a middle-of-the-road horror-thriller, but with bits of weird sex added in and several over-the-top shock moments that seemed more unintentionally hilarious than shocking. Basically it's just Mulholland Drive with any being able to care for the characters taken out (We even get the obligatory lesbian sex scene- just minus having a place). In other words, you're getting a typical messed up girl story. I didn't really feel for the Nina character at all. For one, I dunno why she wouldn't just get a red flag when Vincent Cassel's character forced a kiss on her, or when he told her to touch herself. Yet somehow she's smart enough to lash out at her over-controlling mom and tell her "I'm not 12 anymore" and dump the plush toys down the garbage disposal.<br /><br />Truth be told, Black Swan is honestly just an incoherent mess. There are moments of brilliance, which all go to naught when something that reduces you to laughter (at an inappropriate moment too) comes. Yeah as you guessed, I laughed at several moments that weren't meant to be funny. Like when Nina masturbates and finds her mom in the room. Or Winona Ryder going all joker on herself. The film looks nice, has good special effects and performances, but you can dress up a pig in fancy clothing and it's still a pig.<br /><br />Oh, but what do I know. Like most Oscar bait nowadays, this film will go to win awards and enjoy a bit of hype for a while. And then, of course, like any other movie, people are going to regret the hype and it will end up on most people's overrated lists.<br /><br />Cue people telling me "I don't get it".</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>OSCAR TO PORTMAN, OSCAR TO KUNIS [SUPPORTING]<br /><br />ACTUAL WINNERS - HERSHEY AND RYDER<br /> ~ BOTH WOMEN DESERVE LEADING ROLES?<br /><br />NOTHING - REPEAT - NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE - IT'S "REPULSION" meets Bunuel ....

She was great, everything else sucked. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The movies I see basically fall into two categories.  First, there are the movies that I am genuinely interested in viewing because I found the trailer, the source material (i.e. comic book, historical character), or the previous incarnation interesting.  These tend to be science fiction films, Pixar films, and movies derived from comic books.  Then there are the movies I watch because they are highly rated by critics and have been nominated for key awards.  Examples of the latter include the various Alfred Hitchcock films, the Godfather franchise, and the film Black Swan one starring Natalie Portman.<br /><br />I expected a lot from this movie seeing that it got Natalie Portman her first Best Actress award at the Oscars.  I was disappointed.  Yes, this movie's content clearly took considerable skill and talent to pull off.  But the movie itself was neither good nor enjoyable.  This film was not enjoyable to watch because there were too many disturbing scenes.  Whether it be the imagined lesbian love scene, or the scene where Ms. Portman's character masturbates, or the various scenes where she confronts her mother, all of them were disturbing scenes that made the characters revolting.  Nothing was exotic, or even lurid, just revolting.  This film was not good for various reasons.  First, it was not original; there are other movies about individuals going crazy due to an obsession or obsessions.  The Aviator is a good example of such a film.  Second, I could not empathize with any of the characters, and any good movie should generate audience empathy for one or more characters.  Third, there was no comedy, no irony, no romance, or anything else in the film to complement the emotional and physical tragedy.  Great films should hit different notes with the audience, and this one was one note only - tragedy.  And last, for a movie built around the beautiful Swan Lake, the set design, costumes, cinematography and overall visual feel was subdued.  Outside of the 5 seconds or so of the movie when the main character imagines herself transforming into a black swan, I did not find any of the scenes memorable.  Overall, quite disappointing considering the quality of the director, Darren Aronofsky.  Even more disappointing was that this film was actually nominated for Best Picture by the Oscars when other, much better films from 2010 were ignored by the Oscars, films such as Kick-Ass, Harry Potter, Shutter Island, etc...</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Let's be clear.  BLACK SWAN is not a movie about dance or about romance. To say the least, BLACK SWAN is creepy, disturbing, and very strange.  It tries to be a horror flick on one level, and a psychological thriller on another.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably on both.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, BLACK SWAN is horrific, and, yes, I do understand what the director was trying to do. In many ways, it reminded me of the 1979 film "All That Jazz," a bizarre and intimate look at choreographer Bob Fosse's life and his descent into drugs, sexual escapades, and near death experiences.  As with "All That Jazz," BLACK SWAN plays like an acid trip gone bad...very, very bad.  You are never quite sure what is real, what is hallucination, or what is really going on.<br /><br />BLACK SWAN takes us back stage during a new, re-envisioned production of Swan Lake.  Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) has snagged the leading role of the White Swan, which is perfect for her delicate and shy personality.  At the same time, she must also play the Black Swan and bring a sexier, wilder personality to life.  The stress of it all is too much for Nina, and she slowly begins to spiral into madness.  By the end she no longer has any idea as to what is real and what is not.<br /><br />The problem is, neither do we.  For the most part, the characterizations are flat and clich&eacute;d.  Natalie Portman whispers throughout the film and is very difficult to understand.  Barbara Hershey is empty and cardboard as her mother trying to live vicariously through her daughter.  The director/choreographer, played by Vincent Cassel, is a stereotypical jerk who will do anything to get the performance he wants.  The shining exception in BLACK SWAN is Mila Kunis as a newcomer to the company who is selected to be Nina's understudy.  She does more acting, and quite good at that, than the rest of the cast combined, including Winona Ryder as the wacked out, aging prima ballerina.<br /><br />Other bright spots in BLACK SWAN include Tchaikovsky's brilliant Swan Lake score, which plays in gorgeous counterpoint to the action on screen, the exquisite dance sequences, and some very impressive and unexpected CGI.  However, these highlights are not enough for me to recommend BLACK SWAN.  And while the ending does leave you gasping, it is not in a good way.  I guess I don't want to be shaking my head at the end of a film.<br /><br />As a side note:  I really don't every need to see an actor or actress pleasuring themselves on screen.  Especially not multiple times.  And especially not Natalie Portman.  TMI.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>Everyone did a great job on this, Natalie Portman's best preformance yet, the score was great, the visual contrast between black and white were present throughout the film, the whole jarring effect of the film made me feel like I was slowly going insane along with the main character. The projector died at the very end of the movie so maybe that was ruined a little for me but otherwise it is a very well made film that I'd recommend. But...<br /><br />God Damn Aronofsky, how many more people going through self-destruction do we have to see? I haven't seen the Fountain so I can't speak for that but Pi (and his only happy ending) shows someone driving himself crazy, Requiem for a Dream shows a group of people succumbing to drugs, and the Wrestler shows a burned out wrestler commit suicide. Now they're all great stories and all but is that all Darren can do? How about finding a new formula for once, one where a character isn't circling the drain for once? Just saying, I liked Black Swan a lot, but it feels like a retread of Aronofsky's previous works.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I can't help comparing this movie with the story of another crazy girl who damages herself in her pursuit of perfection, an old story known as The Bell Jar.  There's one thing in this movie that I don't remember from The Bell Jar though that might explain the girl's overambition a bit better, and that is the driving force of the mother.  No wonder this poor ballerina went nuts.  She had an insane mother, an insane teacher, and an insane female dance partner (for lack of a better term).  The mother drove the ambition in the first place, the teacher purposely nourished it further and led to its distortion, and the dance partner fulfilled the distortion by feeding her the wrong messages.  It's really quite brilliantly weaved together for being as ugly as it is.<br /><br />The one way in which this really differs from The Bell Jar is the ending, but other than that, I can't point out too many major differences.  I wish I could remember the driving force that made the girl in The Bell Jar so unable to handle failure, but I just can't.  I think as I read the book, I simply assumed the driving force was just the societal pressures of the day to succeed academically (which is far worse now than it was in the 60's).  All I know is I got past my first truly epic failure years ago, so I shouldn't be in this sort of danger.  Hooray for EPIC FAIL!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky is really the master of uncomfortable films. They are brilliant, but they make you want to squirm in your seat.<br /><br />So expect nothing less from "Black Swan," a sublimely horrific psychological thriller. Aronofsky crafts the delicate, dark tale of a fragile young woman's descent into insanity, and Natalie Portman pours every ounce of her skill into the role. It's a beautiful tangle of ballet, classical music, black wings and warping reality.<br /><br />The lead dancer (Winona Ryder) of a New York ballet company is hospitalized, so a new dancer is needed for "Swan Lake" -- a girl who can play both the pure White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) desperately wants to dance the role, especially since her controlling stage mother (Barbara Hershey) has always driven her to be "perfect." Many other girls want the role, including the new girl Lily (Mila Kunis).<br /><br />But even after Nina wins the role, she doesn't find any peace. She begins to believe that Lily is trying to steal the role of a lifetime, and is tormented by strange voices and hallucinations -- and spiky little feather start sprouting from her shoulders. And as her debut approaches, Nina begins sliding further into a nightmarish world where she IS the Black Swan.<br /><br />In his previous movies, Darren Aronofsky has explored psychological grotesquerie or exquisite beauty... but I don't think he's ever melded the two as he does in "Black Swan." This movie is a nightmare -- a graceful, satin-swathed, feathered, mirrored nightmare, full of strange images (screaming pictures) and haunting moments that make you want to hide.<br /><br />At the movie's start, there's a vague sense of unease and instability, as if something nightmarish is lurking right around the corner. But with every successive scene, Aronofsky painstakingly slips in more and more surreality and creepiness, until you find yourself locked in Nina's living hell. It all climaxes in a brilliant juxtaposition of dance, death, beauty and horror.<br /><br />The freakiest parts of it may be the changes to Nina's body, namely her backwards "swan legs" and the feathers on her back. Is her madness changing her body? Is it just another hallucination? It takes awhile to figure out.<br /><br />The lead role is one of those roles that demands all the passion, skill and life that an actor can pour into it, and Natalie Portman gives the role everything she has -- her Nina is a trembling, fragile creature made out of glass, who begins to crack under pressure. Mila Kunis gives a subtle, strong performance as Lily (both in and out of Nina's head), and there are great side performances by Hershey, Ryder, and Vincent Cassel.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is a movie that lulls you into a beautiful nightmare, and leaves you trying to unravel what is madness and what is reality. It's uncomfortable to watch, but it's supposed to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Approaching 400 reviews at Amazon, I don't think that I have a lot to add that hasn't already been said about Black Swan. But for what it's worth, my 2 cents is that it is a great movie. Well acted. Well scripted. And certainly well directed by the same guy that brought us <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD9VI">The Wrestler</a>. Like The Wrestler, Black Swan is a dark drama that gets into the psyche of its main character. Natalie Portman is the Black Swan (as well as the White Swan), and she turns in a performance worthy of her Golden Globe and Oscar wins for Best Actress.<br /><br />In a nutshell, after Portman's character wins the lead in Swan Lake, she goes a bit cuckoo and essentially morphs into a living characterization of Odile, the Black Swan. But rest assured, if you've come looking for a movie solely about dance and ballet, you will either be pleasantly surprised or completely shocked. I was the former, although I did really know in advance that what lay ahead was a dark, foreboding movie about a gal that's not quite all there.<br /><br />Speaking of dark and foreboding, gotta hand it to the film's musical score team as well. They did an expert job at building tension where there was none and making the tense moments seem more normal...well, more normal perhaps for someone losing their mind (Portman, not me!).<br /><br />Mila Kunis costars, and she is as hot as her hot and heavy scenes with Portman are. I'm not sure that Kunis' performance warranted the Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but she should have won the MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss with Portman. Hubba hubba. Anyway....<br /><br />What I don't understand is all of the negative criticism that this movie received. I mean, even here at Amazon there are as many 1 and 2 star reviews combined as there are 5 star reviews. Makes me want to go all Odile on the 1 and 2 star reviewers and scream, "What were you expecting?!" Black Swan is an excellent movie and should not be missed by anyone into a good thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Black Swan is one of the year's most acclaimed films, nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Watching it the first time I found it overrated and inferior to its companion film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD92C">The Wrestler</a>. Watching it a second time, I found it to be one of director Darren Aronofsky's most focused efforts. His skill and maturity as a director continues to grow and progress with each film and while it's too early to say if Black Swan is my favorite film by the man it may be his most impressive feature yet.<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer at a New York ballet company. It's the beginning of a new season and the first production is of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. With the former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) being cast out, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) must find a new dancer that can embody both the White Swan and her evil twin the Black Swan. Nina is dedicated to her craft, a perfectionist who knows every move perfectly. Newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) is her opposite; free-spirited and effortless. Thomas knows Nina can dance the White Swan, but he's not sure she would able to convincingly dance the Black Swan. When Thomas finally casts Nina as the Swan Queen, she becomes so intent on perfecting her role that she begins transforming into the character (and what an amazing transformation it is).<br /><br />Nina is a fascinating protagonist; an innocent and sexually repressed character living with a sinister, domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina's fragile mental state is immediately apparent and the film being told from her perspective makes us always question whether what we're seeing is reliable. A portrait of a slow mental breakdown is nothing new in cinema, but it's the adventurous way it's handled in this film that makes it so special. Aronofsky obviously derives some inspiration from Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion with its portrait of female sexual repression, but Black Swan doesn't descend into a retread of earlier material. It's an example of a film being culminated from various influences to create something very new and fresh.<br /><br />Natalie Portman has received the majority of notice for her performance, but everyone here is worth mentioning. The stunning, beautiful Mila Kunis, in her first legitimate dramatic role, is perfect as Lily. Her character is a big part of the film, but one of the less complex roles. Still, she's a convincing opposite to Portman's Nina. Hershey is highly underrated doing some career-best work as Nina's mother. This is a stunning performance by an actress we don't see much of anymore and, in a less competitive year Hershey would've been a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. She brings such nuance to the simultaneously caring and overbearing mother role, making her loathsome yet sympathetic. Vincent Cassel is essentially playing the only male character in this film and he plays the charming, amoral, Svengali-like Thomas with a flamboyant subtlety that is brilliantly controlled and convincing. He's been accused of hamming it up, but I didn't get that impression. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that was unfortunately overlooked. Even Winona Ryder makes an impression with little screen-time.<br /><br />Portman will win the Academy Award this year for her performance as Nina Sayers, not as a sympathy vote or to award her for her time in this industry, but because she gives a remarkable, psychologically complex performance and pulls it off flawlessly. Portman so completely captures Nina's fragility, innocence, and elegance while bringing her through a haunting and memorable transformation that never feels over-the-top or forced. She's so in control of her performance and, physically, she's gone out of her way to look the part as well. Already small, Portman lost 20 pounds for her role as Nina. It's a sympathetic performance of a complicated character. Nina isn't the greatest female protagonist of 2010, but Portman gives the greatest female performance of 2010. With more roles like this, Portman could establish herself as a force to be reckoned with. When Nina says "I was perfect," you agree because of the job Portman has done here.<br /><br />The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is very tight, emphasizing close-ups on the face, while giving the film a very raw feel. The film has a visual style that almost completely mirrors the grainy, muted look of The Wrestler, but Black Swan is a much more beautiful film. The hypnotic opening scene is so instantly intriguing it takes hold of your interest and leads you through the rest of the film. The terrific, sometimes terrifying makeup and beautiful score (which does incorporate much of the Swan Lake ballet) all lend beautifully to the tone created by Aronofsky.<br /><br />Black Swan is not an easy film as it doesn't comfortably settle into any particular genre. It has the elements of a horror film and a psychological thriller but never quite falls into either genre, despite having many wince-inducing scenes. It has a European sensibility, evident in Aronofsky being influenced by Polanski's Repulsion and The Tenant and that might not sit well with some audiences. Other people may flock to the movie due to the highly publicized scene between Portman and Kunis (you know which one I'm talking about) which is neither gratuitous nor graphic and has supernatural element that may disappoint viewers hoping for something much more "arousing."<br /><br />For me, Black Swan really achieves greatness in the final 20 minutes which I found to be some of the gripping, powerful, and fascinating minutes of any movie from 2010. Even when using CGI effects, Aronofsky manages to simultaneously evoke emotion and challenge the viewer. Few films move me to tears, but Black Swan did even while knowing what to expect. Yes, it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film but I found myself blown away by it. It's an amazing film, a brilliant companion piece to The Wrestler, and an emotional rollercoaster ride. Black Swan is the most profound, moving cinematic experience I've had from a 2010 film. It's less of a film than an experience.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>Aronofsky does a Polanski ripoff with a balletic gimmick.  All the psychosexual implications are reminiscent of REPULSION.  Cracked nails and breaking glass are the obvious metaphors for the delicate psyche of our fragile ice queen.  Without the Oscar buzz, not many folks would have checked this one out.  Portman does give it her all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky made such a bold, provocative debut with "Pi" back in 1998. But his career has been nothing but overwrought un-realism ever since. "Black Swan" is an uninspired rehash of Roman Polanski's superb "Repulsion" (1965), about an apparently schizophrenic, sexually repressed young woman who descends into madness amid paranoid hallucinations and libidinous men. "Repulsion" is a great film, while "Black Swan" is overwrought, gimmicky, not the least bit credible, and badly acted -not that it matters considering the superficiality of the exercise. It's also a ballet movie with hardly any ballet in it. Natalie Portman is in great shape but looks absurdly strained performing the simplest of movements.<br /><br />Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is an emotionally disturbed young ballerina who seems to be living out the ambitions of her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nevertheless, she is the hardest-working ballerina in her company, technically perfect, but lacking a certain passion. She dreams of dancing the Swan Queen in "Swan Lake", and, to her surprise and everyone else's, the company's choreographer Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) gives her the part. Mr. Leroy is confident in Nina's ability to play the White Swan but is concerned that she lacks the sexual energy and transcendence to play the Black Swan. The problem preoccupies Nina as well, and the stress erodes her grasp on reality and brings on increasingly violent psychotic episodes.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does not have the acting chops for this role. She does not know how to convey emotion except by emoting. She does the entire film with furrowed brow. A better actress could have made Nina's torment believable but not her situation. It's simply not credible that this weak, flagrantly unstable person would possess the single-minded drive of a professional ballet dancer, much less that anyone would give her the lead in a production. She looks like she's going to have an anxiety attack in every scene. Mila Kunis, on the other hand, is charismatic as rival ballerina Lily, who seems to be genuinely trying to be friendly and helpful to Nina despite the latter's paranoia. Kunis' sassy, lewd and tattooed temptress screams out for more screen time than she gets.<br /><br />Instead, we get crotch shots, hallucinations, CGI that allows Nina to sprout feathers, and very little ballet. On the bright side, "Black Swan" gets better as it goes along, because the story grows into Natalie Portman's panicked performance. By the final act, Nina has reason to break down under the stresses of her paranoia, hallucinations, and determination to become the Black Swan. The film is saved by good pacing, a suspenseful final act, and a climactic ending. But one lesson that filmmakers should find in "Black Swan" is that there is little point in setting a movie in a ballet company if there isn't going to be ballet dancing in it. Another is that a character's personality has to suit her role. And don't expect untalented actresses to be able to carry a dramatic film for an hour and 50 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>How far would you go to be perfect?  After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance.  Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life.  This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away.  I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie.  This is the same director of "Requiem For A Dream" and that should tell you what type of film this is.  I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing.  Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together.  The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy.  I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances.  Portman deservedly won the oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice.  If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie.  It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie.  You will not be dissapointed.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, I would.  This is a movie that you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Last year the world went kind of crazy for `Black Swan', the film that finally brought the world of Darren Aronofsky into the limelight for all to see.  Aronofsky has been creating quality and uniquely intriguing films since the late 90's, and he has brushed Oscar's hand before (garnering acting nominations for `Requiem for a Dream' and `The Wrestler') but it was the bizarrely obsessive `Black Swan' that finally garnered him an acting win (Natalie Portman) as well as Best Picture and Best Director nominations.  It surprises me that this film was `the one' since it is his most immature film to be quite honest.  That isn't to say that it isn't littered with wonderful treats, and Aronofsky's manic yet oddly controlled direction was most deserving of a nomination, but at the end of the day this film is middle-brow Aronofsky at best.<br /><br />I told a friend that this film was like a strange blend of `The Red Shoes' and `Carrie' (two masterpieces) directed by Lars von Trier (genius auteur) with a more polished production thanks to a larger budget.<br /><br />Yes, `Black Swan' is an ugly duckling.<br /><br />The film centers around a young ballerina named Nina who is desperately seeking perfection.  She wants the lead role in her company's revival of `Swan Lake' and she obsesses over the idea of being the Swan Queen, so much so that her whole world starts to take a dark tone.  She is virginal and innocent and childlike in many ways, and so she lacks the otherworldly knowledge to play the dual role part, but she is talented and thus believed in and so she is given the part.  Nina needs to break free from the constraints of her personality, but her upbringing (and her monstrously intrusive mother) makes it hard for her to `let go'.  Then Nina meets Lilly, a young ballerina, new to the company, who possesses everything that Nina lacks; namely sex appeal.  Nina becomes consumed with Lilly, mainly because she is afraid of her.  She begins to suspect that Lilly only wants to take away the lead role from her, and when Lilly is made her alternate she begins to lose her mind with fearful anxiety.<br /><br />`Black Swan' is a very blunt film that doesn't really know the word `restraint', which to be honest is part of the appeal.  The film doesn't hesitate to dive off the crazy train and make a free-fall for deeper waters, especially in the film's final act (which is a visceral work of genius).  The preposterous of the film is highlighted and embraced by Aronofsky's fearless direction, and so you have to appreciate that that is the impression he wanted to make.  Still, there is a feeling of cheapness that erodes some of my affection for the film.<br /><br />I also found that the film's ensemble was very lacking.  There are no layers to these characters.  They are mere caricatures, props for Aronofsky to toy with as he pleases.  I know that a lot of hoopla was made over Natalie Portman and her eventual Oscar win, but I honestly didn't find a lot of depth in her performance.  She was just crazy.  She never really got under the skin of Nina, uncovering who she really was.  Granted, the more I see and contemplate the film I gather that understanding the complexities of Nina wasn't really the point (this film is guilty pleasure personified) but a little depth explored would have fleshed her out and made her more understandable.  Barbara Hershey was also kind of one-note and clich&eacute;d, and not in the way that made her interesting.  Vincent Cassel was horrendous, his line readings were awkward and unbelievable.  In fact, as much as her awards attention baffled me, Mila Kunis was probably the best performance in the film; creating someone we were enthralled with and toying with Nina in a playfully seductive and mysterious manner.<br /><br />And yet still, the film is electrifying and unforgettable.  The cinematography, costume design, makeup, sound (OMG, the way you can hear every swipe of Nina's feet on the floor is to die for), editing and that beautifully haunting reworking of `Swan Lakes' score is just delicious to watch, and Darren Aronofsky knows exactly how to play the audience, drawing us in despite the film's apparent flaws.  This may be Darren's most immature film, but it's quite possibly his best directorial accomplishment.<br /><br />So in the end, I can't hate this film.  I don't understand the unabashed love for it, but I do understand the obsession over it.  It is a film about obsession that captivates its central core by defining obsession.  It oozes with charisma and sucks you in full throttle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>I didn't enjoy watching Black Swan. It would not have taken much persuading me to get up and walk out. As we left the cinema, other than to remark upon its startling intensity, my initial reactions to it were mostly negative. I enjoyed it much more in the twenty four hours afterwards, unpeeling its cuticles and scratching at its feathered back. That suggests the jarring sensation is a superficial one.<br /><br />It was never going to be straightforward with Darren Aronofsky at the helm. Black Swan starts out in a fairly conventional direction - the sheltered heroine battling to escape her castle - but veers off in quite another. So, we watch the unfolding petals of a cosseted young bud, kept out of the light past her date of maturity by well-intending but all the same mendacious forces. We see this charted against the depredations of her environment - there are big, bad wolves everywhere you look - and the technical and spiritual challenges she must overcome to earn her place as the prima ballerina, an award we infer is long past its due date. We see Nina battle her own demons and those of her protectors: there is self-flagellation in her insistence on technical perfection, mirrored in Nina's chastity - self imposed, we suspect - but it is all reinforced by a text-book neurotic, over-protective, historically harmed mother. In a way her mother's behaviour is a sort of vicarious self-flagellation too: Nina is simply the unfortunate vehicle for working out her mother's own self torment.<br /><br />So much, so conventional: as the drama shifts onto Monsieur Leroy, the darkly charged womaniser of a ballet director. He is everything Nina is not: he represents everything she is afraid of: passion: licentiousness.  We first meet him pawing his stable of swans, like a Siamese King inspecting his harem. He's a tease, too: those he has *not* patted can report to his chamber at sundown. There is an uneasy equilibrium, though, in the same way there is between lions and gazelles in the Serengeti: this is an ecosystem, and for it to function it must be so.<br /><br />And then, breaking up the order and hierarchy is a new dancer, flown in to neurotic New York from free-loving West Coast San Francisco to deputise for an injured dancer. In case that wasn't enough of a clue, we're told in an off-stage exchange between Leroy and Nina, she is a free spirit: she may not have all nina's the technical chops, but she *feels it*. She can, Leroy remarks teasingly, let herself go.<br /><br />He tells Nina more than once she is his perfect white swan. But he has trouble seeing the dark alter ego she must inhabit to play the Black Swan.<br /><br />There you have it: a white swan, a black one (though of course it doesn't play out as straightforwardly as that), a wicked witch, Bluebeard. Enough dramatic impetus to last you a week. And boy does Aronofsky deliver it, too: you get that impetus focussed and concentrated into a two hour spell, which is about as intense an experience as you could ask for. This is Scotty in the engine room material: any more, captain, and she'll blow.<br /><br />Aronofsky adds another level of doubt by interposing a layer of fantasy here too. From the opening scene - a dream - we know Nina has an active subconscious, and we're not clear in early exchanges what is "real" and what is not. This extrapolates unhappily, however: as the flood waters of Nina's neuroticism rise, a fertile imagination gives way to active hallucination, which eventually canters onwards into a diagnosable psychotic episode. Intensity to the max, but it undermines the dramatic development. Was that her mother sleeping in a chair in her room while she fantasised? Was she just fantasising? Or was she fantasising about fantasising?<br /><br />Now once or twice that sort of ambiguity would be ok: adding a little uncertainty to further pique the raging intensity (not, though, like the picture needed it). But Aronofsky over-uses the trick: the default assumption becomes is hallucination. This alleviates, rather than builds, tension.<br /><br />There is a profound undercurrent of ickiness: the self flagellation, per his previous picture, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0847832430">The Wrestler</a>, becomes self-harming. But it feels unnecessary: guignol for the sake of it. The purely ballet-oriented gruelitudes (particularly the punishment a ballerina administers to her feet) are enough make this point without the (usually illusory) woundings. In sensationalising this way Aronofsky cheapens his art: he cuts it with hyperbole. Likewise with some of the eroticisms: no red-blooded fellow will completely object to being asked to watch Natalie Portman's onanstic activities (and more!), but Aronofsky goes beyond what is strictly necessary for his statement, even if he doesn't ever quite let Nina get to hers (all the more tension!): It is a little artistically voyeuristic.<br /><br />Because of all his mucking about in mental hyperspace, where we don't know what's real and what's not, Aronofsky's climax misses its beat profoundly. It's a silly, trite, implausible ending - the credits fade up and it feels like a ten-ton weight has been dropped on the picture, Monty Python style.<br /><br />Is it a good film? Yes. It's a very good film, though I think I'd take a certain amount of evasive action to avoid watching it again. Is it great one? That I'm not so sure about.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky's latest tells the story of a troubled young dancer.  Withdrawn and focused on perfection, she channels in her tiny, muscled body the ambition and resentment of her overbearing mother.  Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance as Nina, who's won the role of the Swan Queen in an ambitious adaptation of Tchakovsky's Swan Lake ballet.  She begins to break down under the strain of a demanding choreographer, who insists she be more passionate, and a controlling mother who wishes her to remain a biddable child.  I never expected a story about ballerinas could be so viscerally intense - at once moving and horrific.

That is what the delimma here is. In order to dance the swan in the newest version of Swan Lake, Natalie Portman is asked to become both the light and dark sides of herself. Doing the first part is her specialty but the dark - that is different. Still, she has already managed to take the place of her former and feel good in that. The flipside there is that she also has someone new breathing down her neck, waiting to take over. With the pressure adding up and time running out, can she become the thing she hopes to be?<br /><br />When I went to see Black Swan, I don't know what I expected but I did expect something more. I'm not downing the movie either, because it delivers on a psychological plateau. Still, the hype about awards and about the darkness within this movie make it out to be something that should be able to overwhelm you with the mystery of the moment. Instead, it is mostly about the struggles of one dancer trying not to lose it as she makes herslef into something more.<br /><br />There are admittedly odd parts and those are interesting. There is also this feeling of paranoia that stretches all across this picture, making you feel like something is happening. Things appear in the shadows, people do not seem to be what they claim to be, and a metamorphsis seems to be transpiring. all the time you watch this and wonder what is going on, and good acting leads you to really question the reality and the sanity of the situation. That's the upside. The downside is that small bits happen here and there, adding in about fifteen minutes of mystery into this growing feature. In some ways it has Jacob's Ladde rmoments that are really downplayed, making you wonder what you just witnessed. Still, it is not all good. You have slow places mingling in, making the movie drag in places. she dances and practices and loves and does other things. she even has a moment where her director tells her to go home and touch herself. That and the "moment" her fellow actress share - the thing some people seem to have hyped - are things that were seen by a lot of people but should not be such big things.<br /><br />There's a lot more to this than that.<br /><br />If you want to know this movie, think mindgames and then decide. You know what the person wants and you know others will want it, too. You also know it has oddity, but this is not a new feeling. It does have a good setup and I like it enough to say it is a solid 4, but I am not overly impressed. I would not see it again, for example, having my fill of it. That said, I did like it and I thought it was good - I just hate critically acclaimed because it misleads.<br /><br />4 stars - again, this is for the movie on the big screen and one time through.<br /><br />Thank you for your time</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Nina (Natalie Portman) is your typical New York ballerina who would do anything to be the swan queen for the big production of "Swan Lake".

She goes on hallucinatory trips that brings her to the very brink of insanity.<br /><br />A solid psychological horror thriller from Darren Aronofsky is one of his best movies and one of 2010's best movies. What really sold is that this movie is an artistic mind-screw in the tradition of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Alfred Hitchcock with brilliant acting from Portman and others, quality directions, imaginative yet disturbing hallucinations such as the cringe inducing cuticle pull sequence and a classical score to the soundtrack of the timeless classic ballet known as Swan Lake.

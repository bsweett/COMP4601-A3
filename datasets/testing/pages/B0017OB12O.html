Saito, commandant of the work camp in the Burmese jungle, doesn't particularly like the English.  According to him, they have dishonored themselves by surrendering,  "I hate the British!" he screams.<br /><br />Saito hates them but finds himself in the difficult and humiliating position of needing the stiff-necked Colonel Nicholson's assistance to build his train track and his bridge.  He threatens and tries to break Nicholson, all to no available.  Nicholson would literally prefer death to compromising on his principles.  His principles?  That officers not work along with enlisted personnel.  Officers are for leadership and command not menial labor.<br /><br />Without Nicholson's cooperation, Saito will fail, his bridge will not be built and he will be obliged to commit suicide.  Saito blinks and gives Nicholson what he demands.  Nicholson and many of his officers and men--in an effort to maintain discipline and purpose--throw themselves fully into the project and build a bridge far better than the Japanese ever would have.  Nicholson has, in fact, become an unwitting collaborator with the Japanese.  Nicholson is a heroic figure but his courage doesn't mitigate the fact that he is helping the enemy.<br /><br />'Bridge on the River Kwai' is a terrific film.  It was adapted from the book by Pierre Boulle...a man who, himself, wasn't in love with the British...as a matter of fact, he may have detested the Brits as much as his character, Saito.  To Boulle, Nicholson is the archetypal British colonial officer, brave, stubborn and arrogant in equal measure.  His attitudes are those of colonialism...the White Man's Burden and all that.  This is not the way Lean formats this film but, nevertheless, both the book and movie are terrific.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>At a local movie theater on the first Monday of the month they run one showing of a classic movie. One day I saw that The Bridge on the River Kwai was playing. I walked out of the theater knowing I had seen one of the best movies ever made.<br />  The plot is about a bridge being built by Allied prisoners of war. The battle centers around two strong willed men. Col Nicholson (Alec Guinness) a british commander who refuses to comply with Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)who runs the camp. During this battle Cmdr./Maj. Shears (William Holden) escapes only to be called back into duty to destroy the bridge that now Nicholson has taken great pride in constructing.<br />  This is one of those movies that is slow paced but done so deliberetly. Director David Lean paces the movie so by the end you don't even want to go to the bathroom, (Lean would use the same style in the brilliant Lawrence of Arabia).</p></br><a href="../users/A3BFJFJRXMWXAX.html">A3BFJFJRXMWXAX</a><br/><p>This is a must-see film for anyone who wants to even pretend to be 'up' on film history or attempt to pass pronouncements on current films.  David Lean crafted one of history's best cinematic experiences with this 1957 film.  Alec Guiness is great as the 'leader' of a group of British POW's under the supervision of a Japanese war camp superintendant.  The prisoners have been forced to build a bridge over the river that bears the film's namesake.  Less an action film than a drama, BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI gives us fascinating characters and shows us how they change over the course of the film.  In the end we have learned much about each of them, and no one is quite what he seems to be at the beginning.  While there is action, this is almost more of a character study in how humans bear up under extraordinary circumstances. <p>Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>Where does duty stop and to whom is it due?  These are some of the questions dealt with in this WWII film classic set in a prisoner-of-war camp in Burma.  The matter-of-factness of Alec Guinness is captivating as is William Holden's vacillation between honor and trickery.<p>The prisoners are directed to build a bridge for the Japanese army.  Told that all prisoners will work, Guinness points out the articles in the Geneva Convention that expressly forbid officers from working anything other than administrative chores.  The camp commander refuses to comply and thus begins the battle of wills between them.  The commander has his duty to his superiors, just as Guinness has his duty to the commander, to his country, and to his men.  He does not see the problem of these conflicting duties until it is too late.<p>Holden is an American who is just trying to go home.  After a daring escape, he winds up "volunteering" to return to the POW camp.  Although he just wants to go home, he sense of duty pushes him back.<p>I would recommend seeing this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>grunts a soldier from the British Army after Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness) has returned to lead them in their labors.  Having spent several days in isolation from the tyrannical Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) because Nicholson would not let his officers work manual labor on the bridge, a bridge Saito is charged with having finished by mid May.  The first hour of the film is a battle of wills between the two men, the last 90 minutes deals with the bridge itself and its place in the war.  Eventually a team is sent in to detonate the bridge, leading to one of the most exciting climax scenes in the history of film.<br /><br />The movie is presented here in a two disc set which features an excellent transfer as well as some great behind the scenes material you will find interesting.  The package includes a short booklet detailing the challenges the filmmakers encountered while making the movie, including weather problems, difficulties with casting, and the actual set with the bridge itself, one of the most fascinating sights ever.  The story about the destruction of the bridge is incredible, some of the details you don't see on screen.<br /><br />As a film the casting and story are impeccable.  Guiness is perfect as the stone faced Col. Nicholson, who honors the British army and their capability over anything else, which leads him to some rather questionable decisions while in command.  Hayakawa is strong and convincing as the Japanese commander who rules with a desperate iron fist, as he is up against a deadline.  William Holden stars as the only American in the movie, who escapes the camp and later becomes an integral part of the final plan (against his will).  All three are fantastic.  This is a movie I can watch at any time, repeatedly.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>This famous movie is now 50 years old but still remains one of the great classics in film. It it a story about honor, about an English regiment that surrenders to the Japanese in WW II Burma. To not lose the English honor the colonel decides to show the Japanese colonel to help build the best bridge possible, thereby also humiliating the colonel who, if not finished on time, would kill himself.<br />The English colonel remains naive, first he keeps sticking to the Geneva Convention but the Japanese don't give in.In the end he helps them with the bridge, of which he is very proud. But it is also aiding the enemy. His conflicts come to an amazing end.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>Literally cannot say enough good things about this BD release.

He once famously said, "I only feel alive when I'm making a movie."  In The Bridge on the River Kwai Lean imprisons us in a lush landscape and forces us an to put our minds to a task that will give us some relief from the harsh reality of being a POW constructing the Burma Railway.  Controversial to many as a condemnation of a British character flaw of "doing one's duty and being happy in your work."  The same notion was also reflected in the Nuremburg Trials.  This taut story by Pierre Boulle also offered a final moment of redemption - however posthumous. But that's the hell of war.  See William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa are at their best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I saw this classic many years ago in a downtown San Francisco cinema and it blew me away.  Since then I have seen periodically and the film has never lost it's luster to me. In fact seeing now in Blu-ray, it has gained even newer perspective in it's themes of militarism, honor and the madness of war as when the camp doctor rails at the end, "It's madness, madness".  William Holden was added to the movie so that the film would gain an international following since he was the number one star at the time and in retrospect, it was a wise move to contrast his cynical American soldier/sailor to the disciplined, high principled Colonel Nicolson, superbly played by Alec Guinness who was thought of as a light comedian due to his many successful Ealing comedies.  As Holden put it, "Alec received the glory, but I became rich (thanks to a percentage deal)".  Nevertheless this film will hold up for the ages and the Blu-ray transfer is even better than when it was shown on HD Net Movies.  If you love war films and classic cinema--do check this one out!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This famous film is long (161 minutes), is over 50 years old, and yet still is terrific, still holds up and will forever, I suspect, be considered one of the greatest war movies ever made.<br /><br />'Kwai' is particularly amazing in that there is very little action in it, yet it consistently entertains. It's as good now as when I saw in the theater as a 12-year-old.  I say this to encourage younger people to check this classic-era film out, and give it a chance.<br /><br />Anyone who is fascinated with character studies also might find this of particular interest regarding Alec Guiness' role in here as "Colonel Nicholson." He was mesmerizing in his role. William Holden, Sessue Hayakawan, Jack Hawkins and the rest of the cast are all excellent, with the four mentioned above perhaps playing the roles of their lives.<br /><br />The gorgeous countryside of Ceylon is photographed beautifully. David Lean, one of the all-time great directors, did this film, too, so it certainly has good credentials. A winner of seven Oscars, this great movie has stood the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>"Bridge On the River Kwai" is one of those masterpiece movies.  Sir Alec Guiness is a standout, as is the Japanese commander.  The tension builds artfully throughout the duration of the movie as cruelties escalate and the prisoners try to outsmart their captors.  Perserverence is the name of the game and William Holden perserveres and injects his own dramatic style into the bargaining.  We finally get the pay off and it is a doozie.  BOTRK deserves all of its academy awards and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>An excellent movie.

I can recommend this movie for everyone. There is a bit of violence but it is done with taste.<br /><br />Ps.There is a book called Ship of Ghosts. It is the true story of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>David Lean directed this classic, masterpiece in 1957, right before he began work on Lawrence of Arabia. It is filled with<br />richness in theme, narrative, and characterization and supported by an incredible cast. This film describes the horrors of war and man's pyschological struggle to find meaning and survival amidst the horror.<br />Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge but his efforts are failing and only by soliciting help with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), can he accomplish his task but this escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine. Meanwhile an American escapee (William Holden) leads a commando raid to blow up the bridge. Alec Guinness won a much deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work. His realization at what he's sacrificed to keep his troops morale and survival is astonishing.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>War films dont get better than this.

There are two DVD versions in the market.  The regular version and the limited edition.  I opted for the latter despite the cost because if this is a &quot;very good movie&quot;, I wanted to be treated with whatever was on that second DVD and I'm happy to say that this is one hell of a movie!<p>I don't think today's movies can do what was done on &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  It's even hard to believe that this movie was made with a two million dollar budget.  The movie is brilliant as it tackles two major storylines between two leaders Colonel Nicholson for the English and Colonel Saito for the Japanese.  Two fanatics + another (the commando / British Major) who comes later in the story.<p>The movie was brilliantly done and for a movie that was made in 1957, the video was very nice and it's letterboxed and in digital 5.1.  You can hear the insects and birds all around you. <p>After you are done with the movie, you are then treated with the nearly an hour documentary on the film which is filled with interesting tidbits such as the problems of making the film to learning how demanding the director was.  Very interesting.  Also, an appreciation of the film by John Milius (director of &quot;Big Wednesday).  The original B&amp;W featurette,  a short USC film narrated by William Holden, movie trailers for other movies by the Spiegel/Lean duo, cast information and more.  <p>This is an awesome DVD.  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>This enduring classic is (loosely, very loosely) the story of the WW2 POWs used to build the Thai/Burma railroad.  The larger war becomes a personal battle between 3 forces:  The Japanese soldiers looking for labor led by Colonel Saito, the British soldiers looking to serve as prisoners as dictated by the Geneva Convention led by Colonel Nicholsen (Alec Guiness winning an academy award) and the commandos looking to destroy the bridge led by Naval officer Shear.<br /><br />The morality (or more specifically madness) of war is adressed in the movie.  The pointless nature of armed conflict reads true today, as do issues of handling prisoners.  The movie's a long one, but one of the few that justifies the added time.  Every piece is indeed required in this classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>William Holden may be the star of the film but Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors. Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's "Colonel Bogey March." This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the "Colonel Bogey March" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to Columbia/Tri Star 2000 release DVD of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;....<p>I am still whistling that wonderful theme song from this film(I watched it 2 days ago),&quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;. From the moment the British soldiers march into the Japaneese P.O.W. camp, whistling that tune I was once again hooked on this fabulous World War II movie!<p>The story, based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, is loosely based on actual events that occured during the war.The very proper Colonel Nicholson(Alec Guinness) leads his captured,but proud and tattered British troops into the Japaneese P.O.W. camp they have been assigned to.It is there that he comes face to face with the commander of the camp, the equally proper Colonel Saito(Sessue Hayakawa).Saito and Nicholson are immediatly at odds, concerning the assignment of the British, to build a railway bridge for their enemies over the River Kwai.Both men are highly principled in their beliefs, stubborn in their ways and will not give in where their honor is concerned.Saito seems to have the upper hand, using cruel and unusual punishment to try to persuade Nicholson, but to no avial. The bridge must be built and eventually they come to a compromise.Nicholson sets his men to the task in an almost obssessive way and takes great pride in the job his men are doing.<p>Meanwhile......an escapee from the camp, American sailor Shears(William Holden),whose only ambition is to get home, has now &quot;volunteered&quot; to lead a task force, including the over zealous British commander Major Warden(Jack Hawkins),back to the camp so they can blow up the bridge.And of course you know with Holden leading the team there will also be some romance mixed in with the action!<p>It's a great adventure from start to finish. Directed by David Lean with perfection, filmed in the breathtaking locales of Ceylon, with an engaging script by Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, you'll fall in love with this epic film.It recieved the Best Picture(1957) Award from Oscar and also garnered a Best Director for Lean, and Best Actor for Guinness, as well as Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, and Music Scoring!<p>You will not miss one detail of the jungles in this beautifully remastered DVD. The colors are sharp and vibrant. It is presented in the original theatrical widescreen(anamorphic), aspect ratio 2.55:1, and every bit of scenery right to the edges is outstanding. The choices on the sound are 5.1 Dol Dig or 2.0 surround. The dialouge is crisp and clear, as is the musical score. The surrounding sounds are not quite as clear but is still good. It may be viewed in several languages or with subtitles as well. There is not too much on the special features on this edition(see tech info), however there is a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; for not much more than this one with a ton of extras(if only I'd known when I bought this one...),that is also by Columbia so I would guess the picture and sound are excellent as well.<p>One of the best war movies ever made..go for it..Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>Richly deserving its 1957 "Best Picture" Academy Award, "The Bridge On The River Kwai" is truly one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen (and I had never seen it even once until just a few days before writing this review).<br /><br />Directed expertly by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel, "The Bridge On The River Kwai" never falters. From the very first well-composed "CinemaScope" frame, right through to its exciting climax, everything about this motion picture is spot-on perfect.<br /><br />The film tells the World War 2 story of a group of British P.O.W.s who are handed the assignment of constructing a railway bridge across the Kwai river, deep within an Asian jungle in the hot and steamy summer of 1943.<br /><br />Each actor in this movie shines brightly in his respective part -- beginning with Alec Guinness' absolutely wonderful award-winning portrayal of "Colonel Nicholson", who undergoes more than his fair share of torture and abuse at the hands of the Japanese "Colonel Saito" (played by Sessue Hayakawa). Guinness' Nicholson is a man guided by an immovable set of rigged principles. And he ends up winning his battle of nerves (and torture) against his Japanese enemy. A truly remarkable performance by Mr. Guinness. It's no wonder he was nominated for the "Best Actor" Oscar for his role in this film. And, rightfully so, he won the award as well.<br /><br />The great William Holden (age 38 here) earned a healthy 1-million-dollar salary for his part as "Shears" in the movie (plus he got a portion of the film's box-office receipts too). And he earned every cent, as far as I'm concerned. While his part is not quite as deeply-layered or extensive as Alec Guinness' in the picture, Holden's character is still a vital and integral part of the film, as he plays a soldier who sets out on a mission to destroy the River Kwai bridge.<br /><br />Jack Hawkins rounds out the main cast, as "Major Warden", the hard-nosed leader of the Allied Commando team assigned to blow up the just-finished Kwai railway bridge.<br /><br />An interesting thing hit me a day after I finished watching this movie for the first time -- I found myself re-living portions of the film over again in my head, and (of course) found myself whistling the unforgettably-sensational "River Kwai March" theme tune (aka "Colonel Bogey March"), which is something that's likely to stay with you for quite a long time. (The DVD Menus make sure you won't forget the melody either.)<br /><br />Plus, the day after I saw it, I also found myself already beginning to appreciate the "timelessness" and award-winning flavor and grandeur of this epic-scale motion picture. And I even felt a strong desire to watch the whole 162-minute film all over again the very next day. When a movie can have that much impact on a viewer, what better compliment can there be to emphasize its greatness?<br /><br />Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the 2-Disc edition of "The Bridge On The River Kwai" on November 21, 2000, and it's a great-looking DVD in all respects, in my opinion. Sporting a beautiful and colorful Anamorphic Widescreen print of the film, Disc One of this two-disc set contains the full-length film in its original CinemaScope aspect ratio of approximately 2.55:1. The lush quality of the photography shines through brilliantly here via this nice, crisp-looking Widescreen version. I'd hate to think of having to watch this movie in a hacked-to-pieces Pan-&-Scan Full-Screen version. Luckily, such torture is not required here, because the original Widescreen format is available on this DVD.<br /><br />There are multiple Dolby Digital soundtracks to choose from for the movie -- a 5.1 Surround track plus a 2.0 Surround option as well. Both of these tracks sound very good to me. Lots of subtitling options are available as well, plus an "Isolated Music Score" soundtrack too.<br /><br />Several fulfilling bonus features take up residence on Disc #2, including a nicely-done 53-minute Making-Of documentary, as well as an original 1950s-era vintage behind-the-cameras featurette ("The Rise And Fall Of A Jungle Giant"), which has a satisfying old-time "nostalgic" feel to it.<br /><br />While I very much enjoyed the "Jungle Giant" mini-featurette (which lasts for a little more than 6 minutes) for its unique behind-the-scenes type of footage -- I couldn't help but scratch my head in bewilderment when the final portion of the program seemingly is cut off abruptly without explanation. The narration and video build the viewer's suspense, taking us right up to the brink of the dramatic one-take-only scene of the bridge being blown to bits, then there's a splice in the film just prior to seeing any behind-the-scenes stuff of the actual detonation, with the film then trailing off into its closing few seconds (an "epilogue" of sorts). Very odd I thought. Makes me wonder if that bridge-blowing sequence was somehow lost and not able to be recovered for some reason.<br /><br />Additional DVD Extras --- A "USC Short Film" (with an introduction by William Holden), which runs for just under 16 minutes. This is a kind of a "lesson" in filmmaking techniques, with "The Bridge On The River Kwai" used as an example of what goes into feature filmmaking. Lots of behind-the-scenes footage on the sets of "Kwai" is included here.<br /><br />Another featurette on Disc 2 is "An Appreciation By Filmmaker John Milius". This is an 8-minute "appreciation" of "The Bridge On The River Kwai" by Mr. Milius, as he provides his personal thoughts on the film and its impact on him. Needless to say, he loves the movie. And his comments here are quite interesting too.<br /><br />There are also four Theatrical Trailers included as DVD bonus material (including one for "River Kwai"). Plus -- A 7-minute "Photo Montage" (on a musically-scored timed track, with "Pause" capability enabled). The "montage" was a slight disappointment to this writer, simply because it only includes photos of poster art and advertising materials for the film. No "publicity stills" are included at all. Which is kind of odd because a few such items are seen within the Making-Of documentary. Still, the filmed montage is done very nicely, with appropriate underscoring to add atmosphere.<br /><br />Rounding out this healthy batch of DVD supplements is a "Talent Files" section, featuring brief text-only bios on five members of the "Kwai" cast and crew.<br /><br />Also included as part of the 2-Disc "Limited Edition" DVD package is a collectible 12-page booklet, which is a replica (reprint) of the original 1957 souvenir book. The last page of the booklet is a DVD Scene Selection guide for the film's 40 chapters.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />"The Bridge On The River Kwai" took more than a full year to film and edit, finally making its debut in movie theaters on December 18, 1957. But that year spent in the Asian jungle was definitely worth it. Because what resulted from that strenuous year of sweat and gritty filmmaking was a true cinematic masterwork.<br /><br />So, take this DVD for a spin soon .... and then watch yourself replaying much of the movie in your head the next day. For this is a DVD to treasure; and a movie to remember. For all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>If someone had the inclination, &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; could have been divided into two very respectable movies.  The first, concerning a group of British prisoners of war charged with erecting the title piece, would have been a neat little psychological drama and character study starring Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa.  The second, an action-adventure thriller, would follow William Holden, accompanied by Jack Hawkins, as they braved the harsh Asian jungle in a plot to blow up said title piece.  Each movie, as I see them in my own head, would have their fair share of suspense, action, snappy dialogue, intriguing characters, and powerful narrative thrust.  Each would have been a critical success, a popular smash, and an enduring classic.  However, they are not two movies.  They are one cohesive whole.  And here the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<p>David Lean skillfully weaves these the two narrative threads together.  Even with a 160 minute running time, Lean never wastes a moment.  Everything leads to something else, and it is always entertaining.  Lean is that rare director who has a firm handle on both the visual and narrative elements of his films.  He reigns both in here with considerable skill, only showing what the audience needs to see, and what he wants them to see.<p>As in most war movies, madness is a theme that runs rampant.  Each of the main characters has dipped into some sort of madness, which manifests itself in four unique and intriguing ways.<p>Guinness is Col. Nicholson, a by the book British officer.  He carries around a copy of the Geneva Convention, and expects his Japanese captors, isolated for many months in the jungle, to adhere to them.  Guinness' greatest work here is in portraying Nicholson's stubbornness in the face of grave danger, and his pride in a job well done.  It could have been a showy role in the hands of a lesser actor, as there is a temptation to externalize Nicholson's crumble from sanity.  Guinness is subtle beyond the call of duty (even in his physical portrayal; one moment has him, after a long stint imprisoned in an oven-like box, paraded in front of his men.  Catch Nicholson trying to march with military precision on legs terrorized by atrophy.  It is a heartbreaking, and heroic, moment).<p>Colonel Saito, played by Hayakawa, is a man caught in a most unenviable position.  In the beginning, he appears to be holding all the cards.  But as we soon see, he is as much a pawn as the prisoners he's captured, indebted as much to his superiors as to his honour of duty.  The problem with the character of Colonel Saito, and really the only hole in the whole film, is that he is supposed to be a menacing character.  But we never see him be menacing; we have to rely on the word of Commander Shears.  A scene of him killing in cold blood would have gone a long way later on, when his transition to Guinness' subordinate would have been even more powerful.<p>Major Warden, played by Hawkins, comes late to the story, but has much to say about how the second half will play out.  He too is controlled by a sense of British duty, but his madness exhibits itself in a less controlled way.  Warden, who's spent most of his time playing war games in a tropical paradise of a base, expects his mission to be a walk in the park.  The horrors he encounters (both physical and psychological) are unexpected and hit him much harder than the others.  Hawkins, as both the English gentleman and the tormented soldier, does a fine job.<p>Holden plays probably the most intriguing character.  His Commander Shears has lived with his madness the longest, and has developed an ironic anti-hero callus to shield himself from the horrors.  We first see him digging graves for his fallen comrades, of which he is the last to survive.  From there, his situation gets much worse.  Shears adopts a mocking tone when confronting his superiors, parakeeting their catch phrases (&quot;When you're done, there's always one more thing to do&quot;; &quot;Be happy in your work&quot;) to the point of ridiculing them.  And even when he manages to escape the physical prison, he manages to get drawn back there against his will.<p>The prevailing madness of the film comes to a head in the end as Major Clipton, the camp's doctor and arguably the only character not afflicted by insanity up to this point (and probably my favourite character), has a Conrad-like epiphany.  It's a moment that rivals Kurtz' &quot;The horror!  The horror!&quot; from &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Kwai's&quot; war-movie progeny &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.<p>Even though many of its themes are psychological, it's no surprise why &quot;Kwai&quot; became both a popular and critical success.  It has all the elements of a grand classic: an all-star cast, tight suspense, lush scenery, humour, drama, finely drawn characters, intense action, and well-scripted dialogue.  And of course, there's the great whistling scene; nothing better than a bright melody to cut through the horrors of war.  It's a charming little scene that both brings a smile to your face and warns of tough times ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>There really aren't enough superlatives to describe the beauty, power and human drama in this film. The restoration is magnificent, the photography beautiful and the story compelling. Sessue Hayakawa gives a masterful performance as Colonel Saito; easily the most complex portrayal of any Japanese person in WWII movie history. He is completely unable to understand the British sense of honor, since being taken prisoner in the Japanese mindset is the ultimate dishonor. Yet he is also unable to deny that he and his own officers are simply not competent enough to tackle the task at hand, namely to build a railway bridge across the River Kwai -- and do so under a non-negotiable deadline. To fail this task would cause his own public dishonor, yet to yield to the contest of wills with Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), whom he desperately needs to build the bridge, would cause him to suffer a loss of face and deep personal dishonor -- a Hobson's choice. Alec Guinness is simply brilliant in his role -- and simply British. On one level he is the quintessential British colonial master, out to &quot;teach these people a lesson...that will put them to shame&quot;. His pride allows him to convince himself that building the bridge is nothing more than a morale booster for his men -- never mind that it furthers the Japanese war effort. He reasons that since he was ordered to surrender that to then refuse to do his captor's bidding might be considered tantamount to insubordination. But beyond doing what is merely necessary, he becomes obsessed with building a bridge that will last hundreds of years. In reality he is constructing a monument to himself, since he is now in the twilight of his military career. William Holden gives a wonderful performance as Shears, the only American to witness this contest of wills. He is much more interested in living &quot;like a human being&quot; and avoiding any military duty than dying for such a twisted sense of &quot;honor&quot;. However, though, circumstances dictate that he become the proverbial reluctant hero. There are so many other outstanding touches and performances in this film that to describe them all would take more time than it would to simply watch it. In this case, one picture is truly worth a thousand words.

This 1957 DVD Limited Edition (7 Oscar Winner including the BIG 3; Best Picture, Director - David Lean and Actor - Alec Guinness) World War II Japanese Prisoner Of War camp Classic remains one of the best psycological war movies made.  (1953's &quot;Stalag 17&quot; a WWII German POW camp is the other.  Ironically William Holden won a Best Actor Oscar).  <p>The story is about 3 main fanatical characters; First is Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) the Japanese prison camp commander.  Second is Colonel Nicolson (Alec Guinness) the English commander of the POW's (introduced by the now famous whistling tune, &quot;Colonel Bogey's March&quot;). Third is an English (demolition expert) Commando Major (Jack Hawkins) guided by an escape POW (William Holden) a reluctant, coerced sailor who's kismet is chosen for him.  These 3 Soldiers and 1 Sailor have impossible missions to accomplish with all their fates focused at one common place at one specific time.  <p>The 2 Stories are; One build &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; in a very compressed time line.  The Second is to destroy this same bridge.  The stories have many twists and turns while the finale is surprisingly abrupt after a long complex journey.<p>This 1957 wide screen classic is beautifully restored and plays very well even without all the special digital effects of today.  The realism is so vivid.  Seen phyically on the POW's and soldiers bodies and faces.  The Dolby 5.1 puts you in the thick of the jungle with an eerie feeling.  A frighteningly close environment, dense, with very little visibility but the sound is 360 degrees.  Only these sounds to cue your imagination and senses.  <p>As always with a DVD 2 pack there is an abundance of background information about the movie.  A nice collectors package.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British  director who brought us such unforgettable classics as "Lawrence of  Arabia", "Doctor Zhivago", "Ryan's Daughter" and, of course, "Bridge Over  the River Kwai", (see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography in  all of Lean's films is always spectacular and breathtaking, for Lean had a  special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set  the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Lean characteristically  focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal  characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and  historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a  uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular  individual situation. <p>Each of these films is also a well-choreographed  and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of  the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are  always delighted by what Lean displays. In "Bridge Over The River Kwai",  the first of these spectacular films to be produced by Lean, the wildness  and danger of the surrounding jungle is used as an active metaphor by Lean  which he uses to bind the British prisoners into a life and death struggle  with the despotic camp commander, whose feudal philosophy leads him to view  the prisoners as shameful cowards who do not deserve to be treated like  human beings.  Their curiously na?ve and self-important commanding officer,  played brilliantly by Sir Alec Guiness, immediately becomes embroiled in a  power struggle with the Japanese commander that sets the plot churning into  overdrive, speeding the story along toward further confrontations and a  number of interesting plot twist.  <p>Also excellent as a cynical American  sailor landlocked in the camp is William Holden, who plays the part with  such blithe and careless detachment it is hard to appreciate how good he  is, unless you are familiar with his performance in other films such as  "The Bridges At Toko-Ri" or "Network". The supporting cast is excellent,  and the script, written by the novelist who penned the original book, is  taut, lean, and full of memorable dialogue and terrific dramatics. The  action unfolds as part of the larger context of the war itself, which  provides the necessary impetus to explain the desperate, cruel, and  courageous behavior of the characters. The cinematography here is  absolutely breath-taking, and the many spectacular action sequences and  memorable musical score all contribute to make this one of the most popular  and memorable films of all time. By the way, the film has aged very well,  and as a piece of history and as a piece of popular entertainment it is  always a pleasure to view as one of the outstanding films of the 1950s.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>Where do the greatest wars take place: On the battle field or in the mind? The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British World War II film directed by David Lean. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and was shot in Sri Lanka. It is a war classic on every level. The acting, story, dialogue, and philosophy all put forth in this forth are excellent. A unit of British soldiers are captured and marched to a Japanese prison camp in western Thailand. At this camp they are forced to build an extremely important railroad bridge for the Japanese.  Throughout this challenge the unit is led valiantly by their commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). The Colonel is really the centerpiece and most important character in the film. He is always pushing forward, staying positive, professional, and determined no matter how dismal the situation may appear to be. The talent and integrity Alec Guinness displayed in this role won him the well deserved Best Actor Academy Award. Watch this film and contemplate a path of enlightenment that applies to war, peace, and everything in between.<br /><br />Colonel Nicholson: It is quite understandable; it's a very natural reaction. But one day - in a week, a month, a year - on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again, you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity. What you have done should be, and I think will be, an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike. You have survived with honor - that, and more - here in the wilderness. You have turned defeat into victory. I congratulate you. Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>This is movie is an excellent WWII prisoner of war film.

It's worth noting that director David Lean's association with actor Alec Guinness goes back to his stupendous film of 1946 "Great Expectations" which Leonard Maltin refers to as "One of the greatest films ever made" with which I am in complete agreement.  There are precious few films directed by Lean in which Alec Guinness does not appear.  All that notwithstanding Lean and Guinness came to a major disagreement during the making of "Bridge" over Guinness's characterization and were not on speaking terms for a good part of the production period.  They had to have a messenger convey their communications.  I believe that when Guinness saw the finished cut of the film, he had to admit that David was right.<br /><br />The film has  an excellent cast:  William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, James Donald and particularly Jack Hawkins, my favorite British actor.  His stunning performance in the great Ealing film "The Cruel Sea" (1953) about the war in the Atlantic during World War II is still among the best films of its kind.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of "Bridge" is of particular benefit to this beautifully photographed film.  It has been pointed out that the explosions seen destroying the bridge do not correspond to the placement of the charges as seen the night before.  But that doesn't take away from the great power of this now classic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>To the Japanese officer to surrender is to dishonor yourself.<br />So prisoners are treated as the lowest of the low.<br />When an iron willed British officer who was ordered to surrender meets<br />an iron willed Japanese prisoner camp commander, real sparks fly.<br />The compromise that is reached gets the bridge built, but at a cost<br />of a no-win solution,when a British commando team led by an former American prisoner of that camp comes to blow up the bridge.<br />When I first saw this movie I had no idea that the Japanese<br />were even worse than the movie showed them all across Asia.<br />To say that the devil had a good tool in the Japanese Imperial Army is<br />little short of the truth, as Japanese soldiers raped and killed near or above a half million Chinese girls and women during the war.<br />One comes to distrust the Japanese idea of honor and morality when faced with history and factual documentation of their war crimes.<br />This movie if anything soft-pedals their behavior.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>The jungles and mountainpeaks, rivers and animals make this a cinematic masterpiece. I would love to visit Ceylon but of course not during war. Its beauty is just absolute. The picture's story was also quite good. The overall theme to me was is there honor in wartime. To we become quite human and do what we can to survive or do we cling to the rules and stay soldiers to the end. In the movie Alec Guiness plays the rule oriented Major caught in a prison camp being told to build a bridge with his other subordinates, should he keep up the farce and play Major or leader until they are freed, following the rules no matter if it kills him. William Holden who is one of the subordinates disagrees, one other sees his point. Guiness becomes obsessed with his leadership and the bridge is his projection of obsession and his eventual demise. A stunning visual feast. Ceylon is and should be a dream come true not a place for negative energy to florish.<br />Lisa Nary</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>The Bridge on the River Kwai is a fantastic film account of one man's misguided but honorable attempt to rally his men together in the midst of troubling circumstances.<p>When British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and his men willfully surrender to the Japanese army, they are sent to a prison camp where they must work on an enemy railroad bridge. But Nicholson won't stand for it, eventually having his men do it on his terms. Soon he's virtually running the prison camp, but his misplaced duty has him doing his best work for the enemy.<p>Though at many times it seems ludicrous that a British Colonel would really be so out there that he'd think he was doing a good thing helping the enemy, stranger things have happened. Once you let yourself believe it's possible, the film becomes extremely engrossing, entertaining and splendidly produced. Though it doesn't come close to the masterpiece that director David Lean later created in Lawrence of Arabia, this is still a great film. Guinness as always is wonderful, standing out from the cast as a gifted actor.<p>However, I can't dismiss certain flaws I felt the film had. The sub plot of an American escapee (William Holden) doesn't begin to mesh well with the colonel's story until the second half when he's sent back in with a team on orders to destroy the bridge. Also, the use of Asian women on that team is almost laughable. In the midst of the hot, humid jungle, they're always smiling at the men while serving them. When one was placing mortar shells into a weapon while smiling during combat at the end, she reminded me of the Price is Right girls showing off a prize. Though this depiction of women was standard in film for the time period it was made, it only comes off as silly now.<p>But by and large, this is a wonderful film that easily allows you to overlook these flaws. And worth multiple viewings just for Guinness excellent performance</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>Yes I know.  This is an old, classic, best picture flick.<br /><br />It's just too damn slow.  The William Holden character, the American P.O.W., really should have been an interesting character.  He was almost interesting after he escaped, playing around with a girl on the beach...some of the dialogue was trying for some witty, snappy, Casablanca-esque pop...but it just wasn't there.  It just seemed like everyone was writing talking in slow-motion...all the actors were slaves to long-winded dialogue in the script.  I just read that Guinness wanted to play his character with a sense of humour but the director insisted he play it as boring as possible.  Someone needed to bring that fiery, sarcastic character and I feel it should have been Holden.<br /><br />Everything said in the same boring matter-of-fact tone for almost 3 hours...there's no background music to keep things moving along...I ended up dozing off in the middle somewhere.<br /><br />I'd never recommend this to anyone.  And I'll never see it again.  I've read it's supposed to be an anti-war movie.  Seems more of an anti-audience movie to me.  Too dated for modern audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>"Bridge Over the River Kwai" is an Oscar winning World War II film, loosely based on a book by the French writer Pierre Boulle.  However, Hollywood had to change the plot to make it more palatable to American viewers by introducing an American star into the cast.  The plot was also modified to accommodate a greater role for women: one female beauty makes a brief appearance, and several Asian women absent from the original novel play a key supporting role towards the end.<p>What makes this movie a gem is not just the exciting plot, although that is an essential ingredient in making this a successful movie.  A British contingent of soldiers in a Japanese prisoner of war camp are required to build a bridge across the river Kwai for the Japanese.  But because this bridge is a threat to the Allies, they send in a troop of commandos to destroy the bridge.  There is only one problem: the British commander (Colonel Nicholson) who built the bridge has taken so much pride in the construction work of his soldiers, that he does not want it destroyed.  The tension rises to heart-stopping levels, with a thrilling climax.  There is some violence in the movie, but it is minimal and only towards the end, and unlike modern war movies there is no focus on the gory details.  The climax features stunning scenes that at the time were unprecedented in movie making history.  And the ambiguity of the conclusion leaves plenty of room for after-movie discussion and contemplation.<p>But what really makes this movie so stellar is the characterization and the psychological conflict at the beginning of the movie.  What the second half of the movie offers in terms of intrigue and action, is more than matched by the psychological conflict in the first half.  The Japanese commander of the prisoner of war camp (Colonel Saito) requires British officers to perform manual labour.  Colonel Nicholson insists that this is contrary to the Geneva Convention, and together with his officers refuses to comply.  This battle of personalities is the feature of the first part of the movie and is compelling, gripping, and involves brilliant acting.  The repeated notion of "madness" also hints at underlying themes about the futility of war, making this a profoundly anti-war movie.  This is evident in the complete reversal of the British colonel's attitude to his officers working and the final lines of the movie about "madness".<p>Although not suitable for younger viewers because of the occasional intensity of the action and the themes of war, "The Bridge On The River Kwai" is generally a clean and wholesome movie when compared with modern movies.  Given that the cinematography, characterization, and acting are all superb and thought-provoking (as well as the enduring whistling tune of the "Colonel Bogey March"), it is little wonder that this film rightly takes its place among the all-time war movie greats.  In fact it's easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though William Holden is given the first billing of the credits, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is without doubt Alec Guinness's film.  And the film's setting may lead you to think this masterpiece as a &quot;war movie&quot;; that is not exactly true.<p>&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; begins with intense battle of will.  As British Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) refuses to join the work of building a bridge, Japanese Colonel Saito tests his will in the most extreme ways.  But many keen-eyed viewers will soon realize that both have something in common, which finally draws each other after Nicholson's long, long suffering under the hot sun in Southeast Asia.  Ironically, Nicholson finds himself deeply involved in nearly impossible task of building a bridge more than he actually knows.  But to what purpose?<p>As this storyline shows, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; brilliantly works as a fable, and the superb acting of Alec Guinness, whom younger generations probably remember as Obi-Wan of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; will rivet your eyes on the screen.  The cinematograhy is also great, capturing the humid climate of the place to give the film authentic atmosphere.  But most of all, this is made before CGI became popular in moviemaking -- just imagine they had to make all of those production designs!<p>Looking back from now, David Lean's epic-scale story seems to lose its power in the latter half of the film, in which Holden's character tries to destroy the bridge.  His character is a little unconvincing, compared with Guinness and Hayakawa, and Lean, I am afraid, stretched the film too long to depict Holden's deadly mission though his trek in the jungle itself is an engrossing one.  And you may feel Hayakawa'a performance is a little theatrical -- but keep in mind, he first became an instant star in Hollywood in 1915 with &quot;Cheat&quot; (directed by Cecil B. DeMille, another director who preferred big-scale movies).  But don't worry, you soon forget these things.<p>&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is a masterpiece that only golden age of Hollywood could produce; not flashy special effects but talented actors with dedicated crew made it possible to exist.  Watch it.<p>Pierre Boulle, a French writer who wrote the original book of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; based on his own experience during the WW2 and his days in prison camp, is also the author of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;  The latter book (and the original film, to some extent) is also intelligent and iroical as well as David Lean's masterpiece.  Try it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's "Summertime", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's "The Bridge on the River Kwai", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate "Lawrence of Arabia", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.<br /><br />The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of "Colonel Bogey March" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel storylines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.<br /><br />Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two storylines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exuding natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then adding a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to "Summertime", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.<br /><br />The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, "The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Crackerjack entertainment - with an insightful "war is crazy" message to go along with it. A company of British soldiers is captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge over the Kwai. A battle of wills develops between the Japanese commander (played by Sessue Hayakawa) and the British one (Alec Guinness) over officers' rights; Guinness wins out and virtually takes over command of the camp, getting the bridge built with typical British efficiency.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an American prisoner (William Holden) escapes and returns with a commando unit set on blowing the bridge up. Guinness's ego has so taken over that when he spots the explosive charges and wires on the bridge, and suddenly realizes what's about to happen, he actually tries to stop it from blowing up. But too late: the bridge is blown to smithereens and so are Guinness and Holden. War's madness.<br /><br />Guinness's slide into insanity is slow and subtle - and totally believable. He will not give the Japanese the satisfaction ever of assuming they can control or intimidate the British; after all, there are rules in war and "gentlemen" play by the rules. Gentlemen also perform to the best of their abilities, no matter what the task - even if it means building a bridge for the enemy. But he's in this game too deeply and his insanity is a loss of reality.<br /><br />Everything works in this picture, with the biggest winner being British fortitude (though American practicality deserves a pat on the back, too). At first we are caught up in Guinness's seemingly noble actions, all that admirable British stiff upper lip behavior, and when the truth hits us, it's devastating. That's because David Lean's direction is perfect; he's like the poker player who knows he's got the winning Ace up his sleeve and timing is everything. The movies won a fistful of Oscars and deservedly so.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia) directs this 1957 adapatation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Planet of the Apes') great World War II novel.  The film still stands as one of the greatest war films ever made with superb direction and an all-star cast that provide deep character studies with all the action and tension one expects from a war story.<br /><br />Confined to an inhospitable Japanese prison camp burried in the jungles of Southeast Asia, a British POW, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), is subjected to the cruel torture of the camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for choosing to stand for principle as to the treatment of his officers.  Saito needs competent engineers and laborers to build a railroad tressle bridge on a tight schedule and, although at first infuriated by Nicholson's stiff upper lip and low opinion of Japanese culture, he begins to exploit Nicholson's ego to compel him to build the bridge properly and on time.  Thinking that he will show the 'inferior' Japanese how much better the English are in engineering, Nicholson becomes obsessed with building the enemy bridge and oblivious to the treasonous implications of such an act.  In the mean time, a cowardly American POW (William Holden) escapes to safety only to be later coerced by the English to return and sabotage the bridge in a commando raid.  Leading the British demolition expert (Jack Hawkins), Holden's character returns to the bridge for the final showdown.<br /><br />This is a brilliant war film with a plot that's primarily character driven as opposed to action driven: the tension comes from the clash of wills between all of the characters as opposed to a non-stop action clash of arms.  The film also seems to deal with the uncertain consequences of bravery and cowardice in the sense that, although Nicholson at first bravely stands for his principles, he blindly becomes a suppliant to Colonel Saito's plans to finish the bridge.  On the other hand, although Holden's character is the epidemy of cowardice and self-interest, it is he who becomes one of the true heroes of the story.  The film in essence follows the story by Pierre Boulle but, as is almost always the case, the book is better.  In the book, there is no flinching to Nicholson's unrelenting snobbishness and utter stupidity and he does not 'wake up' at the last minute to fall on the detonator: the mission fails. Also, William Holden's character does not exist. There is no American ex-POW guiding the commandos back to the bridge.<br /><br />This film is very well directed and has great camera work.  Filmed in Sri Lanka, the great cinematography captures every ray of heat and drop of humidity one finds in the dense jungle. The acting is top knotch all the way around. Finally, who can forget the timeless whistling tune sung by the POWs.  This is another great drama that should be in every war film lover's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>"He had the guts of a maniac.

We know there will be resistance, there will be punishment and comradery. Its been done to death at this point.  Many of those cliches came from Bridge on the River Kwai.  Even The Great Escape owes more than a few tricks to the David Lean Classic of 1957.  Heck even Star Trek VI stole Saito's opening speech for the Klingon Gulag scene.  We know the story:  Alec Guiness, the consummate professional officer gives not an inch to Japanese commander Saito.  Lazy American Holden makes a hero of sorts by the end for the "rescue."  Calling this or the Great Escape on "historical accuracy" is like calling "Predator" a comment on America's involvement in Latin America.  Nope, this is a prison film.  And this prison movie goes the extra mile from latter replicas in the "accurate" story of war it all amounts to.  In a Hemingway-esque turn, they all die in one way or another for a stupid wooden bridge.  Sad and trivial, but epic nonetheless.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />Upgrading from the previous DVD box release is worth it.  Colors are bold without being crushed.  Skin tones are accurate. Blues and greens of the jungle are vibrant and inviting.  Delineation of the jungle light from shade to sun is just beautiful.  There are no crushed blacks here. Early scenes on the train as we enter the jungle are thick with grain, likely from push processing the negative a couple stops or, more likely, the result of optical compositing for the opening credits.  Fear not, the emulsion settles, quickly into a consistent and uniform image.  Lens distortions are easily visible, something I never noticed as much on the DVD and detail is surprisingly good for a 50+ year-old film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai Is a tasty preface to what will hopefully be an equally impressive Blu-Ray for Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.<br /><br />The Film.  5/5<br />The Blu-Ray  4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Directed by David Lean, this film focuses on an attempt by a team led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) to destroy a strategically important bridge over the Kwai river in Burma in 1943, a bridge built by British prisoners during World War II. An epic in every possible sense, the inhumanities of the Japanese are probably underplayed somewhat so that we can focus on two essential conflicts of will, one between Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and the other between Warden and Shears (William Holden) who is forced to join Warden's team and thereby avoid a court martial for impersonating a U.S. naval officer. It should also be noted that Nicholson struggles with a conflict between his obligations as a British officer (i.e. to resist his enemy in any and every possible way) and his determination to demonstrate British superiority over the Japanese captors. Colonel Saito has his own conflicts, notably between imposing his will on Nicholson and the British troops and getting the bridge built. At the heart of this magnificent film are several moral dilemmas which help to explain why we become so emotionally involved with its narrative. <p>One of the many pleasures of seeing this film (especially in its DVD format) is the juxtaposition of lush tropical settings with the raw emotions of those who are building the bridge and those who are determined to destroy it. I am also struck by how carefully Lean develops the semi-adversarial relationships between Nicholson and Saito and between Warden and Shears. Although &quot;Madness... Madness&quot; is frequently quoted as an evaluation of those relationships, I disagree.  Saito has been ordered to built the bridge, Nicholson agrees to accomplish that task but on his terms, Warden has been assigned to destroy it, and Shears (who considers all this "madness" but plays a key role in achieving that objective) lacks the circumspection which Lean enables us to have. Of course, war itself is madness...and yet there is (or at least can be) a redeeming if misguided integrity in how adversaries conduct themselves amidst that madness.<p>The excellence of this film was acknowledged by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, receiving in 1957 seven Oscars for ?Best Actor (Guinness). Best Adapted Screenplay (Pierre Boulle), Best Cinematography (Jack Hildyard), Best Director (Lean), Best Editing (Peter Taylor), and Best Score (Malcolm Arnold). Years later, it was ranked #13 among "America's Greatest Movies" by the American Film Institute. I consider it ludicrous that Gone With the Wind (#4) is ranked higher than The Bridge on the River Kwai by the AFI. For those with a sensitive palate, the former is junk food whereas the latter is gourmet cuisine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In "The Bridge On the River Kwai," director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  <p> As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short.  Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option.  If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code.  Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.<p> Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks.  But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to "loan" Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission.  So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  <p> From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.<p> Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.<p> Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.<p> The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green).  Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, "The Bridge On the River Kwai" is one of David Lean's masterpieces.  It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I have to confess, this is not my first review of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  Way back (and I mean waaaay back) in college, my freshman English Composition teacher informed her students for extra credit she would welcome a critique of this movie, which was showing over the weekend on one of the local TV channels.  I had heard of the film (which had been theatrically released some twenty years before), but had never seen it.  "You will be pleasantly surprised," my instructor advised.<br /><br />And I was.  After viewing this David Lean epic, I eagerly wrote a two-page critique (which I still have, somewhere).  I don't remember what kind of a grade I got. . .I only remember how impressed I was with this sweeping, grand tale of honor, duty, grit, and madness.  And having just seen this movie again, I continue to be impressed.  This Oscar winner is as timeless in its entertainment value today as it was three decades ago, or five decades ago.  Like the bridge itself, Lean patiently builds this story to a remarkable climax, an absolute showstopper.<br /><br />No need to summarize the plot; it's been thoroughly and impressively presented on the product page.  What bears repeating is this is a hauntingly beautiful film where antagonists suddenly find themselves completely and irrevocably interdependent:  the Japanese need the British POWs to build a railroad bridge over the River Kwai; the Brits need this project, this bridge to aid their enemy, to stay busy, focused, and boost their morale.  And yet, so ironically, a special forces team has been dispatched to destroy this interdependency; all these components explode (pardon the pun) when brought together, when hard decisions have to be made in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Alec Guinness is absolutely sensational as the stubborn, by-the-book leader of the POWs; I've seen this great actor in several movies, yet this will forever remain his signature role.  Jack Hawkins, William Holden, and Sessue Hayakawa are exceptional, too.  David Lean (who, curiously enough, was not even the studio's first, second, or even third choice for director) has achieved cinematic immortality with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, a masterpiece that fluidly transcends the generations.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>This film is a giant in a very crowded genre of WWII movies released in the 1940's and 50's.  It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director (David Lean).  The story is atypical of the WWII genre.  Instead of showing the glory of battle, it presents the psychological and physical torment of life in a POW camp.  It focuses on the human story, a story of principles, will and courage in the face of adversity.<p>Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the commander of a group of prisoners of war interned in a Japanese camp in Southeast Asia during WWII.  He is told by the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) that the prisoners will build a bridge across the river Kwai to complete the Japanese railroad that will supply their troops.  Saito orders that officers will work beside enlisted men, to which Nicholson objects because it is a violation of the rules of war agreed to at the Geneva Convention.  This leads to a standoff, a test of wills that is ultimately won by the irrationally stubborn Brit after many days in solitary confinement.<p>The result is that Nicholson agrees to build the bridge on his own terms, using his own engineers.  This seems to be insane, since building the bridge would aid the enemy.  However, Nicholson's has a high-minded goal that transcends the war.  He wants to build a bridge that will endure as a testament to the superiority of the British civilization, especially since it will be built under such extreme circumstances.  He also feels that building a bridge of which they can be proud will boost the moral of the men while living under such oppressive conditions.<p>The psychological aspect of the film is fascinating.  Saito's personal sense of honor does not allow him to use the brutality necessary to coerce the prisoners into building the bridge properly.  Ironically, once he succumbs to defeat in the battle of wills against Nicholson, he gets everything he wants.  By losing, he actually wins.<p>David Lean's direction is outstanding, portraying the harshness of the prison camp without sacrificing the subtlety of the psychological aspect of the film.  Lean gives us enough character development to bind us to all the competing characters, making us sympathetic even to Saito, the camp commander.  <p>The acting in this film is superb.  Alec Guinness is magnificent as the idealistic and staunchly principled Colonel.  This was probably his best role in a stellar career.  William Holden is also terrific as the sardonic and cowardly sailor that fate continued to throw into situations that required him to become a reluctant hero.  Sessue Hayakawa delivers a masterful performance, as the hapless commander who succumbs to Nicholson's iron will.<p>The ending evokes conflicting emotions, as it is simultaneously ironic, triumphant and devastating.  At the end, the viewer is not sure whom to pull for since there is no neat way to resolve the collision of converging forces.  This makes the film even more interesting.<p>This film is a timeless classic.  I rated it a 10/10.  I'm looking forward to seeing it on the newly released DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I haven't seen David Lean's award-winning "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957) for so long that I forgot how great it is. It's not a conventional war film and therefore there's very little action; the "action" is mostly psychological. I remember watching it on TV a few times with my dad when I was about 7-10 years old and even then, with such little understanding of the world and its social workings, I was fascinated by the picture and knew it was great -- even then.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A platoon of British soldiers are brought to a Japanese POW camp in Burma during World War II to help build a strategic railway bridge over the River Kwai. The Jap Colonel in charge of the camp, Saito, insists that the British officers work along with the enlisted men. The British Colonel, Nicholson, stubbornly objects to this based upon the Geneva Convention, a copy of which he carries around in his pocket. He insists that there are rules to be followed, even in war. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two. Ultimately Nicholson is put in charge of building the bridge, which he takes so much pride in he fails to see that he's aiding the enemy. Meanwhile, an American sailor, Shears, escapes the camp and later leads a group of Brits on a mission to destroy the bridge.<br /><br />Although Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, is a fascinating character -- an ultra-proper stiff-upper-lip Brit -- and certainly worthy of respect as far as his utter boldness goes, he's what my dad would call a "goon." (My dad served during WWII and died in 1988). Nicholson is so infected by pride, stubbornness and a sense of superiority that he can't see the obvious. Yes, he's a realistic and fascinating character, but I find him to be a total moron, who can't see the forest for the trees. It goes without saying that I can't relate to him at all.<br /><br />Colonel Saito, the Japanese commander of the camp, ultimately accepts that it's in his best interest to allow Nicholson to believe he's running the show in order to get the bridge built. This is obviously a struggle for Saito because he has pride as well; but he refuses to allow it to get in the way of fulfilling his mission. 'Let Nicholson build the bridge and believe he's in charge and superior,' he seems to figure, 'In reality he's my pawn and a pawn of the Japanese military machine.' (Others may interpret this scenario differently, likely suggesting that Saito is the loser in the test of wills, moping around in bewildered defeat throughout the rest of the picture, but that's not what's really going on here IMHO).<br /><br />William Holden expertly plays Shears, the American who escapes the camp and comes back to attempt to destroy the bridge. He's the the character I relate to most. On the surface he appears completely selfish -- doing whatever he must to survive, including lying and bribing. Shears has lived with the madness of war the longest and naturally develops a sarcastic, anti-hero callousness to protect himself and survive with his sanity intact. Despite the negative, selfish vibe you'll initially get from Shears, he never loses his humanity. He refuses to become an inhuman machine like Nicholson or Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), the latter whom leads the British mission to destroy the bridge.<br /><br />For example, as Warden and his party travel through the jungle Warden becomes injured and insists that the rest leave him behind to die, arguing that he would do precisely the same if anyone else was injured. Shears blows up at this point; he's seen enough of this idiotic machine-like do-or-die mentality. He yells, "You make me sick with your heroics! ... You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like gentlemen? How to die by the rules? When the only important thing is how to live like a human being!"<br /><br />As captivating as the first hour is with the psychological conflict between Nicholson and Saito, the remaining hour and 41 minutes is even more engaging as the two storylines develop and ultimately converge: Nicholson building the bridge and celebrating its completion, along with his now-comrade Saito, while Shears & Warden and their team travel to the bridge and attempt to implement it's destruction.<br /><br />I just saw the film the other day but hadn't seen it for 8 years or so and actually forgot exactly how it ended, as far as who dies, etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any major details away; you've probably forgotten the details as well, that is, if you've even seen it before. In any event, the ending is brilliant and potent. The Allied doctor of the camp looks on in utter disbelief at the climatic results. "Madness... madness..." is all he can manage to mutter. Powerful.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is filmmaking of the highest order on every level. The Sri Lanka (Ceylon) locations are breath-taking. The only negative I can muster is that parts of the score are understandably dated seeing as how it was released in 1957. But that whistling theme is hugely memorable, of course.<br /><br />I could probably write a book about all the great scenes, lines and points the film makes but I'd rather you discover (or re-discover) everything for yourself. There's so much depth here that you'll get something new with each viewing. It goes without saying that "The Bridge on the River Kwai" is one of the best pictures ever made and one of my all-time favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This film is a real tour de force dilema . I have always considered this work as a true example of the leadership vision . In a corner we see the single minded leadership of the Colonel (Alec Guiness) who considers a honor concern to build the bridge demanded for the Japanese authority in the camp.<br /><br />But there are other wills who see in this fact the possibility to escape and this commitment will be carried to the last consequences .<br /><br />It is useless to comment it this war jewel , the timeless battle between the epic and the loyalty ; the will against the destiny ; the duty against the freedom .<br /><br />This movie is now part of the cinema story and it is a wonderful example about the leadership means .<br /><br />All the awards this film received were deservedly won .<br /><br />One of the supreme masterpieces of David Lean ; by far, the best brittish director of the XX century.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>In my list of the top ten movies of all time there is a place for  &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  This movie has just about everything; great acting, great directing, great music, great cinematography, a great, multi-layered story line, and a message for all humanity.  The great acting includes William Holden who brings his usual swagger to his character.  However, the audience finds themselves focussed on the acting of Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and their mental chess game of a struggle for power.  This aspect of the movie would qualify for greatness by itself.  The cinematography is outstanding and underscores much of what the director tries to bring out.  This is one of those movies worth seeing on the big screen if you can find a theatre that shows old(er) movies.<p>The story essentially involves British POW's having to build a bridge deep in the jungle of Burma.  The Japanese prison commander is insistant that officers work along side their men.  The British commander refuses to alow this to happen.  This is the chess game between Guinness and Hayakawa.  An American POW (Holden) escapes towards the beginning of the movie and is drafted to return to the POW camp in a guerilla action to destroy the bridge.  During this 160 minute film, there is ample action, plenty of sub-plots and a lot of brilliant symbolism.  My favorite is a gun battle between the guerillas and a Japanese patrol deep in the jungle.  We have an early glimpse of a number of sleeping bats as the scene develops.  When the action starts, the gunfire disturbs the bats who blacken the sky as they come to life.  This imagery of turning peace into chaos is itself symbolic of the ultimate anti-war message of the movie.  The idea of the British soldiers building, with misguided pride, a bridge in the jungle only to have it destroyed upon completion is a message about the pointlessness of war.  The brilliance of this movie is that it can be enjoyed equally by WWII buffs and anti-war protestors.  Each time you watch it you pick out a little bit more than you saw before.  If you haven't seen this movie, you've been cheating yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>In 1957, a movie was premiered that was the most awe-inspiring of its time. It was a massive project, involving a collaboration of several countries and the building of a bridge. It was the film that put director David Lean on the map and brought home Best Picture and six other Oscars at the Academy Awards. Although Lean and producer Sam Spiegel later topped themselves with "Lawrence of Arabia" and their first film's flaws have since become apparent, "The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a landmark of motion pictures and still awes people (Major spoilers ahead).  <p>"Madness! Madness!" The last words said in the film by Colonel Clipton can be used to sum up the film. Most of the major characters were mad in a way, but some more so than the others. Let's take Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson, one of his most renowned performances. Nicholson is a stiff upper lip officer, who believes that by building a `proper' bridge, he is helping the future and providing the prisoners with better work and self-esteem. He doesn't seem to take into account that this bridge will be used by the Japanese in Burma against the allies and that men are dying on the River Kwai. There are three other main characters in the story. Shears, played by William Holden, Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakawa and Major Warden, played by Jack Hawkins. Shears, from what we can tell, doesn't want anything to do with the war or the P.O.W camp. He bribes officers and, when he escapes, tries to weasel his way out of going back. As an actor, Holden has always been underrated, yet this movie will have you asking why. Hayakawa was 68 years old when he was cast as Saito, yet he doesn't look or act like it. Unlike Nicholson, he only builds the bridge because he has to. Like Shears, he does his duty because of what would happen if he did otherwise. The third character, Warden, is different on the other hand. He sees the war as a game, playing with his plastic explosives as if he's a kid with firecrackers. He also believes only in the mission, carrying around suicide pills should anyone have to be killed. <p>Speaking of the River Kwai, the actual story was worse than it is here and this is one of only two problems I have with the story.  Hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoners of war died along this railway from causes such as malnutrition, dysentery, malaria, gangrene, beatings, exhaustion and torture. And some just wanted to die. This sugarcoating of the actual story is one of the most controversial parts of the movie, but what did you expect? This is a Hollywood Epic. The other problem with the film is lack of focus. We leave the Nicholson-Saito story just when we are to decide whether to cheer or boo Guinness so events involving the commandos can be fitted. Both are major stories, yet the producers can't decide which is more important. <p>The Colonel Bogey March has become one of the most renowned scenes in film history. Originally, however, the song was almost not used because it had some rude lyrics. So, it was decided to whistle it. The scenes where the march is first used seem to foreshadow other coming events. The P.O.Ws march past "the graveyard" and the hospital where the sick are kept. They are like new recruits marching past battle hardened veterans as they go to war. Shears remarks to Corporal Weaver, "We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers". The second time the march is used is near the end, as the gang marches across the bridge just before the commandos strike. The march, as happy as it is, is an omen of what is to come next and what happens is not always that good.  <p>"There's always the unexpected". Filmmaker John Milius (Who is interviewed on the Limited Edition DVD) once said that the commando mission in this movie is the best he has ever seen on film. Why? This movie follows "Murphy's Law" or everything that can go wrong will go wrong. The team parachutes off course and one of them gets killed. Then they have to take an alternate route because of Japanese Patrols. Then Warden gets shot because the youngest member hesitated at killing a soldier, delaying them further. However, they continue on and on. They finally reach the bridge, marveling at the quality of the structure and the apparent comradeship of the prisoners with the Japanese. They think that, from there, it's easy sailing. However, here's Murphy's Law again, for nature has some tricks up her sleeve. Also, the same officer who got Warden injured is still unprepared for killing when the moment comes.  <p>Ironically, the person who destroys the bridge is the same man who advocated its construction. Nicholson's actions, however, still spark debate to this day. Many believe that he would never do such a thing and that he must have been knocked unconscious we he did what he did. However, what about his last line "What have I done?" In my view,<br />though he loved the bridge like it was his own child, he realizes the enormity of what he has been doing and that he must murder his child.  <p>In the end, the bridge is destroyed, but for what cost? Everyone involved is either dead or doomed to die. Their fates have been sealed. On the other hand, life has survived. The first shot we see in the movie is of a bird floating around in the sky. This represents nature's tranquillity, before it is disrupted by the machines of war. The last shot we see is of the same bird and once again is tranquillity. Only this time, it is a return to peace. Men may have kicked aside life in their quest to build and destroy the bridge, but they are just temporary visitors. Nature is a permanent resident.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>"Take a good look, Clifton. One day the war will be over. And I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built and who built it - not a gang of slaves, but soldiers, British soldiers, Clifton, even in captivity."<br /><br />Still one of David Lean's very best films despite its faults, unlike most of his epics, the plot of The Bridge on the River Kwai is focused enough to allow the film its debate on the nature of heroism and command without seeming forced, and is divided clearly into two halves. The first is a battle of wills between two madmen and their respective codes of honour; the British Colonel Nicholson, who seeks to turn defeat into victory, and the Japanese Colonel Saito, whose cruelty comes from his inability to see his lack of shame over their surrender.<br /><br />Nicholson is so determined to use the building of the bridge as a weapon against his Japanese captors to rebuild his troops' morale that he is blind to the strategic consequences ("I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them." mutters Donald's medical officer). As Nicholson exceeds his requirements, he assumes Saito's role, even to the point of forcing officers and those on the sick list to work - the very points they had earlier clashed over - forcing the Japanese Colonel to face a surrender of his own. Ultimately reduced to the meek voice of acquiescence at one of their conferences, he alone achieves his objective but only at the cost of his self-respect. He alone realises what he has become.<br /><br />The second half is more standard adventure fare, as anti-heroic escaped prisoner Holden (his casting clearly based on his similar role in Stalag 17) is press-ganged into returning to the bridge with gung-ho masochist Jack Hawkins to blow it up. If at the camp Donald is the voice of common sense, Holden is the voice of the common man. Faced with the wounded Hawkins' self-sacrificing heroics, he responds with a tirade against everything he stands for; ("With you it's one thing or the other, destroy the bridge or destroy yourself!"). But though he rejects the insanity of heroic codes and proclaims that the only true dignity lies in survival, he dies upholding just such an ideal. This is just one of the contradictions of an undeniably problematic ending, which opts for the spectacular at the cost of much of the substance of the film.<br /><br />In reality, the bridge was never destroyed, but Lean discards history to give the audience the large explosion they've been waiting for. Depicted with intriguing ambiguity as to Guinness' motives, it nonetheless tends to obliterate the assertion of Pierre Boulle's novel that all the suffering has been in vain by allowing a victory, albeit at hideous cost. War is no longer a pointless and vainglorious farce played with human lives, but a place where even a cynic and an unwitting collaborator can redeem themselves through the nobility of self-sacrifice.<br /><br />Yet if ultimately the film lacks the commitment of Bryan Forbes astonishly bleak King Rat or even Spielberg's dark Empire of the Sun, there is still much to admire, not least a quartet of great performances from Guinness and the under-appreciated Holden, Hawkins and Hayakawa. Lean is much more in control of his narrative than when he started making love stories with casts of thousands, his masterful use of the Scope frame coming over particularly well in this restored version (no new footage but a cleaned-up print) which finally gives blacklisted writers Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman their screen credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>with those words william holden sums up this movie,and what a movie.david lean was the master of taking a grand scale movie and still making it a very personel psychological battle of wills.<br /><br />  this is really two stories in one,one being the battle between alec guinness as a british colonel and his his counter part sessue hayakawa who runs the japanese prison camp during world warII. their battle of wills is one of the most intense psycholgical battles ever put on screen,with both men unbinding and how the single-minded colonel takes his job of building a bridge over the title river as an excerise to prove that the british are better than their captiors,never seeing that he is in fact aiding his enemy.<br /><br />  william holden is a p.o.w. who escapes only to be forced by jack hawkins to return to the camp to blow up that bridge. we follow both stories till they both converge at the end. sounds simple but nothing about this movie is simple. after repeat viewings you can find layer upon layer to the story and the soldiers.<br /><br />  sir alec guinness won a richly deserved oscar for his amazing job as a soldier so blind to the code of honor that he can see nothing else. but william holden is the heart of the movie as the out for himself man who sees through guinness's and hawkins heroics and the all consuming quest for honor in a war when there isn't any. jack hawkins is a true joy to watch as leader of the men sent to blow up nicholson's bridge. and for once the enemy in the form of camp commander sessue hayakawa is showen as a well rounded person who finds no honor in his prisoners,but comes to understand and even like him.<br /><br />  when the two stories join up this powerful movie sets up a classic final 25 mins. thathas never been equaled in movie history. the final shot of mr.guinness as he finaly sees and understands what he has done is both heartbreaking and will stay with you long after the movie ends.<br /><br />  this two disc set is amazing,the film is lovingly restored and the credits have been restored to give carl forman and michael wilson as writers(the were blacklisted at the time so the french novelest pierre boulle,who wrote the book but spoke no english was credited as sole writer and picked up the oscar for screenplay for this). the extras are fantastic and that just makes the whole set that much better!!<br /><br />  this is in the top 3 war movies of all time,winning SEVEN oscars for guinness,picture,director,editing,screenplay,and score. and this features the famous whistling tune "colonel bogey march" that you will also remember long after the movie ends. if you love movies this is one you must have!! get this one now!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This is a great movie about a great story.  It was a big budget movie featuring awesome scenery and cinamatography. As if that were not enough, the film is embellished with bravo performances by William Holden, Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa and others.  No wonder &quot;Kwai&quot; won no fewer than seven academy awards in 1957 including Best Picture.<p>The story is brutally simple.  British (and one or two American) POWs in Southeast Asia are being forced to work in railway gangs for the Japanese.  The struggle between the British POWs and the Japanese makes for a great story, as the British Senior POW and the Japanese commander engage in a battle of wills.  The outcome of the film packs a wallop, and I found it to be very satisfying.  This movie never drags, and is punctuated with humor although the overall tone is deadly serious.<p>One nice thing about this film is that although it does not in any way glorify war or whitewash the awful consequences of war, it also avoids gratuitous violence, and is suitable for fairly young viewers to watch. <p>This is quite possibly the greatest war movie ever made.

Shears did not have to keep a stiff upper lip or save face or any of that sort of stuff.

"The Bridge on the River Kwai" is not "about" British POWs building a bridge. It's about Other Things, for which the story (a near-total inversion of the historical facts) serves as a backdrop.<br /><br />Contrary to what one reviewer has written, there /are/ "better-looking" Blu-ray transfers from that era, most notably "The Searchers", which is of absolute demo quality. "Bridge" is excellent, but not at that elevated level.<br /><br />Color photographic materials of that era (and well-into the 70s) had high contrast -- that is, a limited tonal scale. This is most-apparent in outdoor scenes under direct sunlight. The effect is harsh, even garish, and the first 20 minutes or so of "Bridge" suffer badly from it. For whatever reason, this harshness gradually declines. On the other hand, scenes shot "indoors", under controlled lighting, do not suffer from this problem, as the direct and fill lighting can be fine-tuned to compensate for the film's limitations. (The same things could be said about many films of this era; "Bridge" is not unique.)<br /><br />Another problem is that -- despite what some review claim -- this is /not/ a true Technicolor film -- it's shot on an integral tripack material, probably supplied by Kodak. "Technicolor" of this era suffered from the inability to render vivid colors with their full saturation (unlike "real" three-strip Technicolor), and a color balance that leaned strongly towards the warm colors, sometimes with muddy or muted greens. In outdoor scenes, one often feels the only colors are blue, green, and brown. Indoor shots under artificial lighting do not generally have this problem -- there's a wider range of more-natural colors.<br /><br />These color deficiencies aren't helped by the fact that a few outdoor scenes have a sickly yellow-green cast. Perhaps the available sources had deteriorated to the point where a full correction wasn't possible, but I doubt it.<br /><br />There was only one point where I saw anything that even remotely resembled edge enhancement. And there appears to have been little or no grain reduction. THANK YOU, SONY, for not trying to "enhance" the image in ways that only degrade it.<br /><br />As wonderful as the restoration is -- and this /is/ a significantly better edition than any I've previously seen -- the restorers made no apparent effort to achieve a consistent color balance throughout the film, or to broaden the range of colors displayed -- in other words, to make it look more like a recent film, something that David Lean, et al, could not possibly object to. What you /will/ see is much-improved version of what I first saw 53 years ago, but nothing more.<br /><br />The sound is real stereo, as befits a prestige "event" film of that era. I can now hear subtleties in Malcom Arnold's Oscar-winning score I'd never noticed. For example, whenever Nicholson takes command and starts making decisions, the music seems to suggest he's loony.<br /><br />The film remains an absolute classic, one of those very rare films that encourages discussion of the moral and ethical issues it raises. An unconditional recommendation -- and don't reveal the surprise ending!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies worth re-watching.

It might be an even better film than his equally celebrated LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. The latter film has, at the center of all the visual grandeur and epic scale, a character than is equally larger-than-life. The main characters of BRIDGE, on the other hand, are more humanly scaled, and I was grateful for that. Here is a cinematic epic that isn't just empty spectacle, but has intriguing characters and a literate thoughtfulness that is becoming a rarity in movies these days. In a lesser film, for instance, characters like Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness, in a performance that won a deserved Academy Award---as did the movie itself), and Shears (William Holden) might have been reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes. Here, they have fascinating complexities that help drive the plot and serve its theme, which can pretty much be summed up by the final words of the movie: &quot;Madness, madness!&quot; The beauty here is that both Saito and Nicholson might be mad, but their madness isn't necessarily without justification.<p>Of course, all this character development, which may or may not necessarily be interesting by itself, serves as a backdrop for what is essentially an adventure on a grand scale, and on that level it also works triumphantly, delivering beautiful widescreen cinematography, lush settings, and genuine suspense, particularly in its tense final moments. A glorious epic adventure that also never skimps on the human element, indeed makes it almost an integral part of the story---that is the magic of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by David Lean<p>The Bridge on the River Kwai is based on the fantastic novel by Pierre Boulle.  The movie won 7 out of the 8 Academy Awards it was nominated for, including: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Alec Guinness).  Watching the movie for the first time 45 years later, I'm happy to say that the film still holds up well over time.  <p>It is a simple story.  Set during World War II, the Japanese have a prison camp in Southeast Asia.  They have an entire command of British prisoners of war, as well as a couple of Americans.  The commander of the prison, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, in an Oscar nominated performance) needs to have a bridge built across the River Kwai.  The prisoners are to build it.  This sets up a clash of will between Saito and Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), the officer in charge of the British.  Nicholson still wants to lead his command, despite being in prison.  He allows that the soldiers should work (to build morale, discipline, and to keep in shape), but absolutely forbids his officers to do manual labor.  Saito demands that everyone works.  Both men hold to their own personal code of honor and it is an intense emotional stand off between the two.  While this is happening, the British soldiers are building Saito's bridge.  Nicholson requires that take pride in their work and build the best possible bridge that they can.  <p>That is half of the movie.  The other half involves an American POW named Shears (William Holden).  Shears seems to be fairly opportunistic and only out for himself.  He manages to escape from the POW camp and eventually makes his way to freedom.  While free and living at a British military base (waiting until he can return home), he is recruited into a mission to destroy the bridge that Nicholson is building.  The bridge is strategically important and reluctantly Shears agrees.  The storylines are separate for a while, but they do all come together near the end when the bridge is being completed and Shears (with British forces) are arriving to destroy the bridge.  <p>This movie is a classic, and there is a very good reason for that.  45 years later (or so), The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a very good movie.  This isn't your typical action movie with explosions every 10 minutes, but David Lean does a good job of building the tension throughout the movie.  It may have some deliberate pacing at times, but if you're a fan of the classic movies, this is one you have to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>REVISED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW:<br /><br />The new Blu-ray of "Bridge" looks marvelous with a depth and detail only hinted at with the previous DVD editions of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes "Crossing the Bridge" a picture-in graphics track and a documentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes a replica of lobby cards, information from the original press book for the film in a book housed in the hardcover BD holder and a DVD edition of the film in addition to the Blu-ray. Highly recommend for fans of the film.<br /><br />DVD REVIEW BELOW:<br /><br />David Lean blossomed as a film director during the 50's. While he directed a number of earlier classics during the 40's, Bridge on the River Kwai was the first of many epic films that never lost the most important part of any epic tale--the human element.<br /><br />Although "Bridge" is inspired by a true story keep in mind that this isn't a documentary of the events that occurred there and Lean uses it to tell a dramatic story about survival, pride and the insanity of war. Novelist Pierre Boulle was a prisoner of war in Thailand and used the story of the building of the bridge as a backdrop for a fictionalized portrayal of those events combining them with his experience as a POW and the people that Boulle knew as a POW.<br /><br />Bridge focuses on the Japanese attempt to build a bridge linking their railroad through a perilous jungle in Southeast Asia. The prisoners of war are used essentially as slave labor to reach this goal. Colonel Nicholson(Alec Guinness who won an Oscar)are captured with his British troops. Nicholson's  can-do attitude creates a myopic outlook which prevents him from seeing that he is collaborating with the enemy when he agrees to help complete the bridge. It's the infusion that Japanese Prison Commander Saito needs; his prisoner worker population is shrinking rapidly. Dysintery, Malaria, heatstroke and other inhabitants of the jungle have killed most of the workers. The bridge is behind schedule and the Colonel Saito is very displeased.<br /><br />One of the last remaining prisoners is Shears (played with marvelous cynicism by William Holden). He just wants to do as little as possible and return home alive and well from the war. He has an escape plan. When he informs Nicholson of this, he's told that the British will not attempt to escape as there "is no place to escape to". Nicholson feels they'll be better treated in the camp and doesn't want his troops to face the harsh jungle. He orders his troops not to escape given the circumstances.<br /><br />Shears and two other prisoners make a break for it. Of the three only Shears survives, is shot and eventually found within Allied territory. He's taken to a British stronghold to recover. Shears provides info on the bridge. He doesn't want become involved in an effort to go back and blow it up. Blackmailed by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins)he ends up volunteering for the mission with Warden and one other American.<br /><br />Lean's direction captures the atmosphere of the jungle perfectly. While amazon.com rates the image as a 4 out of 5, I'd give it a 3. While a restoration effort was attempted, it's nowhere near as complete as that done for Lawrence of Arabia (another Lean film)or Hitchcock's Vertigo and Rear Window. Bridge has a much more brutal look which captures the essence of the jungle and the odds facing Shears and Warden. On the other hand, the film has a lot of analog artifacts and, although I can't be certain, looks like the negative has faded a bit. While it isn't in as bad a condition as Lawrence (or Vertigo)was, it certainly could use a face lift to improve the appearence.<br /><br />The sound is pretty good overall. Columbia has expanded the original soundtrack into a Dolby 5.1 master and, while it doesn't take advantage of the full range, it coulds much better than the earlier VHS edition.<br /><br />There are two editions of this classic film. The first has a second disc full of worthwhile extras that includes behind the scenes footage, a documentary on the film, appreciation by director John Millius many more items. The two disc set is certainly worthwhile for fans of the film.<br /><br />The single disc edition is a dual layer like the first disc of the two disc set. It looks like it came from the same master. It features the full film, trailers and a brief talent biography on Holden, Guinness, Hawkins and Lean. It hasn't been updated since Guinness' death a couple of years ago. It's not bare bones but for the price difference it should suffice for most fans. It features the same interactive menu (a clever use of actual scenes from the movie)and a motion scene selection.<br /><br />Bridge is a great film and it's certainly worthwhile in either edition. Which one you purchase depends on how much of a fan you are of the film and whether or not you'll watch the background material more than one time. The picture and sound are very good but it's also clear that Columbia sound undertake a more complete restoration of the this classic film.<br /><br />Oh, a bit of trivia--the main titles have been changed. When the film was released screenwriters Michael Wilson (Lawrence of Arabia, Planet of the Apes) and Carl Foreman (The Guns of Navarone)were still blacklisted writers in Hollywood. Novelist Piere Boulle (who spoke no English)fronted for them receiving screenplay credit and received the Oscar for screenplay. It's only fitting that their names have finally been added to the opening credits. This happened shortly before Foreman's death (if I'm not mistaken)so at least one of them lived to see a wrong righted. Both (or their heirs)also finally received their Oscars with their names engraved. It was fitting given the film's themes and the price the main character (a stand in, no doubt, for both Wilson and Foreman)pays in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>After more than forty years, this movie remains one of the great war movies of all time.  It proves that you don't need an enormous budget, a teen idol, and stuff blowing up all over the place to make a World War 2 masterpiece.  The movie centers around a bridge being build by Allied POWs over the Kwai river (hence the title).  Colonel Saito is the man in charge of the bridge, and the British Colonel Nicholson (played by Alec Guinness) is commander of the British POW troops.  An American, Shears (William Holden), escapes from the camp, and later guides a crack British demolitions team back to the site of the bridge so they can blow it up.<p>A large part of the movie centers around the power struggle between Saito and Nicholson.  The latter refuses to be treated harshly, and insists that his British forces will not cooperate in building the bridge unless he and the other officers can lead the project and do not have to do manual labor.  Saito is a hardheaded despot, who cares nothing for Geneva convention rules but is forced to compromise if he wants his bridge finished on time.  Throughout the movie, these two butt heads until they finally reach an understanding, and from that point on they work together very admirably and build a fine bridge.<p>The problem with having built such a spectacular bridge, however (in which Nicholson rightly takes great pride), is that the allies want to blow it up.  At the end of the film, Nicholson is forced to make a choice between his pet project and his loyalty to his country.  The result is a suspensful finale worthy of this great epic production.<p>The scenery is beautiful, the cinematography grand, the performances exceptionally great.  No wonder this film won 7 Oscars.  This is rightly considered one of the best movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of those classics that never gets old.  The movie tells the story of prisoners of war forced to build a bridge for their Japanese captors. However the British commanding officer will have none of this and instantly puts up a fight.  Later the movie follows the prisoners efforts at building the bridge as well as the story involving Allied commandoes who are attempting to destroy the bridge.  <p> This classic is full of great performances that should not be missed.  Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role, plays Colonel Nicholson, the stubborn British officer.  His conflict with Colonel Saito(Sessue Hayakawa) provides much of the plot for the first hour of the movie.  William Holden is Shears, a man who escapes from the prison camp only to return with Force 316 as they try to destroy the bridge.  Jack Hawkins gives another good role as Warden, the team leader, who will do anything to complete the mission.  Also worthwhile is Geoffrey Horne as Joyce, the youngest member of the team.  This is not one of those action packed fliks that is so prevalent today.  The movie is really more of a character study than anything else.<br /><br /> The limited edition DVD is perfect and should not be missed by any fans of this classic.  The documentary on the making of the movie is very good.  There is also a widescreen presentation with many other worthwhile extras.  If nothing else, at least watch the last twenty minutes of the movie.  It is one of the most tense scenes in movie history.  You can just feel the anxiety as the end draws near.  Do Not Miss This Classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is one of my favorite war movies. It is a story about life in a World War II Japanese prison camp situated in a Burmese jungle. The screenplay is actually an adaptation from an anti-war novel by Pierre Brouille. The main thrust of the film is the duel of wills between the commanding officer (Sessue Hayakawa) of the camp and the commander (Alec Guinness) of the British prisoners.<p>The production is marked by strong acting performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. William Holden plays the part of an American escapee who leads a band of commandos back to blow up a bridge which is being constructed by the prisoners. Holden is his usual competent self. Jack Hawkins is another respected actor in the cast.<p>Sessue Hayakawa began making American films in 1914 but spent his World War II years in Japan. The movie's theme song whistled by the prisoners on the way to work on the bridge became a popular recording during the late 1950's.<p>THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI received several Academy Awards including best actor by Guinness. Hayakawa was also nominated for best supporting actor. Some other awards were for best picture, director, screenplay and cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>It may be hard for some in today's &quot;every man for himself&quot; mentality to relate to the strong personal honor that underlies many characters in this movie. The central 'combat of wills' is between Saito, the Japanese ruler of a prison camp deep in asia, and Nicholson, who is a traditional multi-decade British soldier that has lived his entire adult life within the rules and structure of that system. <p>As a lover of feudal Japanese culture, I found it fascinating as Saito claimed the heritage of &quot;Bushido&quot; (the 'way of the warrior' of the samurai), yet had no problem using all prisoners as slave labor in order to save his own neck. Instead of following the Geneva Convention and treating the prisoners as the &quot;rules&quot; insisted, he bent them in order to not have to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) because the train bridge was not finished in time.<p>On the other hand, Nicholson refused to allow Saito to use his officers as laborers (although he didn't seem to mind his *men* being sent off to work the tracks) and goes into The Oven to suffer as a consequence. Later, when work is running behind, he even goes into the hospital and talks the sick men into helping out - risking their health and lives for the 'common good' of the railway (which in fact is helping his *enemy*).<p>I wish the movie were a bit longer, so we could go even deeper into the various characters. Each one has been molded by time and experience into a certain lifestyle, and each has doubts at time that he has chosen the correct path. A fascinating movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>1957's Bridge On The River Kwai is a stirring war film that is based on a novel that itself was inspired by real life events.  The movie stars William Holden and Alec Guinness as an American commander, Major Shears, and an English officer, Colonel Nicholson, respectively who are captives in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.  The camp is run by the heartless and maniacal Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and he has been put in charge of constructing a railroad bridge over the river that will be extremely important to the Japanese war effort.  Saito and Nicholson are at constant odds over the British captives role in helping build the bridge.  Nicholson does not want to aid his enemies in such an important task and Saito uses abusive and sadistic means of punishment to try and break Nicholson, but due to Nicholson's high honor, he never gives in.  Eventually the men reach a compromise and Nicholson throws his men into task of building the bridge with a fervent and obsessive nature.  A parallel story line concerns Major Shears who escapes from the camp, makes an inspired trek through the dangerous jungle and finds his way back to a base in the South Pacific.  He provides the commanders with the information about the bridge, but his true motives are selfish as he wants to go home.  He is forced into volunteering to guide a British troop back into the jungle to the prisoner's camp to destroy the bridge.  Along on this mission is the leader Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who is way too gung ho about it for Shears' liking.  The eventual intertwining of the two stories reaches a brilliant and rousing climax.  Director David Lean uses the jungle scenery of Sri Lanka to beautiful perfection to recreate the images of World War II.  He never resorts to gratuitous violence or mayhem , but expertly crafts a story about the psychological effects war has on three men who at first seem quite different, but in the end seem very much the same.  The film was a rousing success and dominated the 1957 Academy Awards winning a total seven including Best Picture, Mr. Lean's first Best Director Award and a truly deserving Best Actor Oscar for Sir Alec Guinness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>This is a story of an intense struggle between the fanatical determination of a Japanese POW camp commandant (Sessue Hayakawa) and its senior ranking English POW officer (Alec Guinness) who is every bit as fanatical.<br /><br />William Holden plays the only American in the camp and manages to escape early in the film.<br /><br />The POW camp is set on the River Kwai (the film is shot in Ceylon) with the mission to construct a railroad bridge within a certain timeline.

Alec Guinness understands the commandants situation and gets concessions that undermine the code of this proud Japanese commandant.<br /><br />William Holden manages to return to the sight of the bridge with Jack Hawkins and several satchels of plastic explosive to provide a sad but surprise ending to this great story.</p></br></body></html>

The whole movie was shot in black and white and incorporates Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein. The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them. Some of the on going gags are Igor (pronounced "Eye-gor") ever changing hump on his back. On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side. Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Bl&uuml;cher or just Bl&uuml;cher, the horses goes wild. Also there are few minor mistakes as well. Gene Wilder role of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is the grandson of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein. In one scene; he is referred to as the great-grandson. Also Inspector Kemp right arm is artificial, but when he is searching for the Monster in the woods, it is on the left side. Finally when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and Inspector Kemp are playing darts, Dr. Frankenstein only throws two darts through the window. When Inspector Kemp heads toward his car and drive off; the scene shows six darts. The movie starts off with the coffin of Baron Beaufort Von Frankenstein, the Great-grandfather of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, being open.  A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great-grandfather estate. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein travels to Transylvania and meets up with Igor and Inga. One night Dr. Frankenstein hears music and along with Inga investigate the source of the music. It leads him to his grand-father private libray and the book How I Did It. After reading the book, Dr. Frankenstein believes he can do it as well and did up a body of a recently huge criminal. Igor is sent to the Brain Depository. After dropping the good brain, Igor picks up the adnormal and brings is back to  Dr. Frankenstein. When the creature is bought back to life and goes wild in the lab, given a sedative, Dr. Frankenstein asks Igor whose brain is in the that creature. Igor calmly replies that it is an Abby Normal's brain. Dr. Frankenstein is angry with Igor that he gave him an abnormal brain. The monster escape and we have the blind man scene where his taken in and the blind man does his best to be polite. When the blind man offers the Creature a cigar and tries to light one up for him, he burns the creature thumb and the Creatue leaves screaming. He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion. At an evening gather Dr. Frankenstein shows off The Creature to fellow scientits and doctorts, however, a lightbulb burst and The Creature goes into a fit a rage and is taken into custady. It while The Creature is in custady that the prison guard mocks him and The Creature breaks the chains and escape. Dr. Frankenstein plays music to bring The Creature back to the castle for a serious operation. The operation is a succes and The Creatue is nolonger evil. Despite the minor goofs, this is Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder at their finest. I am giving Young Frankenstein an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />Language Selection<br />Scene Selection<br />Extra Features<br />A) Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein<br />B) Trailers<br />C) TV Spots<br />D) Deleted Scenes<br />E) Mexican Interviews<br />F) Outtakes<br />G) Production Photographs<br />Play</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This is definitely one of the best comedies of all time, I can't help but laugh every time that I watch this great film. Mel Brooks definitely comes through again with this hilarious parody of Frankenstein. The script is funny and the look of the film looks like it was made in the 1930s. Gene Wilder is the star of the film, but the jokes really go to Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman as the monster and Eyegor. This film has definitely proven itself over the years and is just as fresh as the day it first was released. If you never see another Mel Brooks movie in your life, I highly recommend this. Trust me, you will love it!</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Young Frankenstein" is a 1974 Mel Brooks film, based loosely on the Frankenstein book and horror films. It's got a good reputation, but I didn't know what to expect really. I liked it though.<br /><br />The "Young Frankenstein" is grandson of the original mad scientist, a professor of biology at an American university. He wants nothing to do with his grandfather's research, digging up bodies and bringing them to life, he thinks its a load of nonsense. On returning to his grandfather's castle in Transylvania, however, destiny compells him to take up the experiments again, and soon, he has re-animated a corpse, with the body of a giant man, and a brain belonging to an "Abbie Normal". That's what Eye-Gor (Marty Feldman) says, anyway. The townsfolk riot, the monster learns to dance, and a couple of love triangles develop.<br /><br />I think this film works best as a tribute to old horror films with comedic elements rather than a straight up comedy. It's got great sets (some from the original Frankenstein film), great lighting, and those long periods of silence and minimal score that older films have. I haven't seen as many of the old horror films as I would like to, but I have seen enough to think this makes a good stylistic tribute. If you go in expecting something funny to happen all the time, you may be a little disappointed. Funny things definitely do happen (like the monster singing "Putting on the Ritz", the police chief's strange, mechanical movements, etc), but if you treat the film like some forgotten horror flick with some unexpected quirks it works a lot better, I think. The uncoventional comments and such come off a lot stronger this way, and perhaps this was the intention. As a comedy tribute to old films, I think this is one of the better ones, and I'd be picking this up before, say, a film like "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra", which was made a couple of years back.<br /><br />Special features on the special edition include several deleted scenes, original theatrical and television trailers (narrated by Mel Brooks), outtakes, a commentary by Mel Brooks (whose audio sounds kind of aged), and a making of documentary with interviews from various crew members and Gene Wilder. He hasn't changed much, Gene, not really. They're all pretty interesting to watch.<br /><br />Worth a look for fans of Mel Brooks, and for lovers of the old time horror films. A funny tribute.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>This film is one of my all-time favorite Mel Brooks movies. It has been called one of the ten funniest movies ever made, and I am not about to argue that. Everything about this film works. From the casting, to the set pieces, to the dialogue, to the direction, to the soundtrack, everything clicks. One thing in the film's favor: the decision to film in glorious black and white, as in the glory days of Hollywood horror films, which this movie paid direct homage to. The cast was spot on, and you could only imagine the crack-ups that occured after each take. Peter Boyle was wonderful as the Monster, and Gene Wilder was a true genius as Fiedrich Frankenstein. Teri Garr, in an early appearance, is great as Inga, the lab assisant. Marty Feldman lends his maniacal eyes to Igor, giving a rousing performance in the process. Madeleine Kahn, as usual for this great lady, nearly steals the whole show as Dr. Frankenstein's american fiancee. She will forever be remembered for her rendition of "Love at Last I've Found You". Overall, one can tell this film was a true labor of love. Every scene is filled with detail, which this DVD release brings into sharp focus. The contrast is wonderful, the sound is sharp, and the film just glows. If Mel Brooks rather crude humor isn't your forte, this film is closer to mainstream than normal for him. As a result, he gave us a true cinema classic, and we thank him for it.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>This is from 1-5 stars a 6,flawless comedy I have<br />watched it 100 times and can still watch it 100<br />times again,just flawless!Amazon buyers buy this<br />along with HOLY GRAIL & UP IN SMOKE and you are<br />set for life my friend.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Just watched this again for the umpteenth time and found myself still laughing at a classic comedy with some of the most memorable lines in any comedy.  It's been over 30 years and this gem is as good as when it was released.  Timeless.<br /><br />Look, by now everyone who loves movies should know this film.  One of those rare lightning-strikes wherein everything worked wonderfully and the casting created a perfect ensemble.  Hands down the best movie parody Mel Brooks ever made as well as the best looking and most completely consistent in design as well as style.<br /><br />I don't need to elaborate on story and production, but if you've never seen Young Frankenstein, what have you missed?  How about:<br /><br />"Walk this way.  No, no, this way."<br /><br />"Hump? What hump?"<br /><br />"Roll, roll, roll in ze hay."<br /><br />"Werewolf. There, there wolf."<br /><br />"Blucher!"<br /><br />"Brandy? Some varm milk...perhaps.

A very Big mute!"<br /><br />"You take the blonde, I'll take the one in the turban."<br /><br />"You little zipper-neck."<br /><br />"O sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!"<br /><br />Out of context, not much.  In context, hilarious.  And the cast!  Gene Wilder does demented, arrogant obsession like no one else.  Terri Garr is yummy.  Marty Feldman absolutely irreplaceable.  Peter Boyle marvelous.  Madeline Kahn the ultimate spoiled "princess". Cloris Leachman simply perfect in a small but indelible role. Ken Mars' Inspector is a personal favorite of mine (I have loved his thick German accent since The Producers, and he and Mel get in some jokes here about how some viewers of that film couldn't always understand what his Franz Liebkin was saying).  And last, but not least, the hysterical cameo by Gene Hackman as the Blind Hermit.<br /><br />Critics tend not to give 5 stars to comedies, probably because every joke doesn't work for everyone.  That is the nature of comedy.  Well that is true here as well, but it is one of the most consistently funny films from beginning to end you'll ever see.  And it is good-hearted, good-natured, and without a mean bone in its body.  Well worth your while.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>One of the most consistently hilarious films on record, the Brooks/ Wilder team creates a loving authenticity with actual Universal Studios props and use of black and white photography. Then, they add a rogue's gallery of top comedic actors: Marty Feldman, Kenneth Mars and Cloris Leachman (who portrays the infamous Frau Blucher). Just as hilarious the tenth time around.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Thirty years later, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN remains a classic comedy, filmed with such loving affection for the classic it spoofed.  So much of the humor is played so straight, it becomes even funnier.  All the actors have their own crowning moments, many of which have been reiterated by other reviewers.  But take the film's classic black and white photography and cinematography which evokes the pure essence of the original films.  Gene Wilder is perfect as the heir to the Frankenstein legacy, and his comic timing has never been better.  Marty Feldman is pure magic in his role as Eyegor, the bug-eyed assistant who is lecherous, witty and morose all at the same time.  Teri Garr is brilliant as Inga, the buxom assistant whose German accent is so good it's amazing.  Peter Boyle, barely recognizable under the expert make-up, does wonders with his eyes and his duet with Wilder on "Puttin on the Ritz" is superb.  Cloris Leachman is great, but I wish she had more screen time; her Frau Brucher (Neighhh) is a comic masterpiece.  And of course the late Madeline Kahn also brutally underused, is magnificent as Elizabeth, whose roll in the hay with the Monster is tremendous.  Gene Hackman in his cameo as the blind man is top notch; only an irritating Kenneth Mars "mars" the perfect casting.<br /><br />But one cannot help but admit YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the funniest films Brooks ever made and one of the best American comedies of our time.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Thirty years have not tarnished the unequivocal hilarity of Mel Brooks' send-up of classic 1930's horror movies. With stiff competition from "The Producers" and "Blazing Saddles", classics in their own right, this is arguably Mel Brooks' comedy high watermark. This masterwork is just one of those serendipitous circumstances when all the elements work beautifully and in just the right amounts. First, there are the visual elements...the sharp black-and-white cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld and the authentic-looking production design and set decoration by Dale Hennesy and Bob De Vestal. Then there is the endlessly clever script by Brooks and star Gene Wilder, which ranges from broad slapstick and farce to bawdy burlesque humor to sharp irreverent satire. They have written a king's ransom in funny lines that have since become part of comedy film lore..."Werewolf?...There wolf. There castle."..."He vas my...boyfriend!"..."It's Eye-gor"...""Put...the candle...back".<br /><br />The casting is impeccable. As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced "Fronk-en-steen" to escape his "cuckoo" bloodline), Wilder balances his trademark wide-eyed innocence with the character's monomaniacal drive with perfect aplomb. Teri Garr and cross-eyed, bug-eyed Marty Feldman lend able comic support as Inga and Igor, the doctor's nubile "laboratory assistant" ("Roll, roll, roll in da hay") and the hunchback, inexplicably British footman ("What hump?"), respectively. Kenneth Mars has a funny turn as the police inspector, looking very much like a direct cousin of his F&uuml;hrer-loving Franz Liebkind in "The Producers". Deglamorized to the point of being heroic, Cloris Leachman is wonderfully over-the-top as Frau Bl&uuml;cher, still holding a torch for the original Dr. Frankenstein and whose very name makes the horses whinny in fear. Of course, she did a variation of this role in Brooks' later "High Anxiety" as the evil Nurse Diesel. Peter Boyle, well before his paternal curmudgeon on "Everybody Loves Raymond", makes a lovably menacing monster, his fearful nature offset by a soft-shoe turn with Wilder on "Puttin' on the Ritz". An almost unrecognizable  Gene Hackman provides a memorably riotous cameo as Harold, the blind monk ready to make espresso for his new friend. Even with all this keen competition, Madeline Kahn still stands out as Elizabeth, the doctor's high-maintenance fianc&eacute;e, who in one of the most hilarious scenes, gets seduced by the monster and climaxes with a rendition of "Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life" that would make Jeanette McDonald blush. Just about everything she says gives me an uncontrollable case of the giggles. She is well missed.<br /><br />The DVD has several worthwhile extras such as a few deleted scenes and outtakes, including a ridiculous "Actor's Parade" sequence that has no purpose but to make the entire cast pass by the camera. There is also a 36-minute making-of documentary, which is informative, entertaining and includes even more outtakes. There are also a couple of oddly amusing Mexican TV interviews with Feldman, Wilder and Leachman. This is a true comedy classic well worth owning and watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/AD9WTAOAFUZA4.html">AD9WTAOAFUZA4</a><br/><p>Inspired beyond words, "Young Frankenstein" ranks with "Blazzing Saddles" and "The Producers" as Mel Brooks' finest contributions to film.  And, we must be grateful for his mettle, his moxie and unparalleled genius as he romps his way through the classic Monster tale of all time.  Marty Feldman is indelible and unforgettable as Igor, the irreplaceable Madeline Kahn won an Oscar Nomination, and the film served as comedic landmarks for the lieks of Terri Garr ( Tootsie) and the legendary Gene Hackman.  Some scenes are side-splittingly funny, and others lighthearted and tender in the way only Brooks and Wilder could possibly pull off.  In fact, Wilder deserves a lot of praise as Mel Brooks' "everyman" though he can sometimes play the role so straight, he loses himself to the kooks all around him.  "YOung Frankenstien" is perhaps his best Brooks character if for no other reason than he is equally looped out and bizarre, part Willy Wonka, part nerdy gunslinger.  He's hilarious and gentle here, in a movie that will tug your heart even while you're coughing it up laughing!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein becomes heir to his ancestor's work in this hilarious spoof of the classic horror film.  Mel Brooks is generally overrated as a filmmaker, and Gene Wilder's later films failed to deliver many laughs.  However, this collaboration shows the genius they are capable of in the right circumstances.  The cast is excellent and the choice to shoot in black and white was inspired.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>"I am a scientist!" Gene Wilder rants to his class, "My grandfathers work was doo doo!" Young Frankenstien is a person who has liveed his life under the morbid shadow of his grandfather, Baron Von Frankenstien. This is withoutadoubt (one word) one of the funniest movies you could watch. The movie itself is only partially old, but its black and white filming gives a great classic feeling. There are so many puns that there is no way in heck you could memorize them without repeated viewings. I love that. My brother in law, a rather picky viewer (pickier than me) (even more pickier than others) watched this with me the other day. He was chuckling his head off. Just watching HIS reaction made me roll on the floor with tears coming down my face. (I do that when I laugh hard). Well, I suppose my point is that this movie is a class A comedy, that even the pickiest of people love. The dude is a stone! An unbreakable critic that...well. You get the idea. Watch it for liquid rendering laughs. (Might wanna watch it after the kids go to bed!) *****</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN could well be the finest comic parody of a serious film ever made.  James Whale, whose dedication to German expressionist aesthetic ideals Brooks and Wilder emulated in this film, directed both the original FRANKENSTEIN and its even finer sequel THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Gene Wilder had had the idea of doing a respectful parody of the Whale classics before he made BLAZING SADDLES and he approached Brooks with the idea of directing his script.  Most people I have asked about the film assume it is a Mel Brooks project from beginning to end, but it would be more accurate to describe it as Mel Brooks directing a Gene Wilder.  Of course, being Mel Brooks, he made more than his fair share of additions to the script, including many of the jokes, such as the famous Gene Wilder line "What great knockers!" he looks at the great doors of the mansion while his face is extremely close to Inga's chest.<br /><br />The film is such a successful collaboration that the film represents the career highpoint or close to it for several of the principals in the film.  Although BLAZING SADDLES has to go down as Brooks's career peak since he wrote, directed, and acted in it, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is his next greatest film.  Gene Wilder has never come close to having a greater role than that of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and though he has written other screenplays, nothing else remotely approaches this in terms of success.  Though we know the late, great Peter Boyle for other roles (such as his great Emmy-winning performance on THE X-FILES' episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"), this had to be his finest hour.  Teri Garr is one of my favorite actresses, but this is always been her best role in my opinion (it is also the role that changed her from primarily a TV guest actress to a movie actress).  Though Cloris Leachman has had an amazingly diverse and varied career, this is easily one of her most memorable roles.  Finally, Madeleine Kahn had comparable roles in BLAZING SADDLES and WHAT'S UP DOC?, but she was never clearly better than she was in this film.  The one clear exception to all this is Gene Hackman, who has a small cameo and who has had, of course, a few dozen better roles than this.  His presence is welcome all the same.  In short, it is a film that made everyone in the project look very good indeed.  One additional actor I would like to mention is Richard Haydn, a great veteran Hollywood character actor.  Many will recall him as one of the scholars in BALL OF FIRE, Howard Hawks's take off on SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  Here he appears at the very beginning of the film as Gerhard Falkstein.<br /><br />This is probably the last film Mel Brooks made in which very nearly every joke works.  What is remarkable is that they work as well today as they did in 1974 when the film first came out.  I suspect people will be laughing at it as hard 75 years from now as they do today.  The film has as many truly funny moments as any you could hope to see.  A host of the bits in the film have become classics, from Inga asking if Frederick would like to go for a "roll in ze hay" (she is being literal, not suggestive), to the horses neighing when they hear the name "Frau Bl&uuml;cher," to the famous performance by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle of "Puttin' on the Ritz." But the jokes can obscure what a slick production it is. Most people know that they used much of the equipment used in the original James Whale films, but even when they using completely original items the film does a masterful job of imitating the look of the old Universal projects.<br /><br />In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is almost certainly assured of permanent status as a great comedy classic.  Having said that, I'm not certain that this great film has ever gotten the treatment that it has deserved on DVD.  I would love to see a definitive edition, with greatly expanded extras, better commentaries, interviews with the surviving cast members, and perhaps a documentary or two.  With most of the major surviving figures from the film either aging or ill, I would like to see this done sooner rather than later.  But even if this is the best we will ever get, this is definitely one of the classic comic films.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>&quot;Yah, yah, track twenty-nine...I hope you make it in time!&quot; Non stop gags; a terrific atmosphere, worthy of the classic Universal Frankenstein movies we all know and love...James Whale would have LOVED this! Whenever the name Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) is mentioned, the horses go into a frenzy of neighs; GREAT stuuf. At night in the graveyard, Igor (Pronounced EYE-GORE) and Wilder are digging up a corpse (digging because Igor took the wrong brain...Abby Normal!) for their nefarious lab work; Wilder starts complaining and Igor (Feldman) says: &quot;Could be worse....could be raining.&quot; No sooner are the words out of his mouth then we hear a terrific crash of thunder, then see lightning, and then the skies open up. Then Igor says: &quot;I have a hunch...&quot; This is so funny it can make you sick from laughing; when Peter Boyle, as Frankenstein's Monster, launches into his famous &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz&quot; you are pretty much over the edge and barely able to breathe any more. One of my favorite lines is when Igor is driving Wilder to the Castle and there is a howl in the distance; Wilder says nervously: &quot;What was that?&quot; And Igor replies: &quot;Werewolf.&quot; Wilder: &quot;Werewolf?&quot; Igor: &quot;There...wolf.&quot;<br />Feldman, Wilder and Cloris Leachman are wonderful in this, and it was shot, appropriately, in black and white. I was fortunate enough to be at the studio when this was being shot and went onto the set and opened a door in the Castle and there were Peter Boyle, Wilder and Feldman all sitting around a table, taking a break...and Boyle had the most sickening shade of green make-up all over his face; he looked terrific. the sets were fantastic, and it was a thrill to be allowed to see them all. Great stuff and a very funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region Free<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Running time: 1:45:41<br />Movie size: 28,451,026,944 bytes<br />Disc size: 44,630,975,001 bytes<br />Total bit rate: 35.89 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 25.96 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3215 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3215 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  2371 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 2371 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />DTS Express  English  96 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 96 kbps / 24-bit<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, French<br />Number of chapters: 28<br /><br />#Inside the Lab BonusView Track<br />#Inside the Lab (HD - 30 minutes)<br />#It's Alive: Creating a Monster Classic (HD - 31 minutes)<br />#Transylvanian Lullaby (HD - 11 minutes)<br />#Additional Deleted and Extended Scenes (HD - 25 minutes)<br />#Franken-Track Trivia<br />#Isolated Score<br />#Blucher Button<br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein (SD - 42 minutes)<br />#Deleted Scenes (SD - 16 minutes)<br />#Blooper Reel (SD - 5 minutes)<br />#Bonus Interviews (SD - 7 minutes)<br />#Production Gallery (SD - 35 minutes)<br />#Marketing Materials (SD - minutes)</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Mel Brooks won the Oscar for his first film, The Producers.  He followed this up with two moderately successful films.  But in 1974 Mel became the top comedy directors of the time with Blazing Saddles and this film, Young Frankenstein.<br /><br />This is the ultimate sequel to the classic Frankenstein film (even better than Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.)  Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) - pronounced Franc-en-steen not Frank-en-stine - is the grandson of the infamous Dr.  But he wants no association with the crackpot ancestor.<br /><br />But Frederick is beckoned to Transylvania for the reading of his great grandfather's will.  Frederick is met by Igor (Marty Feldman) whose grandfather worked for Frederick's grandfather.  On the trip back with Frederick's new assistant Inga (Teri Garr) they hear a howl (Inga: Werewolf! Igor: There wolf.)  They are met at the castle by Frau Blucker (Cloris Leachman) - whose name is accompanied by screaming horses.<br /><br />During the night Frederick is awakened by Inga who hears music from behind his bookcases.  This leads them to Victor's private library and Frederick becomes obsessed with his grandfather's diaries.<br /><br />Frederick has decided to recreate his grandfather's experiment and snatches the body of a recently hung murderer (Peter Boyle).  Igor is sent to the Brain Depository (after 5 p.m. slip brain through slot) to get the brain of a great scientist but he drops it and grabs the brain of Abby Normal - you figure it out.<br /><br />They are now ready to revive the monster!  But things don't happen as expected.  Well, they happen but not as soon as expected.  Frau Blucker (horse scream!) releases the sleeping giant and here it becomes a warped version of the traditional Frankenstein. But this time they capture the monster and try to rehabilitate him. This leads to a great musical number (Puttin' on the Ritz).  And this goes wrong, of course, and the townspeople chain the monster.<br /><br />As Frederick and Inga console each other, they really console each other.  What a perfect time for Frederick's fianc&eacute;, Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), to arrive!  The monster escapes and returns to the castle and finds Elizabeth.  He falls in love with her and abducts her.  And in the most intense sex scene, they make mad passionate love (six or seven times).<br /><br />Frederick comes up with a final solution, to transfer some his knowledge to the monster.  But Inga wonders what the monster gave Frederick?!<br /><br />This is a non-stop laugh riot.  This is not the best comedy ever made but one of the wittiest.  Just when you expect a crude joke, the tables are turned.  This is a satire and next to farce, great satire is almost impossible to make and they did it!<br /><br />Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks made their film debuts in The Producers and respectively, received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Best Original Screenplay Oscar.  But neither had great success until they reteamed in this film.  This film would cement their status as comic geniuses.<br /><br />This would be Marty Feldman's greatest success as he would die a few years later.

For new fans, this is a black/white film, despite colorized dvd packaging and colorized 'stills' (above). Revisited this film just today (toying with blu upgrade) and found dvd to be just fine, IMHO. Audio/visuals still effective (and just musing, but is it right to expect the film to look better than in '74?). So, instead of double-dipping, will now look for original Frankenstein, and do the inevitable comparisons! (Features of dvd: 41 min. 'making of', several deleted scenes, and interesting set of short Mexican interviews, of Feldman, Wilder/Leachman. Subtitles in eng, spa, fr). A great film is a great film, no matter vhs, dvd, or blu!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>The DVD box says "The funniest comedy of all time!" Well, maybe; I'd certainly put it in the running for that title.<br /><br />Gene Wilder is young Victor Frankenstein, who goes to the length of changing the pronunciation of his name ("Frahnk-en-steen") in an attempt to distance himself from his notorious grandfather. But when he inherits the Frankenstein spooky old castle in Transylvania ("Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?"), he soon falls under the spell of the violin music, the spider-webbed equipment, and the notebooks of his grandfather, carefully preserved by his grandfather's former lover (played to perfection by Cloris Leachman, the horses whinny in fright every time her name is mentioned). He also has the grandson of his grandfather's assistant Igor (That's "Eye-gore" he says, after Frankenstein corrects him on the pronunciation of his name), and a "lab assistant" named Inga, played by Teri Garr. ("Goodness, what knockers!")<br /><br />He left his devoted fiance back in the city (Madeline Kahn), but she eventually shows up at the castle.<br /><br />Of course they manage to reanimate a monster similar to his grandfather's, except this one has a zipper in his neck. He's played by Peter Boyle, who dutifully goes through many of the cliche scenes from the original Boris Karloff rendition, turning each one on its head. My absolute favorite is the blind hermit who so thoughtfully offers him soup, wine and a cigar.<br /><br />There are so many inspired twists to this movie that I'd hate to ruin any of them for you. But I'm betting you will never again be able to hear the song, "Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life" without getting slightly hysterical.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>There are so many things to like about Young Frankenstein, which is as much a homage to the Frankenstein legacy as it is a satire. Taking parts from many of the Universal Frankenstein films, (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Son of Frankenstein) Young Frankenstein parodies the most memorable moments from these Universal classics. Unlike many spoofs that have aged, this film is still quite clever, the jokes original and well-timed. There are so many witty lines and memorable scenes.<br /><br />The cast really makes this film tick. Gene Wilder is such a perfect fit for the grandson of the late Dr. Frankenstein. He attempts to distance himself from the Frankenstein legacy; he pronounces his name "Fronkenstten" and dismisses his grandfather's achievements. However, when he learns of a will, and visits the Frankenstein castle and discovers his father's book "How I Did It", he is overcome with zealous passion to continue the family legacy. Wilder has such a knack for knowing how to hit the right note for comedic effect. Marty Feldman as Igor is a no-brainer; he has the right physical look, and his mannerisms and level of comic grotesqueness make for some good laughs. Terri Garr is wonderful as the sexy blonde assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn perfectly performs the role of Wilder's fianc&eacute;e, and Peter Boyle embodies the giant-child like monster to a tee. There is also a funny cameo from Gene Hackman as the blind hermit who encounters the monster, a classic scene worth viewing repeatedly.<br /><br />The extras are quite impressive as well. Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein takes a deeper look at the ideas behind the satire. It explores Wilder's inspiration to create this film, his collaboration with Mel Brooks, the script, and a look at the casting and roles and the vision for the film.  There are also trailers for the film, deleted scenes, interviews, and an optional commentary from Brooks.<br /><br />A superb comedy that has stood the test of time, and is a tribute to the Frankenstein story, Young Frankenstein never gets old. Any fans of Mary Shelley's classic or the Universal classics should check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i liked this film a lot.there were a lot of memorable lines to be<br />sure.i chuckled a fair amount at some of the jokes and gags.but to<br />me,this movie works more as a monster movie.making it in black and<br />white was a stroke of genius.it made it much more authentic,just like<br />the old monster movies of the 30's and 40's.i think it's one of the<br />best Frankenstein movies i've seen.Gene Wilder is in great form here,as<br />is Teri Gar.Marti Feldman is a riot.Peter Boyle is also great.and<br />Cloris Leachman puts in another brilliant performance.and we can't<br />forget Madeline Khan.of the first four Mel Brooks films i have just<br />seen,this is the best one.for me,Young Frankenstein is a 3.6/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>I first saw this (twice) in high school (yes, you heard right). Shown after classes, it remained uncut in all its risque, irreverent glory. I immediately fell in love with this comedy. And I'm still in love with it. If any film deserves to be called a "classic", it's this one. Not only did writer-director Mel Brooks & writer-star Gene Wilder capture the visual black & white beauty of the old horror classics, but they pulled off the impossible--a kooky, irreverent comedy that's also a sweet, loving tribute to those films. Every single joke & sight gag hits the bullseye, and each & every performance is memorable (made bittersweet by the passing of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn & Peter Boyle over the years). There are so many great comedy bits crammed into this movie that it's almost futile to make a list here, so I'll spare you the reading.<br />A definite must for any Brooks movie collection.

I saw this opening with a friend who was a Universal horror movie buff and an NBC film editor.  He indicated while we waited anxiously for the film to start that Mel Brooks was currently very hot and the expectations of all the young people in the audience appeared to reflect that fact.  Although the plot was conceived by Gene Wilder it was modified and directed by Mel Brooks and may have been his best movie.<br /><br />It almost made me wet my pants several times and was hilariously funny from start to finish. Some of the props were from the original Frankenstein by Universal. It drew on and satirized: Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein and The Son of Frankenstein. It also went to Broadway in the form of a musical comedy, which I never saw.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Thirty-five years later, this film still provides a ton of laughs.  It's always great fun to watch.<br /><br />It's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, too.  His face was hysterical and perfect for this film. In fact, he, along with the camera-work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times.<br /><br />Teri Garr was at her best and never looked as pretty as did in here. Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.<br /><br />Looking at the Frankenstien "monster" in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading "The Wall Street Journal" are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the "nice knockers."<br /><br />Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and-white. It may have been his best film, although "Blazing Saddles" would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder's constant yelling, which can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best "comedy classics" ever.<br /><br />I was pumped to hear this was now available on Blu-Ray and that will be the next format of this movie I'll see it on, although reviews are mixed on the quality of the BD.</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>Young Frankenstein is one hour and forty six minutes long and was released on December 15, 1974. The whole movie was shot in black and white and incorporates Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein. The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them. Some of the on going gags are Igor (pronounced "Eye-gor") ever changing hump on his back. On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side. Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Bl&uuml;cher or just Bl&uuml;cher, the horses goes wild. Also there are few minor mistakes as well. Gene Wilder role of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is the grandson of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein. In one scene; he is referred to as the great-grandson. Also Inspector Kemp right arm is artificial, but when he is searching for the Monster in the woods, it is on the left side. Finally when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and Inspector Kemp are playing darts, Dr. Frankenstein only throws two darts through the window. When Inspector Kemp heads toward his car and drive off; the scene shows six darts. The movie starts off with the coffin of Baron Beaufort Von Frankenstein, the Great-grandfather of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, being open.  A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great-grandfather estate. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein travels to Transylvania and meets up with Igor and Inga. One night Dr. Frankenstein hears music and along with Inga investigate the source of the music. It leads him to his grand-father private libray and the book How I Did It. After reading the book, Dr. Frankenstein believes he can do it as well and did up a body of a recently huge criminal. Igor is sent to the Brain Depository. After dropping the good brain, Igor picks up the adnormal and brings is back to  Dr. Frankenstein. When the creature is bought back to life and goes wild in the lab, given a sedative, Dr. Frankenstein asks Igor whose brain is in the that creature. Igor calmly replies that it is an Abby Normal's brain. Dr. Frankenstein is angry with Igor that he gave him an abnormal brain. The monster escape and we have the blind man scene where his taken in and the blind man does his best to be polite. When the blind man offers the Creature a cigar and tries to light one up for him, he burns the creature thumb and the Creatue leaves screaming. He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion. At an evening gather Dr. Frankenstein shows off The Creature to fellow scientits and doctorts, however, a lightbulb burst and The Creature goes into a fit a rage and is taken into custady. It while The Creature is in custady that the prison guard mocks him and The Creature breaks the chains and escape. Dr. Frankenstein plays music to bring The Creature back to the castle for a serious operation. The operation is a succes and The Creatue is nolonger evil. Despite the minor goofs, this is Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder at their finest. I am giving Young Frankenstein an AAAAA+++++.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>It's a funny thing about comedy; it seems to be of and for its time and very few age very well.  I remember as a kid when I first watched this film that I laughed until I cried.  Then I watched it again a few years ago and I absolutely hated it.  Now after having watched the original Frankenstein movies upon which this spoof is based, I actually like it again as I can compare and see exactly what scene from the original is being spoofed although I have to admit that many of the jokes don't pack as much of a punch as they did when I first watched this film.<br /><br />This is why I really respect some of the older comedians that can still get a laugh out of me after many, many years such as some of Buster Keaton's (Sherlock Jr.) and especially Charlie Chaplin's work (Modern Times, City Lights, The Gold Rush, The Great Dictator etc) not to mention the Marx Brothers (Duck Soup, and the other movies)too.  I've come to realise that as much as I enjoyed and laughed at scenes from "Meet the Parents" and "Something About Mary" for example that future generations will probably wonder what the fuss was all about just like the way many of the reviewers with negative reviews feel about this film.  That's why I'm convinced you cannot have a "funniest comedy of all time!" as the dvd cover claims here because what is funny for one generation very rarely remains so for another.<br /><br />Still, this was enjoyable and if you actually go back and watch all the original Frankenstein movies from the very good first two to the much less so others, you'll appreciate this spoof a whole lot more.  Marty Feldman made this film for me as he was still really funny in his role as Igor although the entire cast was excellent and Teri Garr kept reminding me that she was the original Phoebe of "Friends" fame in terms of mannerisms and behaviour.<br /><br />The dvd itself has a few good special features such as a making of documentary and a few interviews but the sound quality is only in Mono and the picture quality hasn't been restored and while ordinarily this would be something to complain about but as Wilder wanted this film to closely resemble the original Frankenstein films one can't really complain as these "imperfections" actually achieve the director's goal so to speak.<br /><br />One of the first great spoofs and certainly funny when it first came out and when I first watched it but now to be fair like most comedies, it has lost much of its hilarity but it is still amusing and very enjoyable if you are also a fan of the old Frankenstein movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a superb comedy, a masterpiece of motion picture parody and the very best work of all involved.<br /><br />Co-scripted by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks and directed by the latter, YF lampoons the original 1931 Frankenstein movie as well as several other fright film classics.

Teri Garr is attractive as Inga ("Roll in ze hay!"), while the late Peter Boyle is fantastic as the Frahn-ken-shteen's latest creation. And let's not forget Cloris Leachman as Blucher("He vas my BOYFRIEND!")! Overall, if you don't laugh more than five times from beginning to end, then you've got a serious problem.<br /><br />A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks, 1974)<br /><br />I watched two movies over the weekend I'd only ever seen pieces of before and figured, from the pieces I'd seen, that I'd hate. One was Dr. Strangelove, and it fulfilled my expectations. Young Frankenstein was the other, and this time, I have to say, I was quite wrong. Young Frankenstein is superb all the way around. (It probably helps that I had a recent re-watch of James Whale's Frankenstein under my belt, for those of you who haven't seen it yet.)<br /><br />The plot concerns Dr. Frederick Frankenstein ("that's FRONK-en-shteen") (Gene Wilder), the grandson of Victor, the doctor in the original. He's spent years trying to get rid of the family taint, which all comes spiralling down around him when he inherits the old castle and the accompanying lab. Leaving behind his cloying, uptight fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), he travels to the castle and meets the staff-- Igor (Marty Feldman), Inga (Teri Garr), and Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). Surreptitiously encouraged by Inga, Frederick becomes obsessed with the idea of repeating the experiments of his grandfather, and soon, the new monster (Peter Boyle) comes to life. The rest of the movie is half homage to James Whale's original and half screwball comedy.<br /><br />The real strength of this movie is the cast; Mel Brooks could've sat back and pointed a camera, and they could make this work. Wilder, Boyle, Feldman, Leachman, Garr, Kahn, Gene Hackman, and Richard Haydn (in his final film) are all either in career-best form of darned close to it here. All are actors with impeccable comic timing (yes, even Gene Hackman), and it often seems as if Brooks just said "okay, do whatever it is you were planning to do, then put it way over the top." The result is in no way a sophisticated comedy; this is just a straightforward gut-buster with dozens, if not hundreds of quotable one-liners and great sight gags. One for the books. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>WARNING: This film may lead to incontinence due to hysterical laughter!<br /><br />Mel Brooks' 1974 film, Young Frankenstein is arguably the funniest film ever made. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, who had previously collaborated on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BMY2LU">The Producers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles</a>, wrote the script together. This film is a superbly crafted parody of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CNRLQ">Universal Frankenstein</a> films.<br /><br />The story begins with young Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) discovering that he has inherited his great-grandfather's Transylvanian mansion. Upon his arrival Dr. Frankenstein meets Igor (pronounced Eye-Gore), an eccentric servant with a hunched back. He is also introduced to the vivacious vixen, Inga who just wants "to have a roll in ze hay." Before long Frederick discovers the secret library of his infamous grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein and becomes totally obsessed with creating a "monster" of his own. Naturally this doesn't go over well with the local peasantry. After the monster goes on a rampage of terror (or more accurately a rampage of hilarity), the villagers form an angry mob and set out to destroy it. But don't worry, all's well that ends well in the world of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESIK">Mel Brooks</a>.<br /><br />The gags in the film are hilarious (I won't ruin them for any of you yet to see the film). The satire is heightened by the brilliance of the set design, and by the black and white cinematography, which perfectly captures the look of classic horror films. The cast is terrific especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312337078">Gene Wilder</a> as the infirm Dr. Frankenstein, Marty Feldman as the zany hunchback Igor, Teri Garr as the delightfully ditzy assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's obnoxious and vain fianc&eacute;e, Kenneth Mars as the one-armed Inspector Kemp, Cloris Leachman as the mysterious Frau Blucher whose name incites terror in the hearts of all horses, and Peter Boyle as the mumbling monster. Also look for a memorable cameo appearance by Gene Hackman.<br /><br />As often as Young Frankenstein is referred to as being "the greatest comedy ever", it's odd that it never received any awards for its talented cast and crew. They certainly deserved them. There are few works of comedic genius out there today, for which I am grateful to Mel Brooks for giving us this loony masterpiece to watch again and again.<br /><br />The DVD features some great supplemental material including cast interviews, an audio commentary with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470225262">Mel Brooks</a> reminiscing about the making of the film, production stills, trailers and TV spots, a wonderful documentary, seven deleted scenes and an outrageously funny blooper reel (watch the documentary before the blooper reel for maximum effect).<br /><br />And remember next time a reanimated corpse is on the loose that "A riot is an ugly thing... und I think it is just about time that we have one!"</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I'm almost SURE that's what this rating should be.

If you are familiar with the Universal horror films of the thirties (especially, of course, the Frankenstein family), this should make more sense as a parody than to those uninitiated viewers.  Although, there is plenty to amuse even newcomers to the genre.

Young Frankenstein is miles ahead of all but one of Brooks's films.  It's absolutely hilarious even if its not the superlative, Blazing Saddles.  Feldman is the creator of quite a few laughs and I had no idea that Terri Garr was that attractive when she was younger.  Kahn is a riot and Boyle does fine work.  Brooks gives the narrative some cute little twists such as transpires with the little girl by the well.  Without giving anything away, let me say that the ending is excellent and tough to predict.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>This film is not one of my favorite Mel Brooks films. I like his more goofy films such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs. I got this DVD for the extras. The documentary is very good with some very funny outtakes. There  are also some excellent deleted scenes too. A couple of scenes that are  rightfully cut such as the reading of the will that would have explained  the beginning better, but definitely dragged on. A shorten version of them  should have been left in. A whole series of scenes that made Gene Wilder's  and Terry Garr's 'intellectual discussions' a running gag that definitely  should have been left in, they are hilarious. The outtakes are okay, they  could have included more, and only about 10 minutes worth is included. The  documentary has more and you get the feeling that a whole film could be  made from just the outtakes. The commentary by Brooks in very good, he adds  bits about the scenes, actors and other trivia that is enlightening. He  isn't too verbose and he doesn't run out of things to say, both of which  are common in other commentaries. Production photos are also included which  I have never gotten much from. Finally, there are included two interviews  with a Mexican newscaster which I found a bit weird and had me wondering  what they were all about. A Mexican news team must have been visiting the  film site. They are amusing in their own right, but doesn't do much but  take up space. Overall, not as many extras as some Special Editions but  adequate. This DVD is not a must have in my collection, but if you love the  movie, a good DVD for fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>Mel Brooks' &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is a remarkable film: it is a spoof of a beloved classic (the original film version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) which is now a beloved classic in its own right. A fun homage to YF was rendered by the irreverent sci-fi series &quot;Farscape,&quot; in which wisecracking lead character Crichton referred to a sinister alien adversary as &quot;Frau Blucher&quot;--the name of Cloris Leachman's YF character.<p>YF is both a spoof and a sequel of the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film. It concerns a young scientist (the brilliant Gene Wilder) who is heir to both the name and legacy of the infamous scientist who created a monster from dead human remains. Young Frankenstein takes up the family tradition with outrageously funny results.<p>Several elements combine to make YF one of cinema's all-time great comedies: witty dialogue, deliciously eccentric characters, hilarious sight gags (&quot;Put--the candle--back&quot;), and one of the best comic ensembles ever assembled on film. On top of that, the production design, costumes, and make-up brilliantly evoke the classic Hollywood &quot;monster movie&quot; vibe. And there's a great humorous song-and-dance sequence for the doctor and his creation.<p>As funny as it is, YF is also a deeply compassionate and humanistic film. Brooks treats his zany collection of characters with genuine affection. &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; ultimately has a kind-heartedness to match both its intelligence and wit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Of the various film parodies that director Mel Brooks concocted this ranks at the very top.  He's got all of the elements in place: a terrific cast, great black-and-white photography, great production values.  Like any great parodist realizes is that you have to have some kind of affection for the genre you're sending up and it's apparent that Brooks' loved those old 1930's monster movies.  The film is chock full of great set pieces and double entendres(when I first saw this as a child I didn't get most of them).  There is also a classic scene with Gene Hackman in an unbilled cameo.  The ensemble cast is one of the best ever assembled for a comedy.  Gene Wilder achieves just the right tone as Victor Frankenstein.  Teri Garr is voluptuous and funny as his assistant Inga.  Marty Feldman is loony as the hunchback Eye-gor.  Peter Boyle is monstrously funny as the Monster.  The rest of the cast(Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, Madelyn Khan,etc.) are all given the opportunity to shine here.

"That goes without saying."<br /><br />I think my favorite scene takes place at the very beginning of the film where Wilder gives a lesson on involuntary reactions.  Unnecessary vulgarity and abuse of an old man has never been funnier.<br /><br />The Putting on the Ritz perfomance is pretty good too.  But it may never have happened if the doctor's assistants in the castle would have opened the door when he was alone with the monster.  "No matter how terribly I may scream, do NOT open that door!"<br /><br />In no way is this movie a failure.

Director Mel Brooks co-wrote the screenplay with star Gene Wilder.  Mel Brooks is known for satirical comedies such as Men In Tights (1993), Spaceballs (1987), and the Twelve Chairs (1970) among many others.  In YF, Frederick Frankenstein  (Gene Wilder) wants to carry on a quiet life as a college lecturer, but is dogged by the infamous achievement of his late father, Victor Frankenstein, of making a creature out of a corpse.<br /><br />Frederick travels to Transylvania, leaving his less-than-devoted fiancee (Madeline Kahn), and seeks to visit his father's estate.  He meets the lovely Inga, who is to be his lab assistant (Teri Garr), and the outrageous Igor (Marty Feldman) who gives many of the laughs in the film.  Despite his best self-conditioning, Frederick seeks to recreate his father's work.  The result is a creature or monster (Peter Boyle).  Yes, that is Ray Romano's Dad! The townspeople revolt, with disastrous and funny consequences.<br /><br />The movie starts out a little slow, but you will soon be in stitches.  I asked my husband just to give YF a chance, and he laughed so hard, and is still quoting lines from the movie today.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I get a mental block about 10 seconds, so these reviews can be very hard to write, sometimes. Here is Mel Brooks' silly remake of just about every Frankenstein movie that's like....ever been made. Gene Wilder is a scientist named Fredrick Frankenstein who experients a corpse to try and reanimate dead tissue that he read from a book in the castle he lives in with Igor. Soon, he is successful......and I don't know what else to say. This HAS to be a classic. I think it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Cloris Leachman and Marty Feldman are excellent in the film complimenting the comedic genious of Gene Wilder.<p>Pure laughs all the way...and oh yes...Terri Garr is also very funny in the picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>of course, Mel Brookss young Frankenstien is a classic and is very very funny. Gene Wilder is great and so is Martin Feldman as Igor, but its that damn Gene Hackman cameo as the blindman which is the funniest sceen in the movie. Nicely shot in black and white. I cant imagine though Peter Boyle (the monster) as being really hung, I know its a movie but why Peter Boyle huh. Anyway, its a great Mel Brooks film next to Blazing Saddles and SpaceBalls. Gotta love that Igor</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is simply the funniest movie ever!  Even if you've seen it a thousand times, this DVD is worth buying for the behind the scenes documentary with out-takes and such.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>Without looking for flaws or problems I just choose to enjoy this movie for the masterpiece that it is. Gene Hackman has an amazing role as the blind hermit, making this film as good as any comedy I've ever seen in his segment. It was years later before I realized the guy playing the monster, Peter Boyle is the dad on Everybody Loves Raymond. He's hilarious here in this movie. Marty Feldman could do anything he wanted to in the comedy genre and be entertaining, and this movie bears that out perfectly where Marty plays the part of Igor. Frau Blucher played by Cloris Leachman seems to be a role tailor made for her, and the mention of her name in the movie makes the horses nervous. Teri Garr has some moments in the film to make young boys successfully get through puberty, and Madeline Kahn is excellent for her portrayal of an annoying conceited nincompoop woman engaged to Gene Wilder's character - Dr. Frankenstein. Mel Brooks was the howl of a werewolf and the voice of a cat accidentally hit by a dart, but otherwise doesn't appear in this film - which really surprised me since he has important roles out in front for most of his movies. I thought attention to detail was good for the sets, and was pleasantly surprised by the casting. Very enjoyable, and definitely worth buying this DVD. If you want a high definition version, buy it in Blu-ray. Very entertaining and funny film.  I recommend it without a doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This great Blu Ray of Young Frankenstein is a must of you're a Mel Brooks fan,yes it's grainy but that's the way it was filmed!

He is trying to live down the legacy of his grandfather.  He's even gone so far as to insist that his last name is pronounced Fronkensteen.  But his career as a neurosurgeon comes to a quick stop when he is informed he has just inherited the family manor in Transylvania.<br /><br />Traveling there, he meets up with new lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and Igor (Marty Feldman).  By the way, that last one is pronounced Eyegore, in case you were wondering.  But it's Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) who gives everyone a bad fright, even the horses.<br /><br />Slowly, Frederick begins to discover his grandfather's secrets.  Unable to resist the pull of destiny, he creates his own Monster (Peter Boyle).  Will history repeat itself?<br /><br />I find Mel Brooks films to be hit and miss, usually in the same film.  Parts are funny, and parts are just okay.  That was certainly the case here.  There were several running gags I really enjoyed, and a few of the scenes had me laughing pretty hard.  But there were long stretches where I wasn't laughing.  And, frankly, I kept trying to understand what some scenes were doing in the film.  That's probably my own fault for not watching the films Mel was spoofing first.<br /><br />Now I knew going into the movie that there were be plenty of double entendres.  And I didn't care for them that much.  But by far the worst part of the film for me was the rape.  It was supposed to be played for laughs, but I found it and the after math downright offensive, especially since they were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />Even though there were parts I enjoyed, I won't be seeing this film again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This campy, classic send-up of the Karloff FRANKENSTEIN movies has more hilarious, and more memorably absurd ( in a good way ) scenes than any film I can remember- either in recent years, or going back to the Marx Brothers in DUCK SOUP.

Frankenstein is considered film literature.  It was required watching in school, just like &quot;Great Expectation&quot; is required reading.  All movie buffs know of Frankenstein (played by Boris Karloff in 1931) and trivia questions and jokes are made of it.  Now, this film, Young Frankenstein is of the genius writing by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks.  Produced by Michael Groskoff.  Directed by Mel Brooks.  Released by 20th Century Fox in December 1974.  This fine film is a spoof of the Frankenstein films.  It is a comedy, you may laugh at it all that you want to.  It was made for laughter.  The excellent cast: Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and the lovely Madeline Kahn.  Gene Hackman plays the blind man.  I wish Gene Wilder could have been nominated for an Academy Award for Outstanding Actor, but him and Mel Brooks were nominated for Outstanding Screenplay.  The film was also nominated for Best Sound.  1974 was a tough year for Oscar.  So many wonderful films were shown.  In the special features, there is 16 minutes of deleted scenes and 5 minutes of outtakes.  There are mexican interviews with Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Chris Leachman.  A 36-minute documentary &quot;Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein&quot;.  By the way, there is an in-joke for you if you click on &quot;Television Spots&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Young Frankenstein is certainly a classic film, and I feel somewhat bad about giving it only 3 stars.  The film shows its age, not in the jokes themselves, but in the way they are delivered.  I've never liked films that wink too much at the audience, and Young Frankenstein winks constantly - especially Igor, but also the monster and others.  I found that every time this happened, I was taken out of the movie and reminded that I was watching something, which was distracting and ultimately causes me to remove one star.  The other star is removed because, well, it's not The Producers, which is, for my money, a better (and funnier!) film.<br /><br />A plot synopsis is probably not required, as the film is a spoof-homage (almost equal parts each) of the various Golden-Age Frankenstein films.  Young Dr. Frankenstein ("It's pronounced Fronk-en-steen") is ashamed of his famous anscestor until he learns he is the sole heir to the family's estates.  He arrives in Transylvania and finds Igor ("It's pronounced Eye-gore") and the original doctor's book "How I Did It".  He resolves to build his own monster to prove that with a good brain it would give a good monster.  Unfortunately, Igor screws up and we're left with the standard grunting and homocidal monster.  This does lead to the two greatest set-pieces in the film, however: Frankenstein and the monster performing "Putting on the Ritz" and the monster's visit to a blind and clumsy hermit monk.  These scenes are laugh-out-loud funny even on repeated viewings, and it all depends on the performance of Peter Boyle as the monster.  In fact, Boyle's and Teri Garr's (as the ditzy lab assistant) performances are the best in the film.<br /><br />This is a fine DVD edition - Mel Brook's audio commentary is surprisingly interesting and informative.  It's especially good to hear him admit his mistakes (he wanted to cut the 'Putting on the Ritz' scene) and other inside information.  Less interesting are the deleted scenes (most are not that funny, although I liked the "Reading of the will" cut scene). The outtakes are mostly people laughing and ruining the shot, so get boring quickly.  The audio and video are very crisp and clean, probably better than the original run film prints!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Ever wonder about what might have happened to the journals kept by the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, or the notes he must have made while conducting his ill-advised experiments, attempting to reanimate dead tissue?  And what of his descendants?  How would his legacy of horror have affected them a few generations down the line?  Well, ponder no more, because these questions and many more are finally answered forevermore in &#65533;Young Frankenstein,&#65533; an hilarious parody directed by Mel Brooks.  Dr. Frankenstein&#65533;s great-grandson, Frederick (Gene Wilder), is a doctor and teacher whose research has gained him some renown in his own right, and he has done his best to disassociate himself with the tarnished reputation of his ancestor (he even pronounces his name &#65533;Fronk-en-Steen&#65533;).  Then one day he is notified that he has inherited his great-grandfather&#65533;s estate, including the castle, in which the elder doctor&#65533;s laboratory has been preserved.  Frederick, of course, must go to Transylvania to settle his affairs; but the whole affair soon becomes unsettled when Frederick discovers that it is impossible to escape his destiny.  And once he arrives, the die is cast and there is just no turning back, as he can no longer deny that his... name... is... FRANKENSTEIN!<p> On his own, Mel Brooks is usually good, even great, but when he teams up with Gene Wilder it becomes something extra-special, which first became apparent with &#65533;The Producers,&#65533; in 1967.  But the directness with which Brooks approaches this material, combined with Wilder&#65533;s understated performance makes this their all-time best.  They co-wrote the screenplay, and with their differing perspectives of comedy they managed to capture the best of both worlds and strike a balance that works to perfection here.  Brooks hits you over the head and gets right in your face with a gag, but Wilder steps aside, grabs it by the tail and hits the pause button (so-to-speak), just long enough to really put the joke across.  Together they&#65533;re like the ying and yang of the comedic universe.  The screenplay is clever and includes all of the elements that successfully evoke the essence of the old B&amp;W horror films that are such a part of cinematic lore today.  What they give you with this film is the Frankenstein story with contemporary sensibilities, while presenting a cast of characters that take it over the top.<p> As far as the performances go, nobody, but nobody could have played Frederick better than Gene Wilder.  He employs that prolonged, meaningful pause of his (nobody does it better), which he usually accentuates with a slight shifting of the eyes-- just before he delivers a line-- that can make even a mediocre line hilarious.  His subtle approach and staid countenance play this material perfectly, and complimented by Brooks&#65533; straight ahead direction it allows the humor to flow naturally and freely and never fails to get the right kind of laugh at just the right time.  The way they capture the sense of the original &#65533;Frankenstein&#65533; (and the many sequels) is uncanny, from the overall look of the film to the reactions by everyone at the mere mention of the monster, to the throng of anxious villagers led by the unfaltering and inarticulate Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars).<p> Besides Wilder, who is clearly the star of the show, the supporting performances turned in by this superlative ensemble cast are absolutely impeccable, beginning with Peter Boyle as the monster.  Boyle has the gait and the growl down pat, but also conveys so much with his expressions and introspective comportment.  Then there is Marty Feldman as Igor (that&#65533;s &#65533;EYE-gore&#65533;), whose bug-eyed portrayal of the little hunchback who refuses to acknowledge his hump (mainly because he doesn&#65533;t realize he actually has one) is hilarious.  Teri Garr is a joy to behold as Inga, Frederick&#65533;s lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman practically steals the show as Frau Blucher (and don&#65533;t say her name within earshot of the horses).  Mars also creates a memorable character by putting a mumble and a wooden arm to especially riotous use, and last but not least is the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth, Frederick&#65533;s intended who ultimately finds something grand to sing about.  <p> Also included in the supporting cast are Richard Haydn (Herr Falkstein), Liam Dunn (Mr. Hilltop), Danny Goldman (in a memorable bit as a medical student who challenges Frederick during a lab demonstration), Anne Beesley (Little Girl), Michael Fox (Villager) and Gene Hackman in an uproarious cameo as Harold, the Blind Man.  Often a parody of this nature wears thin after awhile, and even the best rarely manages to maintain a level of excellence for even thirty or forty minutes, let alone for 105 minutes as this one does.  And without question, &#65533;Young Frankenstein&#65533; delivers on a level to which few films of this nature can even aspire.  Arguably one of Mel Brooks&#65533; best-- if not THE best he&#65533;s ever done-- and with a definitive performance by Gene Wilder, this parody takes a place among the all time greats in the history of the cinema.  It&#65533;s funny stuff that gets funnier every time you see it, and that&#65533;s the true magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Quite honestly one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, `Young Frankenstein' is a marvel of cinema and a treasure for every film library.  The film sports some hilarious performances, iconic at that, not to mention a tightly woven script with jokes that actually land; all of which come together beautifully to create an extremely memorable comedic experience.  It's rare for me to find a comedy that covers every base.  As much as I enjoy a good comedy I often refer to dramatic films when speaking of `the best of film' but I would be a liar if I said that `Young Frankenstein' isn't one of the greatest `movies' ever made, let alone comedies.<br /><br />The film follows the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein, as he inherits his grandfather's castle.  Frankenstein has spent his entire life trying to live down the reputation of his experimental grandfather but he soon finds himself falling into his granddads footsteps.  Equipped with a hunchbacked sidekick Igor, the beautiful Inga and the mysterious Frau Blucher, Frankenstein makes his own attempt at creating life from death, with some disastrous (not to mention hilarious) consequences.<br /><br />Gene Wilder was one hilarious actor.  I love his character creations, Frederick Frankenstein resting right up there with Willy Wonka for me.  He truly shines here, it's no wonder he considered this his favorite of all the films he made.  Marty Feldman steals this film though as Igor.  His performance is comedic genius.  The way he always manages to steal the limelight in the scene, becoming the focal point of our attention due to his marvelous comedic timing.  Teri Garr is also right on point and effortlessly captivating, but she can't hold a candle to Cloris Leachman or Madeline Kahn who are both uproarious here; especially Leachman (that whole violin scene leaves me in stitches every time).<br /><br />We cannot leave out the late, great, Peter Boyle who dominates this film as the monster.  He makes him human, yes, but more importantly he makes him funny.  That whole `Puttin on the Ritz' scene (arguably the best scene in the film) is precisely the reason why this film is a `must see-must own' staple for any lover of film.<br /><br />Mel Brooks was known for his comedies, many of which are considered classics and are adored by many.  In my humble opinion, this is his finest film.  It gets everything right, and that is a rare treat indeed.  There is not a dry spot found here, each and every gag landing right where it is supposed to (word is that for every joke that landed there were two or three that fell flat so there was a massive editing procedure done to save the film and deliver this finely polished finished product).<br /><br />There are plenty of spoofs out there today, films that take something classic and tear it to shreds in an effort to elicit some laughs.  Sadly many of them fall flat.  `Young Frankenstein' is the film that they should all aspire to be because it is the one film that actually manages to deliver a unique and memorable experience without tarnishing the good name of the original.  Yes, `Young Frankenstein' draws all of its humor from cracking fun at Mary Shelley's classic, but this film manages to become its own film, separate from its inspiration and thus earning its very own place in our hearts.<br /><br />There are few films that I could sit and watch time and time again.  This is right at the top of that very short list.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>I love this film, which is without a doubt one of the ten funniest films ever created (and offhand, the other nine don't come to mind). YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is both an homage and a comic send-up of the 1931 and 1935 Universal Pictures classics FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (with some SON OF FRANKENSTEIN thrown in for good measure) in which an inspired director (Mel Brooks), an inspired screenwriter (Gene Wilder), and an inspired cast (Wilder as "Dr. Fronkensteen," Teri Garr as his tasty Girl Friday Inga, Marty Feldman as the misshapen hunchbacked lab assistant "Eye-Gore," Cloris Leachman as the cigar-smoking and violin-playing Frau Blucher, Madeleine Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's uptight fiancee Elizabeth, Kenneth Mars as the wooden-armed Inspector Kemp who wears an eyepatch and a monocle on the same side, Gene Hackman as The Lonesome Blind Man, and Peter Boyle as the Monster) create the rarest of synergies onscreen.<br /><br />Professor Frederick Frankenstein's acceptance of his birthright, and his transmutation throughout YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN from a respected American neurosurgeon to the Transylvanian noble, Herr Doktor Baron Frederich von Frankenstein, grave-robber and necromancer nonpareil, is an amusing echo of Colin Clive's ghoulish journey from dedicated Scientist to Mad Doctor, in which the humor of this movie becomes the honorarium paid to the earlier film.<br /><br />YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is as funny today as it was in 1974 when it was released. A staple of the cable channels, it is incredible that a film seen so often can stay so fresh, but YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has everyone involved contributing their finest skills at the peak of their powers. Although classed as a Mel Brooks creation, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN really belongs to Gene Wilder. His script maintains a perfect balance between pure silliness, dry wit, slapstick, and lowbrow humor, each finding it's own place and time within the film's reality---<br /><br />---Igor's directions to "Walk this way" (at which point Wilder adopts his assistant's characteristically hunched and loping stance, staggering toward their nearby horse and wagon. This scene inspired Aerosmith to write their classic rock hit, appropriately entitled, "Walk This Way.")<br /><br />---The screaming of the horses at the mention of Frau Blucher's ("Mrs. Glue"'s) name;<br /><br />---Gene Hackman's kindly but inept blind man's pouring of steaming soup into the Monster's lap and Peter Boyle's reaction ("How hungry you must have been," muses the oblivious Hackman);<br /><br />---"Eye-Gore's" ridiculous attempt at playing Igor to type, as in:<br /><br />Igor---"There wolf. There castle."<br />Dr. Frankenstein---"Why are you talking that way?"<br />Igor---"I thought you wanted to."<br />Dr.---"No, I don't want to."<br />Igor---"Oh, okay. Suit yourself. I'm easy."<br /><br />---Wilder and Boyle's unforgettable white-tie performance of "Puttin' On The Ritz" in front of the Transylvania Neurological Society ("For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!")<br /><br />Endless double entendre ("Elevate me." "Vhat? Here and now?" "Yes. Raise the platform." "Oh! Ze platform, ja, ze platform...").<br /><br />---(And my personal favorite) Cloris Leachman admitting that she set the stage for the creation of the monster, a la:<br /><br />Dr. Frankenstein---"So you and my grandfather...you and he were...?"<br />Frau Blucher (screaming it)---"Yes! Yes! Say it! Say it! He vass my...boyfriend!"<br /><br />Note if you will, the slight question in her tone at the end of her lines, as though asking if this is okay. I always end up howling with laughter at this moment, even though I've seen this picture at least 100 times. The entire film is crafted with moments like this, a jeweled net of pure comic genius.<br /><br />Filmed in atmospheric black and white and borrowing the original lab equipment from James Whale's equally ageless now 77 year old film for dramatic effect, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has unquestionably earned its place both as a classic comedy and as a classic in the monster movie canon on it's own merits. Brooks never topped this film. The closest contender in his oeveur would be BLAZING SADDLES, which, although inspired, relies too heavily on toilet humor to be a true classic. There are few other films made by anyone at any time, which have struck such pure comic notes.<br /><br />In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN will never grow old.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>After having seen "Blazing Saddles" in the theater, I was quite anxious to see "Young Frankenstein."  I thought "Blazing Saddles" was funny, but "Young Frankenstein" was even funnier.<br /><br />Frederick (or possibly FRO-de-rick, as suggested by Igor, played by Marty Feldman) Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has inherited his father's estate.  His father's estate is a gothic castle in Transylvania with secret passages and a basement full of the original "Frankenstein" equipment; just the sort of recreation room that any mad scientist would love.  However, Frederick is somewhat straight laced; a doctor set on trying to divorce himself from the Frankenstein name.  However, once he arrives at the castle he seems to become intrigued by being a Frankenstein, and after discovering a book, "How I Did It," he decides it is time to make his own creature.<br /><br />Inga (nicely played by the beautiful Teri Garr) is Frederick's ditzy blonde laboratory assistant.  Frederick is encouraged by the creepy Frau Bl&uuml;cher (Chloris Leachman).  Frederick is often just as discouraged by the bumbling of slightly dimwitted but witty assistant Igor and by the innocent monster, convincingly played by Peter Boyle.  Filling out the background is Madeline Kahn as Frederick's fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth and Kenneth Mars as Police Inspector Kemp.  Buried deep in the credits is Gene Hackman as the blind man.  Even knowing who was playing the blind man I still had a hard time recognizing Gene Hackman.<br /><br />The humor in this movie is multi-faceted.  Sometimes the laughs are cheap, other times they are more sophisticated.  Mel Brooks originally cut the scene where Igor says "...walk this way..." and Gene Wilder starts to hobble down the stairs on Igor's cane.  However, the scene is one of the best, and most frequently recalled, scenes in the movie.  The scene with the revolving bookcase remains one of my favorite scenes.<br /><br />There are plenty of one-liners to keep the pace moving.  Werewolf?  There wolf.  You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.  The list of short jokes is lengthy, and nearly all the jokes work.<br /><br />This movie pays homage to "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein."  I also read that this movie was a tribute to "Son of Frankenstein," but in the making of on the DVD the first two movies were mentioned and I do not recall the last movie being named.<br /><br />The special edition DVD contains a wealth of material.  My favorite material was the making-of feature, the out-takes and the bloopers.  The deleted scenes varied from interesting to dull, and in general I found it easy to understand why the scenes were deleted.  The production stills had some interesting prints, but there were also stills that were repetitive and boring.  The variety of trailers included gave potential viewers a good preview of the movie.  There was even a trailer for a re-release, which I did not remember.  There are also some interviews conducted in Mexico that contained some interesting material, and were thankfully short.<br /><br />"Young Frankenstein" is a movie that has managed to retain its humor for decades.  The jokes are generally timeless, and most of them are set up well enough to be funny.  There are jokes that fall a little flat, but fortunately these are few.  I attribute much of the quality of this movie to the script that began with Gene Wilder and was modified by Mel Brooks.  The result is one of the best movies that Mel Brooks ever directed, and one of the best movies in which these actors appeared.  This movie is a must-have for fans of comedy and for fans of classic horror films.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Released in 1974, Young Frankenstein is irrefutably one of the funniest movies ever made.  Devotees are quick to recreate favorite scenes and certain lines from the film have insinuated themselves into popular culture.  Never has the phrase, "Dying is easy, comedy is hard," seemed more fitting.  Indeed, anyone who has ever intentionally attempted humor knows it's a whole lot more difficult than it looks.<br /><br />Viewed in this context, Young Frankenstein is one of those incredibly rare examples of a project where everything goes right.  The best place to begin is with the chemistry between Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.  Left to his own devices, Brooks is the original loose canon, willing to embrace any outrageous extreme in pursuit of laughs.  Wilder, a far more refined and nuanced artist, is his perfect foil, they balance each other ideally.  (This was also true in The Producers and Blazing Saddles.)<br /><br />Next is the supporting cast.  Great comic actors are less common than hen's teeth, but Brooks managed to assemble a veritable Who's Who.  Teri Garr, in addition to bringing sex to the picture, has superb comic timing.  Madeline Kahn is as gifted a comedienne as you might ever find, and her flamboyance is irresistible.  Marty Feldman is more than just another pretty face with a moving hump, he delivers.  Actors like Cloris Leachman, Peter Boyle, and Gene Hackman - not known for comedy - rise to the occasion and become funny by virtue of their context.<br /><br />Next is the discipline.  Brooks and Wilder stay close to the original Mary Shelley story as well as the two famous film versions, even going so far as to locate and use the laboratory set from the 1931 Frankenstein by James Whale.  By making the film an homage to the great monster pictures of early Hollywood, (note the decision to shoot in black and white), Brooks and Wilder created something that is more than just a broad farce, at times it is actually touching.<br /><br />Architecture firmly in place, the mayhem could begin in earnest.  This is as good a comedy script as you are likely to find anywhere, one-liners zing by with the manic pace of a Marx Brothers movie.  But even the best script can die in the wrong hands, and there are no wrong hands in this film, (not even the dead ones).  From physical humor, to timing, (where comedy lives or dies), to snappy, deadpan delivery of over-the-top dialogue, Young Frankenstein is practicality a masters class in comic acting - plus - these performers are obviously enjoying themselves.  If you were to own just one comedy film, this should be it.  Absolute perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This is director Mel Brooks' hilarious tribute to Mary Shelley's classic novel entitled "Frankenstein" (first published 1818) and pokes fun at just about every Frankenstein movie ever made (especially the original 1931 classic).  The screen story and screenplay to this movie were written by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.  This movie was filmed in the same castle and with the same props and lab equipment as the original classic.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  Dr. Frankenstein's grandson (Gene Wilder) who insists his name be pronounced "Franken-STEEN" inherits his granddad's castle and repeats his experiments.  He also inherits some people:  a hunchbacked servant named Igor-pronounced "EYE-gore" (Marty Feldman), a pretty "lab assistant" named Inga (Teri Garr, her claim to fame), and a housekeeper named Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman).  We also meet the grandson's fianc&eacute;e (Madeline Kahn), a blind hermit (Gene Hackman, who was not given billing credit when this movie was originally released in theatres), and the Monster (played with finesse by Peter Boyle).  All these characters create a hilarious spooky spoof that some say is Mel Brooks best movie and that Gene Wilder says is his favorite movie.<br /><br />The comedy is a mixture between slapstick and outrageous silliness.  There are no cheap jokes but there are plenty of one-liners and sight gags.  I chuckled most of the way through this movie but in some spots, I laughed out loud.<br /><br />The acting is terrific.  Gene Wilder carries the movie.  (He barely stifles his hysterical laughter at several points.)  Teri Garr adds a sexiness to the movie and presents her trademark humor.  I give special kudos to Marty Feldman for making "EYE-gore" such a memorable and funny character.<br /><br />This movie is filmed in glorious black and white.  The background music adds to each scene.  As well, the cinematography is astounding.<br /><br />This is a movie you can see over and over without tiring.  In fact, I laughed more when I saw this movie a second time!<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (Special Edition) itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras, all of them interesting.  Special mention should go to the out-takes/bloopers that I found to be quite funny.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a monstrously crazy movie, a truly inspired vision of lunacy!!<br /><br />(1974;  105 min;  wide screen; black and white, 28 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>Piece of trivia:  Aerosmith went to a midnight movie showing of YOung Frankenstein, when they saw Igor say "Walk this way" and Gene Wilder followed him exactly "walking this way" they thought it was hilarious.  Hence, the title of their famous hit, "Walk This Way".<br /><br />Frankenstein was never meant to be funny, but somehow a genius like Mel Brooks turned it into a classic comedy.  The humor is smutty without offense, silly without being jeuvenile, and timeless.  Here we take the fabled tale of Dr Frankenstein creating his monster and making it a hilarious madcap adventure.  Gene Wilder was at his all time funniest, with his neurotic comedy and screaming fits (of which I modeled my own humor after).  Igor, though no longer with us, was so ugly and revolting that he could've only been an actor playing the weirdo sidekick.  While Terri Garr would go on to play far smarter characters in her career, she was at her buxom airheaded best.  ("Would you like to have a roll in the hay? ... It's fun!  ... Roll!  Roll!  Roll in the hay!")<br /><br />This was also Madeline Khan's (though also no longer with us) greatest moment.  She was at her all time funniest as the vain and self centered fiancee of Gene Wilder, then to have her inner sex kitten come out thanks to Peter Boyle's monster's enormous stranstooker.  (And if you have to be told what that is, then maybe this isn't the movie for you.)<br /><br />The special features are hilarious, as you hear the obvious love and affetion the crew had for this movie.  I was disappointed that Gene Wilder didn't contribute, but then again a lot of comics in real life aren't really "funny guys", and perhaps he hardly says a word should you meet him.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 1974, the same year that Mel Brooks' film "Blazing Saddles" was making people laugh at theaters around the world, Mel Brooks teamed with Gene Wilder to write a hilarious film spoof of Mary Shelley's (1797-1851) classic 1818 short story "Frankenstein", as well as the many twentieth-century horror films that the story inspired.  The result was the film entitled "Young Frankenstein" that Mel Brooks directed and starring Gene Wilder as the fictitious Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson of the more famous Frankenstein from Shelley's short story.  Frederick, embarrassed by his grandfather's unethical medical practices, pronounced the family name as Fronkensteen to try and disassociate himself from his heritage; but when Frederick inherits the family's castle in Transylvania, he has no choice but to return to the family home.  There, he finds two of his grandfather's assistants still taking care of the castle: Frau Bl&uuml;cher (Cloris Leachman) and Igor (Marty Feldman, 1933-1982).  Engaged to Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn, 1942-1999), Frederick has a beautiful assistant named Igna (Teri Garr).  When word spreads in the nearby town that a Frankenstein has returned to the castle, the townsfolk rally around their local police chief, Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp (Kenneth Mars) with his mechanical arm; but Frederick assures them that he is not planning to resume his grandfather's experiments--that is, until he discovers his grandfather's secret diary and decides that he too can create life!<br /><br />Filmed entirely in black and white, "Young Frankenstein" is a classic comedic film that continues to entertain both old and young alike.  With a combination of wonderful acting, hilarious accents (especially those used by Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and Kenneth Mars) and the exquisitely written plot & dialog, it is unlikely that anyone watching this film will be able to do so with a straight face.  Some of the most hilarious scenes include Inga & Frederick with the secret revolving door, the laboratory scenes, the monster (Peter Boyle) with the old blind man (Gene Hackman), the duet between Frederick and monster singing "Puttin' on the Ritz", and Elizabeth transformed into the monster's bride (looking exactly like the bride from the original 1935 "Bride of Frankenstein").  Overall, I rate "Young Frankenstein" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>Young Frankenstein is the most consistently funny and inspired of Mel Brooks's comedies. A parody of the Universal Frankenstein series of the 1930s and '40s, it features a brilliant performance by Gene Wilder in the title role, supported by British comedian Marty Feldman as a humpbacked assistant (a cross between Dwight Frye's Fritz and Bela Lugosi's Ygor), Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp (an homage to Lionel Atwill's Inspector Krogh), Peter Boyle as the Monster, Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher, the housekeeper, and Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn as a naive laboratory assistant and Frankenstein's fiancee, respectively, both looking utterly sumptuous. The cast have a riot with a great script. Look out for Gene Hackman's irresistibly funny cameo, too.<br /><br />The expressionistic shades and eerie tones of Gerald Hirschfield's lighting and photography capture perfectly the mood of the Universal series, and Wilder and Brooks's screenplay draws wittily from every aspect of the original films. While hilarious, it pays respectful homage to the Frankenstein films rather than getting cheap shots at their expense.<br /><br />This edition comes with a documentary and Mel Brooks commentary that will only enhance your appreciation of the film. There are some amusing outtakes/bloopers, although admittedly the rather longwinded deleted scenes reveal just how wisely the finished product was edited!</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Mel Brooks' &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is not only a loving tribute to James Whale's original Frankenstein films, but a wildly entertaining spoof that still generates laughs years after its original release.  This is Brooks in his prime and that is indeed a wonderful sight to behold.  <p>Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is the grandson of the notorious Victor Frankenstein.  After reviewing his grandfather's work, Frederick tries to recreate the famous reanimation experiment at his ancestral castle.  Frederick succeeds in bringing his own creation to life but as luck would have it, there is a problem with the brain implanted in the monster (Peter Boyle).  Soon, the monster is roaming the countryside and finding itself in one hilarious situation after another until Frederick catches up with him and promptly puts his tap-dancing talents to good use.  <p>&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is blessed with top quality comedic performances from start to finish.  Wilder and Boyle are pitch perfect as the doctor and his creation and the supporting cast of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman, and Gene Hackman all shine.  The production design also is top notch as the Frankenstein Castle's interiors and exteriors are faithfully recreated - with the help of some of the original props - in glorious black and white and literally look like holdover sets from Universal's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935).  You would never think that source material like Mary Shelley's original work could inspire such a funny film, but leave it to Brooks to prove it could be done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>&quot;The scariest comedy of all time!&quot; boasted the poster taglines for &quot;Young Frankenstein.&quot; When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat. Such is the case with Mel Brooks' &quot;Young Frankenstein,&quot; one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.<p>Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for &quot;Young Frankenstein,&quot; I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them. They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after &quot;The Producers&quot; (&quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; also helped quite a bit).<p>Some fans of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; could consider the film almost sacrilegious, I suppose, but that wouldn't be fair. It's not a poke at any flaws in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; -- it's a well-thought-out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.<p>Gene Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (&quot;Frahnk-un-steen,&quot; not &quot;Frank-en-steyn&quot;), grandson of the crazy old loon Baron von Frankenstein, who attempted to re-animate dead matter in his creepy mansion in Transylvania years ago. Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him. When a student asks him questions about his grandfather and research into re-animation, he is quick to change the subject.<p>Then he inherits his grandfather's castle in Transylvania and makes the long, weary journey there to acquire ownership. Greeted by Igor (pronounced &quot;Eegor,&quot; not &quot;Eyegor&quot;), Frederick Frankenstein is soon haunted by his grandfather's interests. I guess the craving for re-animating dead tissue is just something that runs in one's blood!<p>He stumbles upon an old chamber underneath the crumbling mansion, home to an assortment of odd inventions and textbooks (including &quot;How I Did It,&quot; by Baron von Frankenstein, which is a bit of an in-joke for readers of Mary Shelley's story -- they'll understand the joke, perhaps, more than most audiences).<p>After finding a dead body in a graveyard and accidentally inserting an &quot;Abby Normal&quot; brain into it from the help of Igor (Marty Feldman), Frederick Frankenstein creates a new Monster (Peter Boyle), who is taken into custody by the townspeople and then escapes, finding an old blind man (Gene Hackman) in a cabin somewhere. He then kidnaps Frederick's bride to take her as his own and Frederick realizes that he must put an end to the Monster before everything in his life falls apart.<p>There isn't much to say about a film like this. The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works. It's classic. Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy. <p>I suppose the accounts of Brooks' and Wilder's off-screen fights during filming are pretty well known. In one instance, Brooks got so mad at Wilder that he threw an object at him. Later he called Wilder and said, &quot;Who was that jerk that threw that thing at you today? He should be fired!&quot; <p>It was because the two minds clashed together. Both being extreme fans of &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; I suppose both men had their own unique opinions as to what, exactly, the film should be about, and what, exactly, should happen in it. But for whatever the reason, despite all their arguments the film has turned into a masterpiece.<p>Wilder's performance is extraordinary. After turning Leo Bloom (&quot;The Producers&quot;) into a nervous, paranoid, timid man, Wilder does a 180 here and makes Frankenstein into a self-assured, mean, forthright character -- giving us the feeling that he's been hassled his entire lifetime by nosy reporters researching into his grandfather's case, and he's tired of it.<p>Filmed on-location in the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films. The famous Universal horrors from the 1930s and 40s are spoofed in this film, and that is primarily is what truly makes it stand out from the other films in the genre. But Brooks and Wilder don't insult them. They compliment them and poke fun with them -- not at them.<p>Brooks tried this formula once again in 1995 with &quot;Dracula: Dead and Loving it!&quot;, which starred Leslie Nielsen as Count Dracula, although the outcome was not as smart as &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and not as convincing. Brooks did a great thing by filming &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in grainy 30-style black and white, reminiscent of old films such as &quot;Dracula&quot; or &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; or &quot;Frankenstein&quot; itself (not coincidentally, Brooks makes more than a few references to other Universal horror films, too). Part of the greatness of this film is the manner in which it is filmed. I can't imagine &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in color. But then again, I can't really imagine &quot;Spaceballs&quot; in black and white...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>There are so many great things to say about this film.... So I make another list...<p>-If you've never seen this, it's not scary. Great spoof-humor throughout.<br />-If you don't like Mel Brooks stuff, try renting it. It is...<br />-Mel Brooks's best work.<br />-All of the performers absolutely nailed their roles. I had forgotten Gene Hackmans classic performance. Outstanding!!<br />-"Widescreen Review" gives the DVD 3.5 picture and 2.0 sound quality ratings.<br />-I would disagree. This is a Spoof of the classic "Frankensteins Monster". I believe this film was recorded in mono to mimic the feal of the original.<br />-The picture quality is actually quite clear.<br />-The extras are better-than-average for a DVD of this price.<br />-Included are deleted scenes and outakes. The "Parade of the Actors" is wonderfully zany!! Great stuff!!<br />-Great for Halloween when you would rather laugh than cringe.<br />-Not for young kids. They wouldn't get the jokes anyway.<p>I bought this as an afterthought. I was pleasantly surprized at what I got. If you're a Brooks fan... What are you waiting for? If not, rent it and see. I don't like averything he's done, but this one is a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>If this movie got any funnier, it would be illegal! This is one of a small brace of movies, written by former gag writers for "Your Show of Shows", that kind of "rifled" the jokes and sight gags at you! Mel Brooks, for some reason, (I wonder what it is,) was VERY fond of poking fun at German culture, and you give him a trite teutonic subject to parody and the venom never stopped!!<br /><br />"My grandfather's work was DOO-DOO!!"<br /><br />"I ain't got no boooody, and nobody cares for me! Ha-ta-chee-cha-hat-ta-chee-cha!"<br /><br />"Pardon me, boy...is this the Transylvania Station?" "Ja, track 29....can I give you a shine?"<br /><br />Then there's the "Putting On The Ritz" number with the monster!I'm telling you, you give any jewish comedian named Mel a platform to work from, and I GUARANTEE you at least ONE comic classic! And this is one of THREE for Brooks! The black and white cinematography is first rate and this film has been called "....One of the most beautifully photographed comedies ever made!" by more than one reviewer.<br /><br />Brooks was certainly at the top of his game here, but unfortuately, after this movie, he started into a long, slow decline and hasn't rebounded since, (except for "Life Stinks" and "History Of The World", MAYBE!) so enjoy this movie, for it's the last of its kind from a director that used to DEFINE truly screwball comedies!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>For fans of Horror and Comedy no other movie pays more homage to both genres.  Mel Brooks hilarious spoof of Frankenstein is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made.  The casting is incredible (especially Marty Feldman as Igor) and the gags will have you rolling in the grave, um, on the floor.  With everything from sight gags to overt sexual innuendo (both Brooks trademarks) this comedy will have you gasping for breath.  The monster on stage doing a dance routine with Dr. F., the lonely blind man (Gene Hackman) who was going to make espresso, the luscious Terri Garr &quot;assisting&quot; whenever she can.  I know this is one of my favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite movies.  It's made even better if you watch the 1931 Universal Frankenstein (with Boris Karloff as the monster) before it.  For fans of Horror, of Comedy, or just plain old good movies.</p></br></body></html>

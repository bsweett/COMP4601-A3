The poster does not help either. My impression was, this movie is some Sci-Fi fantasy about Maya, probably something not close, but similar to "Stargate". The poster even made me think of "Alien vs. Predator".<br /><br />Instead the movie is portraying the ancient world of Mesoamerican people, as well as tracking the end of the ancient civilizations, through the story of Jaguar's Paw - a captured warrior in a rescue to his family. It doesn't portray the fall of the Mayan Empire, it's not supposed to, it just tells a story, It does not set out to be a history of the arrival of European's in the Mayan area. Horrific as it may be, it's a love story at the end of the day along with a lot of action. Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera. For instance, you see women being carried off in the rape-and-pillage scene and you hear their cries but you don't see them being raped and murdered. Battles are staged much as they were in "Braveheart." And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood-streaked Mayan shaman, but moviegoers saw the same thing in Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; it got a PG rating and we read no critical hysterics about "lunatic violence." On the whole, you'll see as much blood and gore on the average CSI episode.<br /><br />After watching this film, it probably should have been titled "Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure." The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw-dropping. You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail. Every face seems to have a complete history as Jaguar Paw is marched through the Mayan city. A well-to-do Mayan woman does nothing more than look at the prisoners from her doorway but the story her face tells is voluminous.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has done the impossible. He has created a tale of the Maya's people in different dimension. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the violence in most of the movie. Finally, as a work of art, this film is unparalleled. "Apocalypto" will move you. I found it to be one of the most beautiful films I needed to see even though it took me some time to view it but I'm happy that I did. Its dialogue is entirely in Mayan language with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends. On one level it unites an international cast, sparing us any clashing accents, and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity. On another, it forced Gibson and his team into a very visual form of storytelling; even amongst the carnage there are shots of aching beauty. If you still haven't seen it then I suggest you give this one a try. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Apocalypto" presents a fresh variation on the staple action movie storyline of an Everyman who goes to extraordinary lengths to save his family from peril. Director and co-writer Mel Gibson has made a career of heroic men who emerge from mundane circumstances to combat threats to loved ones, first as an actor, now as a director. Having told this story in Medieval Scotland, apocalyptic Down Under, and present-day Los Angeles, Gibson places his classic hero on a new canvas: Mayan civilization circa 1500. For those who crave action, primitive weaponry and hand-to-hand combat prove as compelling as explosions and machine guns. As gruesome violence is also a Gibson tradition, there is plenty of that too.<br /><br />In the jungle of early 16th century Central America, tribespeople go about their daily business. Young men hunt and make jokes, elders dole out advice and stories, and families enjoy one another's company. The idyll is shattered one morning when a group of Holcane warriors raid the village, burn it to the ground, take prisoners, and kill almost indiscriminately. A young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to conceal his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and son in a nearby pit before he is captured. He and his fellow captives are marched through jungle, river, and hills until they reach a city. The Mayans are a civilization in crisis, plagued by disease, crop failure, and famine.  Desperate to appease their gods, they have gruesome plans for the prisoners. But Jaguar Paw is determined to return to his forest and his family, who need his help to get out of the pit.<br /><br />The pregnant woman in peril and the relentless young husband are cliches. And it's hokey for a person named Jaguar Paw to be saved by a jaguar, which he happens to run into up a tree. But this is an environment we're not used to seeing, and "Apocalypto" effectively builds suspense in spite of its predictability. The only time it ran out of steam for me was during the jungle chase, which resembles "The Perils of Pauline" after a while. What most impressed me about "Apocalypto" is the meticulously recreated Mayan aesthetic. The piercings, tattoos, and scarifications can be off-putting, and that's before we arrive in the city, where the wealthy proudly display jade-inlaid teeth and huge headdresses. But it grew on me. After a while, I caught on to this concept of beauty, and it became glamorous and alluring.<br /><br />Much has been made of historical inaccuracies in this film, but I don't think its sins are so grievous. Elements from Mayan classic and post-classic periods are combined for aesthetic reasons, and fictions such as the human target game and, I assume, the tapir trap are added to enhance the action and showcase Mayan weaponry. That kind of thing will drive a historian nuts, but laypeople shrug it off. Although Jaguar Paw is imbued with modern, middle-class values, and the film's thematic framing device, "a great civilization in not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within", necessitates muddling of dates, this seems to me a good introduction to Mayan civilization -largely because we get to see what these people looked like, with the help of a recreated city and 700 extras. All dialogue in "Apocalypto" is Yucatec Maya, which is not the actors' native language. English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Touchstone 2007): There is a making-of documentary, one deleted scene (30 sec), and an audio commentary. "Becoming Mayan: Creating Apocalypto" (25 min) interviews Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia about locations in Mexico and building the Mayan city. Other members of the creative team talk about recreating the Mayans through costumes and make-up. Weapons consultant Simon Atherton discusses Mayan weaponry. The audio commentary is by writer/director/ producer Mel Gibson and co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia. This casual commentary doesn't have as much historical information as I would have liked. But it does provide some Mayan background, as well as discussions of lighting, the intentions behind some scenes, and filming anecdotes. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, English, Spanish, and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Long before Vietnam there was unrest in the jungles far across the Pacific Ocean in what we now call Central America. But don't expect a History lesson here, folks. Do expect an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Apocolypto is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and not a word of English is spoken throughout. There are subtitles, but I don't think that there is a scene in the movie where you wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on if there were no subtitles at all.<br /><br />Apocolypto tells the story of the approximate 48 hour period of when one Maya tribe clashes with another, and focuses on the effects of the clash on tribe-member Jaguar Paw and his family. The movie hits on all emotions, and is brutally violent at times.<br /><br />The key to viewing Apocolypto is to remember that the idea here was not, as I said earlier, to give the viewer a History lesson. The film takes a fictional, isolated, 2-day period out of Maya civilization and makes an awesome movie out of it. So the critics who were screaming "historical inaccuracies" and "racism" need to relax.<br /><br />At the time of the film's release there were some negative reviews that said Apocolypto portrayed native Mesoamericans as savages, but never covered and explained the achievements by the Maya culture in art, architecture, language, math and astronomy. Well, no, Apocolypto indeed does not really cover that stuff in detail....It's an action movie, not a documentary!<br /><br />Writer/producer Farhad Safinia (who met Gibson while working on The Passion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJQ">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)</a> ) said in a Reuters article from December 2006 that the idea of Apocolypto was "to update the chase genre by not updating it with technology or machinery but stripping it down to its most intense form, which is a man running for his life." And that is what you get....Apocolypto is a kind-of Maya civilization First Blood <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a> (1982) story that takes place in the jungles of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula circa 1517.<br /><br />Welcome to the jungle. No one can outrun their destiny.<br /><br />Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but he now has under his direction 3 of the best movies ever made (Apocolypto, Braveheart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> [1995] and The Passion [2004]). Apocolypto is one for the collection and should be added to your cart. If you dropped support of Gibson because of his recent public controversy, I can certainly respect that; I therefore suggest that you not miss Apocolypto when it hits cable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Apocalypto takes us back to the Americas right before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492.  The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.<br />The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />The setting (!), the dialogues, the language (!), the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, Apocalypto is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>If there is one good thing to be said about Mel Gibson; its that he associates himself with very unique movies that are usually quite good.  Breaveheart was probably the first big movie that looked at English colonialism in Europe.  Likewise this movie, which he purportedly funded himself, is probably the biggest movie out there about the experience of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans.  The "native" characters are played entirely by actors and actresses of Native American descent.  And they speak the correct native language for that time and place; Quecha.  Set right before the arrival of the Spaniards, the movie also shows the complex world of Central American societies at that time, such as the religious beliefs, social organization, and accomplished skills in construction and architecture; all done without metal tools or parts!  Like other Gibson movies, there is an abundance of inter-personal violence, most of it quite realistic and bloody.  Underlying this visual spectacle are story themes rehashed from hundreds of other movies.  These include the trials of the main protagonist, who, though injured, outlasts and kills of most of a hunting party chasing him down.  This latter chase scene is quite reminiscent of many Rambo movies.  Of course he does this to save his pregnant wife and son; which is a storyline found over and over again, including in a previous Gibson flick; The Patriot.  Overall, this movie is quite good; it puts the audience in a world few of us will ever think of, let alone heard of.  The special effects are top notch, as are the action scenes.  The story-line however, is something to be improved upon.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>I am not going to get to deep into the story. There are a 1000 reviews here and they are extremely positive. Those that aren't focus on the historical innaccuracies. Let's be honest here...if you want to watch a historical documentary...please turn to the HISTORY CHANNEL! Otherwise, this is an adventure set 600 years towards the end of the Mayan civilization. The main character is a young man named Jaguar Paw. He is a fierce hunter, loving husband and father whose world is destroyed when his  village is attacked by Mayans. Before his capture, he hides his wife and son in a well. Against all odds he must flee his captors and return to his family before the rains come! What ensues is nothing short of an adrenaline rush! A great movie!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: One word: WOW! This is gorgeous! The colors explode and fill the screen! Lush green jungles, roaring fires, and solar eclipses! This is a visual joy! DEMO DISC! The audio is outstanding as well. All special features from the DVD are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Forget what you think about Mel Gibson as a person, because either way this guy can make a movie.  The controversial "Apocalypto" is a film like no other, telling a compeling story of survival amidst extinction, using suspense and thrills that sends chills down the spine while being on the edge of your seat.  This was not the film I was expecting to see, but came away from it with a sense of power and strength, and the emotions of the will to survive.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes basically sets the Mayan village setting for us, with moments of humor (good humor at that), bonding, and family.  The dialouge is actually subtitled in English, which really is fitting for this movie.  Some of the cinematography gives you the feel of being in a Mayan jungle, and their language adds to the realism.  Once things get rolling - thus begins the roller coaster that never stops, as the Aztec (supposedly Aztec, but not necessarily) warriors make their move and all hell breaks loose, almost literally.  Powerful scenes of violence and cruelty continue constently, again adding to the realism and sickness of such an event - specifically the Aztec way of life.  The main charcatcer "Jaguar Paw" played by an impressive Rudy Youngblood, is captured (along with most of the rest of the villagers) by the Aztecs and leaves behind his pregnant wife and young son, though keeping them secretly in a safe location.  For the reminader of the movie, you know he has to get back to them and rescue them, promising them he would return.  But how can he possibly escape the fate that seems to be set in store for him and the villagers?<br /><br />The story actually is not as complex as I imagined it would have been.  This movie is basically a thriller/suspense, and doing whatever it takes to stay alive.  The only depth I really found was when a young girl speaks of a sort of prophecy.  No one wants to believe her, but the events begin coming true.  There is a good deal of insight into what life might have been like, and the sets and imagery used for the Aztec culture is shocking to an extent.  There seemed to be lots of detail, so that every aspect of this culture could be recognized.  Though its a shame to see what it represents, the great Aztec city is truly a spectacular sight, and Mel did just a fantastic job mkaing it come alive on film.<br /><br />Among the controvery associated with this film, its probably the amount of gore and violence that have people talking about the most.  From the beginning of this film to the end, you will find plenty of very disturbing scenes.  Its not really ment for entertainment purposes like a horror movie, but to give a more sense of realism.  Some scenes that really get gruesome is the eating of animal balls, hearts being torn out of bodies, beheadings, and squirting blood from a head.<br /><br />This film could also be considered action, though I wouldn't call it fun action at all.  Nevertheless, there are lots of fights and a ton of chases through the jungle.  The camera work is very impressive with these chases, with little to no shaking occuring.<br /><br />The charcaters are all convincing in this film.  The actors and actresses were chosen wisely.  Rudy Youngblood does a find job as the lead, but its the Aztec leaders that sell it the most.  Two very convincing and downright dirty villains are created, both of whom send a good dose of fear to the viewer.<br /><br />If you can deal with some disturbing scenes and lots of gore, this is a movie that everyone should see.  A great look into what might have very well been for these cultures.  It is very powerful and moving, and this movie is one you will never forget after watching.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Apocalypto" is an easier movie to admire than it is to love.  Mel Gibson utilizes all the tricks of his trade to make an intelligent, thoughtful movie and yet what sticks with you is the over-the-top, unrelenting violence of the film.<br /><br />Set in the 16th century, "Apocalypto" focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization, one of the most fascinating yet ignored cultures in the Western hemisphere.  Jaguar Paw is a young warrior in a jungle tribe of Maya, father to a young boy and waiting for his pregnant wife to bring another son into the world.  The first half-hour of the film focuses on the daily life of Jaguar Paw's tribe, including a realistic tapir hunt and some hilarious scenes from the tribe's daily life.  One of the most refreshing aspects of "Apocalypto" is the movie's willingness to humanize the members of this largely-forgotten culture.<br /><br />The peaceful idyll of the tribe's life comes crashing down after warriors invade the peaceful village looking for slaves.  Men are either killed or taken prisoner, women are raped and then either murdered or taken prisoner, and children are abandoned to their fate.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a nearby pit, but their lifeline is cut by one of the invaders.  As Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers are marched away in bondage, he vows to return and save his small family.<br /><br />What ensues is a slow march to hell.  The slavers trek through jungle, across mountains, ford mighty rivers, and eventually end up at a massive Mayan city.  Gibson and his team create a nightmare city of wondrous architecture build on the blood of slaves.  This is not the "Gone With the Wind" vision of slavery, with noble slaves toiling more or less willingly on gorgeous pastureland.  "Apocalypto" shows slavery in all its horrors, up close and visceral.<br /><br />For all the city's might, the Mayan city suffers.  Disease and blight plague the city, and the rulers are trying to appease their sun-god with human sacrifices . . . which is the destiny of Jaguar Paw and his friends.  Gibson and his team linger on the morbid scene that is this sacrifice - ritual disembowelment following by ripping out of the beating heart of the victim, followed by decapitation.  While this is a scene of undeniable power, feel free to keep a napkin handy for the retching that may ensue.<br /><br />A solar eclipse temporarily saves Jaguar Paw's life and provides him the opportunity to escape back to save his family.  "Apocalypto" then turns into a long chase scene as the slavers hunt Jaguar Paw.  Again, these scenes are beautiful and powerful in their way, but again the unrelenting violence becomes a bit much as the body count continues to rise in various gruesome ways.<br /><br />The climax of "Apocalypto" is complex and unsettling.  Jaguar Paw may (or may not) win out in the end, but don't look for an equivalent of Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star here.  The title of the movie is appropriate, after all.<br /><br />Gibson has made an admirable movie with "Apocalypto" that will satisfy both action fans and history buffs.  Unfortunately, the violence quotient is so high that the most likely repeat viewers of "Apocalypto" are the same folks who delight in the recent spate of torture movies, such as "Hostel" or "The Devil's Rejects."</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson, as a filmmaker, is quite brilliant. Good actor, too. His tabloid rap means nothing to me when watching his films, as the films of Roman Polanski, Elia Kazan or Leni Riefenstahl. "Apocalypto" had me from the first frame, and I thought it was another fine film from a fine director. It's known that the Mayans had gruesome sacrificial rites, far worse than what Mr. Gibson portrayed. Still, brutal and abrasive behavior abounds regarding simple human beings who simply live to survive. Vengeance and escape are the centers of this film about a man who simply wants to go back to his family. Once he thinks everything can be happy, the Europeans arrive...and that's a whole different story. I believe Mel Gibson is an impassioned director, making film of unusual interest, and totally in command of his material. Authenticity is of utmost importance, and I commend him for this effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Whether or not you think this movie succeeds, rather depends on what you think Mel Gibson set out to do.  I tend to think he just wanted to make a darn good action movie, but in a setting we never see in movies - the Mayan culture.  If I am right, then he succeeded well, and warrants my 4 stars.<br />However, there is a little more in the movie that might suggest he was reaching for something more. The story is in two broad parts.  After an introduction to a bucolic life in the jungle with hunting and breeding the topics for discussion and frivolity, the movies real first part kicks off with a brutal attack on the village, and the survivors being taken away into slavery.  The only people left behind are our heroes wife and child, who remain trapped in a well unless he returns, giving our protagonist his motivation.  Thus the second part is the gruelling and cruel march to the Mayan city, which is almost like a Sodom and Gomorrah in its wickedness and depravity, the very essence of a city and culture in decay.  Our hero escapes from an apparently certain death, and the third part is a chase as he is hunted down, and he seeks to return to his family to rescue them.<br />It's all cannily put together as a whole, and also in its memorable if gory individual scenes.  The director's eye for a breathtaking shot is undeniable - I was reminded of the beauty of `The Mission' during the waterfall scene - not an unfair comparison in many ways.  The success of the movie is largely due to its script (ironically, given the subtitles) which really draws us in to the characters lives and makes us care at least a bit.  And for action, the final chase scene makes our hero something like Schwarzenegger in Predator as he uses the jungle against the city folk to great effect.<br />So a 4 or even 5 star action movie then?  Yes, but there is then that added ambiguous element - as set out in the opening quote referring to civilisation in decline, there are real similiarities, even in such an obscure scenario, to modern day.  Just enough to make you think about it if you want to, but not enough to hammer any point home.  The final few shots in particular are effective in tying up the movie in a slightly unexpected way.  In another unexpected and only lightly touched upon theme, the final third of the movie is foretold in a rather spooky scene, giving an oddly spiritual or supernatural element to an otherwise very visceral and down to earth story.<br />If he set out to make a message movie, then the movie only half succeeded - but as an action movie with the balls and cleverness to make you leave the cinema thinking?  Spot on.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson continues to explore bravery and cruelty of humans. You can describe the story of "Apocalypto" in this way, but the fact is his latest work as director is a very engrossing adventure tale in the tradition of "The Last of the Mohicans." The difference is this adventure tale is set against the background of the last days of Mayan civilization; and as in his Oscar-winning "Braveheart," "Apocalypto" comes with lots of violence.<br /><br />The story revolves around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), his beloved wife Seven and young son, and the villagers living peacefully in the rainforest. One day his village is attacked by the merciless soldiers sent from the plague-infected city, where the captured men and women are brought for the purpose you have already guessed. Jaguar Paw knows he must come back home before the next rain falls because his wife (who is pregnant) and child are trapped in the bottom of a dried well, and he does it no matter what it takes.<br /><br />The story itself is rather conventional, but the way it is presented is unique. All the dialogues are spoken in the Mayan language, and most of the cast are non-professionals without previous experience as actor. The cinematography is by Dean Semler ("Dances with the Wolves"), but the shooting is mostly done digitally by HD camera. But you wouldn't mind all these things once the film starts to roll and tell its story about Jaguar Paw and the warriors chasing him in the jungle.<br /><br />As to the film's content, it is true that there is violence in the film (like the execution scene of "Braveheart"), but it must be also pointed out that Mel Gibson does not make it gratuitous and excessive. Of course all these things depend on every viewer's sensitivity and certainly this film is not made for pre-teens, but Gibson avoids too direct descriptions of murders, rapes and decapitations.<br /><br />The production designs are amazing to see, but I am not sure of the historical accuracy of the customs of Mayan people or the streets and buildings of the city. I cannot judge that part. But I am sure this is an exciting, well-told adventure story that will keep you absorbed in the world unknown.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>'Apocalypto' starts out with a peaceful setting.  Men from an isolated tribe are out on a hunt, bantering with each other as they track and kill their game.  One character that stands out is Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), an elder and father to young Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  Their peaceful, homey village is shattered early the next morning when raiders arrive, to burn, pillage, and destroy the village while taking captives.<br /><br />Young Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son down a deep sink-hole before battling and succumbing to the raiders.  Men and women alike are strapped to poles and herded through the jungle like livestock, into the vast Mayan city.  Along the way a young girl shouts out prophesies to the raiders, of a dark day and a jaguar.<br /><br />The city is truly a cinematograph wonder.  There are scenes depicting the slaves that built the Mayan pyramids, slave markets, merchants, vendors, and of course the high religious pyramid where the rulers lounge in luxury watching the sacrifices to the Gods.  Jaguar Paw escapes becoming a sacrifice by a solar eclipse.  But the Mayans still intend to make sport of him and his fellow villagers.  When Jaguar Paw manages to escape, the movie gives a chase scene not soon to be forgotten.  Jaguar Paw needs to make it back to his wife and son before the rains start, and with a pack of raiders on his tail, the going is tough.<br /><br />Many other movies are bloodier while depicting less implied violence.  The violence implied in 'Apocalypto' by the Mayan ceremonies is brutal.  There are a couple of 'dig the heart out of the chest' scenes, plus one Tarantino-Style blood spurting scene, but overall the gore was controlled in measure to the violence.  Also, many modern movies employ chase scene just as intense as Jaguar Paw's flight from the raiders, but the atmosphere of Mayan culture and the primitive weapons and fighting techniques make this chase scene unique.<br /><br />The photography is stunning, and the actors, while unknowns, are remarkable.  The entire movie is spoken in Mayan and subtitled in English (you can also choose French or Spanish), but even if you aren't fond of subtitles you should still check out the movie, the action outweighs the dialogue.  This is a visually beautiful movie with plenty of plot and action, though the plot is an old one the presentation is new.  A solid 4.5 stars.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Love him or loathe him, Mel Gibson can make some damn good movies. BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in. Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!)<br /><br />Because of Mel's idiotic comments of late, many have seen fit (perhaps rightfully so) to boycott his films. I know I avoided seeing this one until it came out on DVD, a mini-boycott on my part for Mr. Gibson's poor politics and social skills. But the visuals on the trailers kept beckoning me to check out Apocalypto, and so I finally broke down and rented it.<br /><br />It is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story. Although The Passion had its anti-Jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed. If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.<br /><br />The sets, the dress, the make-up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue-yourself-to-the-screen experience. Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.<br /><br />***SPOILER WARNING***<br /><br />The story is about Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the future leader of a small band of people that live on the outskirts of the great Mayan culture. He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid "in the oven." He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment. Until one day he and his tribe are ripped apart by beastly slave-gatherers. Realizing that he must hide his pregnant wife and son, Jaguar Paw lowers them into a deep pit for safe keeping during the slave runners attack. Caught, bound, and forced to march miles, Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen are brought to a great Mayan temple where they are to be sacrificed. But as Jaguar Paw's turn comes, a solar eclipse occurs and Jaguar and his remaining band are spared a barbarous beheading.<br /><br />But it ain't over yet.<br /><br />Taken to an open stadium, he and his surviving tribesfolk are told to run toward a field of corn as spears, rocks and other projectiles are hurled at them. At the end of the path, too, is a "finisher", the son of the head slave trader who kills off any of those who are wounded. Jaguar Paw, desperate to get back to his wife and child, kills the young finisher and escapes into the jungle. But the king of the slave-gatherers wants Jaguar Paw's blood for killing his son. And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country. Not only is Jaguar Paw running from the slave men, he's also running toward his beloved wife and kid in a race to save them before they either starve to death, get injured, or are drowned by flash-flood rains.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />It is amazing that none of the main actors, supporting actors, or extras have any previous film history (at least not any significant history, really), yet they all played their parts perfectly. Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre-busting thrill ride. Not only is it a pseudo-historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure. Rolling all of those concepts into one film is often impossible, but Apocalypto isn't forced nor overly drawn. It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).<br /><br />The make-up consisted of nearly 70 artists who had to re-tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task. And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head-dresses and eye to detail (I feel she was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination due to this film's affiliation with Mr. Gibson).<br /><br />So if you're thinking about watching this but don't like Mel Gibson personally, I totally understand. But you might try it anyway. It is one fantastic piece of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Superb and breathtaking. Let's be clear. First of all 75% of all Maya inscriptions we know have not yet been deciphered and all we have on these Indians is one thousandth of what we would need to know just a little bit about the way these Indians lived, what's more thought. The vanity of those who say some details are wrong is absurd, especially since the cinema is not a tool to tell the truth but the art of complete illusion. A false detail can only be the drop that will make the bitter-minded overflow and the straw that will break the backs of the growling grouchers. So let me not be avaricious about this film. It reaches some extraordinary magnitude and magnificence. The pictures are among the most beautiful you can imagine, be they of the forest, or of the crossing of the river, or of the waterfalls on the same river, or of the Maya city and its pyramid temples, or of the costumes of their priests, or of the gladiator games for final cynegetic execution. The action  itself is so well built that we get involved in it so intensely that we are in the body of the hunted one, without remission, without any relapse. And yet a long slow phase enables the viewer to contemplate the simple life spiritually full with tales and legends in a village in the midst of the rain forest. It is not an anthropological film, but at this level it is a film that wants to introduce us into a completely unknown setting and it succeeds marvellously, be it the physical setting or be it the spiritual and mental setting. The way Gibson uses the face expressivity of his actors, all of them amateurs though, to tell more than half of the psychological and emotional density and even passions of his characters and situations is outstanding. Some say the story is held up with pieces of strings like an eclipse that comes just when necessary. But we mustn't forget that life is only held up by such pieces of string and that simple events like a train that does not run may change the destiny of thousands of people. Life is nothing but the result of haphazard and unforeseeable whims from our environment. Some also protest against this ? hollywoodian ? film without telling us what it means. The film was entirely shot in Mexico exclusively using non-professional actors from an ethnic group so far never seen on the silver screen before, entirely in their language, the modern form of Maya, and entirely subtitled. These are elements that can be considered as perfectly anti-hollywoodian. If it is the spectacular show that is at stake, then many other films, like Besson's Purple Rivers, are nothing but hollywoodian films. And then what ? The most serious critics say that Mel Gibson is pondering on the fate of civilizations when they reach their final phase of self-destruction. It's both proper viewing and false understanding. It is the minimum discourse that we can see in these absurd human sacrifices to make an eclipse come and go or to palliate several years of bad crops with self mutilation, cannibal self sacrifice, suicidal self-centered morbidity. It is in a way the official method to adjust the population to the means available for survival set in some grandiose and dramatic organization of the elimination of a fringe of overpopulation. And the whole process is supposed to be bringing the most intense pleasure to the participants. We can then compare this with all the executions of human beings in humanity still practiced here and there. The death penalty aims in the same way at purifying society through some ignominous and horrifying practice, rite or crime. Long live war, preemptive or not ! But we would miss, if we stopped there, the great loop of symbolical and parabolical meaning that starts at the very beginning with the purchasing of the right to cross the forest with the exchange of three fish against one tapir leg, then the pregnant woman who must run away from killers and be saved from a flood, to finally end with the reunification of the primary family and its two sons who go back into the forest to start all over again from scratch while another ferocious band of invaders is arriving who will be just as blood-thirsty as the local one for unaccaptable reasons that have been explained and exposed in many books of the time. Adam and Eve leave with Abel and Cain to reinvent life. But the human curse is looming high in the two brothers and the myth they are rerferring to. Here Mel Gibson tells us humanity is nothing but a long history of horrors that constantly repeats itself. Only the forms and the dressings may change.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A quite original film by Mel Gibson and perhaps one of the only films portraying the lives of the Maya.  Although a somewhat uncomplicated plot, the original setting,  costumes, and acting, make this film worth watching.<br /><br />The plot is rather formulaic in that it revolves around a captured man attempting to flee his captors and to save his family.  The film is original in that it is set in the Mayan civilization just before the Columbian period and the language is entirely in a Maya dialect.  The cinematography is excellent and the anthropological representations fairly accurate.  The focus of the Mayan civilization's moral decline seems to be a computer recreation of the great city of Tikal which was very well done.  The depictions of human sacrifice were pretty graphic but essentially a fair representation of Meso-American rituals and world views.  The film carries the suspense pretty well all the way through.  Overall, the screenplay was decent, the cinematography excellent, as well as the direction and editing.<br /><br />This was a great film and another accomplishment by Mel Gibson.  This film's results at the box office seem more the result of Mel's anti-semitic faux pas of the time than anything else and shouldn't discourage viewers from renting it on the presumption that the film was bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Apocolypto was quite good - a movie you cannot look away from - full of action, suspense, brilliant on-location filming.. So what's missing? Well, that is all it has.. the only reason it is good is because it hides behind action.. the characters are supposed to mean a lot to us.. but 99% of the time they only mean a lot to us because they are in danger because they are about to be seriously injured.. this is a technique that is excellent in horror films but if we are expecting a drama or even an intelligent suspense film we want a little more..<br /><br />But enough of my quibbles, mel gibson deserves a great deal of credit for using the original language and for using the people of mexico and for the authentic costumes and all of that jazz... Nevertheless, like most of gibson's films it is essentially adrenaline.. no time for plot... no time for acting.. you are on the run..and you can't look away (this is the type of thing that endangers truly great movie-making.. big budget all action films)...</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" paid a terrible price at the Oscars for its creator's big drunken mouth. No other explanation works. This is, at all technical and crafts levels, an astounding, state-of-the-art movie.<br /><br />Too bad Gibson's ballistic movie couldn't have had one more brief run in theaters, as a last call for fools like me who missed it last year. The film should seen on a big screen. Nonetheless, Buena Vista's single-disc presentation hits all the marks technically. The extras feel pretty skimpy here considering the wild tales about the production down in the jungles of Mexico and the historical potency of its subject matter. No doubt the DVD double-dip is straight ahead via some kind of multidisc collectors set.<br /><br />Gibson's commentary, done with and co-writer Farhad Safinia, has its moments but it's obvious little or no prep time went into that recording. Mostly they gossip about the native actors (some of whom had never seen a movie) and chat about what happened when they filmed this or that scene.<br /><br />The adventure, about Mayan villagers taken into slavery by city-dwellers, has taken heat for one of its historically inaccurate elements. More troubling for casual viewers could be the ridiculous deus ex machina devices that keep things moving along. But nothing waits for logic once the film's great chase gets under way, with a band of warriors in hot pursuit of a resourceful young villager. The movie feels like half of its 139 minute running time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Apocalypto takes us back to the Americas right before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492.  The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.<br />The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />The setting (!), the dialogues, the language (!), the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, Apocalypto is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>APOCALYPTO(2006) Written, Produced and Directed by Mel Gibson.

It is a film about the decline of the Mayan civilization, tribes attacking other tribes, brutal violence, gore, human sacrifice, and primitive warfare - usually involving a lot of death.  There are several Latinas and Latinos in this film (some were genuine Mayan people), along with over 700 extras, with a lot of careful emphasis on realism during the making of the film.  The jungle scenes and sets used were in Mexico, and right down to the last detail it is obvious the amount of effort invested in wardrobe, make-up, and even the Mayan language used in the film was heavily researched to be as authentic as possible.  With a budget of over $ 40 mil, this DVD movie impresses nearly any audience willing to watch a film with subtitles (anybody in the viewing audience translate original Mayan?).  There are lots of lovely women who share their assets with the camera, however, this film makes such an effort at realism that it doesn't seem like gratuitous exploitation eye candy just for the sake of the rating.  I'm guessing the R-rating is mostly for the violence and gore.  Although some of the plot is predictable, I give this 5 stars for keeping me watching without using the FF button on the remote, even though I've seen it three times.  This DVD has a "making of" type extra on it, and the widescreen film presentation is clear, great sound, and perfect color.  The subtitles are tastefully done, and seem to match (as far as I can tell) with the scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A Mayan forest village lives happily and harmoniously, except the mean teasing of Blunted's inability to sire. When terrified refugees pass, the chief forbids the hunting party to 'spead fear', but the real cause soon follows. Their own community is pillaged, the survivors cruelly enslaved and dragged away. The chief's proud son Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and toddler son, but in an unsafe place. The men are destined for bloody sacrifice to the gods in the raider kingdom's pestilence-stricken capital. An 'auspicious' solar eclipse renders their number superfluous, but the raiders' captain orders them killed as target practice. Jaguar Paw survives, killing the captain's son, and may now incarnate an apocalyptic prophecy or still perish without saving his family, while another danger looms unseen. Apocalypto delivers a rush that does not let up. Brilliant images unlike any showcased in a movie, flash across the screen with dizzying speed. This movie features scene after scene that hits the perfect note, which is always a high-pitched one filled with tension. Apocalypto is the perfect action movie, punctuating its frenzy of activity with beautiful and surprising images. I'm overwhelmed by the experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Even with all the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson last year (and doesn't it seem as if each new week brings another celebrity meltdown?), I still looked forward to seeing "Apocalypto."  Why?  If for no other reason--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.  Films of this nature generally go into limited distribution to develop an audience and critical word of mouth before expanding, if they ever do.  But with Gibson at the helm, "Apocalypto" debuted with much fanfare and backing just in time to be considered for 2006's Academy Awards.  For some reason, though, I still missed "Apocalypto" at the theaters.  I have heard every description imaginable from those that have seen the film--from the "best movie ever" to "excessively violent and disturbing."  And while I wouldn't go to either of those extremes, "Apocalypto" is certainly an accomplished adventure picture.<br /><br />Set in ancient Mayan times, "Apocalypto" is essentially the harrowing journey of one man, a youth named Jaguar Paw (a convincing Rudy Youngblood).  Living a simple and isolated existence, his tribe are very at home within the forest.  One day, the unthinkable happens.  They are attacked by another group with apparent intentions of enslaving whomever they don't kill.  Youngblood's wife and son are stranded in an underground well, many others are murdered, and Youngblood is among a dozen or so who are rounded up and marched out in bondage.  The subsequent journey leads to a fantastical temple sequence, where it becomes clear that the prisoners are not to become slaves--but sacrifices.  The remainder of the film deals with how Youngblood can escape this situation.  The temple scenes feature a cast of thousands, ritualistic and brutal slayings, and a mob mania that is terrifying and believable.  Racing against the clock to save his wife, Youngblood must escape back through the jungle--where all he has to help him are his cunning and an almost spiritual connection to his surroundings.  The action is practically nonstop, it's inventive, and it is beautifully staged.  Much of "Apocalypto," therefore, is absolutely riveting and wildly entertaining.<br /><br />For the purists who will debate the film's historical accuracy, I will neither deny or confirm the legitimacy of the events that transpire within "Apocalypto."  While there do seem to be some liberties taken with the historical timeline (as evidenced by a surprise in the ending--which I enjoyed despite its implausibility), I really don't think that this film aspires to be a "historical document."  Gibson has made an adventure story using a Mayan backdrop.  The feel and look of his picture stay as valid as possible to the timeframe, however, I never interpreted this picture as a "true" story.  Guess what?  Fictional liberties are taken in every motion picture.  Otherwise every motion picture would be a documentary--and even documentaries have an angle or slant which make them less than "true" in many cases.  "Apocalypto," at heart, is an effective action picture that makes interesting use of its Mayan setting.<br /><br />I guess "Apocalypto" is not for the squeamish--however, the violence depicted is by no means unusual by modern film standards.  You can see much worse in today's "torture" cinema, those films that pass for horror with current audiences.  I suppose what makes "Apocalypto" more vivid is that the violence is in a believable context.  There are some beheadings and some hunting scenes, but the brutality is intrinsic to the story "Apocalypto" is telling.  I don't believe serious minded filmgoers will be put off by seeing some savagery depicted in a film about ancient Mayan cultures--it's not as if this is a Merchant/Ivory production with tea parties and witty banter.<br /><br />I do recommend "Apocalypto."  Beautifully filmed, the technical merits of the film are beyond reproach.  The cinematography, score, and editing all enhance this exciting tale.  I imagine these elements really shone bright for those who saw this on the big screen. A great action picture that is for adults--check it out.

The first part of this film is the most unconventional but also hard to endure as only bad things seem to happen to the characters but once Act II arrives and the chase begins, grab on !. I can't remmember the last time a film had my stomach in knotts like this one.<br />Some people here in Mexico have complained about the film's historical accuracy since by the time the Spanish arrived in America, the Mayan civilization had already been taken over by other groups. In any case, Hollywood films are not the best way to learn about history.<br />When Braveheart came out over 10 years ago I remmember a friend telling me: "who would have thought Mel Gibson was a real director", 2 films later he keeps surprising me with his directing skills. It's too bad the public has let themselves be convinced by the media that he's the most evil person to ever come out of Hollywood which is absurd. I guess they feel the more they discredit him the more they discredit "The Passion of the Christ".<br />Great work Mel !</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Apocalypto `s main merit resides in the original treatment which received this story placed in the Maya era. The film was planned according the classic patterns of a symphony of just three movements. The First one is the warmth Adagio where the viewer realizes the rituals and customs of a pacific tribe, and a casual encounter with a foreign tribe, the second movement has to do with the violent scenes of fight and defeat of the pacific tribe, whose leader: "Jaguar paw" will undertake the epic challenge to survive along the dynamic final movement And through the first two movements everything is OK, but the febrile human chase along the last third of movie is what it deserves the jewel of the crown. Shocking sequences and chilling fact will happen that will hold fixed to your seat.

There's lots of hand-to-hand combat that doesn't spare the viewer any gory details.  If you happen to like that type of directing and action -- I know *I* do -- then this is a great movie for you.  Cinematography is superb, sets are lavish, and everyone is in top form.  It's just a well-crafted picture, top to bottom.<br /><br />One other thing.  For me, the subtext of this movie was not so much about the ending of one world -- an apocalypse -- by invasion from another.  The subtext is also not about how morally decayed civilizations are ripe for destruction from outside.  No, for me it's much more personal.  This is something I would've missed when I was younger but is obvious now.  The most important subtext of this movie is "What would you do for your family"?  The answer is, of course, Anything.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson is obviously a controversial filmmaker. It is nearly impossible to avoid addressing that here but I'm going to try really hard. Suffice to say, Apocalypto is a very violent and brutal film that portrays the Mayan civilization in a way that troubles some Anthropologists. None of that really matters to most viewers though and I'm here to tell you that most viewers will find that this movie is about as intense and compelling as you can get.<br /><br />Apocalypto is two kinds of action sub-genres mended together in an amazing setting that most viewers will find authentic. It is an action chase film smattered with revenge elements typical of a Gibson movie. Apocalypto opens like Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, with no credits and instead a quotation alluding to the theme of a civilization in decline. The quote is from historian Will Durant and states: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." The civilization in this movie is the ancient Mayan civilization and there is a genuine attempt at convincing the audience we are watching from a time machine. Again, like The Passion of the Christ, Gibson refuses to use English and instead goes with Yucatec Mayan, which may or may not be exactly what these people spoke but I have to applaud Gibson for doing this. I can tell you one thing, it hooked me in a lot more than English would have and helped me delve a little deeper and go back in time a little more efficiently than most historical depictions by a long shot. I didn't need my imagination at all. I can't say enough about Gibson's ability to get his audience into the hearts and minds of his characters and their settings. We also get a relatively unknown but talented cast of Native Americans, which itself serves to accentuate the film's authenticity as we have no prior references to the actors' faces.<br /><br />Apocalypto, in perspective, runs as a political parallel and comments on a civilization in decline. However, like most action films, it focuses on one protagonist as we root for his survival and safe resolution to his goals. His name is Jaguar Paw and he is a Mayan man with a young son and a pregnant wife. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that he ends up having an improbably horrendous few days. He and his friends get a good look at how the Mayan civilization is in decline from greed, disease, self-destruction, failed crops, slavery and of course human sacrifice...you will not forget the human sacrifice. This is hell on Earth but Jaguar Paw is up to the task and I couldn't help but root for him out loud on various occasions as I watched. That alone praises the film's passion. I bought into this movie entirely while watching it and it even prompted me to learn more and study the points of contention many people have with Gibson's depiction. A lot of movies that reference history can get folks thinking and whatever you may find in terms of truth, perhaps it is that provocation alone makes Apocalypto effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>"Apocalypto," not "Braveheart," was the film for which Mel Gibson should have won an Oscar. Whatever you may think of Gibson as a man, he shows himself in "Apocalypto" to be an extraordinarily daring, extraordinarily gifted writer-director.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is as grand, expansive and panoramic as anything Cecil B. DeMille ever attempted, meticulously recreating the Mayan culture and civilization of the 16th century at the exact moment before the Spaniards arrived. But in its narrative sweep, intensity, realism, and sense of tragedy, "Apocalypto" leaves DeMille in the dust. There is nothing stilted about "Apocalypto;" you feel you are really there, living the anguish of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a jungle hunter and warrior, as he tries to flee from a cruel Mayan death squad and reunite with his pregnant wife and small son.<br /><br />This being a Mel Gibson film, be warned that the level of violence in "Apocalypto" is very high, and Jaguar Paw comes in for a LOT of punishment. Nevertheless, once you have seen "Apocalypto," you will never forget it. It deserves to be ranked among the classic cinematic epics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Here you can see Gibson's vision of the Mayan kingdom as it faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices.

Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desperate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life. Though the film has historical inaccuracies, it does show the behavior that caused its decline.

The film does not name the culture portrayed, though I have heard some refer to it as Mayan, but it strikes me as very "Aztec" in its depiction. By that, I mean that there is plenty of gore, cruelty and human sacrifice.<br />The story is of a fairly rural village that is happy enough and getting by. One morning they awake to find that they are being raided by a war party from the "big city". Most of the adults are captured and led off into slavery in the big city. For the women, slavery means servitude. For the men, it is much less pleasant.<br />The men find themselves painted blue and taken to the top of a large pyramid where the local priests are systematically sacrificing them, cutting out their hearts to burn on an altar, lopping off the heads and sending the corpses to tumble down the steps for the amusement and nourishment of the locals.

The Oscar-winning Braveheart (1995) was a good but historically inaccurate film while The Passion of the Christ (2004) was brutal and caused outrage with some accusations of Anti-Semitism. With Apocalypto Gibson left himself open to further debate in his depiction of the Maya civilization in decline just before the arrival of the Spanish colonists, first spearheaded by Christopher Columbus.<br /><br />In terms of the story Apocalypto is very simple with the visuals and action being given more prominence than the plot. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is part of a peaceful Maya tribe living deep in the jungle when his people are attacked by raiders, tying up their victims to be marched through the harsh terrain to their majestic city where a Maya King awaits. Jaguar Paw manages to hide his heavily pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and young son Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez) before being captured by the raiders, led by the ruthless but at times merciful Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo). After being taken to the Maya City, the women are sold as slaves while Jaguar Paw and the rest of the men are put forward to be sacrificed. When it is Jaguar Paw's turn an eclipse suddenly covers the sun and the Maya onlookers are in fear but a priest assures those gathered that they have appeased the sun god Kukulkan and there is no further need for sacrifice. Jaguar Paw and the other men are sent to be killed but Jaguar Paw manages to escape and begins a perilous journey home to his family with Zero Wolf and a band of warriors in hot pursuit.<br /><br />With a very basic story being offered to the audience we are left to rely on some impressive visuals, sweeping panoramic shots of the jungle, waterfalls and then the devastated terrain surrounding the Mayan city that Jaguar Paw and the rest of his village are marched towards. The Meso-American landscape is simply breathtaking and the Mayan city with the temple perched atop a seemingly endless stairway is magnificent to behold. Gibson sensibly opted to have Apocalypto use Yucatec Maya dialogue with English subtitles which makes for a more authentic experience. We are given an insight into Mayan culture with methods of hunting, worship of gods, sense of humour and practical jokes, and finally brutal warfare all being prevalent throughout the two hours.<br /><br />The film's opening with Jaguar Blood joining his father, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), and a group of hunters in the pursuit of a tapir has an inevitable outcome and leaves little to the imagination. Apocalypto does have scenes that some audiences may find difficult to watch. Zero Wolf's raid at the outset is organised but cruel as families are separated with children being left behind. Adults are clearly the only ones of any worth when it comes to slavery and human sacrifice. Jaguar Paw immediately gets on the wrong side of the vicious Middle Eye (Gerardo Taracena) who is eager to kill the film's hero only to be stopped by Zero Wolf. In response Middle Eye makes a show of killing Jaguar Paw's father instead. Middle Eye's violent nature shows no sign of relenting particularly in the journey to the Maya city where he watches a group of slaves, including Jaguar Paw, almost be dragged from a cliff by one wounded and exhausted Maya slave. Middle Eye simply waits to see if the quartet of slaves can haul themselves back to the surface and when they do he cuts the wounded Maya loose and hurls him from the cliff. His actions earn a fierce reprimand from Zero Wolf but no further action is taken. Human sacrifice is also unpleasant in Apocalypto with hearts being removed followed by beheadings and torsos thrown down stairways. This element of the film has been frowned upon for the Aztecs were said to be purveyors of mass sacrifice while the Maya performed it on a minimal scale. Finally, Jaguar Paw's chance of escape comes when two slaves are released at a time by Zero Wolf and told to run towards a field of corn and beyond that the dense jungle. While the Maya slaves run for freedom, Zero Wolf and his men proceed to use them as target practice! Jaguar Paw escapes this fate but is wounded in the process and endures a horrific journey home with Zero Wolf, Middle Eye and a handful of other hunters close behind.<br /><br />The lack of a major storyline is a negative point to Apocalypto but the fighting is brutal but excellent in its execution. The performances are all very good as well and even with a somewhat predictable ending it still leaves a bittersweet taste. Gibson found himself in the midst of controversy again with Apocalypto with depictions of the Maya said to contain many inaccuracies. The Maya are somewhat one dimensional, simply hunters and warriors, whereas in history they were great innovators as well, somewhat lacking in the film. The arrival of the Spanish is said to put the film's events in history around 1502, Columbus' fourth expedition to America but this is also said to be far from the truth. Delving into the facts does hinder a film. I found that with Braveheart after reading two biographies about William Wallace and I know the same is true of Apocalypto. Like Braveheart, Apocalypto will always be frowned on for historical inaccuracy but some elements ring true and a good film is still to be found beneath the controversy.<br /><br />Apocalypto is lacking in a major storyline but the insight into Mayan culture is fascinating. It's violent in places but remains enthralling throughout and the final segment of the film with Jaguar Paw being pursued through the jungle is an exciting cat and mouse chase which is brought to an end in very surprising fashion. Uncompromising but good in equal measure, Apocalypto has much to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson as a person, his film Apocalypto (2006) is truly an example of superb storytelling, and the realization of a vision to bring to the screen a period piece involving the Mayan culture, that is epic in scale, and brutally realistic, as a marauding band of warriors raids the jungle and gathers slaves.<br /><br />Set somewhere in the jungles of Central America, the movie's cast speak an archaic language, wear authentic attire, and use ancient tools and weapons.  Tattoos, scarification, piercing, and the insertion of objects into parts of the body, particularly the nose and ear lobe, were part of the Mayan culture, and a large crew of makeup artists, was employed to give the huge cast an authentic look.  Unfolding in stages, the story immediately draws you in, and is largely a learning experience, for those unfamiliar with the Mayan culture.  The acting performances are amazingly natural, and there are few instances where you don't feel that what you are seeing isn't real.  The pacing is brisk, and the story is told in a manner that feels like events are happening almost in real time.<br /><br />Events are centered on a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the son of Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), one of the leaders of a tribe living in the jungle.  With the goal of capturing alive as many of the adults as possible, a group of warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), and his lieutenant Middle Eye (Gerardo Teracena), attack Jaguar Paw's tribe.  The struggle is furious, brutal, and heartbreaking, as the film brilliantly captures the pure panic, naked fear, and cruel violence, as the tribe is overrun, struggles to resist, and is overcome by the superior force.<br /><br />During the fray, Jaguar Paw manages to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and his son into a deep pit, where they barely escape detection.  After watching his father leave on the journey to great beyond, Jaguar Paw and his fellow prisoners are bound together, and forced to trek through the jungle, abandoning the children of the village to fend for themselves.  Eventually they reach a great city, where the women are sold as slaves, and the men are forced to climb to the top of a massive ziggurat, where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place.  To appease the god Kukulkan, prisoners are held down, and their hearts are cut out.  The men are then beheaded, and their bodies flung down to crash the bottom.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is on the altar, on the verge of meeting this fate, when a solar eclipse occurs.  Taken as a sign that the deity has been satisfied, Jaguar Paw and the remaining prisoners are spared, and taken to sandy field.  In pairs, they are given a chance to run to freedom, dodging the spears and arrows of the enemy warriors.  Killing one of Zero Wolf's sons, a wounded Jaguar Paw manages to escape into the jungle, pursued by Zero Wolf and a group of warriors.  The last act of the film features Jaguar Paw in a transcendental journey, as he runs for his life, and attempts to save his family.<br /><br />In regard to sets, costumes, language, and culture, Apocalypto goes to great lengths, attempting to be realistic.  Combined with some remarkably convincing acting performances, and often brutal action scenes, and you may find yourself drawn quite deeply into this unfamiliar, and often violent world, which is very close to nature.  Apocalypto is a compelling and often shocking saga, that makes a sincere attempt to explore and pay respect to an ancient culture, while telling a poignant, tragic, and thrilling story.  There are some very rough moments, but if you persevere, you may discover a new appreciation for the simple things in life, that you might have taken for granted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Apocalypto' follows a mayan tribe after a group of marauders sweep in and capture village members for slaves and human sacrifices. Shot entirely in the Yucatec dialect and with subtitles, this lends some authenticity to the story and in no way detracts from the rollercoaster ride this film takes you on. There are touching scenes of family life that are quickly shattered by extreme and brutal violence and some of these scenes are quite graphic in places. The various actors play their roles superbly and Gibson's direction is as flawless as ever. Say what you will about the man, he has artistic vision if nothing else. The score is composed by James Horner and you my recognise the discordant pipe sounds also used in Braveheart at various tension filled moments in this film and the overall score is understated and spare. The colours really immerse you in this film, rich ochre's and earth tones, vivid blues of the sacrificial paint and muted jade all combine to create a palate of beauty that add a great deal to the overall feel. The story will keep you gripped for the 2 ? hour length and it doesn't feel anywhere near as long as this, once you connect to the characters and are in the story, you're hooked and completely engrossed. Despite the negative press around Gibson that inevitably coloured the hype around this film, this is a solidly directed and acted film and is well worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>The violence is a bit much and is the only reason why its not a 5 star for me.  I could hardly sit still through most of it.  It's definately high octane and loaded with suspense.  The visuals are great, wonderful directiion.  Whatever you might think of Gibson, one thing is clear: he's a wonderful filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Mad Mel's Apocalypto turns out not to be quite the splatter movie it was painted by feint-hearted critics still reeling from all the welts in The Passion. Instead it's The Naked Prey revisited with slight hints of Kings of the Sun and even Rapa Nui, though rather than telling his story from the perspective of the Mayans he chooses to play down the spectacle and see it through the eyes of their intended sacrificial victims. The story is surprisingly slight - peaceful tribe get captured as human sacrifices for Mayan priests to appease their gods, only for one to make a run for freedom and the trapped wife and child he left behind - but he manages to instil it with more substance than you might expect without hitting you over the head with it. There's an ecological message about impending disaster, but unlike any of those touchy-feely New Age types, there's no imaginary native wisdom on display here: the Mayan civilisation may be an ancient one, but here it's every bit as stupid as its modern-day equivalents, blindly destroying itself and their environment, bringing plague and devastation as they destroy their depleting natural resources, distracting the people with a non-stop conveyer belt of bloody sacrifices. These are savage times, and the film's spectacular centrepiece in the Mayan city doesn't stint on the gore. Yet at the same time the characters are recognisable - they tell dirty stories, play practical jokes and B.S. each other as they get on with their lives. Even the raiding party are little different from a group of modern-day buddies on a fishing trip.<br /><br />With Gibson beginning his film with the same Will Durant quote that ended The Fall of the Roman Empire - `a great civilisation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within' - it's clear that he's informed by Sixties epics as more than he is by Herzog's nutters in the jungle. Indeed, while he may eschew the Scope format he even shoots the Mayan city in the classic Anthony Mann style, discarding the big establishing shot but choosing instead to gradually reveal it as the characters are drawn into it, saving the big money shots for the end of the sequence. As a result, it's a much more convincing and layered depiction of its world and its many social levels than you'd expect for something other directors might have thrown away as a simple background walk-through.<br /><br />Yet after the spectacle, the film scales itself down again as it goes back to basics, and while it's not exactly an anti-climax, it's this section that keeps the film from being more than just pretty good. The big chase lacks the imagination and power of The Naked Prey (which also has the advantage of a much tighter running time), keeping the film at the level of just another survival-of-the-smartest action adventure. It's not bad, but it doesn't hold many surprises, going through many of the traditional means of disposing of your enemies that the movies have been offering since Leslie Banks stalked The Most Dangerous Game back in 1932, though Gibson does throw in a great "There goes the neighbourhood" punchline. He's also blessed with a couple of striking villains in the Wes Studi-like form of Raoul Trujillo as the chief manhunter Zero Wolf and Gerardo Taracena as the cocky sadist of the team, Middle Eye.<br /><br />While it's certainly the best-looking digitally shot feature to date, there are still some problems - with digital's persistent problems with catching high-speed motion, it's not the best idea to shoot a chase movie in digital even if you do have a cinematographer as good as Dean Semler, and some shots are distractingly subpar even on a small screen.<br /><br />It's interesting but not entirely surprising that the not exactly overloaded with extras DVD (just a commentary, half-hour making of and 35-second deleted scene) doesn't include the film's trailer, since looking at it after seeing the film it's clearly not only made up of footage that doesn't even appear in the film - mainly makeup, wardrobe and camera test footage - but it even seems to include a different leading man and a very different look for its native characters and even the Mayan city.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Wow.  Captivating as this film was, I could have watched it with no translation of the dialogue and I still would have known everything that was happening.  Such was the power of collective consciousness that it conveyed, however incongruent to history it may be.  The cinematography is beautiful and the hunter vs hunted plot engaging.  Calling on primal triggers and survivalistic instinct is at the core of the success of this film.  Yes, the costumes, jungle settings, buttocks, breasts, and "cultural" details are enthralling.  It is the power of tapping into collective memory and how we have formed our view of ancient heritage that is so astounding.  Is it very accurate?  Are the scenarios presented very likely?  I don't know.  Would anyone know?  Does it matter?  I was intensely curious about the language that was spoken and intend to do some more reading around that.  Given that, the film was provocative enough to make me dig deeper into understanding Mayan culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>The opening shot of Apocalypto is a nod and a wink to Coppola's opening gambit of Apocalypse Now: Coppola began with a silent shot of a tree line, broken only by the whirr of a helicopter as it passes through the frame. Gibson has the same, but substitutes the helicopter for a man racing across the screen in pursuit of a tapir. Gibson's new film has a lot in common with Coppola's, but Mel makes it even harder for the viewer to watch: his movie is in the ancient Mayan language. The director takes his sweet time shooting endless-but-beautiful shots of vegetation and, like the movies of those two auteurs, Apocalypto's plot is small, but everything surrounding it is on a massive, grandiose scale. The story follows Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), a hunter living a happy life deep in the jungle. After a warring tribe decimates his village and drags him back to their city to be offered to the Mayan gods as a sacrifice, he escapes and takes the fight to his captors. With Gibson's recent blatant Christian motives, Apocalypto's Christ allegories are thankfully kept to a minimum; but religion and its influence on civilization do play a massive part throughout. An epic - despite the severed heads, the torture, rape and brutal killings - hasn't looked this beautiful since Lawrence Of Arabia, while Youngblood, for an unknown, carries the film firmly on his shoulders.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>As more than one commentator has noted, in terms of plot APOCALYPTO seems to draw from the 1966 THE NAKED PREY, the 1932 THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the numerous films both have influenced over the years.  In this particular instance the story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose presumably peaceful village is destroyed by Mayans intent upon obtaining human sacrifice to appease their bloodthirty gods.  After a harrowing march to the Mayan city, Jaguar Paw escapes death--and the city, with a furious party of Myan warriors in hot pursuit.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, there is considerable bleed-over from Mel Gibson's 2004 THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST into the 2006 APOCALYPTO.  The two have often been compared in terms of violence, but the connection goes quite a bit deeper this; it is imbedded in the subtext of the film itself.  A forced march while tied to long poles; a prayer uttered by a woman that sounds suspiciously like a Mayan-language Hail Mary; a prophesy that warns about a man "reborn from mud and earth" who will "end your world;" and enough arrow and javelin wounds to slay Saint Sebastian himself several times over.  The ending is a bit of a quandary, certainly more open to interpretation than that of THE PASSION--but striking the same tone and tying all the subtextual imagery directly to the Roman Catholic Church.  And we need hardly mention the title of the film itself, a reference to the vision of St. John the Divine.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that, like THE PASSION, APOCALYPTO has a none too subtle point: the Mayans, at least as Gibson presents them (the film is riddled with historical inaccuracy, but I'll leave that argument to the scholars), are a corrupt society en route to self-destruction: they have stripped the land of its resources and their civilization has become unsustainable.  Given Gibson's own well-known religious sentiments, there is a certain irony in that the Mayans are driven into this by blindly-followed religious motives.  In any case, we are clearly intended to read the overall film as commentary of sorts on contemporary society's rape of the planet.<br /><br />Although I would give the dubious prize of "most violent" to THE PASSION, there is plenty to go around in APOCALYPTO--and, as in THE PASSION, it is not always of a viable nature.  I find it hard to believe that Jaguar Paw's tribe hunted with the horrifically lethal trap shown here; the Mayans were not as blood-thirsty as portrayed here (Gibson seems to have confused them with the Aztecs), and lot many of the rituals, weapons, and the game of "run for your life" itself, are highly speculative at best.  Even so, I cannot actually say that the violence or its graphic nature are implausible within the context of the film.<br /><br />What IS completely implausible is the amount of physical damage Jaguar Paw sustains without being mortally wounded.  He is dragged along in bondage, half hung by accident, escapes sacrifice by a fraction of a second, is shot through with an arrow, and all the rest--but like the old Timex Watch slogan, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking, seeming to run without pause for forty-eight hours, vaulting down a waterfall, and even getting clipped a time or two more, most often with scarcely a pause to wince.  But Gibson is fair about it: he endows Jaguar Paw's pursuers with the same absurdly improbable endurance and strength.<br /><br />Although it has its flaws--and what film doesn't?--the truly great thing about APOCALYPTO is the technical brilliance and artistic eye that Gibson and his team bring to the project.  It's visually dazzling, and Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler have knack for selecting one knock-out camera set up after another.  Everything from cast to costumes is truly amazing, and the film moves with tremendous speed.  One thing it isn't is dull.<br /><br />But it is extremely troubling.  In addition to THE PASSION, one might also compare it to the notorious 1979 CALIGULA, a film which so mingled sex and violence that both could be considered equally pornographic.  Although there's no visual sex at all--it is a subject Gibson tends to shy away from--APOCALYPTO has much the same effect.  The violence is essentially pornographic in nature, teasing us, leading us on to increasingly intense climaxes of blood and gore.  One has to wonder at the motives here, particularly when the producer-director-writer is so clearly trying to make a "save the world" statement; it seems to me that Gibson's visions are less a solution than part of the problem itself--and doesn't mind, as many scholars have noted, twisting historical fact in the process.  It would seem that Gibson is determined to have a personal marytdom by cinematic proxy.  It's all very problematic.<br /><br />The DVD quality is very fine and offers a commentary track by Gibson, et al and a making-of featurette.  Three stars for technical brilliance.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>If you only have time to watch one movie this week, this one should be your choice!

But sometimes love is stronger than hate, and Jaguar Paw puts his terror aside to get back to his pregnant wife and child hidden in an empty well in his village.

APOCALYPTO is the most harrowing, viscerally violent film I've seen outside of several Italian exploitation flicks and that opening sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. APOCALYPTO is an epic movie which narrates the savage adventures of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), in the waning age of the Mayan civilization - it tells of the disruption of Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers' simple existence as they are captured by an invasive war party and of Jaguar Paw's torturous journey back to his pregnant young wife and son as his captors mercilessly go on the chase.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO was strenuously filmed in the Mexican state of Veracruz and the rainforests of Catemaco; director Mel Gibson was conscientious about hiring a cast comprised entirely of native actors and, much like in the ambitious use of Aramaic in PASSION OF THE CHRIST, having them speak in Yucatec Maya (with English sub-titles), thus lending immense credibility and authenticity to the picture. The glory and savagery of the Mayan culture are in full depiction here as we are treated to majestic temples and pyramids rising up in cinematic grandeur, followed by intense, gory scenes of unhinged violence and vicious sacrifices (decapitations, eviscerations, bodies being pierced, and, in one brutal moment, a face being bit off by a jaguar - *yech*).<br /><br />Tinged with prophecy and doom and resplendent with truly spectacular cinematography, APOCALYPTO is also well served by the acting performances of the unknown cast. A standout, of course, is pow-wow singer and artist Rudy Youngblood, who  makes his acting debut here and boldly carries the film. Dalia Hernandez (Seven, Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife) also acts for the first time and acquits herself well. Raoul Trujillo, on the other hand, is an experienced actor who is appropriately fearsome as the leader of the Holcane warriors, Zero Wolf.<br /><br />The fully realized APOCALYPTO is guaranteed to transport the viewer back hundreds of years to an ancient culture, of which downfall has been cloaked in mystery and conjecture. It's quite an experience. Mel Gibson dips his hand once again in riveting myth-making. The first half of the film is punctuated by awesome world-building as Gibson delves into the Mayan culture, with particular emphasis on the ruling priesthood who insist that more and yet more sacrifices will stave off doom to their declining way of life. The last half of the movie, however, does devolve into basically an extended chase sequence, however harrowing and thrilling. That Jaguar Paw can sure take a licking.<br /><br />This film may be too intense and graphic for some viewers. Several of my friends thought APOCALYPTO too gratuitous in its violence but I feel that the graphic nature was required to drive Gibson's particular vision home. Else, this probably would've been reduced to being a watered-down cultural film. Think what you will of Mel Gibson, he is a great filmmaker who will not stint on his cinematic visions. And, in that purview, I do respect him. APOCALYPTO is unrelentingly violent, thought-provoking, dream-like at times, and truly majestic. And, for my money, it's a near-masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" glimpses into the past and provides us a telling commentary on the present. It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it). Jaguar Paw and his people are attacked and kidnapped to be used as sacrifices for the Mayan gods. It seems that as they have strip mined their own land to build greater temples, they've also caused famine, disease and death to take hold as well. Paw must escape to save his pregnant wife and son who were left behind and are hiding before it is too late.<br /><br />The second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's "The Naked Prey" and "The Most Dangerous Game" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes. You should be aware that the film is in ancient Mayan with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The film received an "R" rating for violence probably deserved given the graphic nature of the first half and last third of the film.<br /><br />The film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world; the Mayans (like today) end up destroying much of their world in pursuit of building larger monuments to their greatness and living out their fantasy as the pinnacle of modern civilization. The result is famine, deforestation, disease and death.<br /><br />The sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.  He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema--the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself. Gibson's ecological parable has a corker of an ending that comes totally out of left field (in fact Gibson in his commentary states that the film was originally build around this conclusion which was meant as something of a joke. Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds stunning. While the extras are somewhat meager (only a short documentary on the making of the film, a deleted scene and a commentary track by co-writer/director/co-producer Gibson with co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia)they aren't fluff. The documentary shows the challenge that Gibson and his crew faced in building many of the massive sets, providing make up for a large group of people and working largely with non-actors.<br /><br />Hopefully a deluxe edition will be in the pipeline at some point with some historical featurettes/documentaries. While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of "reality". This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself. Gibson doesn't get preachy in his message but just lays it out there while allowing his film to do the speaking for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Like any film, artistic license was taken in creating Mel Gibson's epic "Apocalypto" .  However, this one is different.  Gibson somehow succeeded in making and distributing a film that does much more than just entertain.  From the opening scene, the moviegoer is transported to an alien world that most have next to no knowledge of.  The Maya civilization is brought to life, complete with believable characters, incredible costumes and magnificent architecture.<br /><br />It is obvious that Gibson and his production crew did their homework.<br /><br />Archaelogical evidence confirms that the Maya did indeed perform grisly sacrifice on a very large scale, as the film so graphically portrays.  It is also well known that the Maya were more advanced in astronomy than any European civilization of the day; their calendar needed no leap year.<br /><br />"Apocalyto" is no dry historical drama.  It is well written, with fully fleshed characters.  The fact that this film holds the viewer's interest is all the more amazing when one considers the fact that there is not a single word of English in the entire film.  Like many good movies with subtitles, the story is so enthralling that after a time one forgets about the writing at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />In the end, "Apocalypto" is really about devotion to family, and survival against the odds.  The exotic backdrop of the Maya civilization only adds to what is already a great story.  Open minded moviegoers will get a bit of Pre-Columbian history along with some terrific entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>It cannot be altogether a coincidence that only two weeks elapsed between my viewing "10,000 BC" and "Apocalypto". Both films tell essentially the same story, but the former is cheap, shallow stuff from a hack director, while the latter is a highly skilled and emotionally involving entertainment. (It is perhaps significant that Emmerich relies heavily on models and CGI, while Gibson uses mostly practical effects, turning to CGI when it's the only way something can be done.) It is especially notable that, though Gibson's direction is almost free of any sort of sentimentality, we completely identify with the "good" characters, whereas Emmerich is clich&eacute;d, hokey, and largely uninvolving.<br /><br />Other than being a rousing (and unbelievably brutal) adventure story, it's hard to discern Mel Gibson's perspective. Is he attacking modern American materialism? Is he justifying the subjugation of the aboriginal peoples by the Spanish (if only because it ended human sacrifice)? Does he feel that the Mayan civilization /would not/ have been overthrown if it had not been so deeply involved in human sacrifice? * Is he suggesting that it is America's destiny and/or obligation to rule the world? ** Is he advocating a pagan lifestyle that is close to nature and far from the Christian church? The latter might seem strange coming from a conservative Catholic, but "Apocalypto" can indeed be interpreted that way. It is perhaps all these things -- or none of them.<br /><br />Gibson appears to be using "apocalypse" in its original sense -- a prophecy or revelation. Though there are prophecies and revelations throughout the film, the full intent becomes clear only in the last minute, not unlike "Signs". If nothing else, Gibson is searching for a sense that what happens on this plane of existance has purpose and meaning.<br /><br />Though "Apocalypto" is rightly rated R for its graphic brutality, it would not be inappropriate for older teens. It is a kind of insane "travelogue" that places the viewer in a largely unfamiliar environment, to exit with the feeling that one's life has been altered (if only slightly) by an experience that most humans are fortunate never to pass through. It's for this reason that I've rated "Apocalypto" five stars.<br /><br />PS: Contrary to what one poster wrote, the Mayan civilization continued up until the arrival of the Spanish. (There was, however, a general broad decline 700 years earlier.) If one wishes to dump on Mel Gibson, one might consider his lack of knowledge of basic astronomy. I leave it for viewers to spot the horrendous error.<br /><br />* The film's "title quote" is to the effect that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without unless it has destroyed itself from within. This is ascribed (quaintly) to "W. Durant" -- ie, Will Durant, the co-author of "The Story of Civilization", the mini-library that rests in the home of almost everyone who ever belonged to the Book of the Month Club. I've had mine 40 years, and have hardly /begun/ reading it.<br /><br />** One gets this sense from the Mayan priest's speech.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his fellow Mayan hunters are out on the hunt and having a good time in their secluded part of the wet jungle. After making a kill, they spread out some of the body parts, and then laugh at the expense of one of the bigger hunters because of the certain part that was given to him. Just having some good manly fun. Out from the jungle though come some strangers from another tribe. They look scared and beaten. With a warning about how their village was burned and ravaged, they pass by, onto hopefully a new beginning. The next morning, Jaguar's village gets attacked. People are slaughtered and huts are burned down. Jaguar hides his wife and child and then tries to help the rest of his people, only to get captured along with a group of others. They are taken back to the village of the capturers as slaves or quite possibly for a sacrificial ceremony. As the blade is nearing closer, and hope for rain is on the horizon, Jaguar must escape to save his wife and child, who are stuck in a 100-foot pit.<br /><br />Apocalypto was definitely a surprise. For one thing, I didn't know much about what I was getting into when first watching this. I thought maybe it was about why the Mayans disappeared actually (Duh...Aliens took them to outer space). But honestly it's just a story based around the Mayan timeframe. Accurate or not, I don't know. But I did like the movie. While some of the beginning is a little slow to some, I found it fun and interesting. It was nice to see them just joking around and having a good time with one another. As my fellow co-worker said, "I wonder if they really talked or had fun like that". For instance, they play a joke on one of their friends who seems to be impotent. They told him to rub some leaves on his `wing-wang', but didn't tell him they were chili leaves (I think they were at least).  This had him running around frantically naked and even his wife was burning up to (but in a spot you might not expect). The whole village was in hysterics. The action scenes were done really well also. Some say the violence was to extreme, but I don't think so at all. The sacrificing scenes were a tad rough, and I wouldn't let a child watch, but it wasn't too bad. Even `Temple of Doom' had a crazy sacrificing scene and no one really complains about that beating heart... do they? There was maybe a little to much of Jaguar Paw dodging spears and arrows though like he was Neo though, because they were coming from behind and he would always move his head or dodge something without even seeing it.<br /><br />With Jaguar Paws tribe, we also see how peaceful they were, to only have that ripped away from them in total bewilderment by the `evil' tribe. It was sad really and I honestly felt bad for them. Their children being hurt right in front of them, wives being raped or killed, husbands being slaughtered, and then tying up the prisoners to poles and making them trek back to the `evil' guys village. And even after that, I still thought about the bad guys. It had me thinking to myself, "Are they all bad? Do they all agree with what's going on?" Because it sure didn't feel like it sometimes. It had me wondering about the preparations before hand for them. Or maybe some of them think, "Better them than me so I'll just do whatever it takes to survive in this tribe" And when we do see the bad guys place of home, it seems just like any other type of city probably at that time, well... cept for the sacrificing and stuff. But hey, that's what they believed in. Even Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac to his God at one time to appease him. I almost wish we got a little more on the bad guy tribe. Ah well.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely give this a shot. While it is subtitled, it's not that bad at all (it never bothers me anyways) and you honestly forget you are reading within minutes...unless of course you are eating or something. It's got a lot of good action scenes in it, and it has a great story. Jaguar Paw rocks.<br /><br />P.S. - The scene with the Jaguar, although cool as it was, looked really bad. It reminded me of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog from Conan. It really did look like a gigantic sock puppet in a few shots. How Mel Gibson approved that I'll never know. If I was Mel I would have got a real Jaguar and let him go to town on some animal carcass or something. Eh...whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I initially didn't want to see this, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me it's a great film.  He said "yeah, Gibson's crazy, but he's a great filmmaker".  So I rented it, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This is a great film, a really stunning piece of work that's remarkable in many ways.  There are no big name stars, and most of the actor are non-professionals.  It's primarily told through imagery, and the little dialogue there is is in Mayan.  It's very bloody and violent, though not the gore fest that many critics made it out to be.  It's a very good film, filled with truly awe inspiring scenes, especially in the middle of the film when the action reaches the Mayan city.  The Mayan city sequences alone make the film worth watching, as they are astounding and the best of Gibson's career as a director.  The Mayan city was all a set, one of the biggest ever built, and kudos to the production designer for this magnificence.  After the action leaves the city, the film is still mesmerizing with a great chase sequence ending the film.  The action is well choreographed, the film looks sumptuous, especially for HD video,<br />and the performances that Gibson obtains from his cast of mostly non-professional actors is nothing short of amazing.  They're so natural, realistic, and authentic.  There's no self consciousness at all on their part, and this can be attributed to the excellence of the filmmaking.  The costume design, makeup, and set design are all excellent, and Gibson deserves full credit for making one of the most unique films in cinema history.<br /><br />The first third of the film is a bit tired, with silly dialogue and situations that are reminscent of a teenage comedy.  The opening scene is especially over the top with grossness, but after the village is attacked, the film improves astronomically. While I don't like Gibson the person (he's said remaks that are anti-Semetic, sexist, homophobic, and is prone to religious extremism), he's made a great epic here that can stand along Braveheart.  If you don't like Gibson as a person, you should try and put it aside and see this excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I wasn't prepared to like this film since I was not a big fan of Mel's "Passion of the Christ" due to the gruesome violence of the film more than the controversy surrounding it. And of course we've all heard of his meltdown in Malibu but don't let that deter you from enjoying this excellent film.  The visuals and the sound are particularly impressive in Blu-ray and it fully captures what I experienced in the theatre when I first saw it. If you want an example of Hi-Def at its best do put this on or "Blade Runner" to test your set-up.  Am looking forward to Mel's next directorial effort!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Sometimes its hard to separate a movie from the actions of its creator.Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is such a film. Many of the poor reviews of this film were based upon Gibson's racist comments rather than a reflection on the movie. For all the faults of its director Apocalypto is a fairly good straight foreward adventure story.<br /><br />The year is roughly 1502 and the Pre Columbian Mayan tribe of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) seems to be doing pretty well in their jungle village away from the great Mayan cities. Jaguar Paw has a pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and a young son. One morning his village is attacked by the Holcane warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo).<br /><br />The Holcane are destroying villages and taking prisoners to be used as slaves and sacrifices in a great Mayan city. The second act of the film details the death march to the city. Gibson's premise is that the great civilization was destroyed due to rot from the inside and this point is adequately made in the ultra violent sacrifice scenes in this section of the film.<br /><br />The third part of the film deals with Jaguar Paw's escape from the Holcane and his return to rescue his wife and young son. The third part of the film is pure action adventure. More like a cross between Rambo and Run Lola Run. This is pure adrenalin driven action and if you view it as such you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />See this film for the action and not for great social commentary and it's a pretty fair if often brutal adventure. I found myself liking the film far more than I thought I would.<br /><br />The disc includes a making of featurette, Becoming Mayan and a enjoyable commentary by Gibson and cowriter/producer Farhad Safinia.<br /><br />Rent it rather than buy unless ultra violence is your thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>For a story which spans only about 24 hours, I can understand any apprehension about the plot, which seems weak when you think about it. But while the movie played I never felt it lacking.<br /><br />It is not a movie that you will find overwhelmingly intellectual. Apocalypto is a brutal movie. Most of it is very intense and suspenseful, but it is a movie you should see only if you are ok with some very graphic scenes.<br /><br />I thought the acting, what little there was, was good. The story was believable (enough), but the writers took some creative shortcuts which were clearly for convenience. I do not think this movie was made for its story, which was simply woven around some powerful scenes. It was these scenes which made Apocalypto a gory thrill ride.<br /><br />I watched this movie in the middle of the day with a friend. There was no pressure to sit quietly and try to digest its formal elements. We were free to bounce around in our seats and ooooh and ahhhh during some of the more gruesome scenes. It made for a fun movie-watching experience and probably facilitated my enjoyment of Apocalypto.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson, you have to admit that the man knows how to get your attention, and Apocalypto is sheer proof of that.  Mainly revolving around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the film centers around the declining Mayan culture, desperate to survive by offering frequent human sacrifices after raiding and pillaging near by villages.  Desperate to be re-united with his pregant wife and young son, Jaguar Paw escapes, and seeks bloody revenge on his pursuers.  What helps make Apocalypto so surprisingly good is the sense of dread that Gibson manages to create, as well as the surprising amount of action set pieces as well.  Seriously, Apocalypto features enough bloody action that you may think you've stumbled across John Rambo in some scenes, but this helps make the film's 138 minute running time breeze by.  Not to mention how startlingly poignant the film becomes as well before degrading into a cat and mouse chase through the jungle.  Regardless of what you may think of Mel Gibson, you've got to admit that he knows how to hold your interest, and that is one of the many things that Apocalypto manages to do, whether you want that or not.  All in all, Apocalypto definitely isn't for the faint of heart, but it's definitely one of the better films to come from a big name like Gibson in a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>IT'S VERY REFRESHING TO SEE AN ACCURATE PORTRAYEL OF PRE-EUROPEAN AMERICA. NO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HERE. IT WAS A BRUTAL WAY OF LIFE BACK THEN. INTERESTING THOUGH, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED. OUR CURRENT CULTURE JUST HAS DIFFERENT AND FREQUENTLY YOUNGER VICTIMS OF HEINOUS ACTS. MAN WILL ALWAYS RATIONALIZE WHAT HE IS DOING. THIS MOVIE IS BLOODY, I MEAN BLOODY AND VIOLENT. TWICE A MAN'S CHEST IS SHOWN BEING CUT OPEN.  THEN, THEY ACTUALLY SHOW THE BEATING HEART REMOVED FROM THE CHEST CAVITY. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. PERSONALLY, I DON'T MIND WATCHING THIS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE IF IT HAS A PURPOSE. I THINK IT DOES SERVE A GREAT PURPOSE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE. YOU COULD NEVER FULLY REALIZE THE HORROR OF THIS CULTURE WITHOUT THE GRAPHIC DEPICTION AS SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. IT MAY BE GIBSON'S BEST PRODUCTION.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Well, I disagree with many of the critics of this spectacular film. It reminded me somewhat of Werner Herzog's work in South American. There's an epic jungle out there and the fiercest beast of all is, ah, us!<br /><br />I don't know if Gibson is clinically nuts.  His latest brush's with anti-Semitism and drunkenness were bizarre, but he does show all the characteristics of a wild-eyed-visionary-artist. Apocalypto is a fantastical recreation of a 600 year old Mayan civilization that out-DeMille's any Hollywood historical stuff I've ever seen. Gibson used a ton of his own loot to build a Mayan city so lifelike, it is obviously not computer generated.  The sets reminded me of earlier Gibson projects, a Gibsonionian Mad Max touch.<br /><br />The film begins with a bloody, but good-natured tribal hunt.  Rudy Youngblood soon learns that the city Mayans are out on the prowl looking for slaves. His village is decimated and the villagers are led off to the Gods.  Along the way, he observes the incredible brutality of the Mayan religion.  I won't describe the mayhem, but will warn the viewer that it's much like observing the work of lunatics in a concentration camp on LSD. If you're stomach can't hold on, keep a bucket by the couch because the effort is well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  While "Apocalypto" doesn't quite reach the level of overall magnificence of Mel Gibson's "Braveheart", it frequently achieves greatness that equals many of that film's finer qualities.  The visual effects are outstanding, as is the glorious cinematography, and having a cast of unknowns portray a long-lost people from an epic, mysterious culture is a stroke of genius.  The cast is excellent.  If any "name" actor had been in this film it would have taken away from the effectiveness of the tribe as a whole, as a family.  The entire film is in subtitles, as the characters relate to one another in an ancient tongue, which is yet another effective dynamic for transporting the viewer to another time.  After seeing this film and "Letters from Iwo Jima", which is predominately subtitled, I jokingly related to friends that the best foreign films these days are coming out of Hollywood.  That was true until I experienced "Pan's Labyrinth", which is amazing!  As far as "Apocalypto" goes, most of the flaws are incredibly minor, the only parts that had me shaking my head were a few predictable plot elements that are eventually forgivable given the overall grandeur of the film as a whole.  As for the complaints about the excessive gore in "Apocalypto", it is used as part of the story not as a fetish of Mel Gibson, as so many critics claimed.  As far as that goes I found it to be completely hilarious when "Apocalypto" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup, thus backhanding every critic across the face who downgraded the film for its excessive gore.  For a large portion of the movie, at least an hour in total, there is a fantastic chase that will leave everyone breathless.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, both as entertainment and as an artistic endeavor from all concerned.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Just like Tom Cruise's weird celebrity escapades before the releases of War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible III, Mel Gibson and his film Apocalypto wasn't immune to controversy. A big budget film using ancient language subtitles and not a single recognizable face in the bunch, many wondered if Gibson was off his rocker. While not given the large attention that the Passion of the Christ got, this is at least an enjoyable film that won't really change your life or do anything significant, but you'll have fun anyway...if you can stomach this kind of thing.<br /><br />Set during an unspecified date, we see a group of Mayans living in a remote village in the jungle. One day, a savage group attacks their camp and those that aren't killed are enslaved and traveled a great distance to a Mayan city where some are sold off and others are sacrificed. Among the captured is Jaguar Paw, a young man with a son and pregnant wife at home (she was hid during the initial attack). He manages to escape and he sets off back home while being chased by a group of warriors looking to have his head.<br /><br />The main issue (aside from the obvious religious stuff) with the Passion was the amount of violence it had. Some saw it as a representation of Jesus dying for your sins and if he was going to, he better go through hell to forgive everyone's while others saw the violence as gratuitious and almost quasi-sadistic. Unlike certain films with big violence such as Hostel, the violence here serves the story and is part of it rather than is the story. But still, when you see not one but 2 people getting their hearts ripped out than subsequently decapitated, you kinda go "hm, kinda excessive no?"<br /><br />The film is basically separated in 2: a more slower paced view of Mayan culture, complete with odd face paintings and scars. It's interesting although you can imagine how odd it looks to see sticks through people's noses. The second half though is essentially one big long chase through the jungle with Jungle Paw outrunning his captives and even turning the tables on them. We got many many scenes of him just running which could be a great advertisement for a new diet. ("Wanna lose weight fast? Do a Mel Gibson movie"). But instead of being a Michael Bay scene of just action for the sake of showing off effects and mayhem, this serves as a purpose as he has to get back to his wife who is due any minute and the fact that she is stuck in a hole and can easily drown should it rain doesn't help matters. Some enjoy both halves together while the majority will just look at the chase and go "cool dude!"<br /><br />While it won't go into the collective conscious that Passion of the Christ did, it's at least an enjoyable movie for those who like some emotion with their action.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>First, I'm gonna start by declaring that I'm not a big fan of Mel Gibson (as a person).  That being said, after seeing the trailer for this film at the theater, I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />The story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young man who has a happy life----a member of a close knit village of family and friends.  Soon, however, his world is destroyed by Mayan invaders who attack the village, capturing the adults (the ones who are not slaughtered) and leaving behind the children to die.  Before he is caught, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a deep cravass but is soon herded off to a great Mayan city for a dreadful fate, uncertain of what will become of his young family.<br /><br />Once inside the huge city, the captives see slaves laboring to build the ever expanding city and crowds cheering, hungry for blood.  The women are sold off and the men, it is soon learned, are destined to be sacrificed to a Mayan god.<br /><br />Fate leads Jaguar Paw away from death and gives him a chance to return to his home and possibly save his family who remain stranded underground.  What follows is a frantic chase, with captors at his heels, as a young man uses his wits (and blessed by good luck at times) to escape the evil that is closing in on him.<br /><br />Gibson managed to make a fast past movie that gives us a glimpse into the mysteries of the Mayan civiliztion.  He also gives us a parting glance at a culture that is dying and at the start of its decline.  The scenes of the peaceful village being attacked and sheperded into slavery are hard to watch and you will find yourself desperately hoping that these poor people will somehow manage to escape their horrific destinies.  While the ending of the movie leaves room for optimism, it also shows us that one evil can easily be replaced by another, more powerful evil.<br /><br />The film is spoken entirely in the Mayan language (with English subtitles) but don't be put off by this.  The story moves along quickly and the action is well paced.  The lead, Rudy Youngblood, does an excellent job as the man who's life is forever changed but is determined to save his wife and child.<br /><br />A worthy addition to any dvd collection!  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Apocalypto is the story of survival as tribal wars and slavery leads one man on a desperate journey to get back to his family. Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that made many critics claim that it was "the best movie of the year" as well as "brutally violent" and "shockingly disturbing." Watching this film I have to say that it is more about the story of one man struggling to overcome the odds to get back to the ones he loves and even though there is violence its a small part compared to the larger picture.<br /><br />Rudy Youngblood plays a man named Jaguar Paw in Mayan times. He and his tribe are very comfortable, living in their part of their forest. However just one day after meeting another tribe that was passing through their lands because they were attacked by something, Jaguar Paw and his tribe are attacked and taken prisoner by a third tribe. Many of Jaguar Paw's fellow villagers are killed, most are taken prisoner, but Jaguar Paw's wife and kid are trapped in an underground well after trying to escape.<br /><br />After being bound together, Jaguar Paw and a few of his tribesmen are led on a long journey to a huge temple kingdom somewhere far away. It is there that Jaguar Paw realizes that they are meant to be sacrifices to a god that thier captors worship. After what seems to be a miracle saves Jaguar Paw's life, Jaguar Paw has to escape and get back to his wife and child before it is too late.<br /><br />Apocalypto definately is not for those who cant stand the sight of blood, and the sacrifice scenes are indeed hard to watch for their brutally realistic reenactments. However the story of Jaguar Paw stuggling to stay alive to be with his family, especially his wife who is expecting another child, is something to be seen for the powerful performances that are shown in this film.<br /><br />What also is a good original idea for the film is showing the entire film in English subtitles but also with the actually Mayan subtitles being shown as well. I found it really interesting listening to the way the villagers interacted with each other and seeing how different and slightly similar the different tribes were when compared together. Even Jaguar Paw's captors and himself share some common traits. Another thing I liked about this movie is the beautiful scenery. Giant waterfalls, dense jungles, huge fields, and beautiful ancient cities make this movie something that definately needs to be seen to get lost in. This is one movie you should see if you want to see a great film about love, passion, and survival.<br /><br />Extas include:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia<br /><br />Becoming Mayan: The Making of Apocalypto<br /><br />Deleted Scens with commentary by Mel Gibson<br /><br />I walked into the theater not knowing what to expect. Since it was a Mel Gibson film I assumed it was going to be nothing but violence. However I was surprised by how intriguing this film became. This movie is definatley recommended. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>The best filmmakers are the ones who aren't afraid to coat their projects with their own life blood. There are films that you see that you just KNOW it's a window into the soul of the writer or director, and you are grateful they had the guts to do it. Mel Gibson has always taken his fervor, vivacity, creativity and devotion to his work seriously. He has produced and directed such films as: Man without a Face, Forever Young, Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto. All of those films have personally left me with a sense of wonderment, curiosity, awe and self awareness. Mel, as we know, has issues but unlike some people he admits it and is getting help (sober for 3 months!). I grew up with an alcoholic, so I know the ups and downs and the inner turmoil they feel, we are lucky as an audience to witness Mel's way of hashing out his inner demons. I personally don't know one person on the face of the earth who can judge Mel, we all have had moments or knew someone who did, and we all deserve forgiveness and understanding.<br /><br />Onto the review<br /><br />  Apocalypto is an astonishing, breathtaking tale of one man and his devotion to both his family, and his way of life. Jaguar Paw is everyman. A father, husband, son, and warrior.<br /><br />Who among us could imagine his way of life and the hard work it takes to provide for a village and family, and who among us wouldn't trade all we have to experience that sense of accomplishment and utter bliss. When he sees another warrior, who has been displaced by an unknown ravager, he senses his fear and it worries him. His own father says to him that once fear sets into your brain it takes over, and you can't let that happen. That is the truth; a lot of us live with some kind of fear and it consumes our lives to the point where any happiness we feel is fleeting. Jaguar Paw sleeps in a hut, but has a beautiful family and he is content. When a tribe of warriors comes to desecrate their village and kidnap the men and women, he experiences great loss and feels the fear his father spoke of envelope his whole being. He saves his family, only to leave them in a precarious position and he knows that he has to get back to them somehow.<br /><br />  The evil in this movie turns out to be a city of excess populated by the sick and the depraved and the greedy. A ruler who wants bigger buildings, who demands human sacrifice to satiate the Gods, and in turn their crops will grow again and the diseased will be healed. It's a town where human waste runs through the streets, and the people are idle and do nothing but sit around and use the resources, and where the value of a human life is an afterthought to the sport of the game and wicked morbid amusement. It is a society that is doomed and we all know it as soon as we see it through Jaguar Paws eyes. Gibson clearly is saying here that a great civilization cannot not exist on such wastefulness of youth, resources, and decadence.<br /><br />  Jaguar Paw has a mission to get back to his family and because of circumstances and sheer willpower gets free and starts heading back to them, followed by the same warriors who kidnapped him. They are weary of him because of some prophecy but decide to still go after him because of revenge and pride.  He is wounded but manages to outwit, outlast and draw upon strength of character that none of them have. He is a man while they are merely semblances of men parading around in finery, their brains empty and hearts full of hate and greed. In the end he succeeds in saving his family, and witnesses the coming of a new enemy with the Spaniards landing on their beach. Instead of investigating the newcomers he vanishes into the jungle determined to start over anew, a spark of independence and preservation for his way of life still alight.<br /><br />  My husband and I left the theater and talked for about two hours about what message we got from Apocalypto. Why can't people be happy with what they have? Are we as a society now dependent on too much technology and not enough on the skills it takes to survive without. Is the family unit a thing of the past, Are we all too wasteful and ignoring the lessons of many civilizations that have gone before? Do we let fear rule our lives, the fear of bills and jobs and traffic and gossip. Do we know our priorities in life, and is the number one thing ourselves? Are we too selfish, do we have a tribe we can depend on? Do we listen to our elders?<br /><br />I would tell anyone to see this movie, over the age of 17 of course, it does have violence but not for the sake of shock. I thought CSI shows worse that this movie did! Go see it even if you hate Mel Gibson, because your basically just shooting yourself in the foot boycotting his movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Apocalypto" is a well-shot movie that moves along at a fast clip.  Gibson wisely decided not to stretch this movie out into a 3+ hour epic, avoiding that temptation and keeping it just slightly flabby at about 2 hours 15 minutes.  There's nothing here story-wise you haven't seen before.  Imagine "The Patriot" in pre-Colombian Latin America, with the jungle dwellers as the colonists and the Mayans as the British, and you've hit about three quarters of the plot points of this movie.  It's not a bad film by any means, but it does keep reminding you of other movies you've seen before - just with a Yucutan flourish.<br /><br />I didn't care for the gross (pun intended) manipulativeness of the first act.  We know the Mayan city dwellers are bad people.  Whether they were human sacrificers in real life, I have no idea - I always thought it was the Aztecs that were the real bloodthirsty ones.  But the depredations suffered unto our heroic tribe were more than enough to make we the viewers cheer for revenge on the bad guys.  Of course, one could make a counter-argument that the first act simply shows the reality of brutal combat without romanticizing it, and I would be hard pressed to disagree.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is worth a rent, at least, if you don't mind some pretty brutal violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I don't like any movie Mel Gibson has ever acted in, so I hope he continues to direct because I can't stand him, I think he is a crap actor.  Aside from that I love this film, It takes you on this incredible journey, you just dissapear in the frightening world of aztec warriors and their disturbing life of survival, supremacy and machismo. I was surprised on how horrorfic this film was but it served a historic purpose.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie more than I had expected I would.  Yes, there are some gruesome scenes of violence, but nothing as awful as it could have been.  The worst is seeing a jaguar chew on a mans face while killing him, or the heads bouncing down and the headless corpses rolling down the steps of the temple (as was done by the Maya).  The cutting out of the hearts is actually worse in "Temple of Doom".<br /><br />Still, the level of savagery is quite high.  The life of the Maya was harsh and filled with war and violence.  I believe it was far worse than is depicted in this film.  Certainly, the life of women would have been far harsher than the near equality they are given in this story.  Maybe another reason for the "R" rating is that the dress of the Maya is pretty much as you see it on the murals without any attempt to cover things to our comparatively modest standards.<br /><br />The story is about a man who is part of a small village deep in the forest.  For them this was the good life.  Another group of people asks for passage through their land because their village was ravaged.  I do not believe that they would not have exchanged information about what happened, but they don't talk to each other here.  I hate it when a plot point depends on someone not saying something or asking something obviously important.<br /><br />Along come the warriors from the big city in their fierce dress.  They slaughter and take captive the entire village, including our hero, Jaguar Paw.  We have gotten to know most of the central people in this village so this event is quite powerful.  Jaguar Paw works frantically to hide his pregnant wife and son and then goes to help fight for his people.  He is taken captive and marched to the city.  I appreciated the cruelty and indifference to life shown here.  Again, if anything, I think it was more mild than real life probably was for these people.<br /><br />He and his people are not destined for slavery, but for sacrifice.  I will leave you to watch the movie to find out what happens.  However, this movie is set immediately before the Spaniards arrive.  I mean immediately.<br /><br />The dialogue is in Mayan (I guess, I don't speak Mayan so I can't tell you for sure) with subtitles.  There is really not much dialogue so it is quite easy to follow and what little reading there is comes quite naturally after a few minutes.<br /><br />While certainly not for everyone, and not even young teens, it is a decent film.  Not everything is historically accurate, but I certainly found it interesting to see the people in the Mayan murals come to life in their dress, hairstyles, weapons, forest habitat, cruelty, and ignorance.  I particularly noticed how power was tightly held to the few over the many.  The one real flaw I saw in the film was that the people in the forest seemed unaware of the big city.  However, if you read about the Spanish Conquest, it is amazing how fast news spread and how efficient the information systems were.  And given how important information about people who could destroy you is, I think they would have known everything about the city and its people and intentions towards them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>And this time, no one can say that he's pandering to the religious right.  With "The Passion of the Christ," Gibson proved that a film can be great even if the audience has to rely on subtitles to get them through the film.  In "Apocalypto," Gibson proves it once more.  Although this is a stretch, I'd have to say that Gibson's story here is much like that of William Shakespeare's plays in that you do not have to understand the language in order to understand the story.  The story is told through the eyes, actions, and emotions of each character.  In "Apocalypto," we are introduced to Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his close-knit tribal family.  The story begins with tribal members hunting tapir.  We are introduced to Jaguar Paw's brother, Blunted, and his father.  Though few of the characters are named, we learn quickly who they are and have a relationship with each of them.  Warriors from another, more powerful tribe, attack the village, take prisoners, and abandoned the children.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and son in an empty well and vows to return for them.  From there, the story moves to the giant Mexican pyramids and the blood-encrusted culture that base their lives around it.  We see slavery, political and religious manipulation and flat-out cruelty.<br /><br />At this point, the story enters its second phase, where a great chase ensues as a prophecy unravels before the Mayan people's eyes.  We are also given a potential clue as to why this complicated and advanced society suddenly vanished.<br /><br />Perhaps it's not as historically accurate as others would want, but when you boil it down to the basics, "Apocalypto" is two separate stories combined into one.  On one hand you have a tale of a family whose love for one another keeps them going.  On the other hand you have a great chase tale that will hold you in your seat for the entire running time of the film.<br /><br />Gibson has done a masterful job with this film.  He's taken core characters with minimal dialogue and created great heroes and villains with them.  The actors and actresses in this film perfectly exude their respective intentions flawlessly.  You immediately pick up on who's the strong-hearted warrior, who's the honorable and loyal father, who's the sinister, cruel underling, and who's the primary villain.<br /><br />Well done flick that deserves repeat viewings.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.  -  W. Durant.<br /><br />_Apocalypto_ (2006) is an excellent film directed by Mel Gibson that details the decline of Mayan civilization through the life of a young Indian who strives to protect his family.  Gibson's genius is apparent throughout the film as he effectively captures the atmosphere of this lost once great civilization.  The movie has much to say about man's tendency to over-reach his natural status within the world and through a Faustian bargain with demonic forces to eventually destroy both himself and nature.  The movie also is highly pertinent to our own times, in which Western civilization itself faces an imminent decline and through over-extension man has reached into once "primitive" and untapped regions of nature and demolished them.  The underlying force of Gibson's traditional Catholicism is apparent throughout the film, and at different places within the film the Mayan mythology appears to be aping the Catholic ritual.  To the Roman Catholic Christian, the appearance of elements in traditional cultures which bear a marked similarity to its own ritual are of no surprise as God reveals himself to all nations through Christ.  Gibson also shows the arrival of the Spaniards to Mexico in the film and presumably they will attempt to Christianize this fallen civilization that has become hopelessly corrupt by resorting to human sacrifice and chattel slavery and thus is in desperate need of Christ.  The movie treats the traditional Indian cultures with great respect and reverence, particularly that of the tribe of Jaguar Paw (the central character in this movie played by the Native American actor Rudy Youngblood).  However, the movie does not refrain from showing the brutality of the ancient Mayans who preyed off the forest tribes and whose sun god Kulkukan (the Mayan equivalent of Quetzalcoatl) demands human blood.  Gibson maintains that such cultural degradation can only foretell the coming doom of a civilization as is revealed in history through the Spanish conquerors.  The actors in the film all speak the Yucatec Mayan language throughout and the film relies on subtitles.  Gibson has claimed that the effect of hearing a foreign language spoken in a film (as he also did in his _Passion of the Christ_  with Aramaic) is important.<br /><br />The movie begins with Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and several fellow tribesmen hunting a tapir in the jungle.  It is noted by Flint Sky that his own father hunted this same jungle, that his son continues to hunt it, and that his son's son will hunt it after him, thus establishing the continuity of primordial tradition.  Such is the traditional way of life for the world's "primitive" nature-loving peoples.  It is after capturing the tapir that the tribesmen encounter a second traumatized tribe who tell of a coming doom.  Their own village has been ravished.  Jaguar Paw and his fellows return to their village but first Flint Sky tells him that he must resolve not to fear.  That night, one of the village elders tells a foreboding fable of human beings never fulfilling their wants and desires.  Perhaps this fable is an allegory for the greater environmental degradation (and the destruction of the very rain forest itself) which has occurred in our own times.  Jaguar Paw awakes from a prophetic and horrifying nightmare only to find that his village is being invaded by raiders.  The raiders ransack the village and kill many, raping the women, and leaving the children.  However, just before the village is destroyed and he himself is captured, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son at the bottom of a pit where they are to remain for the rest of the movie.  Perhaps the pregnant wife in the pit (the cave?) is meant to be reminiscent of the very Virgin Mary herself from Gibson's own religious tradition.  (The Virgin is to occur again in the prayers of one of the women as a slave for the lost children.)  Jaguar Paw and his villagers are taken away as slaves by the raiders and must trek through the jungle to arrive at the Mayan city.  There they are to be sacrificed on top of a step pyramid to the god Kulkukan.  The sacrificial ritual is meant to be reminiscent of the Roman mass.  The movie features an eclipse and an eerie prophecy followed by a horrendous occurrence at the ball field.  Following this Jaguar Paw runs through the jungle pursued by his enemies driven by pure hatred.  To see the resolution of the movie, and whether or not Jaguar Paw manages to save his pregnant wife and young son, you must watch it.  It should be noted though that the Christian theme becomes apparent again when Spanish missionaries and conquistadores show up in ships towards the end.  Thus, begins anew the history of the Americas.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has directed an excellent film in _Apocalypto_.  The movie includes humor but also much seriousness and bloodshed.  (Unfortunately this film is not to be recommended to the overly squeamish who may find certain scenes too upsetting, but to those few brave souls who can bear some of the more gruesome scenes the film has a positive message for all.)  The atmosphere is well done and the scenery and environment is accurate.  The movie is also historically interesting and Gibson has certainly done his homework on this ancient culture.  However, it is the central theme and allegorical nature of this film which I believe is most important for us today.  It tells us that we must stop over-extending ourselves and destroying nature and the traditional ways of life of "primitive" peoples.  Ultimately however, our hope must rest with God himself who effectively guides our destiny as a race.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>This movie is a masterpiece. Trust me, you havent seen anything like it. 5 stars!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>My wife commented after seeing Apocalypto that she had o idea where the story would go next.  Mel Gibson has created a story that is utterly fascinating to watch and exciting to watch unfold. The film is beautifully acted with excellent performances by all.  To name a couple of actors Rudy Youngblood is magnificent as Jaguar Paw and Morris Birdyellowhead is equally good as his father, the wise tribal leader Flint Sky.<br /><br />The story begins with the idyllic life of Jaguar Paw's village.  The film nicely builds its story with a depiction of the peaceful life of the village and we learn about the personalities of many of the men, women and children.  The most amusing part deals with Jaguar Paw's best friend and his shrewish mother.  The old woman scolds her son-in-law because she has no grandchildren and he is taken in by Flint Sky by his suggestion to rub what turns out to be chilies on himself before trying the next time with his wife. In the opening scene Jaguar Paw and his father are hunting a tapir with other men from the village.  After the tapir has been killed and the meat is being divided the members of another village need to pass by and we learn that their homes have been ravaged, forcing them to move on.  This is the first suggestion that all is not right in this jungle paradise - there is drought and disease.<br /><br />Once the pattern of life in the village has been established, it is attacked with the men and women taken prisoner except for Jaguar Paw's wife and son, whom he hides in a dry cistern. This sets the story for the rest of the film as Jaguar Paw desperately struggles to return to what is left of his village to rescue his family from the cistern, which is too steep to climb.  The captives are marched through the jungle across a raging river to one of the Mayan cities where the men are being ritually scarified. Not to give away too much of the story, Jaguar Paw manages to escape but is pursued.<br /><br />Neither my wife nor I found the violence depicted in the film particularly disturbing.  Certainly there is nothing in Apocalypto that we have not already seen in Braveheart and The Last of the Mohicans. Perhaps the goriest scene - when the victims have their hearts cut out and are decapitated - is shot around by the camera, focusing on the reactions of the people. What was highly fascinating for me is the re-creation of the Mayan civilization.  When Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives enter the city there is a marked difference between the city culture and the jungle culture that is immediately apparent so that Jaguar Paw is an outsider among his own people.<br /><br />The quote at the start of the fill by Will Durant - that a civilization is destroyed from within before it is destroyed from without - is the point of Apocalypto.  The Mayan civilization, despite its advances in astronomy and engineering, is destroying its population, given up for sacrifice, to appease the gods that are laying waste to the land.  Apocalypto is a beautifully photographed film with a story that is mind opening and unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The description of 'graphic violence'attached to the poster of Apocalypto should be changed to 'unfathomable violence!" Every periodical I could get my hands on pointed out the same. It's what we've come to expect from a Gibson film. Then you have the style that only Gibson can bring to a film, oscar potential. Yet, he's unafraid to pull techniques from the "everyman's director book." He'll use slow motion. He'll have impossible chase scenes, (waterfall jump) but all in superb form! Somehow, in between horror freaks and hungry arthouse schoolers, you have this film fit into. What audiance is that? I wonder how well this film will do. I saw this film on the first Saturday it opened, during the afternoon. It was half filled. Pretty good, considering how informed audiences tend to be. I'm sure more than half of them knew about the vomit enducing violence. And about Gibson's tirade(s).<br /><br />  I've read it's an "Arthouse film for Jocks." It certainly brings the action for the jocks, and the after movie gossip fuel. It also has been out there in mainstream news for a bit. It's been delayed for how long? And was it rain? Hmmm, Public corespondent.... Not to mention how even before it was released, nations of outraged people were denouncing it. I'm gonna stay away from taking any sides. As a movie, it deserves a shot. But, maybe it's impossible for me to see it again. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean it in a "Passion" way. Gibson is a determined man, who choses to apply his fortunes to projects no-one, I mean no-one would touch with a ten foot pole.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." This quote by Will Durant flashes on the screen at the beginning of APOCALYPTO and signals the message of the movie: a morally and economically troubled Mayan civilization is "rotten ripe for the fall", to quote another source, and the Conquistadors are landing on the Yucatan Peninsula to do the job. APOCALYPTO goes about showing us this rot that is a brutal, bloody, inhuman Mayan society while telling a classic action-chase tale. Jaguar Paw, a warrior in a small village, is captured by ruthless Mayan soldiers and taken back to the Mayan capital city to be sacrificed with others from his village on a pyramid. He manages to escape and is chased by Mayan fighters through the jungle.<br /><br />So much for the plot. What about the theme suggested by Will Durant? The film makes a good argument that the Mayans were vulnerable but even a morally sound, economically strong Mayan society could not have defeated the Spanish. Why? Because, while the Spanish were small in number, they had horses, muskets, steel swords, and head and chest armor. Not only that: the Spanish were just as ruthless as the Mayans. There was no way even a healthy Mayan civilization could have fended off the Spanish; it may have taken just a litle longer before the inevitable end.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is brilliant movie-making and grand entertainment. Three cheers for director Mel Gipson. And forget what you've heard about bloody, sacrifical heart removals. This is a tiny part of the movie and is not nearly as bad as rumored.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Set during the Mayan Empire's decline, Apocalypto charts the story of Jaguar Paw (wonderfully played by Youngblood) who is torn from his idyllic life and pregnant wife and son. His village is plundered and the survivors are captured by a neighboring warring tribe and taken to the Mayan city. The imagery Gibson created of the Mayan civilization is spectacular. The virtual unknown indigenous South American cast with their daub, garb and piercing are fascinating viewing as are his visual creations of the city and temples. As with Gibson's previous film, The Passion of the Christ, this too is told through another practically dead language: Yucatan Maya dialect. Don't let this put you off though as it doesn't detract from the film and there's not much speaking anyway. Narrowly escaping being sacrificed in a ritual offering Jaguar Paw flees to the forest and with a survivors spirit attempts to return to his family. Hunted by the Mayan warriors, he uses his knowledge of the forest to out wit them and stay alive. The "second half" of the film is fast paced and entertaining action. I don't know how authentic Gibson's barbaric portrayal of the Mayan peoples is but Apocalypto effortlessly transports the viewer into that time and place and the running stream of love, determination and survival that runs through its core makes it a moving film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Apocalypto redefines might.There is nothing subtle about this film. One of the few things that stand out in this film is how good the acting is.The characters seem totally oblivious to the camera.The action has its own applauding pace, the characters have their own shortcomings in execution of the most direst of straits of moves while the weather, sun and the moon have their own influence.This movie took me by surprise.The brutality might seem exaggerated but we're men and WE LIKE THIS.I loved the two major villains of the film.Their eyes convey no respite and sometimes the chase scenes seem to actually make you want not to blink.Yes,there is blood but not to the extent to make it seem obscene/overdone. What I absolutely loved about the film is the taunt of one of the villains (Clue - "Almost") Enough said. You will like this film if you want to get your money's worth. This does figure among the top ten movies I saw in 2006 and believe me, I've seen my fair share. A huge cheer of respect for Mel Gibson. Two words, WHAT NEXT</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film. The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film-making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made. Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto" opens with a quotation from the philosopher-historian Will Durant: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."  This is a great quote, but extremely problematic for the movie that follows.  The campaign by the Spanish conquistadors against the Maya states began in the early 16th century and ended at the end of the 17th century when the last Maya stronghold, the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Pet&eacute;n Itz&aacute;, fell.  The Maya were organized into a number of independent states that had to be conquered one by one, in contrast to the Spanish campaigns against the Aztec and Inca nations where overthrowing a single political center proved to be the key to conquest.  Durant's quote talks about corruption within being followed by external conquest, what we usually associate with the decadence that preceded the fall of Rome, but that does not apply to what happened to the Maya.  Besides, even those Mesoamerican cultures that did not engage in human sacrifice were going to be immune to the myriad diseases that Europeans brought to the Americas and which decimates entire peoples.<br /><br />By the time this movie came out in 2006 the fact it was entitled "Mel Gibson's Apocalypto" hurt rather than helped it at the box office.  On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested in California for speeding and on suspicion of drunk driving.  During his arrest Gibson made a series of anti-Semitic remarks, and since his previous film, "The Passion of the Christ," was criticized for alleged anti-Semitic elements, this was potentially a major nail in the coffin for Gibson.  "Apocalypto" cost $40 million to make and took in just short of $51 million in the U.S., which would make it a major disappointment.  But beyond the bad publicity for the man who co-wrote (with Farhad Safinia), directed and produced the film there was the additional hurdle that all of the dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language, which is still spoken today.  The fact that there are subtitles involved will remind many viewers of Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ," as will the depictions of violence (to a lesser degree).  Just let me say that I ended up watching this DVD by myself because nobody else wanted to "read" the movie.  This is too bad, because the film is a visual delight.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is set in Mesoamerica on the eve of the arrival of the Spanish, presumably on the Yucatan peninsula.  After a tapir hunt, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and the group of young hunters led by his father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) encounter a group of refugees who seek permission to pass through the forest.  More important than the Durant quote is the story told that night by the village elder of how human beings always want more, despite having the best gifts from each of the animals of the forest.  The fable comes to life when a party of Maya raiders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), attacks the village.  Jaguar Paw is able to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and his young son by a vine into a small ground cave before he is captured by the vicious Middle Eye (Gerardo Tarcena).  While the captives are taken to a Maya City, Jaguar Paw worries about his wife and child, trapped in the cave and unable to escape..<br /><br />Actually, for most of the last act of this film you will not be doing a lot of reading, because "Apocalypto" turns out to be, in the end at least, a chase movie.  "Death Proof" was suppose to be a big time chase movie, but I have to tell you "Apocalypto" is a whole lot better in that regard.  The movie I was reminded most of us ended up being "The Last of the Mohicans," not just because most of the action takes place in a lush green forest, but also because most of the memorable moments in both films have to do with people look at each other.  It has been a long time since I have seen somebody bore holes through people with their eyes the way Zero Wolf does in this movie.  Actually, there is another point of comparison between the two movies in that Jaguar Paw runs even more than Nathaniel ever did.  I want to add that my favorite performance in the film was by Morris Birdyellowhead: in his final scene as Flint Sky, I was no longer aware that he was acting, so thoroughly had he become his character for me.<br /><br />The title does not have anything to do with the related term apocalypse, despite the obvious implications, because "Apocalypto" is a Greek term that translates as "new beginning."  The significance here is more ironic than anything else, because the story really is about an ending more than any beginning that takes place after the final credits.  "Apocalypto" was nominated for Oscars for Makeup, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing, and certainly the makeup and costumes we see in the Maya city are absolutely spectacular.  However, while the depiction of Maya culture, architecture and dress is visually impressive, it has been criticized by scholars as being unauthentic and superficial.  Apparently the film takes bits and pieces from various people and time periods to create this picture of the Maya.  Fortunately I never take what I see in movies as gospel when it comes to history and culture, and I would encourage you to check out what you can find online about the Maya once this film sparks your interest.  I have already learned a lot on the subject.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>To be honest, I thought Apocalypto had all the makings of a new Heaven's Gate. Obsessed director, gimmicky idea regarding a lost culture and scripted in another dead language (see Passion of the Christ).  Boy, was I wrong.  Apocalypto, with its Lost World setting, is, if you just look at the plot, a lean and mean action film.  If you've ever seen the old Cornel Wilde flick, Naked Prey, you essentially have a good chunk of Apocalypto, as the hero, Jaguar Paw, races through the jungle, pursued by Mayans, while at home, his wife and child are in great, and growing, danger.  It's edge of your seat suspense that never lets up.  But on another level, Gibson has something to say about civilizations and how they kill themselves. The Mayan's are about as decadent and pagan (in a bad way) as it gets. There were times, as you were led through the Mayan city, that I thought this could be Mars.  It is unsettling and it is brutal, right down to the colors and clothing of the Mayans.  If a civilization can become demonic, certainly this one, as portrayed by Gibson, was.  The sacrifice scenes could easily come out of the Old Testament, the god being worshipped: Baal. And underscoring that is a little girl's prophet-like condemnation, that upsets the Mayan soldiers.  They themselves sense something is in the air, a bad moon is on the rise.  Spiraling out from this is a landscape that is denuded by poor usage, while plague gnaws at the edges of the Mayan world.  Yes, it is a movie set in the past, but one can't help thinking that Gibson is projecting this vision on the here and now.  It's a short leap from a world where heads are being tossed down temple steps, to one where beheadings can be viewed on the internet.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>If you've never seen The Naked Prey with Cornel Wilde (1966) - get it, watch it. It is probably the most horrifically suspenseful chase film ever made. Apocalypto is the second. In The Naked Prey, Cornel Wilde is a white hunter in Africa whose client offends a native chief, and is therefore punished by the tribe by being turned into their prey. That is exactly what happens in Apocalypto, except that the prey is a South American indian that has been captured by a neighboring tribe and then released to be hunted. I have no doubt that Mel Gibson got his idea from that earlier film.<br /><br />Both films contain the victim and his party being captured unexpectedly; horrific scenes of torture of the members of his party; and the remaining victim being turned loose to be hunted like an animal. In The Naked Prey, the torture is a variety of inhumane and humiliating ends to the members of Wilde's hunting party. In Apocalypto, it is human sacrifice atop a Mayan ziggurat. In both films, the hero is saved for a special hunt in which he is the prey. But the hunters never expect an extended chase, and they certainly don't expect to be picked off one-by-one by their victim - but that's exactly what happens, and it makes for two very exciting films.<br /><br />Apocalypto is not for everyone. If you're squeamish, I would not recommend it. It is brutally real, disturbingly graphic and relentlessly intense - as is The Naked Prey. Also, it has subtitles - the Yucatan language, no less. But it is a very good story with an exceptional chase scene in the second half. It does not have a message - I don't care what Mel Gibson has said about declining civilizations and soldiers dying needlessly in Iraq. The Mayan civilization is not the subject of this film - merely its backdrop. Even the byline on the poster - "No one can outrun their destiny" - is misleading. This is not a film about destiny catching up with someone. If anything, it is about someone escaping a destiny imposed on him by other human beings.<br /><br />Apocalypto is a very simple story about a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his young family, who are members of a small tribe in the middle of the Yucatan jungle, that wake up one morning to find themselves being attacked and overwhelmed by a group of fellow-natives from a nearby Mayan city. The adult villagers that survive the attack are carried off in "chains," leaving the children behind to fend for themselves; but before his capture, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son in a cistern, promising to return for them.<br /><br />The captives are taken to a city that is full of activity, most of it strange and difficult to understand - like slaves working in a quarry, removing some kind of white powder, its dust making their bodies white. These white people look weird walking through the streets of the city carrying their baskets of white powder. Where are they going? Then we see: the white powder is being used to plaster the walls of their buildings.<br /><br />There are women whose hands are covered with blue paint, and they begin smearing it all over the bodies of the captives. "Why are they doing this to us?" the victims wonder. Then we see: as they are being led through a tunnel, there are drawings on its walls, paintings of blue people being sacrificed, being mutilated, being decapitated. Then they come out of the tunnel and see a great ziggurat surrounded by people that are "worshipping." On top of the ziggurat, priests are doing the things depicted on the tunnel walls. Once they've decapitated their victims, they roll their heads down the ziggurat steps as the worshippers cheer and a new batch of blue people are led to the top. Now Jaguar Paw and his friends know exactly why they have been brought here. Soon it will be their heads rolling down the steps.<br /><br />It is quite interesting to see a primitive and ancient civilization depicted in this way. It is quite disturbing to see evil depicted in this way. The Mayans were a primitive civilization - I don't care how much archaeologists decry Mel Gibson for emphasizing their blood-thirst and playing down their scientific and other achievements. I think he has hit the nail on the head as far as what these people were: pagan beasts. And yet, they were created in God's image. It shows how low man can sink in his depravity when he has turned his back on God. It also shows the horrors of slavery, and how a person can be reduced in mind, body and spirit when he is forced to submit to the will and whims of another human being.<br /><br />But there is a golden lining to this dark, nightmarish vision: one of the captives waiting to be sacrificed at the top of the ziggurat has hope. He remembers his pregnant wife and young son, and how they are depending on him. If he doesn't return to their village and remove them from the cistern, the next big rain will drown them. He knows he must live to help them. That is the real story. The rest is merely the hell from which he must escape, and the dogs of hell he must out-run.<br /><br />Besides Rudy Youngblood, Raoul Trujillo turns in a powerful performance as Zero Wolf, Jaguar Paw's nemesis. Because of the subtitles, dialog is kept to a minimum in this Mel Gibson - Farhad Safina script. Production values are high throughout, with art direction taking center stage. Then there is the location: even though the jungle is lush, even though it is lovely at times, jungle life is harsh and brutal. My favorite scenes occur on a raging river. There is also a very good scene featuring a beautiful jaguar.<br /><br />Michael Medved gave this film four stars out of four. I would give it five out of five. It is exceptional. But it is not for everyone. Nothing is romanticized in this film, nothing is idealized. It is hard, cold reality - jungle style.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours.  The images include excessive violence (beheadings, punjee stake traps, genocidal type destruction of a village of people, brutalized slaves, etc) and concentrate more on chases than on drama.  But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.<br /><br />There is little story to tell.  A quiet and fearless tribe spends its time hunting, teasing a fellow tribesman about his infertility and making him the brunt of cruel jokes - just the ordinary camaraderie we are led to believe - until our main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hears a shudder in the jungle that results in his tribe being overtaken by a more aggressive, human sacrificing tribe.  The village is burned, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well, and he and the remaining villagers are taken into slavery and marched to the Mayan capital where they are sacrificed by Mayan priests to appease the gods to save their crumbling empire.  A sun eclipse saves Jaguar Paw, he escapes, and after an interminable chase through the jungle reunites with his wife and children just as the Spanish conquistadors sail into harbor.<br /><br />The cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson.  Outstanding among them are of course Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, Mar&iacute;a Isabel D&iacute;az, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias among others. But nearly as much credit goes to the costumer and hairpiece design (Mayes C. Rubeo) and to the set builders (Jay Aroesty) of the Mayan Temples.  Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way.  The problem lies with the lack of significant information about the fall of the Mayan Empire, one of the more advanced civilizations known: Gibson would have us see only the brutal savagery of a highly sophisticated body of people. A sad depiction of a great nation.

And that's what this movie delivers...big time.  It is very action packed and exciting.  The scenes of atrocity and violence are delivered pretty unflinchingly (as Mel Gibson likes to do)...although there is nothing as lingeringly graphic as the flaying scene in PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  It's just good, R-rated violence.  The chase scenes (and the last third of the movie is basically one long chase scene) are extremely well filmed, edited and performed.  It is impossible to dismiss Gibson as a director...his sense of action and pace is pretty darn good.<br /><br />The basic story of APOCALYPTO (one tribe, more powerful and "advanced" than the other, attacks and brutalizes the other tribe.  Plucky survivor must escape and suffer much peril to save his beloved family) could almost have been set anywhere.  I can see it in the middle-ages, in the Old West, modern day, in the future, etc. etc.  But Gibson latched on to the latter-days of the Mayan culture, and it's a great choice.  Yes, I believe he's trying to make a statement of some sort about caring for the land, or the crumbling of civilization, etc...but I just really loved seeing this society.  There really haven't been any major movies set during this time.  I was a HUGE fan of the book "Aztec" by Gary Jennings a couple of decades ago...and this movie is the closest thing to an evocation of that book than anything else ever put on screen.  When the prisoners (our heroes) are taken to a Mayan city, the careful depiction of their journey, from the "suburbs" to a kind of skid row, through "factories" into the religious / political heart of the city is just breathtaking.  I don't know how accurate it is...but it is transporting in every way.  You get a very visceral sense of what life is like in this community.  The art direction, costumes and CGI landscapes are seamless and endlessly creative.<br /><br />I've read a number of reviews that say Gibson really dwells on the scenes of human sacrifice (heads rolling down the stairs of the pyramids, hearts cut from still living bodies, etc.).  Most of the reviewers that criticized the violence also disliked the film...or disliked Mel Gibson.  My honest take on it is this:  the human sacrifice scenes are somewhat graphic...but we never actually see things like beheadings.  We see the sword come down, but not making contact.  Then the head is held up and rolled down the stairs.  I've seen worse stuff on CSI!  It's well done...but unlike PASSION, Gibson doesn't feel he needs to show us every detail in slow-motion.  Yes, it is violent, but I frankly had expected even more wallowing, and it was not bad at all.  R-rated, yes...without question.  But hardly earth-shaking either.<br /><br />And let me again say that the climactic sequences, involving the chase through the jungles is fast-paced, frightening at times, scary, sometimes funny and always heart-pounding.  It is very modern, yet it's also nicely old-school...almost like a high-tech, modern, color version of an old movie serial...where one cliffhanger after another concluded each episode.<br /><br />To me and to my wife, this was a highly satisfying movie-going experience.  I think Oscar nominations are in order for art direction, costumes, cinematography and editing (at least).  I wasn't thrilled with Mel Gibson's recent shenanigans...but don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of this film just because Gibson is borderline psychotic!!  He's also a great filmmaker.  To me, this is one of the top 10 movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Apocalypto is a reminder. Of who we really are. Of where we come from. Of where we're going. As we walk alongside Jaguar Paw into the Mayan city, past disease, decay, and delirium, we can see ourselves -- just another chapter in the sordid tale of man's inhumanity to man. Of course, our make up is a little different, and we mutilate our bodies differently, too. Even our human sacrifices are different; our victims tend to be pre-natal. And while our music and culture have a slightly different rhythm, we're every bit as ruthless, every bit the mob, every bit as deluded.<br /><br />If anyone had questions about Mel Gibson's directorial skills, they're answered here. Likewise, there's ample evidence of his infatuation with viscera, with explicit depictions of flesh being ripped, gouged, sliced, and chopped. It felt like an anatomy lesson at times, with everything from the reproductive tract to the circulatory system on display. I generally dislike gruesome scenes in life and in movies, but, frankly, these scenes serve a larger purpose in Gibson's films. He puts us face to face with mortality, the spurting, pulsing reality of our flesh and blood. The fact that we die. The fact that it isn't pretty. The fact, more importantly I think, of how and why we kill each other. We live in a brutal world, folks. Eat or be eaten. That's how it is, no matter how we insulate ourselves from it. Sure, Gibson has the camera linger for a beat or two beyond what may have been necessary, but there's no disputing the guy has an artist's vision. A bit of a torture artist, no doubt, but I'll take art like this over the standard movie theater junk that's out there any day of the week.<br /><br />Some viewers may have a hard time separating Apocalypto from events in Gibson's personal life. Too bad for them. I don't know what's in Gibson's heart. None of us do. Like all of us, he's got a bit of the bigot in him. Of course, put in the context of the hammering he got from folks who never even watched his last film, one might understand, slightly, the pathology of it. That's no excuse, of course, but human beings are strange, screwed up, and generally indefensible. Gibson's no exception. That, however, does not make his storytelling, and his insights, any less impressive.<br /><br />This is a fine film, a true meditation on the human condition, and a welcome respite from all those folks who see the world in black and white -- those, for example, who view the white Europeans as the murderous thugs who obliterated the peaceful Native Americans. The reality, of course, is that we're all brutal thugs, and skin color is no defense.<br /><br />I'm not sure, by the way, whether Gibson got the Mayans mixed up with the Aztecs. The Mayans were far less known for their human sacrifices, and it would be interesting to hear from academics on this. There are some other potential historical inaccuracies I won't go into so as to spare the spoilers. Frankly, the story rises above historical circumstance, so these questions ought not get in the way of the Gibson's powerful message.<br /><br />I'm not much of a religious man, but as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help but offer a silent prayer of the countless men and women who have died and suffered unspeakable brutality at the hands of their brothers and sisters. Not just the tens (or maybe hundreds) of thousands of Mayans and Aztecs stripped from their lives and marched to their horrifying ends, but so many others -- holocausts only varying in scale, skin color, and ethnicity.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Set against the backdrop of a lush and lively jungle landscape, APOCALYPTO is a film about the death of an empire, the fall of a civilization, the salvation of a family, and one man's struggle against fear.  The film opens with a group of hunters from a small village chasing a tapir.  One of the leaders of the hunt is the protagonist of the film, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  As the hunters are preparing the meat to take back to the village they are approached by a group of refugees who wish to pass through the forest.  The strangers' village was decimated by warriors from the city of stone and they are traveling to a different place for a "new beginning" (apocalypto).  The next morning Jaguar Paw's village is attacked and invaded by the warriors who had destroyed the refugees' village.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a hole, but he himself is taken captive.  The captives are brought to the city of stone and along the way a diseased-stricken girl prophesizes the destruction of the Mayan empire because of their sins:  slavery, human sacrifice, the raping of the Earth, etc.  In the city, the women captives are sold as slaves and the men are brought to a pyramid to be sacrificed.  Through a strange turn of events, Jaguar Paw's life is spared and he is able to escape.  Chased by a group of warriors filled with blood lust, he rushes through the jungle to rescue his family before the rains come to drown them.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is one of the best films I have seen this year.  It is a violent film and there are some minor inaccuracies (especially in regards to some of the architecture of the city of stone).<br /><br />Also, the film is subtitled because the characters speak in a Mayan dialect.  Nevertheless, none of this takes away from the power of the film.<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing.  The people, animals, and vegetation seem almost three-dimensional.  The scenery in the film is more vivid than any nature documentary that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Then there's the acting.  The actors' performances are quite remarkable, especially considering the film's location and the challenge of speaking in an almost dead language.  The central characters are rich and deep.  Watching the movie, a person becomes entangled in their lives.  Much of that is because of the acting, but some of it is because of the writing and directing, too.<br /><br />The storytelling uses everything from the Biblical Book of Revelation and the story of the Tower of Babel to epic Greek poems such as THE ILLIAD to John Rambo in FIRST BLOOD as allusions and references to firmly cement the film in our own shared and inherited cultural heritage.  Whatever one may think about his past public indiscretions, Mel Gibson is a gifted and talented filmmaker that should not be ignored.<br /><br />The story is not only engaging, but it is a powerful parable, too.  We might not, yet, live in a culture and society that is as violent as the Mayans, but we are guilty of many of the same sins.  We enslave people by not paying them decent wages for the jobs they perform and by paying powerful executives money they don't deserve, we sacrifice our children upon an alter called choice, and we rape the Earth in almost the same ways as the urban Mayans do in APOCALYPTO.  Like the city-dwelling Mayans in the film, we often choose to not only ignore what we do but the consequences of those actions as well.  This chosen ignorance means little because the results of those actions remain, reminding us of our sin and folly.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is a violent movie.  For example, men have their throats slit, people are beheaded, priests rip out peoples' hearts, heads literally roll down the stairs of a pyramid, and a man has his face chewed off by a jaguar.  It's all very bloody and slightly gory, yet it's not anywhere near as violent or gory as movies such as HOSTEL or SAW III.  Also, unlike those films the violence in APOCALYPTO isn't useless; it serves a purpose.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is a grand film.  Containing magnificent acting, brilliant direction, and amazing cinematography, as well as a plot that serves as a powerful parable for our time, it is one of the best movies of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>Apocalypto<br />Amazing movie.

Gibson's people made a successful effort at demonstrating a civilization totally alien from our own.  I loved the strange women, almost aliens from outer space.  I also like the slave raid.  For thousands of years inhabitants of the Americas experienced similar raids by war parties from the "civilized" nations on the continent.<br /><br />The slaving scene, for those who wish to look "under the covers", is the history of civilization in general.  Up until only a couple of centuries ago, slavery was simply a given and was not regarded as wrong.  The difference in MesoAmerica was that many of the captives, rather than being used for slave labor, went to fattening pens and to heart sacrifice.<br /><br />I liked the relationship between the slave captain and his son when he tells him after the successful slave capture.  "Your doing a great job, boy.  I'm proud of you."  Wonderful, really, and all so very human.  The final scene was great.  The warring Indians look out to sea and watch strange men with helmets and breastplates rowing into shore.  It's the Apocalypse.  The world WILL change.  Ironically, this film ends up almost exactly where my two novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--start...the glorious, terrible Conquest of Mexico.<br /><br />I thought the chase scene, although exciting, was a little too much "Last of the Mohicans."  It was good in "Mohicans" but once is enough.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, "Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This is a good action movie.

Although I have had an oportunity to visit the pyramids in Mexico and Central America and have seen Discovery and History channels specials on Mayas and Aztecs I was always relatively disturbed that the TV specials had a lot of PC (political correctness) control over the production.<br /><br />Apocalyptico is an in your face depiction of the exteremely advance, intelligent and perverted bloodthirsty societies that both the Aztecs and the Mayans really were in their day. If I had any slight disappointment it would be that the city depicted in the movie, the temples, residences and most of all the pyramids were much much smaller than real life. I would guess that they couldn't film in some of the larger well known historical sites and had to build the set themselves. It does not take away from the movie but I only make this comment to emphasize the real horror of the Mayan history.<br /><br />This movie is so violent it's pornographic. The sexual abuse of the women is glossed over in this film, also to it's detriment cause I would guess Gibson probably thought enough with the violence that he will have to deal with never mind any explicit rapes etc.....<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you want to understand this culture then read 'Aztec Summer' by Gary Jennings, (not Aztec Bllod by the same author  ... the book is a dog). This is a novel with the most fabulously and for the most part historically correct depiction of the Aztecs, and of course to the same extent the Maya and their bloothirsty rituals.<br /><br />To give you an understanding, as you watch the sacrifices at the Mayan temple in this movie, the Aztecs did the same sacrifices when they conquered warring armies that they actually were killing people 24 hours a day for periods of more than 10 years!<br /><br />Finally, for those of us that have visual memories, the chase and the hunt does not diminish the impression of the sacrifices. It most certainly is not a film for the weak of heart or young people, and by that I meand under 30 for goodenss sakes.[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO lives up to all the hype.  Long anticipated but frequently dismissed as "Gibson's Folly," the movie opened at #1 but ticket receipts quickly plummeted.  That's a pity,for while there are indeed a number of excellent films to choose from this holiday season, few of them are as good as this one.  Yes, it is violent--extremely violent.  But this is not the visceral near-pornography of a bad horror movie--the violence of APOCALYPTO serves a vision of cinematic artistry, and if certain scenes are not easy to watch, the film as a whole remains impossible to turn away from.<br /><br />Set in the ancient Mayan Empire on the brink of discovery by the white man, APOCALYPTO is the story of Jaguar Paw, a young hunter of the forest who is loving husband, father, and son.  He and his family and friends live peacefully in the depths of a great forest until the tranquility of their sheltered existence is pitilessly wiped out by a band of brutal marauders led by the bestial Zero Wolf.  Taken into captivity and brought to the city to be sacrificed to the Mayan gods, Jaguar Paw escapes into the dark jungle, determined to return to his wife and son and make a new beginning for themselves.  It is, like Joseph Conrad's immortal novella, a quest into the very heart of darkness, and Jaguar Paw and his world will never be the same again.<br /><br />Taut, engrossing, and incredibly thrilling, APOCALYPTO delivers on many levels.  As an action movie alone it is a success, but that ignores the thoughtfulness and care that has gone into the script and direction.  This is one of those stories that can perhaps be interpreted in many equally valid terms, and the parallels between the Babylonesque Mayan culture and our own are indeed frightening.  Gibson deserves much praise for his artistic vision--something few contemporary directors seem to have--but it would be a crime not to likewise praise his cast.  Rudy Youngblood is exceptional and empathetic as the benighted Jaguar Paw, and Dalia Hernandez is just as good as his young wife, whose own subplot of self-discovery, courage and faith is a vital element of the broader story.  Raoul Trujillo's Zero Wolf is one of the great villains of movie history, and to put it mildly you have to love to hate him.  The supporting players are well-rounded and handle their various roles believably and uniformly well--the cast as a whole may be unknown, but unknown or not, they're very good.<br /><br />Thriller, drama, social commentary--all these things and more, APOCALYPTO is a tribute to the power of story and its power to capture the essence of reality.  Certainly not for everyone, APOCALYPTO is at times painful to watch, and children definitely do not need to be exposed to it.  Even so, APOCALYPTO is a grand achievement, and impossible not to recommend to discerning adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I don't believe I have ever been disappointed with a Mel Gibson movie, but this one came close.  Like "The Passion", Gibson immerses the viewer in an epic tale and an exotic culture, complete with original languages and subtitles.  The visual beauty of the production is undeniable, and the human drama of the story is played out with stark, often gut-wrenching intensity.<br /><br />Counterbalancing these strengths is, in my opinion, a shallowness to the story and the main characters.  The indomitable spirit of Jaguar Paw is the key feature, coupled closely with his love for his wife and son.  These attributes are expressed by a defiance and tenacity both in battle and in capture, as well as in the seemingly endless pursuit sequence that dominates the second half of the movie and, quite frankly, gets more than a little old after about the first 20 or 30 minutes.  Yet on and on it drags until the final predictable defeat of the pursuers and rescue of his family.<br /><br />Overall I would rate this movie as definitely worth watching, both for the excellence of the production and the tragic drama it portrays.  I have no idea how much of the story is true to the history of Mayan civilization, but Gibson certainly paints a believable picture.  In short, Gibson had in his hands the materials for a great movie, but did not maximize the opportunity.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalyto" follows one man's brutal journey in Mayan times from his quiet, peaceful village to hell and back again.<br /><br />The film has much going for it - excellent acting, makeup, costumes, production design, visual effects - which really makes you feel like you are there - but is let down by a cliched plot that contains a few too many coincidences.<br /><br />It is also extremely brutal and continues Gibson's obsession with human suffering following on from "Braveheart" and "The Passion of the Christ".</p></br><a href="../users/APW72P4COWTBK.html">APW72P4COWTBK</a><br/><p>This movie is the exact same thing of the 1965 movie The Naked Prey.

That Little Something Extra being heart-ripping sacrifices. You know, for a good cause, like, uh, combating global warming. Check it out.<br /><br />APOCA-LONGO REVIEW: To ascend to the top of the blood-drenched, gore-caked stone steps of the cinematic ziggurat of zaniness that is Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto", it's necessary to step back a bit, take a deep breath, put down that enemy warrior's heart, drop the statue of Camazotz, and listen up: you gotta get down with Mad Mal first!<br /><br />What do I mean by that? I mean, quite simply, that Mel's work has always orbited, well, Mel. Each of us is a work in progress (except for liberals, who are spat forth pristine & perfect from their mama's hairpouch), but the fun thing about Mel Gibson is how we can relate the Man to his Movies. Consider the Evolution of Mel:<br /><br />Pulp Fiction Mel: the rangy, handsome Australian actor with a very identifiable Aussie accent, the lone wolf set against the arid, apocalyptic Outback of "Mad Max" and the "Road Warrior".<br /><br />Big Budget Mel: here Mel got some Jesus. Wait, that came later. Here, Mel got some Big Budget Hollywood. He played the Edgy, Crazy, Suicidal, Hair-Trigger .45-eating cop in "Lethal Weapon", ying to Danny Glover's yang. Happily Mel metamorphosed into something interesting, whereas Glover is know to whine about not being able to get a cab ride in Manhattan.<br /><br />Serious Actor Mel: Serious! Thespian! Mel! Yes! Mel walked the boards as the most somber Prince, which gave him some heft and gravitas---and set him on the weird, somber, intriguing art which catapulted him into the bosom of Quetzalcoatl---without forcing him to find himself balding, poor, and wrinkled, and still having to walk the boards as, I dunno, Polonius, at age 67.<br /><br />Director Mel: look, man, it's cool to be a Star: you've got, well I dunno, swimming pools. And Bel-Air. And 12-Martini lunches with production dudes. And mountains of coke on glass tables. And Spago! And LA's own Adam's Rib (for Stars): Star-Lets. But it gets old having to bow & scrape before old hairy (Jewish) crabby angry balding hideously wealthy (Jewish) movie producers.<br /><br />So Mel turned out the poigant "Man without a Face", blew everybody away with "Braveheart", and really switched it up with "Passion of the Christ", essentially a snuff film featuring Jesus. Word.<br /><br />Dead Languages Director Mel: Dead Languages=Serious Business. OK, I cheated. "Passion" counts here; so does 'Apocalypto'. I hear his next is gonna be shot using English in LA.<br /><br />And thus we come to MAD MEL yet again, only this time he's not walking the irradiated badlands of Australia firing shells at biker punks, but crawling and puking along the side of the Pacific Coast Highway, snarling epithets at Jews.<br /><br />Anyway, "Apocalypto" is Mad Mel as Montezuma's revenge! It's a gore-caked period piece chock full of hungry jaguars, nekkid chicks, nekkid ziggurats, nekkid high priests with old man bajoobalies, a wife in a well, a rugrat in a well, extra-curricular cruel contests on the Pelota fields, and blood sacrifice.<br /><br />It's even shot in ancient Mayan, which heightens the authenticity. I mean, imagine if Jaguar Paw was emoting in, say, San Fernando Valleyspeak? Wouldn't be the same. Besides, being shot in Mayan makes it more accessible to the largely Mayan audience watching it. Domo Arigato Mr. Apocalypto!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: it's an astonishing creation. For me, though, I think it was astonishing for the wrong reason: for hours thereafter I was in a kind of weird fugue or reverie, imagining myself clad in parrot feathers and a surplice of human ears and tongues, and a crown made of an ocelot's jaw, my body painted, an avatar of Camazotz, tearing out the hearts of my sacrifices!<br /><br />Sorry, where was I? Oh yeah, the story.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" tells the story of Jaguar Paw and his family, who live a life of near Edenic tranquility hunting the lands Paw's forefathers hunted for generations, until a bunch of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin everything!<br /><br />Just kidding. Actually, Paw & Fils get dragooned by a Mayan hunting party (who took the injunction "BYOB" to a whole new level) and frogmarched to Tikal for fun and games. Actually, very little fun. Or games. Primarily Death.<br /><br />And so we follow Jaguar Paw and his captured tribe to the great Mayan temple city, where the Mayans are living with each other, and the Earth Mother, in harmony, save for the occasional heart ripping sacrifice---ah, multiculturalism!---until a band of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />OK, kidding. Anyway, just like "Passion", "Apocalypto" is spare, brooding, beautiful, and complete in itself. Director Mel has some magic in his fingers & in his camera lens.<br /><br />And more to the point: Apocalypto demonstrates that while Man in the state of Nature may not be nasty, brutal & short, Man in the state of Civilization often means having to wear your Heart on your sleeve.<br /><br />Literally.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Whether you like Mel Gibson or not, one has to admit that he, as a director, is one of the few names that will grab your attention completely when attached to a film.  I guarantee that both those people who love Mel and those who hate him know all there is to know about Apocalypto whether they have seen it or not.  And the sad thing is that a lot of people will not see this film simply because of who the director is, and that's a shame.<br /><br />I love Mel Gibson.  Braveheart might be the best film of the '90s.  Passion was one of the most raw, gutwrenching, unflinching films I have ever seen.  And Apocalypto follows those two films with another obscure yet applicable tale that only Mel Gibson could tell, and tell it so unbelievably well.<br /><br />At the beginning, we are introduced to Jaguar Paw, who lives in a small, peaceful village seemingly apart from the rest of the Mayan world.  On a hunt one morning, Jaguar Paw's group encounters a group of "refugees" in an extremely haunting sequence.  These refugees have obvious fear in their eyes, and only want to pass through the grounds to make a new beginning for themselves far away.  Shortly after this encounter, Jaguar Paw's village is attacked by a tribe of ruthless Mayans who seek to capture most members of the village for who knows what.  During the melee, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a hole on the outskirts of the village before he is eventually captured.  Once Jaguar Paw is captured, we go on a journey with him to a disturbing, captivating vision of what the Mayan civilization had come to at its end times.  The journey to the Mayan city takes up most of the film, and encompasses most of the film's message, which could be taken many different ways.  After certain events have occurred in the city, the film turns into a massive chase sequence through the  Mayan jungle, and a final payoff/ambiguous ending that once again speaks clearly as to why Mel Gibson must be respected as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Apocalypto is a film that is not only drenched in its director's vision, but it is also helped immensely by the presence of that vision.  The brutality of some Mayan tribes must be present here to help us understand how bad it was, and the violence in the film does a lot to help us understand it.  By no means is the violence pointless, but it is extremely graphic and brutal; what else would we expect from Mel?<br /><br />I've read reviews about the film that say that Jaguar Paw is Jesus.  Some have said that it is Mel's statement against the war in Iraq.  Others have said it is a statement about our social culture.  The bottom line is that every viewer can have their own interpretation of the film, and that is what makes it so great.  Mel Gibson, as a director, demands that we think and interpret for ourselves.  As a viewer, you are being asked a lot to sit through this film.  It's all in subtitles to Mayan dialect.  The violence is brutal and disgusting to some.  The film is long, as is necessary for it to resolve its story through its own volition.<br /><br />One of the film's sequences will haunt me for a long time to come.  On the journey to the city, the captors and captives encounter a small girl who is infected with "the sickness."  As they pass the girl, and treat her like they would a diseased animal, her appearance/demeanor changes and she proceeds to give them a long, detailed, doom-filled prophecy.  This sequence is stunning, and absolutely haunting, for many reasons that can't even be explained.  It just needs to be experienced.<br /><br />So whether you like Mel Gibson or not, enjoy the experience of watching one of his films while you still can.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Interesting setting for a story that is not new.  This time using a village of Mayas about the time of the Spanish arrival to, I am assuming, Mexico (Cancun perhaps?).  The peaceful village where everybody seems to be happy and where the men have hunted for generations, get their first inkling of trouble when a beraggled group of other Mayans seem anxious to get across the hunting grounds of the village.  Apparently they are fleeing from some unknown fierce enemy.<br /><br />That night as the village sleeps they are overrun by a band of outlaws who kill all who resist and truss up all others.  The main character of the village (they don't seem to have any names though one of the bad guys calls him "Almost") hides his pregnant wife in a deep hole along with his son.  He promises her he will be back to get them but is immediately captured by the baddies himself.<br /><br />The villagers are forced to march tied up.  The leader of the bad guys doesn't want any of them killed so the audience figures they are going to be sold into slavery.  As it turns out some will be sold as slaves while others will be sacrificed.<br /><br />When the main character escapes he is pursued by a horde of bad guys intent on killing him.  It is up to him to stay alive long enough and get back to where he left his wife and child before the oncoming rain will drown them.<br /><br />Why this is not a new tale, is because the way he is chased by the bad guys and how he deals with them, has been seen in many action flicks in the past.<br /><br />The movie is a good action tale and the use of subtitles is no problem.  Not quite five stars but pretty good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>A true cinematic achievement in costumes, makeup, and the overall recreation of an ancient setting is overshadowed by the orgiastic violence.  I almost did not make it through the movie.  If you are delighted by films like Saw and Hostel, you will love Apocalypto.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a Lord Of the Flies type hunt of a terrified tapir through the jungle, five youths hot on its heels.  The animal's death is horrific and not immediate.  A subsequent raid on a happy village is traumatic, with an infant being ripped from it's mother's arms and dangled like a doll.  Later, a human sacrifice has his heart ripped out and held aloft, still beating.  They don't just show it once, but twice, all from the terrified victim's p.o.v.  None of the characters except the main one, Jaguar Paw, are saved from slaughter.<br /><br />The costumes, makeup, Mayan language script, and the authentic pyramid show how much work went into making the movie.  Nothing like this was ever done before.  Gibson wanted to set the viewer right into another time.  It does have that feeling, but the first three-quarters are truly more a horror film than an action movie.  If you can make it through, the last quarter is a great action movie and the viewer can finally cheer.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>Apocalypto is at times an energetic and kinetic chase film set in the jungles of Central America.  Worth a watch, and enjoyable for the most part, it does feature several drawbacks that hamper one's enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the movie is just too damn long.  It seems to take forever for Jaguar Paw and his fellow raiders to get to the top of the pyramid (right before the best-timed eclipse ever) so that the real meat of the movie can begin.  Character development is nice, but the journey to the pyramid seems to take forever and bad pacing never helps one's enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Even more annoying was the gigantic plot hole that made no sense to me whatsoever.  You see, before being captured Jaguar Paw lowered his wife and child down into a giant pit in the ground so that the rival tribe wouldn't kill/rape them.  About halfway through the movie the pit starts filling up with water, which the audience is supposed to view as a bad thing that increases tension and gives Jaguar Paw urgency to get back home.  Why?  The water should A. let his wife and child live longer, as it will allow them to drink and B. allow them to reach the surface when the pit fills all the way.  Instead we're supposed to believe they're in danger of drowning--why?  They live right near a river and the gulf of mexico: they know how to swim and how to tread water.  Sure it might make sleeping somewhat difficult, but they should be in no immediate danger whatsoever.  Poor writing by Gibson in what is otherwise an interesting, if somewhat poorly paced film</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The insensitive Mel Gibson, while devoid of many social graces is nonetheless an extremely talented director.  His captivating spectacle "Apocalypto" filmed in the lush, verdant jungles of Mexico, is a depiction of the clash of culture and civilization within the 15th century Mayan empire.  Filmed with a minimum of dialogue, the cinematographically stunning flick expresses it's points well.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw played by Rudy Youngblood, is a hunter in a forest dwelling hunting and gathering society in a peaceful jungle village.  His tribe's existense is shattered when a group of marauding warriors led by Zero Wolf played by Raul Trujillo, sack and pillage his village.  A large group of prisoners are restrained and taken on a dangerous journey to a great stone architected Yucatan city.  There they will toil as slaves or serve as human sacrifices for the gods.  Meanwhile Jaguar Paw had hidden his pregnant wife Seven and young son Turtles Run during the attack in a deep pit within a stone chasm and vowed to return to them.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw was chosen to be sacrificed and slathered in blue pigment to prepare him.  He gets a fortunate stay of execution by virtue of a previously foretold solar eclipse.<br /><br />He miraculously manages to escape, killing chief warrior Zero Wolf's son in the process.  This results in an exciting heart pounding pursuit through the jungle, reminiscent of the film "The Naked Prey", as Jaguar Paw heads back to his family.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the film, we see that although the Mayan civilization had commenced decaying from within, the truly acknowledged destroyers of this culture has begun to arrive, the Spanish conquistadors.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>In relation to his film "Apocalypto," Mel Gibson is quoted as saying, "The precursors to a civilization that's going under are the same, time and time again ..." I completely understood this statement as I left the theater; no matter where you live, no matter what your circumstances in life, no matter how "civilized" or "primitive" a culture, a society is still vulnerable to decline. What makes all the difference is whether or not it comes from within. This is the very idea the film is founded on, focusing on two different tribes of the Mayan civilization engaged in conflict. It raises some questions: would the Ancient Mayans have continued to prosper had they not been in turmoil? Would they have been able to resist the Spanish invasion if they were united instead of divided? These underlying themes of change made this one of the most unique experiences I've had at the movies.<br /><br />The word "apocalypto" is derived from Greek, translating as "I reveal." Many things are appropriately revealed is this film, most notably the fact that the basic human instincts of survival, love, fear, and hatred are universal; despite the exotic locals and the intense action, I felt a connection with the main characters that transcended such details. The story primarily focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young Mayan hunter living peacefully in a village with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandaz), and his little boy, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). One morning, the village is brutally invaded by a warrior tribe. It's a nasty sight to behold: women are beaten and raped; children are forcefully dragged away; more than a couple of throats are slit. The physically capable adults are bound together, ready to be taken back to the opposing tribe's village.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is one such captive. Luckily, he manages to save his wife and child by lowering them into a cave, one with many nooks and crannies for hiding. While the audience has no way of knowing how the situation will unfold, they still get the feeling that he knows he'll return for them. We certainly hope that that will be the case, especially when the opposing city is finally revealed. In this bustling metropolis: we see powder-coated slaves building massive structures; we see women being sold at auction; we see the men being painted blue; we see severed heads rolling down the steps of a looming pyramid serving as a sacrificial alter. Jaguar Paw is one of many captives scheduled for this fate, supposedly in the belief that their deaths will appease the gods and bring an end to a widespread famine. As he watches his companions' hearts being ripped out and heads being chopped off, he realizes something: he's not yet ready to go.<br /><br />Almost as soon as he comes to this realization, the solar eclipse darkens the sky, meaning that the gods' thirst for blood has been quenched (or so they would like to believe). Already, the more suspicious tribe members consider it the first sign of a prophecy, one described earlier by a little girl stricken with smallpox. This was the one scene in the entire film I had trouble understanding, despite the fact that it was a very effective scene; we first see her as a lonely soul who only wants some comfort. But after she's shunned for being ill, she starts spouting warnings as if she were a fortuneteller. She says that doom will follow the darkness of the sun, and that the man who runs with the jaguar will meet with a dark fate. I wondered whether or not this character was intended to be the creepy predictor of bad events; that seems a little too convenient for the plot.<br /><br />Still, she adds a nice touch of mystery to the story, and her warnings serve as perfect counterpoints to the inevitable chase sequence between Jaguar Paw and members of the rival tribe. At that point, the film becomes a full-blown action picture, full of heart pounding stunts and dangerous encounters (namely with a mother jaguar attempting to protect her cub). It's actually quite exciting to watch, considering Seven and Turtles Run are still waiting at the bottom of a cave. In order to reach his family, Jaguar Paw has to be quick, cunning, and merciless, pretty much to the point of becoming the enemy. Here's an interesting parallel: in order to return to the peaceful life he once knew, he has behave in ways that are anything but peaceful.<br /><br />Again, the theme of change is alluded to, and it's made implicitly clear by the arrival of the conquistador ships. Whether or not Jaguar Paw survives his ordeal, whether or not his family will pull through, it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same; it's a new beginning. Subtler images reinforce this idea, such as the birth of Jaguar Paw's second son in the midst of a flood (brought on by a torrential rainstorm). It seemed to me that "Apocalypto" was intentionally meant to be symbolic, with less attention devoted to story. But don't get the wrong idea; a definite story is being told. However, it's so basic that it's easily overshadowed by the thematic elements. At its core, it's a Daring Escape fable. But it's surrounded by a wealth of more complex ideas, specifically humanistic ones. This was a wise move on Mel Gibson's part; he's crafted a genuinely intriguing film, rich in detail and integrity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is just an interesting film to watch. With most people knowing little to nothing about the Mayan civilization, this film is an eye opener for just about everyone. The visuals, costumes, make-up, and acting are all so good you will often feel like you are watching actual history on film, rather than just another hollywood epic. Mel Gibson has crafted a movie that should be around come Oscar time, especially in the technical categories.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>Very original,probly the most original film I've seen.I was very surprised at how great this movie is,very good filmaking.Action,adventure beginning to end.Buy,watch,enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>A village of hunter/gatherers in the primordial rain forest are savagely overwhelmed and either killed or captured by forces of the great "civilization" of the time, who lead the survivors back to their city to perform blood sacrifices to appease the mob and perpetuate a corrupted society on the verge of collapse.  One man escapes and races back through the jungle, with pursuers hot on his heels, in order to save the wife and child he had hidden before the attack.<br /><br />There are many ways this film could have been executed, most of them badly.  When I first heard Mel Gibson was making this film and had opted to have the dialogue in (I assume) the actual language of the people's with subtitles, it sounded nuts.  But Mel dared to do it and trusted his film-making craft to do the rest.  And he has succeeded in spades.<br /><br />A wild and intense chase film, done with astonishing skill and cleverness, amid the background of a thorougly imagined time and culture, it grabbed and held my interest throughout.  This is why I still go to the movies.  To be taken someplace in time and geography I could never see for myself.  It's also why I read books.<br /><br />First let me say I did not find the violence excessive.  I thought it was appropriate to the story and not overly dwelt upon.  Mel cuts away when he needs to, and he may have had an extra spray of blood or so, but I actually found more over-the-top violence in The Patriot, a movie Mel was in, but didn't direct.  I did think The Passion was too much, but I'm not reviewing that film. As another reviewer said the various CSI's on TV are sometimes gorier.<br /><br />What I found was a completely engaging film of imagined history, remarkable in its production values, and directed with energy and passion.  That you can draw inferences from the depiction of simple and gentle and all too human life in the village versus the excesses and corruption and degeneracy, albeit just as human, in the Mayan city, is only icing. Mel doesn't explain the reasons for their decline, he just presents it; there to think about at no extra cost.  And, a final irony regarding the clash of cultures rounds out the film's question as to what is truly civilized and what is savage.<br /><br />Many reviews I've read seem to be reviewing, or should I say reviling, Mel Gibson.  Gee, might his Malibu episode have something to do with that?  If we start judging artists works by their despicable personal behavior, we can begin emptying out the museums, libraries, art galleries, and film archives.  This film stands on its own terms, and it is a fine & daring piece of work.  Entertaining and with an added something else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>There are two features you can now expect from a Mel Gibson film:  It will be big, and and it will be bloody.  'Braveheart,' 'The Passion of Christ,' and, now 'Apocalypto' all are violent in epic proportions.  'Apocalypto' is startlingly savage.  This time we have the historical fiction presented with a happy Mayan village.  Complete with warriors and hunters we are given some colorful characters--not just from their face paint--including a misfit who isn't able to provide fertility.  One day they unsuspectingly come across another tribe--one that will provide menace for the sleeping village.  They are later raped and pillaged, and the survivors are shackled under a common yoke.  We find that they are brought to Mayan civilization where they will be made a sacrifice to their pagan god to appease all misfortune, including crop disasters.<br /><br />The presentation is certainly remarkable enough as the village hero, Jaguar's Paw, escapes on a harrowing journey that reminds one of the most urgent rendering of 'Lord of the Flies' that's yet to be presented.  The startling savagery comes to the fore with fearless detail.  The cinematography is masterful and their predicament is framed in every scene.  Some of the moon shots and New Age wind instrumentation is reminiscent of 'The Passion of Christ,' but 'Apocalypto' is a group project with a whole tribe in view--even if one hero is its focal point.  Anguish and a sweeping chase are skillfully presented in yet another Mel masterpiece.<br /><br />(Hollywood has presented two opposing viewpoints this year, whose contrast is a telling dichotomy.  There's 'The Da Vinci Code' and Professor Teabing's take that Constantine (an ancient and non-fiction historical figure) and Silas (a modern but fictional character) represent the strife and brutality that Christianity has dispensed in its two thousand year history.  And, then there's Mel's portrayal of one pagan civilization that was brutal until it was tamed by Spanish conquistadors.  A telling contrast.)</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Credit to Gibson's vision.  However, when people rave about how brutal and violent a movie is, I expect brutal violence.  This film was neither brutal nor violent, considering the context.  It was extremely reserved compared to what it could have been.  I applaud Gibson's dedication to reality and using the original dialect, however, this tactic detracts from being able to adequately develop characters.  This is a film that should have been 90 minutes or 3 hours.  As it was, it should have been 90 minutes of action/drama.  I would have preferred a film that was 3 hours long that presented characters that I actually cared about.  How can I care whether a guy gets his heart cut out, if I don't even know anything about that character?  This film could have been so much more.  I was disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>It just amazes me how it is possible to shoot a film that's longer than two hours with subtitles, with no - let alone stars - with no rather well-known actors, which would have you glued to your seat for all its length. Nothing's impossible for Mel Gibson I guess. I really like this transition of his to the director's path, and with four films behind his back he became one of the most notable contemporary directors like Clint Eastwood once did.<br /><br />It's amazing how Gibson can make a popular film but still deliver his idea to the audience. The scent of apocalypse didn't leave me during the whole movie and that's quite an achievement of the filmmakers. Today we used to think (and it's not for nothing) Maya civilization was one of the most developed one of the ancient world, Mayans were great architects, they had science, they had a calendar etc. And I repeat our thoughts on this didn't come just out of nowhere. Mayans were all that. But Apocalypto adds some coloration to the theme. The pyramids people admire today at the time of Mayan bloom were reddened with blood of those sacrificed for Mayan gods. Along with being quite civilized in today's terms, they had slavery and they killed ruthlessly. But this was the world back then. It was a time when death was a common thing, it was all around and no one actually paid attention. It was a time when war was all a grown up man could occupy himself with. Those were the rules. And this apocalyptic feeling appearing during the film is an ingenious Gibson's intent. It was the end of Mayan civilization and you can feel it. It was the civilization that killed itself from the inside with endless murder and cruelty. Spaniards just finished what Mayans started themselves. This is the apocalypse that takes place before our eyes - we see just a couple of days of life of a great people, but we can see its whole history in these couple of days.<br /><br />Of course Apocalypto is violent. I wouldn't say it's extremely violent but right to that extent to show us what was the everyday reality at that time. We see beheadings and hearts being ripped out at the top of a Mayan sacrifice temple, combat scenes that are even more graphic than those in Braveheart, less mass though. We see a huge pit just out of the city limits filled with bodies of people sacrificed... Sure all these scenes are not gratuitous. And miraculously you don't feel they offend you or they are out of place. If you take them within the whole story, attached to the time all the action takes place in, you start percepting them like they are quite natural. Like all this violence was natural for Maya people.<br /><br />Apocalypto is made this way so that you can fully experience everything that happens and feel like you are one of the people that lived at that period. When after the first hour of the film that predominantly took part in the forest I saw the Mayan city made of stone, I gasped along with the movie's characters who saw it for the first time in their lives.<br /><br />The second part of Apocalypto reminds some action movie, but still the picture doesn't fail to convey its message. If we look closer we see our society is not far from what Maya were. But the more they made it on the road of civilization the closer to the end they were. Looks quite nowdays to me. As it is said in the beginning (not sure if it's verbatim) - civilizations are not destroyed externally, they destroy themselves from the inside. And Gibson's film is quite a vivid example to this phrase.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>****Spoilers****<br /><br />What a show this movie was.... it thrusts us into the spirit of the Ancient Maya, and restrains nothing in its telling of the tale, which is quite simple in itself.<br /><br />A young man, Jaguar Paw, with a pregnant wife and a young son, goes hunting Tapir for food in the forest, when they come across a horde of people passing through. They tell him their village was ravaged, and while the others listen and simply move on to the village resuming their lives, the encounter with these people haunts Jaguar Paw.<br /><br />Rightfully so, as a mere day later, the same people come and ravage his village. They attack the men, kill those who resist, and enslave all save the children, who they simply leave behind to follow their parents in tears until they cannot follow any longer.<br /><br />Along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as "He who runs with the Jaguar".<br /><br />Enslaved, they are taken to a great city made of stone, where one by one the women are sold into slavery, and the men are taken to the top of a great temple to be sacrificed to the Gods, as these people fear that their Gods are displeased, and their end approaches.<br /><br />Just as Jaguar Paw is to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse takes place which the High Priest interprets as the Gods' satisfaction, and lets Jaguar Paw live.<br /><br />The slavers then take the remaining captives to an empty arena-like field, and release the captives two at a time, telling them to try to run away into the forests, while they shoot at them from behind with slings, arrows, and javelin, and with the son of the Chief acting as "Finisher" to kill the men as they attempt to crawl away, dying from their wounds.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is shot through the side by an arrow, and just as he is to be killed, his friend (who had been shot down earlier) attacks the Chief's son, and Jaguar Paw is able to break off the arrowhead and kill him with it, before running off into the jungle. The chief and his men chase him.<br /><br />They chase Jaguar Paw all throughout the jungles, and as they do, all of the diseased girl's prophecies come true. Jaguar Paw is being chased by a Jaguar whose cub he accidentally encountered and disrupted, and as one of the men catches up to Jaguar Paw, he is attacked and killed by the cat.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is running back to his village, as he has left his wife and child inside a deep stony cave in the ground to save them as the villagers are enslaved.<br /><br />One by one, he devises traps and weapons to kill his enemies, before he can rescue his wife. It begins to rain, and the hole is filling with water.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw kills all but two of the men, but is saved when he flees to the beach, and the two pursuers are frozen in their places, astonished at the sight of men in gigantic ships approaching the beach.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is able to flee and rescue his wife and child, where they retreat into the forest to find a new beginning...<br /><br />The plight of Jaguar Paw was very deeply human, and the acting was richly superb with light, but not sparse dialogue, and a gamut of emotions being run through all the characters, whose facial expressions and cries of anguish, pain, joy, or pleasure tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece.<br /><br />It wasn't until recently that I became aware of the historical inaccuracies abound in this film, but this doesn't at all detract from the impact of this film.  After all, it's a personal story of one man's struggle to save his family.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>this is a very good movie. very concentrated and intense. but when you watched the storyline unraveled, you  might have suddenly realized that you were watching the renewed 'rambo' from the '80s. even the fighting scenes, chasing sequences and the outcomes were almost the same. this is a well directed movie. forget about other viewers' yadayadayada, don't go too deep and try to interpret the meaning, historical or not, mel gibson or what. don't bother. just take it easy and watch it as an action packed, well developed, well directed, edited and most of all, well performed thriller. chopping heads, digging out hearts, mel gibson just threw the whole 9 yards to you, if you think it's too gross, too bloody, too cruel, just walk out and walk away. ever remember 'if you can't stand the heat, just get out of the kitchen'. this is what you have to remember all the time.<br /><br />why you have to burden yourself and try to seek anything meaningful out of every movie you've watched.<br /><br />this is just another version of 'rambo' in a different background, that's all.<br /><br />and, by the way, if mr. gibson likes it, he could develop this movie into a 007 or mission impossible like franchise, let the hero fight another day against the spaniards as a sequel, who knows.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>This is the story of a Mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well.

I'm still looking forward to more movies from Mel Gibson but in the end I wish I had just stayed home this time around.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is not a normal movie but a big make-up movie...<br /><br />From the moment the film starts to the moment it ends you feel you are transported into the ancient Mayan civilization, seeing full body tattoos, body art, multiple piercing and jewelry... It is a very exciting motion picture to look at, so strange to watch... It has the esthetic that began to appeal and it fills you with wonder...<br /><br />Our hero Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a cunning hunter whose father requests him not to tell of what he saw in forest today... He is warned to strike fear from his heart and not to bring it into the village...His wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez) is pregnant, and their small son, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez), live modestly in a village surrounded by a tranquil rain forest...<br /><br />After a night of frivolity, the peaceful existence of this small community of hunters collapses when savage outsiders begin torching and burning everything in sight killing most and taking away dozens left...<br /><br />Going undetected, Jaguar Paw hides his wife and child in a deep, waterless well promising to return when the attack has passed... However when he is captured by his fearsome aggressors, he is tied to a pole and marched with his friends and fellow villagers to a forsaken land, stone-built, where the earth bleeds...<br /><br />A fortuitous switch provides Jaguar Paw with an unexpected opportunity to escape and get back to his family in peril... But for that he has to make his way home through a killing field and a dangerous jungle, racing against sadistic captors hot on his trail...<br /><br />"Apocalypto" transports the viewers to a strange and unreachable world, to a civilization in decline, to an infernal vision of a city and its inhabitants, to shocking images of human barbarism which has always existed throughout the ages...</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>An enjoyable aspect of Mel Gibson's Apocolypto is that it is not your typical action film. It boasts no real big star names, and doesn't fall in love with itself like some films do. It simply tells a story. It could have been just another brainless action flick, but instead strives to illustrate the essence of one man's attempts at survival while using a Mayan civilization as the setting.  One tribe's fate is in jeopardy when the unthinkable happens: they become enslaved and the targets of a ritual sacrifice.<br /><br />To get this point over with, the movie is quite grisly, barbaric, graphic or whatever other word which successfully describes a lot of blood and death. There are scenes of some of Jaguar Paw's fellow tribesmen being beheaded, as well as many scenes of warriors being speared, impaled or killed in various other ways. There are even scenes of corpses rotting. I'm not one who relishes the idea of watching this type of thing, but I don't think that the barbarism in the film debunks the real story at hand. Another way to say this is: there is a point to the violence, and it in no way effects or tries to "steal the show" of the film's real essence: the struggle of Jaguar Paw (and others) to escape and get back to their land.<br /><br />What Gibson is able to achieve in many parts of this film is a fast-paced, yet mysterious and eerie atmosphere. There are moments, like at the film's beginning, when the quiet tranquility of the tribe's home is juxtaposed by the intrusion and ruthlessness of the other clan. There are also moments when Jaguar Paw is frantically running for his life in the brush, and then moments where he is quietly hiding with others hunting within feet of him, using his instincts as a warrior for escape. Also, the scenery of the forest really intensifies the feeling of the unknown, or danger lurking just beyond the next step. There are many chase scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel yourself rooting for Jaguar Paw to make it back to his wife and kid as the rain starts pouring.<br /><br />If you can forgive Gibson for his shady reputation and just take in this film, I think you will find his film quite original, and scenery impressive for the film's mood. It was refreshing to see a film that tries to be different, original and a little bit intelligent to boot, something you seldom see in action films anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>After The Passion, I was hoping Mel Gibson would spend the rest of his life redoing Biblical stories because the non-violent scenes in The Passion were immaculate, but we cannot control the direction an artist takes--nor should we want to. Here, in Apocalypto, we have an amazing story of human misery, love, loyalty, and valor. This movie is not for children as it would horrify and depress the living heck out of them, but it definitely is for adults; particularly those adults who wish to categorize and analyze our collective human experience. Our ancestors' lives brimmed with tragedy-plagued days such as these and many of these scenes are unforgettable.<br /><br />Most importantly, Apocalypto illustrates how foolish we are to be as obsessed over comparatively insignificant matters such as race, ethnicity, and culture. The hero here, Jaguar Paw, is a member of a different race, time, and culture than my own, yet this reviewer--and practically every other person who sees this film--cheered for his survival with dramatic intensity. This is due to our ability to relate to him at a level far deeper than that of race, sex, and class. All of us intrinsically feel a need to defeat forces of unscrupulous evil, and that is bigger than the superficial conditions placed upon us by our birth. What these small Mayan clans faced at that time was an apocalypse, and Jaguar Paw is a man we should all admire. I could not turn this one off and disagree with the other reviewers who criticized its ending. The final frames were fulfilling.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>I'll start off by saying that you'll find nothing about the historic accuracy in my review. I'm just reviewing this for anyone looking to see a good film. Mel Gibson is no doubt good at what he does and Apocolypto is very well done also. There will be mixed feelings towards this movie I'm sure as there were towards 'The Passion of the Christ" but this is a good movie. Apocalypto shows a young mans amazing and heart pounding experience during the decline of the Mayan Civilization. The movie starts with young Jaguar Paw and his father Flint Sky hunting in the jungle with some other men from their tribe. While teasing a fellow tribe-member for the group is startled by something. As the viewer you can barely see what has caught the men off guard because it is hiding so well in the jungle. It turns out to be a large number of people from another village.<br /><br />They do not say much just that they want to cross the village and want no trouble. A man crossing looks deep into Jaguar Paw's eyes and the man passes him a feeling without even saying anything, the feeling was fear. Back at the village Jaguar Paw knew that something was coming and he was right. Early in the morning while the fires still smoking and the people asleep men appear from nowhere. The men attack the village trying not to kill but injuring many. Overtaking this village will not be easy for them as everyone is fighting to protect their families. Who has not been killed is being tied up and taken except for children. After traveling a far distance from their village Jaguar Paw and his people are then taken to a city with a huge temple and from here is where the movie really and I mean really gets exciting. Jaguar Paw must find a way to get back to his village and save his wife and child who he hid in a dry well before it fills up from rain. I don't want to give away anything but lets say that Jaguar Paw makes one of the most courageous and exciting stands ever.<br /><br />I saw Apocalypto and as I was watching all the things most movie previews promise came true in this film. All the "Heart Pounding", "Jaw Dropping", "Nonstop Action", and "You'll be on the Edge of Your Seat" promises came true. This movie has such a realistic feel to it as well as these actors. You can feel it all from the fear to the determination and courage of Jaguar Paw. There is no way that you could watch this film and not feel anything. This films action and suspense truly never stops and I mean that literally. The acting is so good that you forget that they're actors and believe that they're really the characters they're portraying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson did an amazing job in making these settings and people look so real. Jaguar Paws story is out of this world, had it been done in some modern day culture, a man trying to retrieve his family would not be this good. Because the elements of Jaguar Paw being very outnumbered it makes a high demand of physical and mental endurance to survive in a jungle and this movie becomes more interesting. He truly has no weapons except the jungle he grew up in and knows like the back of his hand but still exhaustion and time are not on his side. His journey becomes all the more impossible and this makes the movie that more intriguing cause you want him to succeed. This film is definitely not for the squeamish type, there's nothing in it you wouldn't find in most scary flicks today but it is still very violent. Apocalypto is an amazing movie that I would recommend to many but be ready to sit on the edge of your seat cause you'll be there for most of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>Don't say I didn't try. Mel, you deserve every chance in the world. I loved your wonderful film on Scotland. I know you can do it. That said, this film, although colorful and well-done as far as make-up and sets are concerned, is a huge disappointment. It is really the "Bourne Ultimatum" with bad acting. There is one chase after the other, lots of blood and guts, and then the happy ending. It's the worst kind of trivial Hollywood entertainment, pure Saturday afternoon cartoon dreck, but it stands out from the crowd because of the expectation created by Gibson's previous work that it might be historically interesting and perhaps even inspiring. Unfortunately, it fails at all levels, save for the extraordinary costume designs and sets which may or may not be historically accurate. Let the anthropologists work that out. For myself, it was pure nonsense from first to last and a complete waste of a real talent with the means to do virtually anything. When the Spanish arrive, we are to assume that Gibson wants to suggest that America del Sur had finally been liberated by its burden of heathen prejudice and had finally gotten the chance to discover Our Lord the Saviour. If this is true, we can say that the film does have a socially redeeming value and cannot, as a result, be defined according to the Supreme Court as pornography.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>One teensy scene upgrade: GODZILLA shows up onshore!

Why bother with the diversionary costly landscape, which was breathtaking and single redeeming feature. The same plot, flute theme, final showdown, blood, gore, hatred inducing scenes, over and over again. YAWN!!!

Whatever you think of Mel Gibson's messed-up personal life, the guy is a creative genius.<br /><br />Apocalypto is set in the pre-Columbian Mayan peninsula, and opens in a small Indian village whose young men are out in the jungle hunting a wild boar, led by their chief Flint Sky and his son Jaguar Paw. They encounter something else they never expected -- a party of terrified refugees whose village has been raided and destroyed. Little do they know that the fate of those refugees is about to hit their own tribe.<br /><br />In a pre-dawn raid the very next day, their own village is attacked by a war party of Indians from another tribe. Most of the adults, including Flint Sky, are killed, the children are spared, and Jaguar Paw, after managing to hide his pregnant wife and little son down a dry well, is captured along with some twenty other people in his tribe and dragged off to the Mayan capital. There they come upon a culture they never knew existed, vastly superior to their own, and built on a caste system that depends heavily on slave labor. But they realize they haven't been captured to be slaves -- they are human sacrifices to the Mayan god Kukulkan. Spared by a solar eclipse, Jaguar Paw and a few survivors of the carnage in Kukulkan's temple are turned over to the war party who make a game of them dodging spears and arrows before they are all killed. Only Jaguar Paw manages to flip the script, and in a stunning act of defiance of fate, kills the son of the war party's chief and escapes into the forest, with nine warriors after him screaming for his head.<br /><br />From there the film takes on an eerie resemblance to "The Naked Prey" with overtones of Xenophon's "Anabasis", with Jaguar Paw running home ahead of the pursuing party through hostile territory, trying to stay alive long enough to get back home in time to rescue his wife and son. And in a thrilling plot twist, once he manages to get back to familiar territory, the tables are turned when Jaguar Paw has the home-field advantage and the hunters turn into the hunted.<br /><br />The acting and directing in this film could not be improved upon. Rudy Youngblood gives a knockout performance as Jaguar Paw, caught up in a hell he never imagined and intent only on getting back to his world and his family. Raoul Trujillo and Gerardo Taracena are chilling as the pursuing warriors Zero Wolf and Middle Eye, and Morris Yellowbirdhead is excellent as Flint Sky. Gibson even got great performances from the children, especially Carlos Emilio Baez as Jaguar Paw's little son, and Maria Isidra Hoil and Aquetzali Garcia, who share the role of the Oracle Girl; their eerie voices ("You fear me? So you should, all you who are vile... would you like to know how you are going to die?") send shivers down your spine. The Indian village and the Mayan city are so convincingly portrayed that we can feel just what it would be like living in either place. And the haunting sound track helps to make us feel we're deep in the middle of 15th century meso-America.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Apocalypto is a knockout film experience. Don't see it for its historical accuracy (inaccuracies abound in this movie); see it for what it is, a glorious action-adventure film that will keep you mesmerized from beginning to end.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>This movie definitely stands out among the other films released right now as something unique to see at least once. And it is pretty good overall- the cast is as strong as they could be and the scenes are a thing of beauty for the most part- but if I would ever watch it again...I don't think I would.<br /><br />Although the movie has its strong points that make it a success... it's just not an exciting film from beginning to end. Actually towards the end I grew bored. I don't know if it was the length of the film or my overall lack of being able to really, fully get into the entire story- but eventually the movie got to that point where I had to wonder when it's finally going to end.<br /><br />So really it's good to watch once to me, but not good enough to watch again.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>This was among the greatest films released in this decade. I loved its setting amid lush and savage jungles. Its vivid and violent depictions of life among the great Maya were as nothing done in Hollywood in a generation. The exciting story this motion picture told kept its rapt audience on the edge of its seat through a lengthy running time. Right up to the very end I was in love with Mel Gibson's latest cinematic accomplishment: and then in the last five minutes I was confronted with an anachronism so overpowering it shattered the suspension of disbelief that had me feeling I was witnessing the actual Mayan civilization somehow delivered onscreen. I will not be so rude as to cite the flawed intrusion here, nor was it enough to make me hesitate to give this film a well-deserved five-stars, but I would like to ask Mel Gibson what on earth he was thinking to have introduced something so historically inaccurate as...as what he did. That left me genuinely saddened and very definitely puzzled. I recommend Apocalypto to anyone with an interest in ancient America, but I would like to hit Mel Gibson upside the head with a history book.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Despite the photography, the exotic civilization, and the engaging actors, you never fully engage with this work. The set up doesn't hold to the conventional ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>I think the fact that people aren't streaming to the theatres to see Apocalypto is proof enough that Passion of the Christ wasn't actually the "modern masterpiece" Christian groups made it out to be. People loved that movie out of religious fervor, not actual cinematic quality. Apocalypto falls somewhere between the brilliance of Braveheart and the Patheticness of Passion. It's just an alright movie.<br /><br />The sheer novelty of a movie about the Mayan civilization, in Mayan, with subtitles, is a draw for some people. And the trailer is beautiful. The movie itself has many beautiful moments, but it never really rises above being a chase movie / supernatural thriller. If it weren't for the awesome locations, costumes, and acting, this movie would be a typical thriller. But it DOES have all those things, so it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />At times the violence and gore is difficult to deal with, but it can be argued that it's pretty historically accurate. It also makes the entire situation more heightened when you see what's truly at stake and the real ferocious nature of the Mayans.<br /><br />Aside from the violence, I didn't really find anything about the movie to be controversial. Honestly, it's not that deep of a movie. Without revealing too much, here's the general plot: a small village is raided, the villagers are taken for slaves and sacrifices, one of them escapes and is chased through the jungle. That's basically it.<br /><br />I'll leave it up to others to say Mel Gibson is bashing paganism, or drawing comparisons with the war in Iraq, or signalling aliens. I say he made a pretty cool movie that is worth a one-time viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>An action adventure movie, basically, shot in the lush rainforests of central America.  Stunning set, costume, and makeup design.  You root for the main character, his family, and the others in his simple village, especially when they are attacked by the more powerful Mayans who live in the city.  However....it is extremely gruesome at times for no good reason (leave it to Mel Gibson--he doesn't want you to use your imagination; he has to make you look at the cruelty and the sacrifice and so on; after all, he made TPOTC), and the end leaves you wondering if there was any point or purpose at all.

Very simple premise, simple to watch, worth viewing once.  Not the worst movie of the year, but not the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I had every intention of giving Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" a chance. I never saw "Passion of the Christ". And I'd like to think I'm capable of enjoying an artist's work despite their personal meltdowns (which is why I can enjoy a Roman Polanski film).<br /><br />"Apocalypto" starts out promising, by introducing the viewer to a likable Mayan village. (Although even in the beginning, jokes about eating testicles and having to procreate in front of your mother-in-law seem to add an unnecessary crudeness). However, as soon as the village is invaded by the ruling Mayan tribe, the film just descends into an orgy of violence, gore and ugliness that just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />By focusing on the characters and using the violence more sparingly, Gibson could have created a better film. But instead, he just throws as much carnage at the screen as he can. A jaguar rips a man's face off. Decapitated heads bounce off a temple. A huge mass grave of headless corpses attract a barrage of flies. After a while, after being assaulted with the relentlessly grotesque imagery, you just become desensitized to it all. And since the characters are never really developed enough for you to really relate to them, the result is that it all just becomes ... tedious.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />At its best Apocalypto is a kinetic chase film, but the first hour drags something awful and the unnecessary and flawed subplot with Jaguar Paw's wife in the giant hole slowed down the action further; Apocalypto is certainly recommended to action fans, but it's not a very accomplished film.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>What's with Mel Gibson and all these violent movies?

But, as we can see by the reviews posted here, people seem to enjoy this kind of lunatic enterprise.<br /><br />The trouble was they gave an Oscar to Gibson for "Braveheart". So he thought (correctly, apparently...): "Blood is the way to go. I found my niche." What a shame tha a director / actor so rich spends his money to create this nauseous films. I just cannot understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>I don't know whether Mel Gibson had "It" to begin with, but who cares, because he's officially lost it with this meandering, heartless film about the decline of the Mayan civilization. Whether or not the actual Mayan civilization was like this is of course open to debate (and historians HAVE been debating this over and over since the films' release) - but what we have here borders on lunacy (and not even in a nice way).<br /><br />The story is simple - a tribe is captured to be offered as sacrifice to the Mayan Gods, and one man (i.e "The Chosen One" like Neo from "The Matrix") saves them all (sort of). Well at least he manages to save himself and his family. There is even a ridiculous child Oracle (again, like "The Matrix") who predicts the coming of the Chosen One.<br /><br />Thrown in an Eclipse, a black Jaguar, some quicksand, and lots of blood and hearts (literally) thrown around, and you have "Apocalypto" down pat. This is not a film for the faint of heart, but its not much of a film either. Rudy Youngblood (who is busy convincing us all in real life of his Native Indian roots) plays the young man who is the Neo of his generation, and the second half descends into a senseless chase - one disaster after the other, and oh, did I mention the blood and visceral body parts?<br /><br />The sad part of this whole thing is that it *could* have been tolerable had we given this project to a better director. Mel Gibson clearly has problems with race, religion and the universal belief system. At the end, the Mayans come across as Godless, barbaric and mindless creatures who 'deserved' to be conquered by the white race. Obviously this is not a good message.<br /><br />A very poor film - even purely as an action film, it falters quite badly. Very mildly recommended. Also, I thought the casting was WAY off - not at all convincing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Apocalypto is one of those films that deserves thought over it. Oddly enough, it is also one of the few films with depth that can also evoke immediate responses. As testament to that, you can see the many visceral reactions that came out at the time of the films release.<br />Oddly enough, as impactful as the film is in terms of the violence and the ferocity of the performance, I can still safely say that many aspects were held back, I would guess for censorship reasons, and probably because Mel Gibson wanted the film to do well at the box office. The Combination of Actors, animals, practical effects, animal puppets, over 400 Visual FX shots, give rise to a near perfect illusion of the frenetic paced action which is this story.<br />I can but urge you to see this film.

So on Christmas Eve, my brother, my father, and I gathered around to watch a heartwarming family movie about human sacrifice.<br /><br />I knew a lot more about Aztec and Mayan culture than my relatives, so much of what happened (or was about to happen) took on special significance for me.  When Jaguar Paw's (Rudy Youngblood) tribe is attacked by the Aztecs and carried off instead of killed, we know it's not to live a life of slaves.  It's something much worse.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife and young child manage to evade capture by lowering themselves into a well, but they're trapped there. If it rains, they drown.  If the Aztecs find them, they're sacrificed. And thus we have a race against time, as Jaguar Paw must both escape captivity and pursuit, all in an effort to save his young family from certain doom.<br /><br />Apocalypto encompasses everything you ever wanted to know about Aztecs.  It's all here: black panthers, Aztec martial prowess, steaming jungles, ziggurats, and a twist ending that ties it all neatly in a historical bow.  If the movie wasn't so violent, high school teachers every would be showing this movie as a snapshot of history.<br /><br />The violence is actually not that bad.  A scene where an Aztec is mauled by a panther is more graphic than the heart sacrifices performed atop the grisly temples. Much more exciting are the thrilling chase and combat sequences, some of the best on foot.<br /><br />Given that this is a film about a time before modern convention, it's amazing how Gibson fits in movie conventions usually associated with car chases.  There are twists in Jaguar Paw's escape and his hunt by the Aztecs that are worthy of any action movie.<br /><br />Did I mention that this entire movie is subtitled?  The movie's so enthralling that you stop noticing it a few seconds in. Apocalypto's that good. Sure, it's a blood-drenched action thriller in another language.

As "Braveheart" was basically about  William Wallace, so Director Gibson smartly  uses one character as a repository of all his thematic material thereby focusing not diffusing our attention on something  upon which we cannot relate (though, to be truthful and based on Gibson's recent public outburst, you can't help wondering what the subtext here is...i.e. how this relates to our current political and religious situation): i.e. in this case the last days of a crumbling Mayan civilization which, out of desperation has put all its hopes in basically witch doctors who attempt to appeal to the "Gods" via human sacrifice.<br />Jaguar Paw, as one of the many captured by the ruling tribe, is the center of our attention thereby making his plight personal. JP as portrayed by Rudy Youngblood is strong, handsome, brave, intelligent, a loving husband, son and parent. When he is captured and sent to be sacrificed, degraded by his captors, even then his innate goodness and bravery shine through.<br />The Centerpiece of "Apocalypto" is the Temple scene at which the High Priest (a disgustingly smug Fernando Hernandez) spills the blood and removes the entrails of several men (the captured women are sold off like cattle) all in service of the "Gods."<br />Gibson films this scene in what can only be called a frightening, crazy, frantic manner: the beheadings, the Royal family smirking, the thousands of citizens screaming for blood, the heads rolling down from the upper regions of the temple: the camera swirling all around from the frightened faces of the captives soon to be killed to the strange, almost immobile, because of face markings and headgear, grin of the King (a very weird looking Rafael Velez). The scene becomes almost unbearable because of the intensity with which it is staged and filmed...then Gibson pulls away.<br />To me all that is important about Gibson as a director is that he makes good movies. And "Apocalypto," though not up to the level of his "Passion of The Christ" is a very good movie. It's furiously paced, it's beautiful to watch, the acting is first rate and it is infused with the sounds and vistas of an almost mystical and very much mysterious time and place: a place and a time that Gibson brings alive by way of his special and profound magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Apocalypto (Mel Gibson, 2006)<br /><br />So many reviews of this film I've read, both amateur and professional, dwell on the violence. I don't know what other movies these folks are watching. The Passion of the Christ, for one obvious comparison that's just as mainstream, was far, far more violent than this was. There are movies less than half this long that are far more violent. I think the bottom line as far as this goes is that if you have a weak stomach, you might want to avoid Apocalypto, but if you had no problem with The Passion of the Christ (or, honestly, Eastern Promises), then don't let all the shock over the "extreme" amount of violence in this movie get to you. If you want to see it, the violence won't bother you.<br /><br />In any case, the story: Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a warrior and hunter in a small rural tribe. Everything's going along swimmingly until a Mayan slaver band attacks and captures almost the entire tribe. Jaguar Paw is able to send his wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and son off to hide in a hole, but the slavers find out about it and cut the vine she's supposed to use to climb out. Thus, Jaguar Paw has to find a way to escape before he's sacrificed and rescue his wife and son before they starve, or die of thirst.<br /><br />Not a bad little revenge thriller, this, and Gibson, as he did with The Passion of the Christ, adds the mystique of a foreign setting and a language far removed from that most people are familiar with. As a gimmick, I'm sure it will grow old eventually, but Gibson is a proven director on ground he's very familiar with. As a result, the film is very effective. The cinematography is gorgeous, unsurprising as Gibson once again pairs with Dean Semler (Dead Calm, The Road Warrior, Razorback), one of those fantastic cinematographers they grow down in Australia. The make-up jobs are gorgeous, and the action sequences are choreographed in such a way that you'd never think they were choreographed. This is good stuff. Gibson turns in another winner; when he's behind the camera, it seems, he can't lose. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This has to be one of Mel Gibson's finest films (as director). The Mayan characters are well-portrayed (there's a very good balance between good and evil, and that's something that's not regularly seen in other films). The art direction and cinematography are excellent (it's unfortunate that they didn't win during the Oscars). The music is hauntingly beautiful, and the main chase sequence in the second half of the movie revs up the tension oh so high. Blood and violence are excessive, so parents are warned.<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's 2006 film Apocalypto contains all the essential elements of the typical epic drama: over 2 hours of nonstop action where an unassuming hero, the young family man Jaguar Paw, played excellently by Rudy Youngblood, finds himself in a vicarious situation where his home and hearth are threatened and he is forced to venture out from what he knows in order to protect and defend what he holds dear.<br /><br />As a Mayan warrior living at the time of the conquistador arrival in the New World, Jaguar Paw is familiar with the ways of the Yucatan jungle where he and his ancestors have lived comfortably for generations.  The audience first sees him with his fellow hunters and shares in the easy fellowship that exists in the village.  We admire the loving relationship that identifies him as a father and husband, but most of all it is that Rousseau-ian wild child, hanging-around-without any-clothes-in-the-forest innocence that we covet.  Jaguar Paw seems to have it all; that is until another Mayan contingency plunders through his village, kills the undesirables and transports JP with other potential slaves and human sacrifices to the Temple of the feathered-snake god, Kukulcan, in the central Mayan metroplex of Chichen Itza.<br /><br />Gibson films with amazing authenticity - his depiction of the internal and external suffering of JP and his village counterparts creates gut-wrenching moments of the sort he is famous for in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.  We not only feel the pain, we live through the exhilaration generated when Gibson utilizes the universal power of myth where the hero travels within a mythical woods fraught with peril leading to an emotionally and physically transcendental initiation that allows him to not only combat the forces of evil, but return to his loved ones fully transformed.<br /><br />Is Gibson merely reenacting the mythical hero's journey or is he simply employing a powerful story to underline a contemporary message?  Apparently he feels strongly enough about whatever the significance is to finance both JP's and JC's (The Passion of the Christ) metamorphosis with personal funds.  However, facilitating graphically painful violence, torture and almost horror movie techniques, he, at times, over illustrates his point.  Beneath all the gore, what is he depicting---man's penchant for inhumanity or his own seemingly insatiable desire to photograph it? Is he using the blood spectacle to mesmerize and entertain the crowd not unlike the emperors of Rome used the battles to the death in the coliseum?  Or does he, like some ancient shaman believe that something purifying and spiritual is born from the mythic "the-king-must-die" blood sacrifice?  Like the front piece to the film, historian Will Durant's quotation, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within," and the actual depiction of the debauched sickness ensuing from the lower levels of the Mayan society to the garish strangeness of the upper classes, Gibson firstly drives home the idea that as a particular society evolves it becomes jaded by its own sophistication.  What is, at one time, new and exciting, degenerates into old and boring necessitating the exploration of newer and better thrills to achieve a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Gibson's heroes differ from the usual Campbell heroes of a thousand faces that need the quest to mature and redefine their values. Their morality and goodness stands firm and in terms of development they remain the same from start to finish.  From the vantage point of the audience, pandemonium reigns --- the sights and sounds of the debauched society evokes that alien quality George Lukas used so well in Star Wars when Luke Skywalker infiltrates the cosmic bar and innocence personified encounters an assortment of cynical alien rou&eacute;s.  We sense peace only in the major characters.  Yes, they are terrorized by the ordeal they are about to undergo, but spiritually they remain steadfast.  Instead, they are the only characters that by their stability and quiet resolve fill the hole carved out by the heart of darkness.<br /><br />Each of Gibson's major characters undergoes his trial by fire by understanding fully that his objective has little to do with the actual ordeal and all to do with their sense of self and their responsibility to their family and home. The cultures he depicts have degraded into abysses of the spiritual where the accumulation of wealth naturally erodes be they ancient Rome in the time of Christ (Passion of the Christ), the British subjection of Scotland (Braveheart) and now in Apocalypto the Mayan Empire around the time when the old world collided with the new.  Those who can still be saved need some kind of mythic sacrificial figure that personifies the values of hearth and home.<br /><br />So, okay, Mel, I get it . . . we all are accidental participants in a corrupt society---desensitized by our own complexity, in dire need of a sacrificial lamb to reconnect us with the all important simple things that life unfolds and ultimately death and the after-life reveals.<br /><br />Bottom line? Mel Gibson's Apocalypto may provide a colorful and raucous panoramic view of a long gone civilization, but it also exemplifies the epic tale of Jungian archetypes where trial by fire transforms and drives the representative hero to extraordinary action.  Bloody in parts, it typifies that which Mel has become famous:  providing a sacrificial lamb that elevates hope and common good for the masses.

Brilliant cast, good story; I will watch this again!<br /><br />** NOT for the squeamish ** = a must watch for lovers of gore!<br /><br />Story: "peaceful" forest dwelling villagers have their happy idyllic lives shattered by &lt;EVIL> Aztecs. The hero, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), is dragged away from wife & child. Hauled onto the top of pyramid, just as he is to get the chop/disembowment &lt;&lt;SURPISE>> the sun eclipses and he has the opportunity to escape. Chased by a horde of angry Aztecs, he eradicates them in grizzly and ingenious fashion.... the story builds the baddies as the meanest nastiest guys in South America, so PLENTY of entertainment value (and cheering) when they get it.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw gets to save wife Seven (Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez), family and jungle culture in just over 2 hrs. ***** 5 STARS<br /><br />Gibson also stated that Apocalypto would help dismiss the notion that "history only began with Europeans" source: wikipedia.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>As this movie begins to unfold you are aware you are watching a very unique film, first it's the fact it's told in ancient Mayan, second it's that it's shot on location in the jungles of central america.  Let me be frank, the film is brutally violent and as is de rigure for Gibson films the  is up close and personal, Gibson seems to love graphic  and savagry, but it actually works in this film.  The story is simple, but engrossing and you really find yourself rooting for the protagonist as he races against the clock.  The acting is actually quite good and the direction and cinemaphotograpy first rate.  I highly recommend it, its a very good piece of filmmaking, but it is hella violent.</p></br></body></html>

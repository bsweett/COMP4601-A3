In the past my wife read these comics and so i knew going in a little about the charecters. However someone not familiar with the books may have a bit of trouble with the charecters. All in all a fun movie and i feel the best of the comic adaptations. The picture quality was great and there is lots of action so as long as one doesnt expect a mind excersise it should be an enjoyable movie for most.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>In the near future, a new breed of humans--known as mutants--begins to emerge from the general population. Gifted (or cursed, depending on one's standpoint) with a variety of extranormal abilities, these mutants face fear and distrust from society. But under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier, a group of these mutants has banded together to help light the path to a better future for both mutants and normal humans. This is the premise of &quot;X-Men.&quot;<p>Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter David Hayter faced a daunting task in taking the massive X-Men mythos (which has evolved through decades of different comic book titles, and has involved an encyclopedic number of characters) and adapting it into a feature film. But, together with a superb international cast, the filmmakers succeed brilliantly.<p>A prologue set during the Nazi Holocaust sets the overall serious tone for the film--a welcome change from the increasingly campy and ridiculous &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise. Yes, &quot;X-Men&quot; is a science fiction film with plentiful action and special effects. But at its heart, this film is an intelligent drama about characters who face crises and challenges.<p>Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) squares off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a rival mutant leader with a radically different philosophy. Add to this struggle Bruce Davison as a McCarthyesque, mutant-hating U.S. senator, and you have a rich tapestry of ideological conflict which serves as a backdrop for the frequently explosive action. But overall I found the emotional core of the film to lie in the relationship between Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a seemingly indestructible warrior with retractable metal claws, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with the ability to suck the life force out of others. Each of the actors delivers an excellent performance.<p>The mutants of &quot;X-Men&quot; can be seen as metaphors for any feared or persecuted group in human history. Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good. It is, I believe, the film's success in tapping into universal human fears, hopes, and ideological conflicts that elevates it above being merely an excellent sci-fi action epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>This Comic book to screen adaptation is one of the best of its type, well cast, well paced, and set up for its first sequel.<p>I haven't read an X Men comic in at least 25 years--since the 70's. Since then the comic books have become enormously popular, but I've not kept up or knew much about it at all.<p>I have fond memories of the clever, creative series and it quickly took the place of the mid 60's Superman, Batman, DC Gang comic books. But I grew out of comic books and I've not been overly nostalgic looking back at them. Oh sure I've wandered into comic book collector stores and peaked at a few old issues, stuff I remember having as a kid.... <p>  X MEN <p>I'm sure not having a strong recollection of any story line and barely recalling some of the characters was a plus in my enjoying the 'surprises' of the film. I found the film wonderfully cast. Patrick Stewart makes a great Professor Xavier. Though Wolverine I understand is basically a dwarf in the comics, I don't think much is lost by having him full sized in the film. Ian McKellan plays a pretty old Magneto (but whow cares? he's having a good time and so are we).<p>They did a wonderful job with it I thought. At times the film was almost touching, and without slowing down the fast pace of its character introductions, plot mechanics or action.<p>Unfortunately, when you come to the end you realize the huge hurdle that any of these movies face. You want to end a movie like this, satisfying the audience but leaving them wanting a little more. <p>Of course there's no mystery about the wanting a little more part. The movie was done well, it will do good box office and so there will of course be a sequel. The lead actors have agreements in place to be in a couple of sequels, though director Singer isn't a sure thing. There will be another X Men movie,probably within a couple years. So the movie isn't exactly complete because unlike a movie where you aren't sure if there will be a sequel or not, you already know not only will the film  continue, it's already in several of the actors contracts. So they don't have to wrap everything up, they can have characters rush off to find themselves and not show us or tell us a thing about it, because there's gonna be a sequel. <p>I enjoyed the humor, the relationships, the special effects. The darker parts of the story I thought all were well balanced and the film didn't stop dead as we explored some disturbing revelations (as happened in the Batman films for instance). Because of the intelligent script and good acting the film isn't as shallow as most comic books to the screen conversions have been. <p>The film has some drawbacks. It was pretty much the Wolverine story, and several characters were given short shrift. Halle Berry was given almost nothing to do with her character of Storm. The reaction of the character to situations was also very slow. Berry's casting and performance may be the weakest thing about the film, but the script gave her so little to do it's impossible to determine if she would have been good were the part better written for her. <p>Some of the wire work stunt scenes were fairly obvious, but I much prefer this style of filmed stunts than CGI. I get a sense real people are doing the action scene and acrobatics at least part of the time, rather than most of it being computer generated.<p>It was a real drawback that we never see Cyclops and Jean interact as a couple to know how 'special' their relationship is. If we had, the triangle would have worked much better.<p>Bruce Davison who plays the Senator is usually very enjoyable in whatever he does, and he's quite good here and deserves a mention. <p>Bryan (Usual Suspects) Singer has directed one of the most  enjoyable, comic book movies I've ever seen and I anticipate many successful sequels (particularly if he agrees to direct another).<p>Now give me 80 or 90 mil, and a collection of Green Lantern books to refresh my memory and I'll turn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie. C'mon...<p>Chris Jarmick, Author (The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>I saw a picture on a TV guide (I believe) in 2000, with a picture of a man with three blades coming out of his hand.  At first, I thought it was an ad for the newest Nightmare On Elm Street installment, until I noticed that it was Hugh Jackman in the upcoming movie "The X-Men".  My mind gave the famous line of Emily Litella:  "Well, that makes it completely different.  Never mind."  After all, I had read and loved the X-Men comics when I was younger, and knew enough to know that Jackman was playing the Wolverine.<br /><br />This movie was as good as I could imagine it, and even better.  It had the special effects and action you would expect in a comic book adaptation.  But the movie appealed to the mind as much as to the eyes and nerves.<br /><br />This movie (and actually, the whole series) deals with the issue of prejudice and how to deal with it.  In these movies, it is mutants that are the victims of this prejudice.  The story line says it is a spurt of evolution; there is nothing to scientifically verify this.  Nevertheless, the mutants are feared and persecuted.<br /><br />There are mutant protagonists, led by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and mutant antagonists, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen).  The difference between them is the response to the persecution.  The protagonists seek to live quietly and peaceably with humans, having Xavier's school as a place for protection and refuge.  The antagonists are ready to wage war with the persecutors.<br /><br />In this first installment, Magneto's goal is to transform humans into mutants, which he does to a Senator who wants to have mutants registered (not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany, a comparison made in the first scene of the movie).  The problem is that humans are unable to withstand the change and end up dying.<br /><br />I avoid detailed plot descriptions in my reviews so I spoil as few surprises as possible.  I will say, though, that Magneto survives the first movie, not unlike Darth Vader surviving in the Star Wars movies.  One thing I like about the movie, though, is that Magneto is not the type of villain you want to see killed.  Magneto and Xavier are not true enemies, but adversaries who would admit the other is really a friend.  I am the type of person who would rather see a villain reformed than executed.<br /><br />This movie is PG-13.  The Senator's death, among other scenes, keep this from being a family movie.  However, I have no problem with teenagers seeing this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is an awesome movie.

Goodness knows, there have been missteps in the past.  But director Brian Singer does about as good a job as can be reasonably expected. First off, we need to thank the makers of Mission Impossible 2 for running over-schedule, thus tying up actor Dougray Scott and consequently allowing actor Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine.  Jackman is the standout in this movie.  His wonderfully understated performance as the &quot;reluctant hero&quot; is arguably the centerpiece of this film.<p>What distinguishes this film from other lesser film adaptions is an intelligent script, or at least intelligent for the genre.  Character development isn't sacrificed to make room for more standard mindless special effects and action setpieces, like in some movies (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, anyone?).  <p>The in-jokes are funny, and the characters' history and motivations are treated with a fan's level of respect.<p>If the filmmakers can retain those elements of character-driven story and a respect for the source material in future installments, then they may have a successful movie franchise on their hands</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>As most of the world knows by now, X-Men is the live-action version of the of the Marvel comic strip, directed by Bryan Singer (of the Usual Suspects fame). Set in the not too distant future the X-Men are humans who thanks to genetic mutation have inherited special powers. On the surface, having special powers sounds great (you might think) but in X-Men the mutant race is an oppressed and persecuted minority, due to the bigotry, ignorance and fear of much of the non-mutant population. Furthermore an ambitious and influential Senator (Bruce Davison) wants to introduce a registration policy for mutants in an attempt to further restrict their civil rights. In response to this the mutant community is split into two camps led by Professor X, aka Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto, aka Erik Mangus Lensherr (Sir Ian McKellen). Magneto believes in the supremacy of the mutant population, which he is willing to use force to prove, whilst Professor X merely wants, equality, integration and peace. With fundamentally opposing views the two camps are set on a collision course with the future of the human race at stake.<p>X-Men is an entertaining action movie and it has some great fight scenes but it is pitched at its intended mass audience and carefully falls short explicit violence making it pretty much suitable for all but young children. However, although the X Men movie comes from a comic book background and is definitely aimed at a mass audience it also has a message and is a lot more highbrow than most super hero adaptations. X-Men for example opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp with a young Magneto witnessing his mother being shepherded off to the gas chamber and from this it is pretty clear that Director Bryan Singer is deliberately making a point and drawing a comparison. It is also worth noting that at the time of the X Men's creation, back in 1963, among the major political figures in pre civil rights America were Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and it is easy to draw comparisons with Professor X and Magneto. Comparisons can also be drawn between X-Men character Senator Robert Kelly and a certain Senator McCarthy. What is more, X-Men is particularly pertinent at a time when there is so much tabloid speculation and scare mongering with regard to genetic engineering.<p>With X-Men, Director Bryan Singer, a self-confessed fan, has stayed remarkably loyal to the comic books and has served up a commercial but extremely enjoyable film with impressive special effects, which has inevitably spawned a sequel and (in all likelihood) a franchise, which makes me for one very happy. Full of great characters and great performances from the likes of Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), Anna Pacquin (as Rogue) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey) and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique). However, it is the excellent pairing of the Royal Shakespeare company's McKellen and Stewart opposite each other that really adds gravitas to the proceedings and my only real dissapointments were seeing the excellent and beautiful Halle Berry (as Storm) being under-used and the relatively short running length of 97 minutes. <p>X-Men 2 hits our screens later this year and I for one am really looking forward to it! Four stars ****</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Finally, a movie based on a comic book that actually remains faithful to the original book and characters.  Of course if you're talking about the X-Men, you're talking subject matter that is more mature on many levels than most comics books.  The story line goes head on into the racism and fear of mutants, people born with genetic differences that don't surface until they hit puberty and give them never seen before gifts that allow them to do pretty amazing things, some incredibly beautiful, others intensely frightening.  Professor Charles Xavier (perfectly cast and portrayed by Patrick Stewart) is their unsung savior as a wealthy father figure who takes in these young people to try to mold them into something positive.  On the other end of the spectrum is a jaded and bitter Magneto, also portrayed well by Ian McKellen, who believes that normal humans have had their chance and now something has to be done to show them that mutants are superior.  Xavier's Senior students, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Storm help new found mutants Rogue and Wolverine discover who they are and what may lie in the future.  The actions scenes are unique and original.  All the actors give solid performances, especially Jackman, and Halle Berry impressed me with her Kenyan accent.  I hope she speaks more in the sequel.  The DVD is excellent for true fans because it's obvious that Director Brian Singer wanted so much more for this movie but just wasn't allowed to have it.  Time, budget and a last minute search for someone to play Wolverine caused serious constraints.  Considering the obstacles and the bad luck of past comic-book-to-movie adaptations, this one scores high and pleases fans and normal folks alike.  It stands for something more than just heroes and villians, and it gives us a story about people, no matter who they are or what they can do.  Buy this, if you have not already.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.<br /><br />The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant "X" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a "Brotherhood of Mutants" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br /><br />You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.<br /><br />Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - "X-Men" (2000), "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BWVCM">X2: X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>" (2003) and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCO83Q">X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)</a>" (2006).<br /><br />"X-Men" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the general plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are presented and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and understandably opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as Iceman and Pyro. Both groups meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which I believe is the weakest part of the film.<br /><br />Regardless, when I saw "X-Men" in the theater in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since "Superman" (1978) and "Superman II" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the great quality of many of those flicks.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>While this movie does not follow the canon of the comic books entirely, it is still a good movie, and a fair adaptation of the comic books, with nice special effects and a good cast. I enjoyed this movie even though I could spot what was different from the comic book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Never doubt the efficacy of prayer! X-Men(2000) was a critical and commercial success. It spawned two sequels...and two prequels. The film pleases X-Men fans and non-fans. The film stays true to the comic book and never turns into camp. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were inspired choices for Professor Charles Xavier(a.k.a. Professor X) and Wolverine. X-Men takes place in a world where mutants are oppressed by "normal people". Mutants led by Professor Xavier try to be tolerant while mutants led by Magneto(Ian McKellan) are radical and extremist! Magneto has a diabolical weapon that can turn "normal people" into mutants!<br /> Director Bryan Singer(The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil, House, Superman Returns) takes the X-Men story seriously. The late Michael Kamen wrote a solid music score for X-Men. The scene where Wolverine and Sabertooth fight on the Statue of Liberty is an homage to A Man Called Hero(1999). X-Men has a fair amount of humor. Cyclops(James Marsden) asks Wolverine if he "wants yellow spandex". Anna Paquin is quite good as a teenage version of Rogue. Ray Park isn't bad as Toad. He played Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace(1999). The X-Men film franchise got off to a good start, but now it's struggling to stay alive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>This was a great movie Hugh Jackman did a great job playing wolvierine. I just love this film. Very Good.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRIO">Fantastic Four [Blu-ray</a>], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>Similar to what Alien did to the Sci-Fi thriller genre, the film X-Men was a milestone in re-introducing the comic genre to the general public. The last blockbuster movie based on a comic before X-Men was the Batman with Mr. Freeze, and I think it's safe to say we would all like to forget that one.<br /><br />When I first watched X-men over a decade ago, I remember not being over-zealous or joyed over the plot, characters, acting. After watching it over and over again throughout the years, I've realized the intangible greatness that lies in the film. It laid the blue-print for how to introduce an ensemble super-hero cast. Truly one of those films that you appreciate more and more every-time you watch it.<br /><br />What Singer does well is give the film a feeling grounded in reality. His "Star Trek" approach to X-men is unique and the cinematography of the film is beautiful. I love the openings of the film with magneto and rogue. I feel that everyone got a decent amount of time on screen and the performances from xaiver and magento couldn't have been better. They were brilliant. and even thought they made a lot of changes to the rogue character, the way she ties in to magento's plot and the bond her and wolverine make and how he saves her was very touching. and i love the soundtrack as well, the rogue/wolverine theme was brilliant.  i like how this movie wasn't all about action but about the actor's performances. everyone did a great job. This movie really captures what x-men are all about and despite the changes they made to rogue and the unexplored past of some characters (for budget and running time reasons obviously) this is in my top 5 comic films of all time. a true sci-fi masterpiece. FLAWLESS!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is interesting, as I never read the X-Men. So I did not have any preconception or know if any of the charters are important or known.<br />The story is clear. You can tell the bad guys from the good. They do not try to mask anything and did an excellent job of telling the back-story. They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not over shadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you get what you ask for in spades.<br /><br />Bottom line is it is worth watching once to say you saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The reason I use that statement as my review title is that, while this film is good, much like `Spider-Man' and `Batman Begins', this film is trumped massively by the sequel.  That aside, this film is still very good for the genre that it finds itself in.  Superhero movies can be hard to make because there are so many devoted fans to please, and there is no way that one can perfectly transfer a comic book to the big screen.  Still, as far as they come, this is one of the better installments.<br /><br />It's a shame that the third film was such a cluttered mess (it's still better than `Spider-Mess 3').<br /><br />This film establishes the conflict between former friends Professor Xavier (Professor X) and Magneto, formerly known as Eric Lensherr.  Lensherr, facing prejudice his entire life, suffers greatly at the hands of an unkind and unsympathetic human race, who regard mutants as below them and continue to misunderstand and mistreat them.  Xavier and Lensherr, once comrades, are now rivals as their viewpoints on the world have begun to contradict one another.  Xavier believes in patience, for he feels that humans are universally good and that they will learn to accept mutants as equals, but Lensherr has grown to despise humanity and feels that the only key to happiness would be a human-free (and mutant inhabited) world.<br /><br />Thus sets the basis for the first installment in the X-Men franchise, and as Xavier's school for mutants and Magneto's band of thugs set off in search of the same girl, a young mutant named Rogue, chaos ensues.<br /><br />That good kind of action sequence chaos.<br /><br />When it comes to superhero films, the most important (or one of the most important) things to consider is the cast.  You have leagues of devoted fans waiting to put a face to the hero they have followed for years, and so `nailing' that aspect of the film is key.  For a film that is littered with heroes and villains, `X-Men' definitely has some inspired casting.  For any fan of the comic, I think there was only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.  Near unknowns (I say near because they weren't, and still aren't, BIG NAME stars) Famke Janssen and James Marsden filled out their respective roles very nicely (Janssen is a perfect Jean Grey) and Oscar winner Anna Paquin was the perfect choice for Rogue.  Ian McKellen is perfect as Magneto, and while I find that Storm didn't have much to chew on, Berry was a nice (if a tad obvious) choice.<br /><br />But seriously, this is the film that introduced Hugh Jackman to the world, and no matter how awesome the rest of the cast may be, Wolverine was the most important casting decision, and Jackman is absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.  I'd give it a solid B+, verging on an A-.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I used to watch The X Men animated show back in the early to late 90's I always wondered what a live action movie would be like in 2000 we found out it stared Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Patrick Stewart as Professor X Ian McKellen as Magneto & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth which was 1 of Mane's 1st big roles. On with the story Magneto wants to start a Human Mutant war he wants to infect humans with a plague that can mutate & kill them they also used it on Senator Robert Kelly & he died. He also finds out about this girl named Rouge who has bonded with Wolverine he's like a father to her when Wolverine is sleeping he is having flashbacks of a war he can't rember his past Rouge is checking on him & he accidentally sticks a claw into her side she uses her power & steals Wolverine's instant healing ability.

And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Still, this DVD holds up.<br /><br />Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.<br /><br />As for the story, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren't particularly involving, either the "good"  or the "bad." The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have had us more interested in them, but didn't.  Jackman's "Logan/ Wolverine" always seemed to be pouting and angry.  (He got more personality as this series continued.)<br /><br />For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.<br /><br />If profanity bothers you, the film was very good in that department, too, as there was very little. Obviously, this film was popular enough to spawn multiple sequels.  Now that all three "X" films are out in a packaged Blu-Ray box set which, I've heard, looks and sounds fantastic, that's my next step.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>As an adaptation, I think, this outing from Marvel's partnerships with Hollywood isn't quite as good as the first two Spiderman films.  Of course, the special effects are splendid (Storm calling up the weather, Magneto at work, his henchman Toad hopping about flourishing an incredible tongue, shapechanger Mystique, and Wolverine's claws, to name a few), and Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier was an inspired casting choice.  But there's a certain darkness to the movie that isn't just about Marvel angst (I would have preferred to see the costumes from the original comics rather than a generic uniform, for one thing).  What's more, the focus is less on the X-Men as a whole than on Wolverine (perhaps to be expected considering his fan base!) and Magneto.  And even without being able to read Magneto's mind, it seems that a genius like Xavier, with the advantage of his long acquaintance with Magneto, would at least entertain the possibility that it's Rogue, not Wolverine, that he wants.  (Wolvie, after all, has apparently been out and about for a while before we meet him by way of Rogue, the newly-fledged Mississipian mutant who has run away from home in terror of what her powers do to people.)  On the other hand, Magneto is a villain with whom one can almost sympathize (especially considering that we learn early on that he survived the Nazi Holocaust and therefore fears that mutants may be the target of another such program--or should that be pogrom?).  I'm hoping that the subsequent chapters will give Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm more chance to shine.  On balance, though, it's a well-done action movie with a strong underlying message, and could well serve as a springboard for some good family discussions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Bryan Singer has created a great opening to the X-Men movie franchise. The key to this type of film is not to play it too comic bookish and also not to play it too seriously. Singer does a good job on both counts. With great casting and a quickly moving plot line the X-Men movie is a pleasure to watch and as Singer puts it in his commentary a good trailer for the next movie in the series.<br /><br />There are many characters in the X-Men universe but the film wisely introduces the viewer to a small group of them who will be essential to the story. In the America of the not too distant future a debate rages as to whether mutants (those with special powers) should be made to register with the government. To Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) this is just too close to his childhood which was spent in a Polish concentration camp. He has gathered his Brotherhood of Mutants in order to battle this registration scheme. He intends to use a special radiation emitting device which will turn all into mutants. His group includes Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) the Toad (Ray Park) and the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn).<br /><br />Opposing the Brotherhood's Plans id Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who believes in a peaceful existence between mutants and the humans. He runs a school for mutant children that preaches inclusion rather than fear and exclusion. His star students who teach at his Academy have not rejoined the world. They are the X-Men. The X-Men that are featured are the weather controlling Storm (Halle Berry), the lasar eyed Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Into his group comes a teen who cannot touch others, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and a man who has been equipped with claw like weapons named Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).<br /><br />To give away more of the story would ruin the fun. This is the best type of action movie both intelligent and quick moving. One can only hope that future movies in the series will follow the same outline. I viewed this film in the special two-disc edition that includes the director commentary, an extended viewing mode with 17 incorporated branching featurettes and a number of special features introduced by Singer on a second disc.<br /><br />Of the many comic book movies released in the last few years this is one of the best that I've seen. See it and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>X-Men has proven itself as a movie that doesn't get old, no matter how many times it is seen. I have watched this movie many times and it still isn't boring, that is the best thing that can be said about movie. That it has a long life and can still be enjoyed years after it's release, and X-Men definitely fits that category. But, what is not to like about this movie?<br /><br />The casting for it is perfect, Ian McKellen makes a great Magneto and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Professor Charles Xavier. The same things can be said for everyone in the movie and who they were cast as in the film. It is done so perfectly, it adds to the story and makes me wonder if this movie would have been as powerful as it is if other people were cast in this film. Let's not forget the special effects that are used in this movie. That is definitely eye candy for sure. The mutant powers look great when they are used in this movie and look realistic. It is really cool to see Wolverine's adamantium claws first slowly come out in the bar.<br /><br />The story doesn't follow the comics as well as I had hoped they would. The biggest example I could see in the film is that Wolverine and Sabertooth don't know each other prior to their meeting in this movie, but in the comic, they have known each other for years. Despite the lack of being 100% like the comic, this movie makes a story of it's own and the previous story isn't really needed. It is so compelling in the way it is told, it can be forgiven for its very small mistakes for sure. This is definitely a have to see movie. If you haven't by now, you need to!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

Plus the guy no one ever heard of, Hugh Jackman, gives the breakthrough performance of the year as Wolverine. Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen shine as well. Halle Berry doesn't really work as Storm though; she doesn't have the tough look or right personality for the role. Angela Bassett would have been a better choice, possibly. Plus it would have been cool to see Beast, Gambit and Night Crawler in it, but I understand why they weren't, because who needs an overcrowded cast? The film had enough trouble giving enough screen time for the mutants that were in it as it as it is. Still, with those minor problems out of the way, X-Men is still my number #1 pick for best movie of Summer 2000.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>When I saw "X-Men" at the theater in the summer of 2000, I was quite surprised for the hard work that director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") has put into this movie. Singer did not just a good job, but an outstanding job with the special effects and the storytelling and such. As far as the acting goes, Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek: The Next Generation") was an excellent choice as Professor Xavier. In fact, I knew that they would pick Stewart for this role. And as for Hugh Jackman (who appeared in 1998's "Paperback Hero" prior to doing "X-Men") as Logan/Wolverine, Jackman was brilliant! We all know that Hugh Jackman is from Australia, and that "X-Men" was his first American production. But when Jackman gets right down to talking in that American accent, he does it with perfection all the way! And that is what makes Jackman the actor that he is today, with lots of charisma and style as well. The supporting cast, including Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique), Tyler Mane (Sabertooth), and Ray Park (Toad) gave great performances as well! The DVD transfer of this was simply amazing! Especially with features like Hugh Jackman's screen test, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes footage, and much more! "X-Men" is the best comic book adaption ever made since "Superman" and "Batman"! I cannot wait for the "X-Men" sequels to come out! But until that time comes, I will still enjoy watching "X-Men" for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I read comic books as a kid but never got around to the X Men, though they were very popular.  When I saw that this movie was coming out, I thought I'd check it out and I'm glad I did.  The characters are really good and I especially liked Wolverine, Jean Grey and Storm (who I would like to see more of in the sequel).  With great actors like Patrick Stewart and the incredibly talented Ian McKellan it would have been hard for the director to go wrong.  The dvd has some cool extras and it is well worth the money.  If you like comic book heroes or not, this movie is worth your money.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>This movie was pretty good. I definitely have seen worse however, I expected the fight scenes to be greater than they were. I didn't really see Storm, Cyclops, or Wolverine utilized to their fullest capabilities, and certainly not like the cartoon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Even when I was really into comics more than a few years ago, the X-Men just never really appealed to me.  Maybe it was the fact that I really didn't know the story behind each character; that was certainly one of the issues I had with this film.  Granted, my encounters with the X-Men have been few and far between, but I've just never seen much of anything behind any of the characters other than Dr. Charles Xavier and Wolverine.  I followed Wolverine during the first couple of years of his first solo comic, largely because he was a complicated, mysterious, deadly character with great depth and passion, a man still trying to discover what he truly was.  Despite his mutant powers, Wolverine always comes across as a human being, with all the positives and negatives that implies.  Without him, I can't connect with any of the other mutants, so I think the filmmakers definitely had the right idea when they used Wolverine as their cinematic conduit to the viewing public.<br /><br />This is a rather unusual film, in that it was obviously written with sequels in mind - there's not a very big sense of completion to this film at all.  Not only does it refrain from supplying some important answers, it doesn't even get around to asking all of the questions yet.  The first half of the movie basically serves to introduce us to all the major players.  Even still, I feel like I know next to nothing about Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden); in actuality, I can't work up much of a reason to even care about those two very much.  I have to wonder, though, if Cyclops is supposed to be so annoyingly prissy; Marsden seems to be channeling a Footloose-era Tom Cruise, which made it impossible for me to like his character.  I can't complain about the two heavyweights in this particular arena, though.  Patrick Stewart adds an important air of believability to a story that could have easily stumbled down the road toward campiness, while Ian McKellan - a rather surprising choice to play Magneto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.  The special effects are quite impressive, and the story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure this film would have worked without Stewart and McKellan.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I tend to look upon this (for the most part) as Wolverine's movie.  Hugh Jackman pretty much nails his character, in terms of both the look and the attitude.  Despite his personal preference for solitude, Wolverine's the one who helps Rogue out when she's trying to find her bearings; most of what we learn about Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) and Cyclops are a direct result of the connection he makes with Grey; he is the one who draws the most important information out of Dr. Xavier, etc.  The movie doesn't really bring this out, but Wolverine also has a special rivalry with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane, who doesn't do the character a whole lot of justice to my eyes).<br /><br />In terms of the plot, you basically watch Logan and Rogue slowly make a place for themselves among the X-Men, eventually coming together with Grey, Cyclops, and Storm to prevent Xavier's old, wayward buddy Magneto from succeeding in his dastardly plan to establish the dominance of mutants over human society - even if it means inciting a war between humans and mutants.  Honestly, it isn't the most impressive script I've ever seen, basically putting the ultimate fate of the film in the hands of the actors and actresses bringing the story to life.  Some darn good casting really saved the day here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>Fox has given this one another of their superior DVD treatments. Primary among the extras are the deleted scenes. Usually, you can understand why scenes were exiled. In this case, it makes you wonder what director Brian Singer was thinking. Most of the material that was cut helps explain the character motivations beyond anything that had previously been seen. The relationship between Jean Grey and Wolverine actually gets some meaning to it. It helps delve into Rogue's mind a bit more as well. <p>The movie itself is curiously involving despite it's shortcomings. Is it great, no. The special effects are though. The performances, for the most part, are very good. And, it rarely falls below good. Best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Now, if only Anna Paquin could decide if she's going to actually have an accent through the whole movie (No Kevin Costner jokes.)</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The first X-Men film is not really perfect, but in terms of it's timing and what it meant might be coming down the pike with regards to cinematic interpretations of comic books (specifically Marvel comics) it is pretty darn close to perfect. Lets face it, this is the harbinger of the comic book movie age that has, like it or not, made some exciting and high-grossing films. I personally think the majority of comic book movies fail and could care less about how much money they make, but X-Men is a bit more than that. It's a very good movie too.<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters but that actually served the film well in terms of how I viewed the hype. I didn't care because so many did...that's the old punk in me in guess. So I waited and received the film as an early Christmas gift the following year. I actually watched it Christmas eve and found it to be incredibly refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />It begins by showing us a young boy being separated from his parents at a German concentration camp in Poland. His parents are going into the camp and will be killed. The boy is desperate to save them and as the German soldiers hold him down he reaches out and somehow begins to bend the metal gates that close in his parents before being struck down by the [...] of one of the soldiers' guns. The boy is Eric Lehnsherr, one of the great all-time Marvel comic villains known as Magneto. In one fell swoop, Bryan Singer does something that I've always been glad X-Men writers did consistently, and that is allow us to sympathize with this villain.<br /><br />We are then introduced to the primary plot of a modern day Senator bent on the granting the government the ability to force registration of all mutants. Then it shows how telepathic and mind manipulating mutant Charles Xavier and his old friend and rival Magneto fundamentally disagree on how mutants as a race must react to this oncoming repression. This is followed by the introduction to our primary protagonists; Rogue, a young girl who drains the life of all people her skin makes contact with, and Wolverine, an enhanced mutant with the ability to heal himself enough that his body endured somking of skeletal replacement surgery. His skeleton is made of an indestructible metal and he also has claws made of this metal that break through his skin anytime he wants to kill someone. Great characters that Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are able to portray well here. Again, Singer introduces these characters with relatable depth.<br /><br />In short, Magneto wants to destroy humanity and the X-Men must stop him in an environment where they are not appreciated in the least by the public. Singer attempts to make sociological insights on those terms in addition to bringing great character depth. When you consider the number of characters and the length of the movie, these are not easy tasks to say the least. Then again, when watching the Usual Suspects it's quite obvious Singer has a knack for just this sort of thing.<br /><br />X-Men is a very good movie but I won't give it five stars because it also contains some fairly annoying dialogue that I absolutely refuse to forgive. For example, the character Storm asks the villain Toad what happens when a toad is hit by lightning and answers her own question by saying "the same as everything else." It's not funny or witty. It serves no purpose other than to make Storm look like a big cheese ball, and that isn't really fair. Not to mention, who really cares what happens to a toad when it gets electrocuted and why is that even a question to begin with? Let's just watch the lightning bolt strike and see toad explode. That is really just a nit-picking though, as X-Men is still a very good movie and it actually gets more and more important in terms of movie history with time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Normally when I watch a movie based on a comic book I cut it a bit of slack when it comes to things like character motivation.  After all, we are dealing with characters who are larger than life.  Heroes wear white and are motivated by a sense of justice, villains wear black and do their evil deeds basically because they are evil.<p>This sort of basic motivation has even snuck into mainstream movies.  Gladiator and The Patriot both had villains who, when asked why they do the evil deeds they do could be expected to reply, &quot;Because I'm the bad guy and that's my job.&quot;  The heroes of these movies are motivated by revenge rather than justice.<p>Here comes X-Men and shows them up with style.  On one side we have Normal Human Senator Kelly, out to register Mutants because he is afraid of them.  He is afraid they will make him obsolete, afraid they have the ability to destroy him at will and he has no way to protect himself from them except by marking them as dangerous beings.<p>On the other side is Magneto, a mutant with the power to control metal and a survivor of the Holocaust.  He sees this as an attempt to bring back those bad old days and is ready to fight it at all costs.<p>Both of these villains have motives that are wholly understandable.  In today's movies that is unusual.  In a movie based on a comic book it seems remarkable.<p>In between these two forces are the X-Men led by Professor Xavier who is out to keep the peace, prevent Senator Kelly's Anti Mutant law from being passed by legitimate debate and similarly try to keep Magneto from killing Normal Humans.  His team rescues Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in what should be a star making performance) and Rogue (The lovely Anna Paquin) from an attack by Magneto.<p>Purists to the comic book may balk at the variations from the original, but these things almost always happen when translating a story from one medium to another.  Even a simple origin story like Superman went through variations when translated to film.  The fact of the matter is that this movie treated the source material with respect in a quest to make a decent movie and the result is a movie which should have been hyped as an event when initially released.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Everything about this movie is great, special effects, storyline, and the casting as well.

It seems so easy to make a comic book into a movie. Comic books use frames and shots and the storyboards are already there, just adapt. Yet when they get to the screen, the tights look silly, the villains aren't what you expect and the whole thing seems to be an origin story even if you are familiar with these characters from long back.<p>This movie could have been horrible. There are so many characters in the comic book that the origin portion of the movie could have rivaled the original Superman for tedium. The cliched storyline running through the comic book has the theme of "oppression is wrong". <p>This movie gets it right by focusing on Wolverine and Rogue. Already the two most interesting characters in the comic, these are the ones you want to watch anyhow. Preserving the Wolverine loves Jean Grey and hates Cyclops storyline from early X-men helps to drive the story along. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are the best distinguished actors in Hollywood now that John Gielgud is dead. And there is a real plotline. Sure, it sufferes from the action movie problem of random bits thrown in for no reason, but you feel like someone actually sat down and wrote this. As opposed to most Batman movies where you think that a bunch of producers sat on the set yelling things at the director to do.<p>Of course there are problems and no comic book fan is going to love a comic book movie unconditionally. Sabretooth is supposed to be Wolverine's bigger and meaner double, but since they  hired a pro wrestler (and not a very talkative one) they didn't give him anything but a lot of grunts. Ray Park is a great martial artist which you can tell from his too-few-scenes. And a lot of the other X Men are just sort of there.<p>But still this is a fun movie and one that almost takes the bad taste of eitehr Punisher or Captain America out for only a moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>X-Men<p>Score: 84/100<p>I didn't really know what to expect of X-Men.

But this film surprised me beyond belief, I really liked it and I saw it twice at the movies, both times the level of excitement and interest were unbelievably high!<p>In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them &quot;mutants&quot;, the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Daivson). The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called &quot;X-Men&quot; to stop him. In the meantime, 2 mysterious mutants, one named Logan (Hugh Jackman), a powerful and agressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) emerge. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?<p>X-Men is a largely enjoyable and well-paced comic adaption that mixes thrills, action, science and comedy all into 90 minutes, and does it quite superbly. The star-filled cast all have a blast, really bringing the mutants alive, newcomer Hugh Jackman in particular, he's really quite stunning as Wolverine, and he is going to be huge. Famke Jenssen and Halle Berry should've been used more, but the plot is mostly worked around Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen + Jackman and Anna Paquin, so it really uses up most of the room. But, that's a minor flaw, in an awesomely-decorated, excellently strung-together piece of work that is much better than anyone had the right to expect.<p>Roll on X-Men 2. It can't come soon enough!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW.html">A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW</a><br/><p>The film raises some interesting questions such as what is the evolutionary path that we are on as human beings.

Forget about all that a let's just talk about the film which to me started out like gang busters and then lost some of it's intensity as the film progressed.

Against all the odds, the final product (based on a long-running Marvel comic series developed by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont and Len Wein) demonstrates a profound maturity that lifts it head and shoulders above the massed ranks of mechanical Hollywood blockbusters, whilst simultaneously delivering the kind of effects-heavy spectacle that audiences have come to expect from this particular sub-genre.<br /><br />Whilst bigoted politicians are fomenting unreasoning hostility toward a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers including telepathy, pschokinesis and/or mind control, representing the next stage in human evolution - a benevolent psychic named Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has established a private school where he teaches particularly gifted mutants to channel their abilities safely. But some of his most powerful students - played with earnest conviction by a number of Hollywood's sexiest rising stars, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden - are called upon to challenge the wrath of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant supervillain whose hatred of mankind was cultivated in a Nazi concentration camp (outlined in a harrowing opening sequence, where the film's sober intentions are signalled in no uncertain terms), and who is determined to launch a devastating assualt on the world's non-mutant population, igniting a war between the species that only the mutants can win.<br /><br />The unusually clever scenario provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, without skimping on either aspect of the production. That's due partly to David Hayter's concise script, Singer's ingenious ability to convey a wealth of relevant information at high speed without rushing or obscuring the details, and a strict adherence to the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.). The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen may seem unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors elevate the proceedings beyond the confines of mere 'Good and Evil', adding real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team are somewhat underused, but they certainly LOOK spectacular and they make the most of their limited screen time, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of a rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's Panavision photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins, reflected in the DVD's similarly-styled packaging.<br /><br />While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia, the only form of prejudice which remains openly condoned throughout society. Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protestors gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? These themes are further underlined in a Fox TV special included on the original DVD release, constructed as a series of news reports surrounding Congressional hearings on a proposed Mutant Registration Act, wherein Davison holds court with almost religious fervor, spitefully twisting the evidence to suit his own rhetoric, only to be laid low by an amusing final twist that mirrors the downfall of many a similar real-life politician. This particular interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) that he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it certainly provides plenty of food for thought...<br /><br />Followed by X2 (2003).</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>We all must realize that had this movie flopped, it is possible that there would not have been a "Spiderman", "Daredevil", or the terrific-looking (at least from the previews) "X2".  While many comic fans are rejoicing that the future looks great for this type of picture, there had to be a tremendous amount of pressure to do it right.  After years of seeing substandard products, due to a combination of lack of special effects technology or Hollywood indifference, the folks at Marvel waited many years for the right time to put together exactly the right movie.  <p>After living with these characters for many years and having it firmly in my mind what they should look like, I can say that there could not have been a better job of casting.  Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X.  Getting a actor of Ian McKellen's status for Magneto was a real coup.  Hugh Jackman gives the best performance in the highly desired role of Wolverine.  Who knew then that Halle Berry would become the second Oscar-winning actress in the cast (along with Anna Paquin)?  And who also knew then that Rebecca Romjin-Stammos would become arguably modeldom's hottest pin-up?<p>All these people were cast by others that knew the characters inside and out, and wanted the best product possible.  Like "Spiderman", there are very few changes to the "rules" of the characters, and anything done different (like ditching the familiar costumes) was done without harming a thing.  Watching it again is getting me really pumped up for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the future there is a race of humanoids born whom later when reaching maturehood develop powers and even bizarre appearences on some as they are mutants. However the human race misunderstands them and kind of treats them unfairly, so a powerful good mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have formed a school for the gift where young mutants can control their powers and help the benifit of all mankind. However there are some terrorist mutants lead by Magneto (Ian McKellen) who are hellbent on trying to destroy the human race so that mutants can rule over mankind, a runaway mutant girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) who has the power to absorb lifeforces and energy from other beings including mutants temporarily of course as she runs away from home. She meets up with a Canadian mutant named Wolverine (a.k.a. Logan) (Huge Jackman) but after being attacked by a savage brute named Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) they get rescued by a team of mutants named The X-Men lead by Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) where they live in Professor X's school for the gifted to help mankind from the bad mutants such as Magneto's minions like Toad (Ray Park) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijin Stamos) who are planning on mutating the whole human race.<br /><br />An excellent adaptation of the popular comic books from Marvel that started a different trend on superheroes created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Bryan Singer who did the excellent "Usual Suspects" was born to do these movies except for the third as he really took the comics metaphor on discrimination of different people well to the big screen after years of development hell even with Carolco originally wanting the rights but Fox came to save it. The acting is quite excellent including the action sequences as i love how this Sci-fi movie plays as a movie about racism in the future and how to try to be accepted by mankind. I love how this movie introduces audiences to a different cinematic superhero then Batman or Superman back in 2000 who is Wolverine making him the best superhero ever! it was followed by an equally awesome yet even better sequel.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set offers the movie in a glorious picture and sound quality experience that would rocket the viewer to the roof. The extras are fantastic like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage, Deleted and Extended Scenes with optional commentary, Mutant Watch featurette that appeared on FOX TV, Charlie Rose interview with Bryan Singer, Still galleries, animatics, Intro by Bryan Singer, Five-part interactive documentary, Trailers, TV spots and internet interstitials.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>Just when I thought comic adaption was a dead genre, X-MEN by Bryan Singer of the Usual Suspects fame has scripted a movie packed full of stupendous CG graphics and more importantly an enchanting allegory to life.<p>The clash between Magneto and Professor X and the human intensity in the action-packed drama captivates, because of a tight script and a well-ensembled cast boasting credible acts from Anna Paquin as Rogue and the enigmatic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It dissects a human drama between the difference of a mutant and ordinary, of race and segregation, and it makes the audience feel for the idiosynacractic ways that the mutants handle their grief of being ostracized. Professor X is suitably diginified; Ian McKellen as Magneto is embittered.<p>The fluid CG graphics add a sparkle to the action scenes where you see Wolverine and Storm wielding their power against Toad and Mystique and Bryan Singer has impressively incorporate so many characters in one show and yet able to make each and every hero alive. The only thing you blame is - there isn't deep characterization for every one of them, but that's understandable. <p>It's such fun and nostalgia to see your heroes and heroines battle out,criticizing the accuracy of the portrayal.

This film had me pndering for hours why a director would destroy a perfectly good comic series into an hour and a half of endless idiocy.  The acting was fairly good to start, and the beggining looked almost promising, but then, it dropped off considerably once you hit the first action scene.  This movie may be based on a comic book series, true, but to make a feature length film out of people flying in the air and smashing each other is pointless.  The director did do a good job with the casting I must say though, Ian Mcklellan, and Patrick Stewart save this film from hitting rock bottom.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the year 2000, Marvel Comics in association with 20th Century Fox officially ushered in the current age of superhero movies with the successful box office smash "X-Men". Truthfully, out of all of their vast properties to adapt for the silver screen, the X-Men seemed in my estimation to be one of the riskiest endeavors for Marvel in terms of being a hit. I felt it was a risky choice if for no other reason than the fact that the X-Men universe is so rich and diverse that it would seem almost impossible to winnow it down to a manageable level that could easily fit into a 90 minute or two hour running time. Yet, despite a few minor flaws in the story and/or some tweaks to some characters, the difficult task was accomplished in an extremely impressive fashion under the watchful eye of talented director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects").<br /><br />"X-Men" is the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has the unique ability to heal from any wound along with unsheathing razor-sharp adamantium (an unbreakable metal) claws from his hands, as he struggles to find the truth about himself, while helping a young mutant named Rogue (Anna Paquin). During their journey the two encounter a team of mutants led by the enigmatic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that somehow both humans and mutants can find a way to peacefully co-exist with one another. However, for every school of thought there is an equally strong opposing viewpoint, and this one is led by a powerful and extremely angry mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellan). As battle lines are being drawn, Wolverine and Rogue find themselves stuck in the middle of a war they never knew existed, and are forced to choose a side to stand with before time runs out.<br /><br />The story for "X-Men" as written by David Hayter ("Watchmen") provided a very nice and neat introduction into the expansive universe that these iconic characters inhabit. While this initial film featured a relatively focused story that revolved around the two pivotal roles of Wolverine and Rogue and their quest for answers and acceptance, it hinted at the potential for a much bigger story to follow on a much grander scale. For most franchises to succeed, especially those that could be deemed risky, you need the initial story to be a little smaller in scope in order to draw your audience in and establish the groundwork of relationships with which further sequels can build upon. Writer David Hayter understood this and crafted a very tight and concise script that moved along at an almost relentless pace, yet without really skimping on too many of the details. For comic book fans there were numerous nods or references to either events or characters from the comics, but this movie wasn't just for the fanboys. The wisest decision that 20th Century Fox and Marvel made was to make these characters as accessible to those outside of the world of comics as possible, but at the same time not making such drastic changes so as to alienate your core fan base. All of this was achieved with the story for "X-Men" and as I said a moment ago, it served as the perfect jumping point for this series to expand from.<br /><br />Bringing the film to life was director Bryan Singer, who with this movie brought to comic book films something that had been noticeably absent for many years...a semi-grounded sense of reality not too dissimilar from our own (apart from the whole super-powered thing mind you). Previous to this film (and for that matter the first "Blade" film), the only truly successful comic book movies were those in the initial Batman franchise, and in each of those movies we found a very eccentric, gothic-inspired reality that was more outlandish and showy. For me I appreciated the fact that Bryan chose to steep these films in a reality that was much more recognizable to our own rather than one much more fantastic. By doing this we are able to better relate to the characters, and therefore become immersed in the story, allowing for a much easier suspension of our disbelief (which every fantasy and/or sci-fi film relies upon).<br /><br />Besides the look and feel of the film, Bryan also excelled in creating some really fun, entertaining action sequences that at times felt like they were the very panels of a comic book coming to life. As a fan of comic books and some of the comic book films that had come prior to this film's release, I was pleased to watch an adaptation that knew how to blend the action elements together with intriguing character development. Generally these types of films had been written off as no more than summer fluff at the box office, and nine times out of ten this had been proven true. Not since 1989's "Batman" (to my recollection) had a comic book movie effectively blended those two all-important elements together to such a great degree of success. So, for this adaptation to buck the established order of things (so to speak), and actually include a coherent story rife with interesting characters along with the obvious entertainment factor inherent in most visual effects movies was a bit unheard of. Thankfully, Bryan Singer and his writer David Hayter, along with everyone else involved in the decision making behind the scenes of "X-Men" were smart enough to create a film that stayed somewhat true to the notion that this was a summer blockbuster, but also a movie that contained some great drama and could please audiences for years to come beyond its stay at the box office.<br /><br />Starring in this film is quite the varied group of talented actors and actresses ranging from veterans of both stage and screen, such as Sir Ian McKellan ("Apt Pupil") and Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek: Nemesis"), to some of Hollywood's great beauties like Famke Janssen ("Taken") and Halle Berry ("Swordfish") to relative new faces like Anna Paquin ("Fly Away Home") and Hugh Jackman ("Someone Like You"). What was great about this cast is that each member brought a seriousness to the role and portrayed these comic book characters as if they were any other dramatic role, opting not to play up the camp factor that would have been the order of the day in previous years past (for example the much maligned "Batman & Robin"). For a majority of the actors and actresses chosen for the various mutants, and humans for that matter, the casting appeared to be strokes of genius and good fortune combined, as each one looked as if they had manifested directly from the comic book page.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise casting choice, for me at least, would be a then unknown Hugh Jackman as the fan favorite Wolverine. Having not seen Jackman in anything prior to this film I wasn't sure if he could do justice to the clawed hero; however, I was completely blown away by the intensity and ferocity that Jackman brought to the role. His portrayal is so spot-on that it reached the point that his interpretation became almost universally accepted by the comic book fan community as being the one true Wolverine. A move that is surprising given that this community is generally extremely finicky about sticking to the details of their beloved heroes, not to mention the fact that Jackman is over 6' tall, lean, yet still muscular rather than being a short, and semi-stocky, but extremely muscular guy that would more closely resemble his comic book counterpart. With that knowledge one could see how surprising it is that his portrayal was so easily accepted, but I guess when it's clear that he's the ideal person for the role, some details can be overlooked for the greater good of the franchise.<br /><br />"X-Men" was a very well written, directed, and acted movie that gave comic book fans and audiences in general something that everyone could enjoy. For comic book fans there were some minor gripes about changes made to some of the characters origins, but nothing significant enough to take away from how great this movie was, or what it would mean for other comic book characters being brought to life on the big screen. Even after all the comic book movies that have bowed since this film's opening, "X-Men" still remains one of my all-time favorites of the genre, a fact that I don't see changing anytime in the near future.<br /><br />"X-Men" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Even for a movie based on a comic book, this one is pretty unwatchable, partly because it tries to take itself way too seriously. I saw "X-Men" shortly after seeing "Fantastic Four," and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This fantastic sci-fi/action film made in 2000 is a good versus evil super hero type.<br /><br />The movie opens with a scene out of World War II that shows people who are born different from the ruling society, being treated cruely.  One of these people turns out to be the villianous character, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto holds a grudge against mankind and has an accomplice, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) who can change into many shapes and forms.<br /><br />We are introduced to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)who runs a school for mutants that teaches them to harness their powers for the good of mankind.  These mutants possess extraordinary and dangerous powers which are the result of genetic mutations. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) grows metal weapons from his fists.  Cyclops (James Marsden) unleashes bolts of energy from his eyes. Storm (Halle Berry) can manipulate the weather. Rogue (Annna Paquin) absorbs the life force of anyone she touches. But these mutants must protect those who fear them as Magneto reveals his  plan for the future!<br /><br />I wanted to see all the X Men movies as my friend is currently working on the prequel, "Wolverine" starring Hugh Jackman in Australia and I promised him I would view them all.<br /><br />This film has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Director Singer, best known for The Usual Suspects, has created a film which is inventive and exciting while staying true to the comic's origins.<p>The main star of the film is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, a rouge mutant who joins Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)'s team of mutants including Cyclops, Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who are pitted against Magneto (Ian McKellen), the head honcho of bad guys with a plan to turn the world's population into mutants.<p>Wolverine is the main guy here, as Jackman proves to be perfect for the role of the hairy guy with some nasty claws. The star power of McKellen and Patrick Stewart gives the film it's gravitas, and the supporting cast of Tyler Mane as the imposing Sabertooth and Ray Park as Toad combine to create a great ensamble cast abbeted with a great script to work with.<p>Seamless CG combined with impressive live-action stunts is awesome, and the film's strong point, action, is well-paced and exciting, with a string of set-pices building up to the huge and amazing finale. The score, by Michael Kamen is a pulse-driven soundtrack that fits the film's style and tone well.<p>There are problems; the film does centre around Wolverine too much, making you want a bit more exposition on the other charcters and their backgrounds, and the film's running time makes the viewer want more, but hey, that's what sequels are for, and the next instalment will no doubt be worth the wait...<br />The DVD extras are impressive with "making of"s, deleted scenes and production material.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I originally did not plan on seeing this movie, but many of my friends told me that it was good, so I finally gave into the peer pressure and saw it.  I'm glad I did, because this movie is great.  I guess the visuals are the real stars of the film, but the actors are still good.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as Proffesor X and Magneto, respectively.  Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is on the mark, and the character Toad (Ray Park) is cool in his own way.  The script is good for the most part, but it does have some clich&eacute;s, such as Wolverine and Cyclops fighting over Jean Grey, or Storm giving Wolverine a lecture about choosing sides.  Also, a few lines weren't written very well, especially when Storm is about to fry Toad with a lightning bolt.  She says, "Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?  The same thing that happens to everything else!"  I just don't see the threat.  But all of the jokes were great, my favorite being the "Middle Claw" with Wolverine.  This is a feast upon the eyes, and is very good for some laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>You'd think with a movie like X-Men that it would just be all action and no character development or any sense of depth. But this movie is way different. The film takes time to develop its characters, especially Rogue, so you feel sympathy or agony for what they are going through, men or women. The plot of the movie is really quite simple but is given a lot of intelligence by the clever dialogue and good set-ups. The acting is fantastic - Ian McKellen is a good baddie despite his age, Hugh Jackman is hairy and fabulous, Patrick Stewart puts on a believable show as Professor Xavier, Famke Janssen is sophisticated and sexy, Halle Berry looks cool in a white wig and acts well as the powerful Storm, James Marsden is given heaps of opportunities to WOW! the audience, Anna Paquin is sweet and expresses Rogue's emotions brilliantly and the other evil X-Men do well too, including Ray Park (Darth Maul, anyone) in a tongue-twisting and scene-stealing role. Wow! Good casting, too, as you can see. Okay, back to the facts. The screenplay is neat and has heaps of depth, action, technology, adventure, science, chemistry and comedy. I enjoyed all the action sequences and the film is really hard to dislike, even for people who have never heard of or read the comic book. The story seems quite realistic too and you can even believe its happening, which is a big compliment for a fantasy flick. I loved the techno music on the soundtrack too, really good stuff for a party or something. The third or fourth time you watch this movie it isn't nearly as good as the first or second, but X-Men remains a cool, awesomely designed and entertaining visit into the world of comic book characters. X-Men 2, bring it on!</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a very good film. I hope they make another. Patrick Stewart is what acting is all about.

And it's a movie that fans of the comic books have been waiting for over 30 years to see. Well, after all of this time, I think we can mostly thank George Lucas for developing the technology necessary to bring an incredible action film like this to life. &quot;X-Men&quot; is every bit as good as I knew it would be, just watching the previews at the movies. Just by the way the story was explained in the three minute preview, I knew that Bryan Singer was going about this the right way, which is ironically like the way the animated series went about it when it first debuted. I think I can give a lot of the credit to the cast picks, and the performances from Hugh Jackman (the best Wolverine we could've hoped for), Anna Paquin (a younger but nevertheless effective Rogue), and of course Patrick Stewart who beamed down from the Enterprise to become part of another successful franchise. Never blink during this movie - you might miss something. But I can't help but wonder what would be different if they had given Bryan Singer the extra six months he originally had... Maybe that grinding swing around one of Lady Liberty's crown-thorns wouldn't look so... unrealistic. Was I the only one who noticed that the claws looked like pasty white straight lines and Jackman looked like he wasn't even there? I didn't think so...</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>This movie, quite frankly, was a disappointment. It had great actors (Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart), a halfway decent plot and good special effects. So what's my problem? I didn't actually CARE about any of the characters...It fails on the gut level. Part of the problem is that the movie is very short, so there is no room for real character development.<p>I'm comparing this movie to the Michael Keaton Batman flicks. Now THAT's how you turn a comic book into a movie! This is closer to Batman Returns (which I give 2 stars) than to Batman (5 stars).<p>Rent, don't buy.

What I found was a very enjoyable action movie, with more brains than one usually finds in that genre, with a good cast and excellent direction. If the sequel is this good, then it will definitely be worth watching.<p>In recent years, an increasing number of people have been discovered to be mutants, whose DNA has taken a leap forward and given them superhuman powers. Now their freedom is threatened. Rogue, a girl whose touch can kill (Anna Paquin) and Logan/Wolverine, (Hugh Jackman) a man with steel claws and amazing regenerative abilities are attacked in Canada, only to be rescued by mutants and taken to a top-secret "school for the gifted" in New York. It's run by the mind-reading/controlling mutant Carles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), to teach and protect his fellow mutants, known as X-Men.<p>But there are others without such benevolent plans. Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor who can generate powerful magnetic fields, anticipates a coming war between mutants and ordinary humans. With the help of the reptilian shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), savage Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and nasty Toad (Ray Park), he abducts and artificially mutates a U.S. senator, then threatens the entire population of New York with a bizarre weapon. And only the X-Men can hope to stop him. <p>Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it's done well. In fact, most of the movie goes under the listing of sounds-stupid-but-is-done-well. The superpower-enhanced action sequences are well done, and the mutants are given human edges and attachments that keep them from just being pretty faces with superpowers. They may not be homo sapiens any longer, but in personality they are quite human. The special effects are surprisingly muted, and usually kept in tune with the storyline. Though this is an action movie, it bothers to have a complicated plotline including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well. <p>Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his "children" in one scene). Ian McKellen is flawless as Magneto; this is not some random wanna-conquer-the-world villain, but someone who is embittered and determined to the point of potential genocide. (An interesting parallel is that he is a survivor of the Holocaust, yet he seeks to establish a "master race" of mutants) Hugh Jackman does a good job with Wolverine's tough-guy image that covers his confusion and loneliness, since he doesn't know who he is or who put metal all over his bones. Anna Paquin annoyed me as Rogue, because she seems to cry a lot. Famke Janssen (as telekinetic Jean Grey), Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm), and James Marsden (as laser-eyed Cyclops) are all good supporting roles, although Berry's role is somewhat thinner than her costars'.<p>This movie is also a bit darker than films like Spiderman, more adult and more disturbing (especially with the themes about prejudice and discrimination). This movie isn't quite flawless, unfortunately. Some of the costumes are a bit overdone, especially Storm's -- is there any logical reason for her to wear that silver catsuit and cape? Most of the characters are fine, like Cyclops and Wolverine, but occasionally the costumes get a little silly. Additionally, many of the scientific aspects of the movie are never explained at all, such as Kelly's transformation into the human jellyfish. How exactly does Magneto do this? I'm a little fuzzy on how that radiation is generated and how it affects ordinary humans.<p>Despite these flaws, "X-Men" is a good solid action/SF movie, especially since it so easily could have been a total disaster. Pop popcorn and sit back.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>The long-awaited comic book-to-film translation of X Men left some fans satisfied and some wanting more. There are some terrific action scenes and great characters. Veterans Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are terrific, as are Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The Special Effects in the film are inventive and amazing. My favourite SFX moment: Where Magneto is walking across a pathway created by moving metallic planks across a chasm, the pinnacle of cool. Director Brian Singer has loaded the film with eye-popping visuals and some great one-liners. Michael Kamen's futuristic score (one of his best) adds to the mysterious tone. After watching the film several times through, there are a few little quibbles. Wolverine is a great character, but a bit more exposition on the other characters would be good, and the rather stringent running time leaves the film a bit short on great set-pieces. Still, that's what sequels are for! <p>The DVD extras are great, with trailers, some interesting deleted scenes, "The Mutant Watch" featurette, a Bryan Singer interview, Hugh Jackman's screen test, still photo gallery and TV spots.

Most impressive."</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>Fear and dread crept over me as I first began to follow the making of this movie. I cringed as Ana Paquin was announced as Rogue, I cried when they didn't cast Derek DeLint as Magneto (who looks a lot like Jim Lee's interpretation of the character) and when I found out that Beast would not be making an appearance in this film I lost all hope for this movie being any good. I figured that X-Men would enter the tradition of [bad] super hero flicks along side the Batman movies... Thankfully Bryan Singer and David Hayter (AKA Solid Snake of Metal Gear fame) are geniuses and handled the X-Men, the limited budget, the costumes and everything with a surprising accuracy that made me see this movie almost as much as I saw Episode 1 when that came out. Only with this film it wasn't the title of the movie (though I am a huge X-fan) but the movie itself. X-Men was surprisingly well written, and now I've sworn to marry Ana Paquin... For what they set out to do, although her accent could have been more consistent, she worked perfectly as Rogue, and Ian McKellin is fantastic as Magneto, no... Perfect. These actors (except Hally Berry as Storm) became the characters for me. They worked out so much better than I had though, especially new comer Hugh Jackman's incredibly accurate portrayal of Wolverine. Jackman IS Wolverine as far as anybody needs to know. The story is much better than most comic to movie translations, and the best part is that the movie stays in the grays the way that the comics do, not having any villains that are just pure evil (except Sabretooth, who is sadly under used in this film.) The fact of the matter is that X-Men is definitely a super hero flick done right, it stays true to the spirit of the comics with only Storm being a disappointment. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's mostly tongue in cheek, and over all the movie is a lot of fun for people of all ages, weither or not they're X-fans, I firmly believe that most people looking for a good action drama will love X-Men. (Here's hoping that Beast will be in X2.)</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a beautiful, dark film that is perfectly cast.  The X-men and all their struggles really come alive in this one, along with some great action sequences and effects.  <p>I have read this comic for nearly 35 years, from its beginnings to the present day.  Never would have I expected that these characters could be portrayed with any depth on the screen!  But they are in this film, from Wolverine to Cyclops.  <p>Brilliant.  And better than all the other attempts to bring comics to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>As far as bringing comic books/games to the screen, this has to be the best so far. The filming, sound and acting are great. The only reason I feel I did not give it 5 stars is that I just finished watching "The Perfect Storm" the same day...and the acting does not compare... But if you like reading the X-men comic, you must have this film. The DVD gives you a lot of extras. And for a comic book, there is a very good story line. Wolverine's creation seems to need its own movie. Everyone else is born a mutant.... Of course the comic book as is the movie, is a statement on how the majority treats minorities they do not understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>amazon only lets us review one part of a whole set so theres a better chance youll buy more stuff if you like the first review.i guess theyre more interested in $ than the freedom of speech and not ripping off its customers.so im going to review them both right here.in part one,wolverine who has acute senses,admantium blades and a extremely fast regenerative power is hurt and rescued by the x-men who are a team of highly evolved people with extraordinary talents.he was with rogue when he was recruited who can touch people and see there thoughts  and drains mutants abilities.thier leader is professer x.one of the guys from star trek.he is insanely telepathic.while there at mutant school,he meets cyclops with eye lasers and jean grey who also does the telepathic thing.theyre enemies are magneto who controls anything metal,sabretooth-a cat like he-man,toad with a very long and powerful tongue.like 4 or 5 feet and can throw people.magneto has a special machine that could suck all mutants powers into his captive rogue and then take over from there.a battle goes down up top the statue of liberty.then in the second part,which i give 5 stars,another bad mutant who works for magneto named mystique uses nightcrawlers9a good teleporting mutant]body to attack the white house so the x-men will get the blame.magneto who is trapped in a plastic prison pulls the iron in his guards blood to rip him apart and escapes.the guy who aided his escape is a big shot goverment type who wants the mutants dead.his son is a mutant who can control otheres minds.but the dad can control him with a special machine.so they try to use the kid to control professer x into using his cerebro invention to kill all mutants.theres a big fight,blahblah blah.mystique is totaly naked except for blue dye and little rubber suction thingys allover her body.sabretooth is played by the lucha libre star taylor mane.thats spanish for professinal wrestling.they are both good but 2 is way better.jean grey is a semi hot red head.if the creators really wanted to go over the top spectacular with this set theyd finish telling the story.jean grey does come back as an extremely powerful mutant called phoenix.she is powerful enough to take over the world but doesnt want to since shes good.but then she gets turned into the dark phoenix.also ,there are many many cool characters not even explored yet.theres juggernaut-a giant kind of like hulk but smarter.apocalypse-a more powerful and giant version of the t-1000 from terminater 2.giant robotic mutant hunters called sentinals.the blob-a giant fat guy whose mirth absorbs most any blow.longshot-a good guy who has incredible luck all the time.archangel-with paralytic darts and razor wings.the beast-more agile than spider man,genius and colored a lot like sullivan from monsters inc.havoc-he can concentrate something and blow stuff up.even a mountain if he really really tried.gambit can charge things and use them explosively.bobby drake from part 2 later becomes a far more powerful ice man.firestar who shoots fire.a lot like pyro in part 2.there are many many more too.at least 30.they even travel to the future for numerous outstanding stories.my point being,while both of these movies rock!they could make at least 3 more totaly awesome ones and a whole string of sequels some even involving psycic vampires and the like.wolverine did the best acting in part one but was outshined by pyro in the 2nd one.pyro can control flames.ie:in one scene he lights a lighter and uses it to blast a team of cops away so he can escape.that scene was the best scene of both parts.there is this subtle ww2 minority rise up against the white kind of undertone but its  expected with hollywood.in the best scene i talked about,wolverine gets shot in the head at point blank,hits the ground and is up within a minute.i guess the only star is the dude from star trek.so these are his 2 best movies.all his others suck.the special effects are very cool.pyro and nightcrawler put on some dazzling displays.ive already given some ideas for sequels but will recap.1-apocalypse vs the x-men,2-the dark phoenix saga,3-time travel to the vampire world of the future,4-sentinals vs the x-men,5-time travel story where the x-men are eventualy betrayed and wiped out by a friend,and even when the battled kang who in the very distant future rules the world and sets out to conquer all time!i give the real deal and the real deal is if you dont get all this and more youre getting screwed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The special effects are good. The characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want. Welcome to Carrie, Christine, Firestarter, the Tommyknockers and many other Stephen King paranormal beings and situations. Of course, this film adds to that berserk universe a good old American wrapping but with a twist. The statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky  and jutting out of a flat no man's seascape. The twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the United Nations for the general assembly of this world's forum. This American wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants, against people who are different, who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible. And the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants, transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them. And before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them. Finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film, temporarily, they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutant-dom. Then the rest is not even sentimental episodes. It is pure action and mission and some fights, and a lot of visual special effects. That makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain Quasimodo in Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo: the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal Parisians want to victimize and kill.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>X-Men is the best comic strip adaptation I've seen to date. It has all the excitement and special effects that you'd expect, together with a class of acting that you don't see in many other films of this type.<br /><br />The story concerns the two factions of the X-Men. X-Men are mutations from normal humans. One is lead by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the other by Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen). Xavier believes the X-Men can work with humans. Magneto wants to destroy humanity and in a brilliant opening scene (shot in black & white) set during the 2nd world war we see he has some justification for this view. Patrick Stewart and in particular Ian McKellan are the main reasons to see this film. They add a certain gravitas to the proceedings that takes the movie to a different level. Having said that Hugh Jackman and the rest of the cast are all good.<br /><br />It always helps to have a good director and Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) does a great job. There are some excellent set pieces and the film is kept to a sensible length. This is well worth buying at the right price as it does hold up to repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>When this movie first came out, it was like "FINALLY!  X-Men on the big screen!"  Had they attempted to pull it off when X-Men was first invented in the early 60's, it would have fallen short, but modern special effects and filming techniques complemented the movie nicely.  And Wolverine, one of the most popular and awesome superheroes of all time, gets played by someone PERFECT for the role... Hugh Jackman!  Come to think of it, I have no complaints regarding the entire cast selection.  If you like superheroes and action movies, you owe it to yourself to watch X-Men.  And bonus, they made a sequel, and a third for us to enjoy!  I can't wait to watch it again...</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>World`s favorite mutants get their first movie and the result is convincing enough to deserve a watch. Bryan Singer, a repectable and innovative director ("The Usual Suspects", "Apt Pupil") shows enough respect and knowledge about the franchise and creates an entertaining and meaningful action movie, wich steps above many run-of-the-mill empty blockbusters with repeated ideas. The director expertly showcases the X-Universe, setting the mood and tone for the sequels to come.<br />Although this is sci-fi material, in a way it`s depicted in a realistic, believable manner, as the characters and their envoironment seem credible and not too fantasy-like creations. Singer developed a serious tone for this universe, avoiding the childish and irritating tendencies of the latter Batman movies. The plot focuses mainly on Wolverine and Rogue, so unfortunately the rest of the characters aren`t too developed, but given that this is the first movie of a series it works well enough. <p>"X-Men" is intelligent, creative sci-fi, a solid movie with good direction, competent special effect (used just when necessary, avoiding useless explosions and fights), an efficient plot and a talented cast. Not a masterpiece, just a good comic-book adaptation (in fact, it`s probably one of the best).<br />The ending result should please fans and non-fans alike, altough it would be surpassed by its sequel, "X2", a better and more sucessful movie. Worthwile entertainment (and though-provoking, too).</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>--The Setting--<br />The not-to-distant present. The human race is feeling threatened (perhaps by not having a cold war with a ready-made enemy to vilify) by a new phenomenon - mutant people who possess strange abilities. Are they defects and deformed people? Are they the next step in evolution? Whatever they are (hence the X term), they are a worry to many, particular the senator calling for their registration (a recurrent theme in American sociology - let's register those different from us; let's register known communists, let's register all gun owners, let's register all sex offenders, let's register, hmmm, what's left?).<br /><br />Some of the X people (sorry, the title is gender-inaccurate: not all of the X-men are men) see this as the first step to their imprisonment and irradication, particularly the one named Magneto, who watched his family being herded toward death chambers in Nazi Germany (where they also had a penchant for registration). Magneto decides that this is the final straw, and vows to 'change the minds' of the leaders of the world.<br /><br />On the side of the angels is Xavier, Professor Charles Xavier, powerful telepath, who is both a champion of mutant rights but also a believer in the fundamental goodness of humanity. Thus, we have the classic battle - good and evil. The battle lines are drawn. The forces line up.<br /><br />Behind Magneto, who can control metal objects, either believing in his vision of a corrupt humanity who will do them no good, or simply after the power their powers could afford them, are Toad, a mutant spits toxic goop with his rubbery tongue, Mystique, a basic shape-shifter, and Sabretooth, the 'muscle' every villain.<br /><br />In league with Xavier at his school are Cyclops, a man whose eyes fire laser beams, Storm, who can control the weather, and Jean Grey, who possesses minor telepathic powers and telekinetic abilities.<br /><br />Into the midst of this gathering battle fall Wolverine, a man with heightened senses, quick healing and special implants of metal, and Rogue, a frightened teenaged girl whose touch robs the one she's touching of his or her life force.<br /><br />--The Story--<br />Good versus evil. Who's side are you on? Wolverine and Rogue are nearly abducted by Magneto's forces, saved by Xavier's forces, then (of course) caught once again. There are some clever moments and diversions (what is really going on?), but mostly as a movie inspired by a comic book would be, the plot is predictable. Magneto is out to convince the world leaders that they are wrong to despise and fear the mutants by turning them into mutants. Each of the mutants has a reason to opt for one side or the other in this battle. Each of the X-people have a past, and we get only teasing glimpses of some of them. The good guys win, of course, but it isn't a definitive victory. Of course, you wouldn't expect it to be. This is supposed to be a blockbuster that will spawn sequels for years to come...Overall, this was a fun movie with a good action, a good story, and good effects. I must confess to never having seen the comic books before and being completely ignorant about the characters or plots, so there were no expectations to be dashed. Stewart and McKellen are two of my favourite actors, and they did not disappoint in their roles.<br /><br />My one wish would have been for more background and details - I know they were hoping to leave something for the sequels, but coming in at just over 90 minutes, they surely could have let those of us without a comic book interest in on a little more of the mystery.</p></br></body></html>

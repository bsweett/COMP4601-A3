For this is a bloody, gory, sadistic piece of art that gets down and dirty from the starting gate, and never lets go.  It's really a terrific movie.<p>Why?  Two reasons.  First, the special effects.  I've written in other reviews how I can give or take them.  Sometimes they help, sometimes I find them annoying.  A good movie still depends on plot, and if it's all special effects, no matter how good, there will be always something missing from the movie.  In this movie, they are not only good, as in the fight scenes, which convey the speed and agility of super beings fighting each other.  But they are also essential to the plot, which is reason two. <p>We are used to vampires being the bad guys, and this also remains for this flick.  But the story takes a plot twist when Blade and his mortal vampire enemies find themselves uneasy allies.  Why?  Because an even more terrifying and powerful breed of monster has evolved.  This new breed is kind of like a vampire, but, and this is where it becomes art, has powers and physical abilities that make the &quot;regular&quot; vampires look wimpy.  Part of these physical abilities are very realistically shown via the special effects, and therefore essential to the plot.  <p>I will not reveal what these new abilities are, but if you like you vampires gory, sadistic, and bloody, this one's for you.  And yes, there is even some good plot thrown in, as the previously mortal enemies are forced to work together.  There is also the return of Kris Kristofferson, who has been rescued from the vampires, but must be watched to see which side of the fence he's going to be playing on.  <p>Overall, one of the best action sequels ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Successful sequel to the 1998 gore-fest, this time Blade (Snipes)teams up with an elite vampire squad called the Bloodpack (who are actually trained to kill him) to hunt down and eliminate a new and tougher breed of bloodsuckers called the Reapers (reminiscent of Max Schrek's portrayal of NOSFERATU) who attack both humans and vampires. More dark, gothic and grotesque than the original with even better visual effects and martial-arts scenes. Gabriel Beristain's atmospheric photography and Del Toro's focused direction also give this bloodthirsty film a real, horrific European feel. Flawless entertainment all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Now come on after you saw Blade you knew easily that there<br />was going to be a sequel at least I, did.Well Wesely Snipps is<br />back as the daywalker in Blade 2.Last time we left him in Prauge<br />and we can see the change in Blade he has a sense of humor and<br />is much faster at showing his enemies no mercy yes Wesley Snipps<br />is amazing doing his martial arts scenes much more amazing then<br />Blade but then he had to pump up the volume.The story starts as<br />Blade is in a frantic search for Abraham Whistler who is played<br />by Chris Cristoferson when Blade finds him he decides to keep his old freind alive.But just as it seemed nothing would happen<br />after that Blade is attacked by mysterious foes that come to his hideout after a furious battle they let Blade know that they need<br />his help Blade suspicious of them takes precations and learns  ,<br />that undead vampireristic creatures called Reapers are feeding at will on the living and vampires , the Bloodpack as they call<br />themselves needs Blade to lead them into the darkness to battle<br />with the reapers.<p>  But Blade finds that some of the team does not like him but he gains a female love intrest from one of the members outnumberd<br />and closed in Blade fights furiously to stop the reapers but is<br />suddenly double crossed by a freind of Blades who seemingly gave<br />them Blade just to become one of them , Meanwhile a disagrement<br />between father and son for cursing him into the undead and the<br />son want's revenge...<p>  Blade 2 is bigger,better and faster then the original first<br />film Wesley Snipps is incredible in his action scenes Blade 2 is also in the highest format of Dts a 6.1 master of the film puts you into the heart of the film with incredible sound if you were<br />unimpressed by the first film this ones better if you liked the<br />first film you,ll get more in this one , if you have seen it in the theatre it has enough features to make it fun enough for those who have seen the film beings that it's two disks so what<br />are you waiting for the Daywalker has waited long enough neither<br />should you a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The original Blade was regarded as the beginning of the resurgance of comic book movies, and its sequel tops it in every way possible. I just saw this last night and my head is still spinning. Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes looking totally badass) returns two years after the original movie in search of his reincarnated mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), and after he finds him he is made an offer. A new breed of vampires called the Reapers are taking out normal vampires, and the vampire lord offers Blade a temporary truce so he can hunt them with his new associates the Blood Pack which is led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). The movie is slow in the first hour and a half, but the pace quickly builds up when secrets are revealed and Blade learns all is not what it seems, and what results are the best action scenes in a movie I've seen since The Matrix, excellent special effects (although some of the CGI could have been more polished), and the bloodiest goriest martial arts melee you'll ever see in a movie adapted from a comic book. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see martial arts great Donnie Yen (a member of the Blood Pack) for very long, it would have been great to see him and Snipes go at it in a fight scene.  All in all, Blade 2 is one of the few cases where a sequel outshines the original film, and this Platinum Series DVD is packed with extras: commentaries by director Guillermo Del Toro and Snipes himself among others, trailers, a strategy survival guide for the upcoming PS2 and XBox Blade 2 video game, and a Cypress Hill with Roni Size music video.  Sink your teeth into it as soon as you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>A tremendous movie from Guillermo del Toro.....the action and special effects are top notch.  If all out dazzling action is your thing then this one is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro's "Blade II" is one slick action film.  Despite appearances, it's not a technically a horror film but rather an action film with horror elements.  Yet, whatever the genre this film falls in, there is no denying its entertainment value.  It makes the first "Blade" film - which itself was not bad - look silly in comparison and illustrates that this franchise is one of the more creative, witty, and stylistic franchises going today.  "Blade II" is not high art or the next candidate for a British Film Institute analysis, but it is a fun and bold viewing experience.  <p>Half-man, half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) goes in search of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who is being held prisoner by the vampires.  After freeing his mentor, the two men return to Blade's dwelling where they are immediately confronted by other vampires.  However, these vampires do not want to kill Blade but rather want his help.  After sizing up the situation for themselves, Blade and Whistler reluctantly form an uneasy alliance with the bloodsuckers and go in search of The Repears who threaten both the human and vampire population.  <p>"Blade II" has its moments of strong violence and gore but they are not gratuitous and are sensible within the context of the film's story.  del Toro is smart enough to know that showcasing blood and gore just for the sake of doing so only generates cheap thrills so he has wisely avoided this approach to the material.  Thus, "Blade II" is a film with a dark tone that is more creepy than upsetting.  Helping to further differentiate this work from the average run-of-the-mill slasher film is the strong performances throughout.  Snipes and Kristofferson are great and  Ron Perlman and Leonor Varela ably complement them.  Sure, maybe Whistler shouldn't have been revived for the second film and yes, some of the CGI effects are pretty bad, but in the end the scorecard still comes out in favor of "Blade II" as its positive aspects handily outnumber its negative ones.  Long live the Daywalker!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Blade II is a successful sequel, it does what is has to do be right on with the original. What makes it a great sequel to is their ability to go in a different direction but at the same time, doing it correctly.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>I really liked this vampire movie, though its not as good as the first which was really excellent. A lot more blood with some messed up new nemesis'(the effects for how they suck the blood is great, must taste yummy). Snipes is always cool is this part and I think it fits him and I think its his best role, being the daywalker. The action hits cool with some new vampire slayings and there's one dopey scene in which Blade and that chick fight by the highlights, I mean come on you can tell that's fake, but the other effects are way cooler. I just hated that Danny John Jules (Cat from Red dwarf) had to die in the sewers as a lot of those Reapers came up and killed him. A good time.<p>...</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>"Blade II" is one of those sequels that is as good as the first movie, but strangely enough, a lot more illogical.  As Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half-human, half-vampire slayer recovers his presumed-dead mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he runs afoul of vampires bringing surprising news.  A new kind of vampire (known as Reapers) have appeared on the scene, and basically are killing ANYTHING to control their thirst.  With a pack of vampires (trained to kill Blade), Blade and crew try to contain the spread of the Reapers, but may be betrayed by forces within this teneuous alliance.  Directed by Guillermo Del Toro ("Cronos", "Mimic"), and boasting some shocking visual effects (such as the Reapers method of draining blood), this is definitely a good ride for "Blade" fans.  The DVD includes some funny commentary tracks with director Del Toro and Wesley Snipes, a detailed "making-of" documentary, a humorous batch of deleted scenes, documentaries on the visual effects, and a lot more.  This one is recommended (but not for the squeamish).</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>The daywalker known as "Blade" ( Wesley Snipes) is back! but this time, there is a race of powerful vampire creatures known only as "Reapers", they are parasitic genetically enhanced vampiric beings that suck the blood of both humans and vampires alike as they are bent on draining the lives of both races. A new order vampire clan joins up with Blade and Whistler ( Kris Kristofferson)as they both must be with the clan to exterminate these new breed bloodsuckers.<br /><br />An electrifying and ultraviolent sequel to the 1998 hit based on Marvel Comics vampire flick that reunites Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson with of course a new cast most reconigizably Ron Perlman from Hellboy and City of Lost Children as one of the vampire warriors. Director Guillermo Del Toro's style for this movie is just impressive as it triumphs over the original in anyway with more action, more vampires ( but some different ones this time), more gore, better acting and fantastic martial arts sequences that are cherographed nicely.<br /><br />The 2-Disc DVD has great stuff like crisp picture & Sound, two audio commentaries, isolated scroe, Deleted/Alternate scenes with commentary, galleries, documentaries, music video, trailer, and DVD Rom content. This is a must have DVD for the fanatics of horror movies, action, comic book movies, and vampire flicks alike, you won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>There was never a thought in my head that a sequel to Blade could be just as fun, dark, witty, and great as the original. I was wrong. Blade returns in his justly commendable sequel with just as must action and more bite than the first. More bite is mucho thanks to the events that takes place in the film. Blade is forced to join teams with a group of highly trained vampires to rid of a new breed of vampire called Reapers. These reapers, woo, they were some ugly freaks. They not only feed on humans, but plan to rid the world of vampires too. In Blade 2, it's basically good vs. evil vs. evil vs. good. This whole agenda made for some great plot twists which I didn't see coming at all, and a few I did, but they still were effective. The action is up a notch from the original, and it's all good. Most notable is the "House of Pain." Ouch.<p> Wesley Snipes becomes Blade once again, and adds more depth to the character. Kris Kristoffersoon returns as Whistler. Yep, thought he died in the first one too, but his return is simply and quickly explained. The estrogen in the film comes from Leonor Varela as the daughter of a respected vampire leader. Great actress, and her last scene is quite poetic. <p> Guillermo del Toro must have known exactly what he wanted, and he must have known what the fans wanted. He pulled all of the right punches, made a great cast of characters (It's all about Scud!), and gave the Blade storyline another level. Here's to a third . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Other than the explanation of where he (Blade) came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.<br /><br />The movie is essentially a platform for Snipes to have fun with his most renowned character. And he does so with very entertaining results. The movie has reasonably well rounded characters, suspicion piled on top of everyone, some amazing set pieces and a good sense of humour. The impact of all the blood and guts is reduced by the obvious fantasy of the fights (wires and SFX a lot of the time), but its still pretty powerful.<br /><br />The lead performances are all very good, although some of the peripheral characters are a little too hammer horror. Luke Goss demonstrates great potential, although you would need to see him without the make up, body doubles, and special effects to really judge. and there is occasionally that urge to shout "when will I be famous." and the pure blood female vampire who takes a shine to blade is well worth being bitten by.<br /><br />Overall it feels less like a sequel and more like a stand alone movie. with this in mind, I think its in fact better than the original (a rare example of the exception that proves the rule).</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Blade II' is one of the few exceptions to the rule concerning sequels. This one rivals the first and posits the proverbial question "which one is the best?" My general rule is the original is always the best, but I accept my choice as subjective opinion and will posit the possibility that I might be wrong.<br /><br />In installment two Blade joins forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy a new strain of the vampire virius which is producing a hybrid creature with a ravenous thirst that hunts both vampires and humans. Now fighting alongside the "Blood Pack", a group initally put together to hunt down Daywalker, the battle for the survival of both races is about to begin.<br /><br />Positives: More action, more blood. Ron Perlman is amazing as Blood Pack wiseguy 'Reinhardt'. The scenes involving the interaction between Blade and Reinhardt are the best in the movie. Also, the inclusion of Hong Kong martial arts legend Donnie Yen as 'Snowman' was a great move. Unfortunately they killed him off much too early.<br /><br />Negatives: The storyline and dialogue aren't as sharp and cohesive as the first (with the exception of the banter between Blade and Reinhardt). Leonor Varela is good as the vampire princess 'Nyssa', but I would've preferred the return of N'Bushe Wright to reprise her role as Blades' potential love interest Dr. Karen Jenson.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>&quot;Blade ll&quot; offers exactly what you would expect:  Lots of martial arts fighting, thin plotting and ghoulish vampires, but the surprise is in director Guillermo Del Toro exhilirating and stylish approach, which elevate the film above its somewhat far-fetched plot, even for a vampire movie.  Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the titular vampire hunter, and with just as much aching cool as he did the first time around.  Within the first ten minutes of the film, he saves his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from torture, and a new breed of vampire shows its face.  A Reaper.  A super-strong and almost indestructible foe that turns it vampire victims into new Reapers and this gang is led by a jolly good fellow Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).  Seeing Nomak as a threat, the Vampire Nation offers a truce to Blade for his help in hunting down and killing the super-vamps.  But of course, nothing for Blade is what it seems, especially with David S. Goyer's occasionally juvenile script.<p>But Snipes (who also co-produced the film) and Del Toro shine in this kind of movie.  Intense fight scenes comprise nearly half the film, involving swords, guns, bombs and plenty of fist-flying, giving fans of the first film what they really want:  Blade kicking much Vampire ass.  But the fights are sometimes marred by painfully obvious computer effects, and a couple painfully trashy shots.  But these are minor quips, seeing as Snipes is so freakin' cool as the big bad Daywalker, and Del Toro stages the battles with intense, macabre applomb.  If your in the mood for escapist fare with plenty of bloody violence, &quot;Blade ll&quot; fits the bill nicely.  The DVD includes a making of, details on the Vampire make-up and interviews with Del Toro, Snipes and David S. Goyer.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>BLADE II  is a far superior film from BLADE in just about every element: the acting, directing, writing, effects, music, lighting, sound, plot, believability are all better in this sequel than the original. I'm not sure why that is because at face value, it would seem that BLADE II is a totally unoriginal film, borrowing from the best of action-horror movies. However, the film works and works quite well.<p>BLADE II starts off not too long after the original movie ended. Two years have passed since Blade saved the world by ridding it of the young vampire who was threatening to destroy it.  Blade has spent that time killing vampires and searching out their lairs, seeking to find his weapons-manufacturer, mentor, and friend, Whistler. In BLADE, everyone assumed that Whistler was killed. However, we soon learn that wasn't quite the case. He tried to kill himself, but the vampires wouldn't let him. Instead, they turned him into one of their own and beat him as close to death as possible and then began the procedure all over. Blade succeeds in finding Whistler and injects a serum into him that will either turn him back into a human or kill him when the sun rises. The serum works and things seem back to normal.<p>However, things aren't quite normal. A new breed of vampire has risen that doesn't seek out human blood, but vampire blood. Also, unless a vampire is devoured, it turns into one of these new creatures, too. The creatures seem to be a cross between zombies and vampires, but stronger than either one. Silver and garlic have no effect upon them and only sunlight does any substantial damage. The vampire lord summons Blade seeking a truce. He wants Blade to help him hunt the creatures down. Blade agrees, only because it brings him farther into the vampire world than he has ever been before. And so, the chase begins.<p>The action was quite good in the film and though much of it is derivitive from the Matrix, those style of stunts work in the world where BLADE II takes place.  I was also impressed with how fleshed out the characters were. All of the major characters were fully developed in this movie and we see sides of Blade and Whistler that weren't even hinted at in the first film.<p>Overall, BLADE II is a fairly decent action picture that is far better than the original film in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Two things are prominent in this fast-paced, gory, adrenaline pumping sequel:  the action is non-stop and the Reaper vampires are some of the ugliest creatures committed to cinema, and impressively real-looking.  Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the half-vampire/half-man killer who is recruited by a Nosferatu like vampire (played with quiet relish by Thomas Krestchmann) to rid the world of these mutant vampires who are impervious to silver, stakes and garlic; sunlight seems to be their only mortal enemy.  Snipes reunites with Kris Kristofferson and takes on nerdish Norman Reedus to join forces with "normal" vampires to wipe out these deadly new creatures.<br /><br />BLADE 2 moves like a tornado, with dazzling fight sequences, lots of flashy gore, and tremendous atmosphere from director Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy).  Ron Perlman is on hand as a particularly nasty vampire whose cockiness and macho bravado is properly put in its place finally.  And Leonor Valera is beautiful as the vampire Nyssa.  Luke Goss gives fierce delivery to his role as the original Reaper.  There are a few surprises at the end, which gives BLADE 2 a powerful presence as a genre film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>Amazing fighting scenes, Snipes acting as good as ever, fast-paced action (but in accord to the screenplay adn the characters possibilities, not stupid nor absurd like so many other action movies, good supporting cast, god cinematography, good special effects, good plot.<p>I never read any Blade comic book or history, but I enjoyed every second of this and the first one.

[The original was directed by Stephen Norrington.] It may be just a testosterone-laden movie aimed squarely at young males, but at least it's finely crafted and not without a touch of style. As for substance, forget substance. It's based on a comic book and, if the characters all behave in a cartoonish way, perhaps that's on purpose. <p>As for the special effects, "Blade 2" has some creatures that are genuinely scary. When these mutant vampires take a bit out of you, they don't kid around. <p>The script is absurd and full of plot holes. Blade [Wesley Snipes], half man, half vampire, now faces a new enemy - a new kind of vampire that is unaffected by most of the conventional weapons used against such creatures, Even the purebred members of Vampire Nation enlists his aid because these monsters are out to get them, too. The script, though, is just a framework on which is built a series of dazzling, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences, all fought on fairly ingenious and properly creepy sets. <p>"Blade 2" is strictly for the boys. It's a bad choice for a date movie. Frankly, it's not really my kind of movie. I'm more intrigued by character-driven fare. Still, it's only fair to admit that, for what it is, this is very good entry in the horror genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>just as powerful and shocking as the first one<br /><br />see this<br /><br />it will shock you just as much as Blade did<br /><br />it's awesome<br /><br />have seen it 2 times already on my dvd player<br /><br />count on it staying a true classic over the next 90 years<br /><br />it really does terrify and entertain you<br /><br />Snipes is the perfect vampire night killer</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>A totally different level of film making and professionalism compared to the original, and not in a good way.

Wolfman and Gene Colan of course was the original Marvel comics team which created Blade from a subplot in their most popular horror comic Tomb of Dracula in the 1970s. Those dudes pretty much knew they were creating comic books stories and never, never took themselves 100% too seriously.<p>Blade II loses the light touch--as much as fables of vampirous goings on could indeed have a light touch--and goes for the jugular, pun intended. I found myself wishing for one of those campy, talky Vincent Price death scenes since most of the creatures here explode in a special effects blast into dust and immediately into oblivion type of thing when killed. The crew of offending vampires creepily open the flesh on their cheek, jaws and upper neck to--bite yer neck and suck yer blaad! Yeesh! And Snipes smiles sadistiaclly thru-out the entire thing. It was a chore to look at it 'cuz it is busy, so many of those vamp things disintergate and no one is having that much fun.

This was just a poor script, with a lot of hammy acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>What a stinker.  I mean, the first "Blade" movie wasn't exactly high art, but at least it had some enjoyable moments.  This sequel, by contrast, is dreary and belaboured, everything too calculated and cold... I'm sure they meant for it to be stylish and sexy, but it's all just dreadfully dull.  The film sets up the most hackneyed cliches (Blade the loner gets set up with a super team, a punkish/modern primitive vampire platoon, which he must lead to defeat their common foe...) but instead of following through on the premise, the filmmakers just let it drop to the floor, as flat as everything else in the movie.  No one bothers to embue the members of the group with any personality -- why bother?  they're going to die anyway.  In fact, they hardly get any dialogue at all, not even a wisecrack or cynical aside.  It's all just chop chop chop hack hack slice dice chop chop chop.  Hack.  Slice slice slice.  Bang bang bang.  Boom. Chop. Slice. Pow. Chop.  Bang bang bang.  Techno fetishism and grotty special effects are supposed to save this film, but once again, we learn the lesson that razzle dazzle and gimmickry in and of themselves cannot make a dead film fly.  An 11+ on the yawn-o-meter.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>I seem to recall a time, in the not too distant past, when vampire movies actually made a little effort to be scary.  This is no longer the case, apparently, for nowadays the vampires themselves have become so image-conscious that they just can't seem to be bothered with anything as mundane as conjuring up a few goose bumps for a thrill-starved audience.  These modern-day Draculas need to devote all their time and energy to proving just how hip, cool and trendy they really are.  Take the bloodsuckers in "Blade II."  In this sequel to the highly successful 1998 original, the vampires all talk in the vernacular of streetwise thugs and sport the very latest in grunge attire (one would think that there would be at least a few old timers in their ranks who would rather don a Bela Lugosi-type tuxedo than a torn jeans and leather ensemble, but, apparently, in this day and age, vampirism has become strictly a young person's game). <p>In this film, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the laconic "half-vampire" who, unlike his full-blooded brethren, can move around in the daylight.  Blade has dedicated his life to defending mankind against the deadly assaults from the world's apparently enormous vampire population.  However, in "Blade II," a new twist has been added.  Blade learns that a new form of vampire - a "super vampire," one that feeds on vampires as well as humans - has suddenly been unleashed onto the earth, and the mere conventional vampires are forced to enlist the aid of their own archenemy to help defeat this new strain.  <p>Because "Blade II" ends up substituting action for suspense, the movie quickly turns into a monotonous series of nonstop chase scenes, gun battles and kickboxing sequences - all filmed so darkly that it is often hard to fully see what is happening on screen.  I guess we are paying the price for the success of "The Matrix," since every action movie worth its salt now has to feature at least half a dozen martial arts sequences to make the action-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.  The makers of "Blade II" also rely so heavily on gross-out effects and state-of-the-art gizmos and gadgets that they all but drain the life's blood out of the film.  With no one for us to identify with or care about, there is really no way for the story to generate any actual suspense.  We sit and watch, admiring of the technical aspects of the film, perhaps, but completely unabsorbed in the action on screen.  In "Blade II," the vampires, super-vampires and pseudo-vampires, by waging what is little more than a two-hour long gun battle, end up boring us long before the sun peeks over the horizon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Blade II&quot; is unique.  Consider first that it is based on an underappreciated and, up until the first movie, relatively unknown superhero outside of comic book stores.  Then consider that it's a sequel.  These are two things that just don't add up to success in the modern world.  You can make a clunker of a movie like &quot;Hulk&quot; and still get big numbers in the opening week based on the character's name alone.  You can also toss together a sequel(any of the &quot;Batman&quot; sequels)and gain solid numbers until word gets out that the movie is horrible.  Somehow &quot;Blade II&quot; takes both of these seemingly impossible odds, puts them together with a good plotline, slick action and solid direction, and comes up with a good movie that's ten times better than any other action sequel out there(excepting &quot;X-2&quot;).<p>Snipes is perfect as &quot;Blade.&quot;  He pulls it off with style, humor, and attitude.  Every move he makes is done in a &quot;superhero pose&quot; type of way.  He makes &quot;Blade&quot; both believable and impossible at the same time.  He's just flat out cool.  I know very little about this character except what I learned in the first movie.  I don't know if they got everything correct about the character, but I don't care because Snipes owns this character in the films.  Let the geeks iron out the inaccuracies.<p>&quot;Whistler,&quot; played by Kris Kristofferson, is his same old tough-as-nails, cranky self.  The &quot;Nomak&quot; character, by Luke Goss, is a perfect foil.  You almost feel sad for the guy since his pop screwed with his genetics like that.  His fight with &quot;Blade&quot; is one of the best brawls in modern comic-to-screen history.  It's over-the-top, a little fake-looking at times, but fits the tone of this movie to a tee.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, especially Ron Perlman, the perfectly annoying Scott Reedus and Danny John-Jules(of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;).<p>Don't let the naysayers fool you, this movie has a solid storyline to it. It may not be the romanticized version of a vampire most folks are used to these days, but it does give you a taste of the gory side of our bloodsucking brethren.  If the plot isn't your cup of tea, don't worry, because this movie has also got gene manipulation, ninja-vampires, the token nightclub brawl, cool gadgets that would make &quot;Batman&quot; giddy as a schoolgirl and even a love interest, albeit a brief one.<p>Director Guillermo Del Toro manages to make the &quot;Blade&quot; franchise his own with this sequel.  He keeps the dark, techno-music tone of the first flick intact, but puts his own mark on this flick as well via gore and stylized action.  Folks knock the sometimes-obvious CGI effects and &quot;Wrestlemania&quot; type fight sequences found throughout this movie, but that's what makes this movie so fun.  It's not too serious, it's fun and it's so stylish that you'll want to forgive the CGI miscues and over-the-top fight scenes.  This is an action movie folks, not &quot;Pride and Prejudice!&quot;<p>In closing, watch this slick flick for the fun, action-packed romp that it is.  &quot;Lestat&quot; he ain't, but &quot;Blade&quot; could take that punk out anytime, anywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>The drawing of comparisons between this film and its predecessor is almost inevitable, and probably a mistake, but we'll go there anyway.  Blade II is bloodier than Blade; Blade II has more action than Blade; Blade II has better composition and effects than Blade; Blade II has a more complex storyline than Blade, yet I still am somewhat partial to the original.  <p>Under the directorial guidance of Guillermo del Toro, we get to see a lot more action and a lot more blood spilled, particularly by the &quot;super vampires&quot; that Blade and the rest of the vampire crew join forces to hunt down.  Although one can almost place bets on the order in which the vampires accompanying Blade will die at the hands of the super vampires, the film still is suspenseful and holds back a few plot twists.<p>The two things I noticed most were del Toro's penchant for over-contrived CG action shots, some of which looked a bit cartoonish, and the completely different feel del Toro evoked.  Where Norrington relied heavily on a more monochromatic gray-black feel with touches of green and blue, del Toro plays more in the red-orange visual spectrum.  This, plus the Prague setting, gives Blade II a very different feel than Blade.<p>I didn't find a great deal of interesting material in the second disc, but the director's commentary is interesting (and amusing) enough to listen to if you can get through del Toro's thick accent.  Particularly funny is his description of an edit that was made to a scene after women's groups complained.  Also of interest is that the scene in question (which occurs in a private room at an adult store) is reminiscent of another David Goyer-scripted scene from Crow: City of Angels.<p>From his commentary, you can tell that del Toro had some dark, messy fun making this film, and that is evident in the splatter-fest that ensues.  Did I mention that del Toro is also less subtle with the gore than Norrington?  Bottom line: equal parts monster and action flick, Blade II delivers in either genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film brings back to the screen the story of Blade, the vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must ally with his enemies in order to prevent a new breed of vampires from taking over.  It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, though the choice of Norman Reedus as Scud was poor at best as he does overdo it with his character's "attitude;" it gets tiring, not to mention extremely annoying after a while (but then again that could have been done on purpose in order to pave the way for his "ending").  In any case, he is not convincing in his role.<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Blade is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Its hard for sequals to follow up on a great first installment, especially as one as good as Blade.  There are two direction to go, which is stick close to the first film, so that the 2nd seems too much like the first, or go in a differect direction, which might take the story too far from the first film.  Blade 2 does the latter, which doesn't provide as an exciting and tightly-developed story as the first Blade, but the tons of action of the first film remains, along with a lot of fun and excitement.<br /><br />In Blade 2, a virus is transforming the vampires into a breed of supervampires, who are tougher, more agressive, and feed off of the normal vampires on a regular basis.  The leader of the vampire nation calls in an elite team of vampires known as the blood pack, who's leader is played by the impressive Ron Pearlman (Hellboy, Alien: Resurrection).  Among the team, is also a member played by Donnie Yen (Kill Zone, Shanghai Knights, Hero) for all you  martial art fans out there.  The team forms a very uneasy truce with Blade, in order to have some help defeating the supervampires and to seek out the vampire nation's leader's son - who has been turned into a supervampire too.  Whistler returns to the scene, which is a little confusing after the first film, since it appeared he shot himself.  However, Blade 2 decides to bring back his character and explains this in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Most of the movie is action packed, and great action at that.  The story isn't as sharp as the first, because a lot of screentime is devoted to hunting out the supervampires.  About 2/3 through though, story gets a bit more exciting and takes some twists and turns until the end.  As for the action, overall there is even more this time around, but several scenes overdo the cgi a little, and it is evident and distracting.  For fans of Donnie Yen, he has one very cool scene with exceptional choreography, and his character (though without any dialouge) is just bad (in the cool way).  Blade is not quite as cool as in the first film, but he's still just downright fun to watch.  He has a final fight against the leader's son, which is 3 minutes of one of the better fights I have ever seen.  I loved it more than the final fight in the first Blade.  This fight is even faster, harder, and longer.  It is definetly an edge of your seat fight.<br /><br />Blade 2 may not take itself quite as seriously as the first Blade, but it is almost more enjoyable in a fun kind of way.  Tons of action, plenty of gore, and even some frightening moments make it seem scarier than the first Blade.  A hardcore fan may be dissapointed with the direction the sequal took, but someone looking for an enjoyable movie will still love this.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>For the first major motion picture of a Marvel Super Hero, the Comic book Enterprise chose Blade.  Surprisingly, he is a very low key, lesser-known `anti-hero' who never even had his own comic book.  Maybe that was the trick; use a hero that no one knew as a hero so the stigma of comic books wouldn't taint the popularity.  Let them find out he was born from the comic books AFTER they see the movie and like it.  Now, after several Marvel Character adaptations, including Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men and the soon be released Elektra and Fantastic Four, Blade has pulled through well with two movies and a third one just released.  He is the only character so far to get three movies.  But soon that will change when Spider-Man and X-Men get their third installments.<br /><br />As for Blade's second movie he takes on a new breed of Vampires that are tougher to kill and even tougher to stomach when they are finally defeated.  An astute friend of mine made the comparison; `Blade 2 is to Blade what Aliens is to Alien...more of them and more dangerous', an accurate comparison.  There is even a Special Forces group of Vampires that Blade cautiously teams up with to take them on, because apparently, the current vampires don't want to be killed off by the next evolution of their own kind.  Recruiting the `Day Walker' seems to be their best choice.  If he gets killed in the process, so be it, one less problem for them to deal with.<br /><br />If there was any hint of character development in the first movie, this one totally side steps it and goes straight for the adrenaline rush.  With scads of vampires to be killed in overblown spectacles of blood and illuminating effects, lots of ammunition and explosives to be set off and plenty of faces to be smacked around by Blade's wheel kicks, not to mention snide remarks made between Ron Perlman's character and Blade, we certainly get the sense that this movie was created to wow us, and wow us it does.  No shortage in action and a good plot make this a very worthy sequel that actually shows what could be done when comic book characters are developed to really show their ability.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>this was an cool movie about vampires. me being the horror fan i am rented this with high expectations. it met them and then some. i loved this tottally. okay so heres to the plot. blade is half man half vampire and tottally rad superhero fighting another team of bad vampires and it allk adds up in the end thanks to the pervasive gore anjd extremely strong violence with a techno soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>...with plenty of carnage....blood everywhere! way more complicated than the first, maybe even more interesting (however I loved the first one also) If you want a movie with a ton of gore, and a ton of action this is it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>As if to prove the old adage "if it ain't broke don't fix it," "Blade 2" continues in essentially the exact same vein as its predecessor.  In other words, it's another combination of the old-fashioned vampire movie with the butt-kicking martial-arts extravaganza.  So if you liked the first one, you should have no problem getting into the sequel.  Of course, since "Blade 2" IS an action sequel, everything from the original has to get turned up a notch (or ten).  As a result, the fight scenes are more frenetic, the violence more graphic, the enemies more dangerous, and the special effects more extravagant.  The first "Blade" was very impressive visually, but this one makes it look like the original "Dracula."  That said, the unremittingly bleak look and feel of the original is very well preserved in the sequel.  Since the vampire-hunting plot of "Blade" wouldn't have been as impressive in a sequel, this movie finds Blade hunting an even more fearsome foe: genetically engineered SUPER vampires!  That's right, Blade (reunited with Whistler and teamed with an elite crew of "regular" vampires) now has to take on a gang of "reapers" who are even stronger and more bloodthirsty than regular vampires, not to mention immune to silver and garlic.  Pretty scary.  Naturally, the plot stops for a killer fight scene every ten minutes or so, and the choreography and cinematography are enough to rival that of "The Matrix."  It's all pretty far-fetched, but it does make for escapist entertainment at its finest.  And since "Blade 2" was gangbusters at the box office, hopefully they'll be getting a third installment out there soon.  Wesley Snipes has been all but typecast as an action hero by now anyway, so he might as well go with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>BLADE 2 kicks off shortly following the events of the original, this time teaming The Daywalker with a unit of highly trained vampire mercenaries who have enlisted his aid in order to destroy a common foe. These mutant "Reapers" are an evolved breed of vampires that hunt both humans and bloodsuckers alike, posing a huge threat to both species. Guillermo Del Toro steps in for Stephen Norrington this round, bringing with him a slicker look, even more fast-paced action, and a ton of bloody gore. Goyer has also eliminated the cheesier elements and over the top dialog that bogged down his first script. The success of the original allowed for a greatly expanded budget, which Del Toro has poured in to the elaborate set designs and improved FX. The Reapers benefit most from these upgrades, possessing excellent make-up work that crosses the eerie rat-like features of Max Schreck's Count Orlok with the deadly mandibles of The Predator. BLADE 2 is one of the rare series sequels that outdoes the original on every level, making it the strongest of the three films.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>There is plenty of action in the sequel to the excellent Blade,but it just doesn't hold up to the first film.

I am not familiar with the comic book character other than Blade is half human and half vampire. The special effects in that movie blew me away. I was a bit wary of the sequal but after seeing &quot;Blade II&quot;, that movie was just as good as the first. I'm a huge vampire fanatic and the last vampire film (&quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;) turned out to be a real turkey. &quot;Blade II&quot; definitely didn't disappoint me. I found the idea of Blade working with his enemies to eradicate this new breed of super vampires compelling. I must admit I was rather grossed out by these super vampires and watching them feed. When Blade rescued his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), I wondered if Whistler was going to turn out like Blade; half-man, half-vampire since he was infected with the same vampire virus. Some of the humorous moments in the movie came from Ron Pearlman's vampire character . My favorite character in the movie  I have to say is the vampire named Lisa, played by Leonor Varela.  I liked how strong-willed her character was. What I really enjoyed was the twists that the storyline of the movie took. I really didn't expect for how the movie ended and for one of the major characters in the film. Obviously Wesley Snipes watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; very carefully because a lot of the fighting scenes in the movie were heavily influenced by &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Now while &quot;Blade II&quot; is by no means Shakespeare, it definitely is one of the few modern vampire films that I thoroughly enjoyed without nitpicking the storyline apart. Truly an action classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>It is rare to see a movie that can it top its predecessor in both technical production design and an overall acceleration of movement throughout a would-be-let-down sequel.  Blade 2 is one of those rare movies that just has "something" that the first one didn't have-HEART!  I feel when I watch the original Blade (which I've seen too many times to mention) it seems as though the director wanted to simply introduce an idea-"the world isn't what you think it is."  Blade 2 has a strong (and complex) story, it's introduced it's important characters from the first one so it doesn't need to back track on things.  The exception is a few forced scenes I think they should've left out about Whisler and his history with Blade since most people already knew about that.  Aside from that, the reapers were simply a epic marvel of great prosthetics and slick CGI.  The action is faster, the gore is far more vivid and surreal and the overall look of the film is a showcase of constant improvements from the last film.  Quite simply, this DVD and film is OFF THE HOOK!  Can't wait for number 3!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>The horror action genre seems to invite mediocre sequels.  Film producers seem driven to repeat as much of the original film as possible, and most story lines are never all that rich in the first place.  So I picked up 'Blade II' as lark, not even positive that I would want to review it.  What I never expected was a sequel so good that it made 'Blade' look like it was just practice.<p>When the film opens, you discover that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) never really shot himself in 'Blade'.  Instead, he was captured by vampires and has been used as a mobile blood bottle for the past few years.  Our first sight of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is Whistler's rescue.  Leaving a trail of dusted vampires, Blade takes his old mentor back home and administers vampire anti-venom.  There we meet Blade's new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus), who alternates between getting stoned and keeping Blade's supply of technological tricks working.<p>What follows is a spectacular attack by a pair of vampire ninjas who bear a message from Damskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), an ancient master vampire.  Vampirish reapers are eating the bloodsuckers of Prague as a snack before starting on the humans, and Damaskinos offers Blade the help of his vampire SWAT team, led by daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), if Blade will consent to clean up the mess.  Blade, attracted by the idea of using vampires to kill even worse vampires, agrees.  And with that, the good times begin to roll.<p>The story, by David Goyer, is completely engaging.  It is full of noir imagery, with an almost Machiavellian plot, pitting modern technology with constant reminders of how ancient the vampire world really is.  In addition to the story itself, this film sports some of the most exotic fight choreography and digital imagery I have seen in this genre.  Director Guillermo Del Toro spares little to create a world of comic book intensity that draws heavily on anime for it's visual style.  The intent was to outdo the original production without imitating it in the least.  And that is exactly what he does.<p>If you have seen Blade, you already know that Wesley Snipes is perfect as the human vampire hybrid of few words and many moves.  And Kristofferson is equally perfect as the gritty sidekick.  Leonor Varela turns in a surprisingly good performance as the beautiful and deadly Nyssa.  And then there is Goss, and Kretschmann and Perlman and...  In fact, I could write several paragraphs of congratulatory praise for the entire cast, who were exceptional.  And then another for the music, the makeup, and the special effects.<p>If that is not enough, this two disk set contains enough 'making of...' and commentary material to make it a complete course in how to create a great horror action film.  Del Toro not only likes to talk about the hows and whys of this film, he does a very entertaining and thoughtful job of it.  Watching this was pure spooky fun and I heartily recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Since movie audiences made "Blade" a big success, it's no surprise that New Line Cinema would put writer David S. Goyer ("The Crow: City of Angels" and "Blade") hard at work on crafting the sequel.  The key to a successful movie franchise is to try to keep most of the key players throughout, meaning the same actors for the same roles, so after getting David S. Goyer back to write the sequel, New Line pursued both Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson to return to the roles of Blade and Whistler.  Once these tasks were accomplished and the script was written, and director Guillermo Del Toro ("Mimic") was tapped to helm the film, everything was set for the cameras to roll for "Blade 2".<br /><br />Picking up a year or two after the first film, "Blade 2" puts Blade (Wesley Snipes) hot on the tail of some vampires who are hiding Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) somewhere, and keeping him alive as a vampire.  After freeing his mentor, Blade is confronted by an elite group of vampires known as the Bloodpack.  The Bloodpack informs Blade that a new enemy of vampires has emerged, but this new enemy called Reapers, are not solely after vampires, they hunt humans as well.  To stop the Reapers, Blade must join forces with his most hated enemies or let humanity be destroyed.<br /><br />"Blade 2" basically takes everything that was great about the first film, and improves upon it.  With the directing of Guillermo Del Toro and the terrific writing of David S. Goyer, the saga of Blade continues forward at break-neck speed.  Outstanding special effects that blow the first film away, and show a tremendous amount of imagination, "Blade 2" is a visual extravaganza.  Rarely does a sequel top its predecessor, but "Blade 2" succeeds in being the exception to the rule.  If you enjoyed "Blade", you will most definitely love "Blade 2", and just like "Blade", the ending leaves you just wanting more.<br /><br />"Blade 2" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Do you remember the vampire movies pre 1990?  These vampires preferred to go solo.  Usually, someone was foolish enough to open a long-sealed crypt and let loose the undead, usually Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee.  The released vampire would generally spread havoc until he was staked through the heart.  He did not have to worry about competition from other vampires. Doctor Van Helsing would keep him busy until the climax.  But times have changed and so has Hollywood's vision of the undead. No longer is the vampire the well-dressed stalker who strikes at night.  Now, Hollywood has given the MTV generation a cooler and hipper set of vampires.  Director Guillermo Del Toro in BLADE 2 continues his own tradition as presenting not one but hundreds of vampires dancing in discos and acting like the spike-headed punkheads that Hollywood seems sure represent the bulk of the paying audience.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half-human martial-arts vampire who is immune to the sun and to garlic.  In the first BLADE, he rips apart legions of vampires, who promptly dub him Daywalker, since he fears not the sun.  In BLADE 2, Snipes reprises his role that permits him to engage in non-stop action from the opening to the closing credits.  When he reaches a moment that in another film another lead might pause for reflection, Snipes wastes not one moment in idle thought.  He uses his considerable physical presence to dominate each scene with breathtaking special effects that the audience has since come to expect.  And therein lies the problem with this movie and others of its ilk.  Believability and cause and effect were deliberately excluded from the script.  The world of BLADE 2 seems peopled exclusively by vampires of various sorts.  The garden variety vampires look, act, and speak like the middle class wannabe punkheads that they truly are.  If the script did not inform us they were vampires, I might never have guessed.  The only surprising variation was the introduction of a new breed of uber-vampires, who look more like the classical vampires of the past. These uber-vampires feed exclusively on the 'normal' vampires and are immune to the garlic and silver weaponry that used to work in the American International pictures.  These new vampires generally lope after their undead victims as if they were more chimpanzees than vampires.  Snipes battles both types of vampire before he agrees to focus his efforts only on this new breed.  There is absolutely no logic to his actions.  Both breeds of vampires are set up as straw men, only to be knocked down, while all the while the audience is oohing and ahhing over each more spectacular battle.  Kris Kristofferson is wasted as Whistler, Snipes' buddy, as only one of two humans in the movie.  The other human is a sleazy lawyer who allies himself to the undead in a way that critiques the often heartless profession of attorneying.  The plot bounces from one pyrotechnic display of blood and martial arts to the next with nary a thoughtful moment in between.  By the movie's end, I had long since ceased to care which breed of vampire would reign supreme over a world that seemed to lack non-vampire residents. That both Blade movies have proved to be rousing financial successes has filled me with regret that the day of the solo vampire has passed away to be replaced by non-thinking types whom surely Bela Lugosi would not have called kin.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>As if vampires weren't big enough contenders, now we have genetically enhanced suckheads.<br /><br />More action, espionage & better effects<br /><br />Blade II has ramped up the fun, or twice your blood back!<br />;)</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>Blade fights super-vampires in this one.

Grotesquely gory and full of rapid-fire violence, "Blade II" is unashamed of its animeish action sequences and tongue-in-cheek humor ("Catch you later!"). Wesley Snipes and del Toro give it a suitably monstrous charm, although David Goyer's leaden dialogue bogs down many promising scenes.<br /><br />While a monstrous hooded vampire preys on other vampires, Blade (Snipes) manages to track down his vampirized mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and cures him of his vampirism.<br /><br />Then a pair of vampire ninjas arrive, bearing a message for Blade: ancient vampire lord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants to meet with him. Turns out there's a monstrous vampiric mutation called the Reapers loose -- highly contagious, really disgusting, and preys on humans and vampires alike. Blade reluctantly agrees to work with the elite vampire assassin squad called the Bloodpack.<br /><br />Of course, tensions run high between the vampires and the little gang sworn to kill them -- especially when they arrive at the rave club House of Pain and lose some of their number. Blade takes on the Reapers' leader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), only to discover that there are some nasty secrets behind the Reapers' origins. And Damaskinos' plans are far nastier and further-reaching than anyone could have guessed.<br /><br />Those expecting a copy of the first "Blade" movie should leave the building now. Guillermo del Toro's direction gives "Blade II" a very unique flavour all its own -- it's faster, more grotesque, more fantastical, and more infused with quirky humor. The one sour note is the magical return of Whistler at the beginning, where it turns out that whoops, he wasn't QUITE dead and he's getting better. Contrived much?<br /><br />And del Toro has fun with the action -- lots of grotesque gore (those flip-out Reaper mouths), anime-style action (Blade garrotes a vampire on a motorcycle) and highly destructive gun battles. The first four-fifths of the story are just mindless shoot-'em-up-and-burn-up-to-ashes Reaper-hunts, but it mutates in the last act. Suddenly we're faced with a vampiric tale of betrayal, revenge and Grecian-style tragedy.<br /><br />The big problem with this movie? Goyer's dialogue is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hilarious ("You're human." "Barely. I'm a lawyer"), and sometimes it sounds like he put it in because it looked cool on paper ("There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer"). Much of the time, it's the latter.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes seems to be having a good time here, with lots of wild action and some wry humour ("Now you got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head"), and Leonor Varela provides a hint of possible romance as an autopsy-performing vampire princess. And the whispery-voiced Luke Goss manages to take a truly repulsive character ("so... so sweet!") and give him an air of tragedy.<br /><br />In fact, most of the acting is pretty good in this movie, although most of the actors don't get a lot to do (Donnie Yen is particularly underused), though Ron Perlman is wonderfully loathsome as a neo-Nazi vampire who gets on Blade's bad side. Norman Reedus is intensely annoying as Scud, though -- you'll spend a lot of time hoping that someone shoots him by accident.<br /><br />"Blade II" is a very different beast than its predecessor, and del Toro does a great job with some truly mediocre scripting. Worth seeing if you have a strong stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Blade 2 knocks blade 1 out of the baseball field. this blade movie has tons more of action and tougher villians for blade to fight like nomack. this is the best in all of the blade movies. and it has a awesome soundtrack. and awesome characters. this movie rocks.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The action scenes are exciting, and fast paced. The exciment never dies down for the whole movie. There's nothing new in the plot but I don't care. This is one of the most interesting films starring Wesley Snipes. It's also the best of the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>Let me make one thing clear: This movie has killer action! I will not deny that and if it weren't for other aspects of the movie it would have gotten a higher rating just for the action. Unfortunately all the bad stuff cancels out the good stuff for me.<br /><br />There are some things I just can't forgive and one is plain stupidity and lack of continuity. The people in this movie are dumb as dirt. At the beginning of Blade we have him fighting off vampires wearing these neat "day suits" that protect them from UV light. Funny thing is they conveniently forget they have these useful garments when they have to hunt during the day. Talk about stupid. Not only that, it is established that the big bad hybrid vampires that are the main focus of Blade 2 can only be killed by UV light, yet the idiots still pack a ton of firepower instead of a mess of flashlights. Man... brainless testosterone sure does flow thick in that movie. Another thing I felt was overkill was Blade's new chemical formula he laces all of his weapons and bullets with (well the bullets are packed with it... not laced) and the fact that a single drop of this stuff is apparently enough to BBQ a vampire's entire body. Just seems like they are pushing the envelope here.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat derivative and only gives Blade a reason to kill things. Granted Blade came from a Marvel comic book and the movie does attempt to stick with a comic book styled story, but come on! Give us some depth here! There was a painfully predictable love interest that doesn't do much for the movie at all. There are also a few "surprise" plot twists that are also utterly predictable and bring nothing to the table. And as much as I like Wesley Snipes and as much I like what he brings to the character, the perpetual "cool pose" theme gets old. Just once I would like to see Blade tie his shoe or even just stand still in a non-cool way. Quick Blade! While you answer the phone. Strike a pose!!<br /><br />Still in all of the story content bashing I make this movie has some of the greatest action scenes ever. The fighting is intense and the choreography is stylish without being campy. I really mean it. The action in Blade 2 is awesome. The special effects are well done for the most part and little things like the lighting, camera angles and sound are also done well. In other words the action scenes and production values are top notch... except for the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is nice but it felt forced fed. It seems every time you're in a club and someone turns away for a minute a new song is on (conveniently being a song from the Blade 2 Soundtrack). One scene in this movie seems to pack at least five songs within ten minutes.<br /><br />If you're into nothing but action, action, and ACTION then Blade 2 is just the movie for you. If you like both action and good story telling then be forewarned; you will have to weigh great action with lame plot and judge for yourself. Of course if you are all about content and care little for action you might as well save your money and wait until it comes on cable or broadcast TV. Blade 2 is a great action film and nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>The story in this film is very ornate, and its not as gratuitous as some might want you to believe.Blade and Co are summoned to help the regular Vampires fight off a "Common Enemy", which is part of a story that has many twists and turns.<br />Overall, its indeed very cool, is a notch up from the first BLADE, but has the "Del Toro" factor; that is, Del Toro seems to know he is ramping up a Franchise, but he also adds his own little twists and, in a word, perversions. Possibly the key addition to this world, is Del Toro's attempt to remove the sub-text of why Vampires do what they do, and to change the "Anne Rice" factor.<br />The DVD  extras are superbly plentiful in this  set. Two Sets of commentaries on disc one ( go for the Wesley Snipes and David  Goyer commentary first, in my view, since that is the most entertaining, and Del Toro's and Frankfurt's commentary is basically a lot of stuff that might be something you need to know as a fan, but not as a movie fan, maybe as a movie maker, and certainly shows that an excess of perversion never stopped amnyone from making good films).<br />Disc two has two main sections. There is no doubt that Del Toro is creative, however his little obsessions are a tad too much when viewed and heard in this context. The Making of Section is probably the best item to view first. And in the out-takes and deleted  scenes, the commentary is sometimes useful, but is often just plain off the yuck scale. So, its good to see the deletes and out-takes, which are, I think ( my opinion) mostly done correctly, some deletes are just on the level of "Why?", and the out-takes are fun.<br />All in all a pretty excellent Value Package. Done before Del Toro did  HELLBOY, it is very illustrative of his creative skill and indulgence in some weird obsessions.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>In any genre, sequels are a dicey business unless the director/writer intended the movie to be done in sequel format to begin with.  A good example of this is the LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />As mentioned before, the author didn't really keep this series open to that.  Although he mentioned that Blade would be out there, he seemingly had killed Whistler in the previous movie.<br /><br />As mentioned in another review, this isn't what happened.  For this sequel to work, the vampires would have had to infiltrate his lair at the end of the other film.  That makes this sequel feel false.<br /><br />Since others have spoken of the story, which wasn't too bad for a horror film, but it wasn't the most substantial, I would talk about the special effects.  There is a bit more computer-generated effects, which make some of the fighting moves seems a little cartoonish.  Further, in one fight, rather than seeing displays of the martial arts, we see a little bit of WWE professional wrestling.  Rather than give the fight a sense of power, it makes the fight a bit cheesy.<br /><br />Going into the movie, I didn't have the highest of expectations, so it wasn't too bad.  If you are looking for a great film, this is not going to be it.  This is, however, not bad for a Friday night.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Blade 2 is a awesome movie the whole series is awesome. Wesley Snipes is the only man to do the job of killing vampires. When it comes to kill the mutant creature that came from another vampire he is the man to do the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and start kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it everyday for the rest of your lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is a film I loved watching. Very well acted and designed, and the vampires rocked. Blade himself did a lot of funny and intense stuff, too. I thought the vampiress he became friends with was hot.  Oh, and the final fight with Reaper(who is my # 3 favorite Blade villain next to Deacon Frost and Dracula)was as good as they're gonna get. The only thing that could have made this movie better is  if it had the scariness and pumped vigor of the first one. Other than that, it is splendid, and I think any Blade fan should see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Your rotten reviewer will keep things short, children. In case the title fooled ya, this is the sequel to Blade - with Mr. Wesley Snipes (after watching his killer moves in this flick, I can't bring myself to even talk about him without the most earnest deference).  The "Blade" movies are set in a fun-house mirror version of our own world, in which a race of supercharged vampires (appearing little different than the everyday corporate variety) use their superior powers and wealth to rise to the top of the food chain.  Reprising his role as a daywalker, a sort of a mutant hybrid of human and vampire, Snipes wars against the Vampires (whom he calls suckerheads). As we learnt in the first "Blade" flick, Blade has all the powers that come with being one of the undead (including a killer fashion sense and an attitude to match; also he's really quick with a samurai sword and can absorb punishment that would kill lesser comic-book heroes). For reasons that have beguiled the vampires, he has none of their weaknesses. Blade uses killer moves, a samurai sword that seems to have a mind of its own, various gadgets and his attitude. Having dispatched a would-be Vampire king in the first movie, Blade is offered a chance to join the suckerheads when a mutant race of vampires called Reapers sets its appetites on everybody. With sideways-opening mouths, super-speed and a heart almost completely encased in solid bone (my stake won't work! Would you believe that this has never happened to me before?), the Reapers stalk vampires much as vampires hunted humans. Against the advice of his friends (including Kris Kristofferson as a crusty mortal who's endured so much suffering, he might as well be one of the dead) Blade joins the suckerheads in annihilating the Reapers. Dangers aside, Blade reasons that the pact will allow him to get closer to the vampires than he's ever been able to before, and anyway, should the reapers nosh the vampires to extinction, they'll add the human race to their menu.<br /><br />So, why doesn't this movie completely rock? For one thing, it's so dark that it's hard to tell what's going on during the fast battle-scenes. Also, sexed-up for battle, our hero and his not-so-loyal band of undead foot-soldiers are encased in body-armor, armed to the teeth and shielded with their glasses - it's like watching a movie about action figures. The characters walk and talk like soulless AI characters in some hopped-up videogame. (Unfortunately, I caught this flick about the same time "Demolition Man" was on, and it was enlightening to see how much more spirited Mr. Snipes was Simon Phoenix in that flick.) Our badguys die in predictable and uninspiring CGI pyrotechnics, and speak either n a pastiche of four-letter words and pseudo-hard boiled tough speak ("yeah? Take off your sunglasses and say that, punk!"), or some of the overly dead-serious and clinically precise babble you'd find in either overpriced comics or on episodes of "Star Trek: The Next Generation".  "Blade II" is supposed to be about tough guys, but it's not very tough at all. If ever a movie needed the "Simon Phoenix" treatment, this is it.</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>nomak is a cool bad guy. the setting (prague) is cool. great ending. cool sound track. only 4 because of some cheap dialoge (which all action movies have) and no car chases.  good extras include making of vidios which come out to about 1 hour, half hour of deleted scenes that were rightfully deleted, comentary, stupid music video, and other stuff.</p></br></body></html>

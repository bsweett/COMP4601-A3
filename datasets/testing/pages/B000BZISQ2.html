The first two films were directed by James Cameron, but a new director has taken the reins for this one.  The director is Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown).  I was a little nervous going into this movie because of this change in the director.  James Cameron had made two classic, genre defining films that pushed the special effects teams to the limits (especially on Terminator 2).  Mostow had a lot to live up to and I wasn't confident that he could do the job.  I was wrong.  Mostow did not make a Terminator movie the way that James Cameron would have done, but he made a worthy entry into the Terminator franchise.  <p>One thing to note about this movie is that it is not nearly as gritty (emotionally or in the content of the movie) as the first two Terminator movies (especially not as much as the first one).  While this uses the elements and story of the Terminator franchise, this is not a hard science fiction film but more of an action film.  It also works very well on this level.  Here is the back story that we know going into this movie: In the near future all of our lives will be run through computers.  Our military will use one great supercomputer to manage the military functions.  This computer will become self-aware and take control of the world through computers (which run everything).  There will be a war between man and machine and the machines will win.  Humans will be almost wiped from the face of the planet until there are only small pockets of resistance left.  One man will rise to lead the humans: John Connor.  In the first Terminator movie, the machines sent a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother.  John sent back a man who would become his father to protect Sarah Connor.  In the second Terminator movie, the machines sends back an advanced model to kill a 13 year old John Connor.  The model that was sent back to kill Sarah in the first movie was sent back in time to protect John in the second movie.  This brings us to the third Terminator movie.  John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's.  His mother has died of Leukemia and John is living on the fringes of society.  He lives in such a way that there is no record of his existence (he works on the theory that if he can't be found, he can't be killed).  He lives a gloomy existence because even though the judgement day in 1997 has come and past without incident, he doesn't really feel that it is over.  A new Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) has been sent back to kill both John Connor, but failing that to kill the men and women who will become his lieutenants in the resistance against the machines.  <p>The T-X appears to be an updated version of the T-1000 that Robert Patrick played in Terminator 2.  The T-X is also made of the liquid metal that the T-1000 was, but there are added abilities.  One: the T-X has functional weapons built into it.  The T-X can turn its arm into a gun/flamethrower and various other weapons.  The other major upgrade is that the T-X can remotely control other machines.  This provides for a rather impressive chase sequence involving a van, cop cars, fire engines and one bulky vehicle with a crane.  The T-X was also designed to destroy other Terminators.  To protect John Connor, the Arnold model from the first two movies is sent back to protect John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who would become John's second in command.  The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) is an outdated model but was the only one the resistance was able to capture and reprogram.<br />This is the set up for the movie.  Kate is the disbelieving woman that Sarah Connor was in the first movie, but there is great chemistry between John and Kate and this helps the movie a lot.  <p>One thing that The Terminator tells John is that the Judgement Day has not been stopped, only delayed and that it is still coming...very soon.  As you can tell from the subtitle of the movie: Rise of the Machines, the machine uprising begins during this movie.  I mentioned that this movie didn't have the grit of the previous movies, and this is true, but it is not a very upbeat film and with the Machines beginning the war we are not given a very happy movie.  We are given a good one, though.  Terminator 3 is not perfect, but it far exceeded my expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>never fail another great terminator movie was made. but sad to say that it was arnold's last terminator movie. i love this movie and the girl who plays the female terminator rocks. if you have not seen this movie then you should</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>John Connor now exists only as a drifter living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful and advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father a U.S. Air Force General is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers and leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result and the war against the machines will begin. T3 is a solid movie for a third installment. This movie is good enough to watch more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This was the worst movie, in the Terminator saga, not only is there a different John Connor, (Edward Furlong did not return), there is also no Sarah Connor, in this story, and no James Cameron directing either. The new characters in the film weren't very interesting either, and the performances, were pretty forgettable as well. The Television series, that came out, shortly after this film, was actually, more interesting, and a better cast as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>The Terminator idea is something of great intrigue to me and although it may seem extremely farfetched and even a bit bizarre that I would believe such a thing, I do actually think a machine uprising is a possibility. We as a race strive to create more advanced machines every day; machines that are capable of independent thought and maintenance are just around the corner. There is no denying that if we continue to create more and more intelligent machines and rely more on the interweaving network systems we currently have in place, there will come a point, in my eyes, not too far in the future that machines will realise humans are obsolete and realise that no longer need us around. I know it's weird, but it's the way I think. I also think Scientology isn't as bizarre as the media would have us believe. Let's make one thing clear, I'm not a Scientologist or a recluse nerd, I just think in weird ways.<br /><br />The original Terminator movie kicked off a truly brilliant series that lead to the triumphant sequel, subtitled Judgment Day. Nobody thought it could ever be topped and in many ways, with T3, they were right. It received quite critical reviews upon its original release and even had some people hating the very idea of making it a trilogy. Considering the age of Schwarzenegger, it was originally rumoured that he may not be able to be cast in this movie, and because of that rumour, the films production was condemned immediately. Luckily Arnie was able to participate in the movie, and actually got himself into shape and looking the way he did 10 years ago.<br /><br />T3 is set roughly 10 years after the events of Judgment Day and now another enemy of the future is sent back to assassinate the leader of the future resistance against the machines, John Connor. Not only is it John now in the firing line, but it's also the other members of the resistance, including Johns future wife, Katherine Brewster. The new enemy is the most advanced Terminator yet. Known as the T-X or Terminatrix, this female Terminator, played by Kristanna Loken is the most brutal machine to date. She can create any weapon from her arms and just appears more heartless than any machine could possibly be. John is once again protected by a new T-101 (Arnie) and is told that the Judgment Day he thought he stopped was merely postponed and is actually inevitable. Now with the help of the new T-101, Katherine & John must keep away from the T-X and try to find her father who is heading Skynet to try and find a new way of trying the prevent the Rise of the Machines.<br /><br />There is quite a bit that can be said negatively about this film, but there's also a bit of good to talk about as well. One of the biggest criticisms I have is the casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor. I don't mind Nick Stahl as an actor, but as the rebellious John Connor, he's simply not the right man for the job. I personally think Edward Furlong would have done a much better job had he reprised the role. I also felt that the absence of the Sarah Connor character was another big downfall for the third film as she's certainly a benchmark character for these movies, much like Arnold. Clare Danes as Katherine Brewster was just bland, I never found myself believing in the character and felt the film could survive without that character. I felt that she was simply a device to explain the plot of the Terminator history (or future, whichever way you see it) for the new viewers who may not have seen the original films. Kristanna Loken was triumphant as the T-X and for a female Terminator, I now can't think of anyone better for the role.<br /><br />A few things within the film didn't make sense to me, but I can't talk about them because it will ruin it for those who haven't seen it. One thing that bugged me about it, however, was the whole idea that Judgment Day was inevitable. If that is so, then what was the purpose of blowing up Cyberdyne Systems in T2 to prevent Judgment Day when it's actually just a way of postponing it? The CGI within, is really well done and the chase scene in which the T-X is driving a giant crane which destroys almost an entire town, is possibly the best action sequence in many years of film. The effects involving the Terminators is also very well done, apart from the hand to hand fight scene which had great potential, but just ended up looking like a big budget slapstick comedy sketch.<br /><br />The comedy moments are also a big downfall and dragged the mood of the film down to a ridiculous level. Thankfully, the doomsday mood was brought back through the immense action scenes and it managed to keep me entertained for the entire runtime. Flaws aside, it's a good addition to the series and although many loyal fans of the first two films may trash it, I enjoyed it and believe that those who have yet to see it should at least give it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>This week's Sid the Elf feature is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This film was just another step along our path to review every movie Arnold ever made. Well, except for the awful Conan movies. This one followed the ridiculously successful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)</a>. By conventional wisdom, this film failed miserably when compared to its predessor. But, by B standards it might have been just a touch better even though it lacked the same awesomeness that caused us to give T2 5 stars.<br /><br />The B-ness of this flick was almost overwhelming. There's Arnold and his snare drum tight face. There's the fact that they needed to replace the extremely popular(in T2) Edward Furlong for Nick Stahl due to a substance abuse problem. Oh yeah! Also, they supposedly recycled a bunch of ideas that didn't make the cut for T2 such as the female Terminator. Arnold is still protecting John Connor against Skynet and their female Terminator. Arnold also has to protect Claire Daines(John's future wife), a tough job for anyone to get motivated for. Sophia Bush was originally slated for this role. That would have added a star at least. O well. The big wrinkle in this one is that we find out that the T-X is back in good old 2004 from the future to not only kill John Connor, but his lieutenants too. Why? Because she kills John Connor in 2032. But we've already seen that history can be rewritten once because Judgment Day didn't occur in 1997 as predicted in Da Terminator. The question is: Can history be rewritten again?<br /><br />Sadly, this movie fell short. Maybe it was the lack of Arnold lines none of which we would find on a soundboard. Also, the appeal of the indestructability of the T-X was a bit old as we saw that already in T2. Aside from a few cool plot points this one just felt rehashed from the previous films. Sid says its a stay-away. We would NOT have enjoyed this one back in the glory days.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>That AI man versus machine War is 'inevitable'?<br />What now seems more likely a a collapse<br />of the oil based infrastructure.<br />What made II special was the acting of Linda Hamilton.<br />In this movie we haven't that child, robot<br />and mother dialog that worked so well.<br />The female android should have been given more<br />'character' and nonviolent interaction: she should have been<br />more clever and scheming maybe.<br />This is just a long kind of boring chase movie<br />with a lot of destruction and very little real plot line?</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Another reviewer felt that the premises of T1 and T2 had been betrayed, because T3 posits that we cannot change our futures.  I agree that it does create a contradiction (if the future is predetermined, how come Judgment Day was delayed by six years?) that would need Larry Fishbourne-style philosophical psychobabble to explain.<br /><br />That said, the film does get many things right.  The directing is top-notch, and casting is great.  I never liked Edward Furlong too much in T2, and it was a relief to see that the new guy was up to the job.  The love interest was good, with the appropriate mix of humanity and steel.  The T-X was outstanding, both the actress and the concept, although she broke little new ground.  The ending was not your usual saccharine Hollywood finish, which was also appreciated.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>More action means more excitement.  That's exactly what made the Terminator movies so great.  That's exactly what makes this movie so great, despite the predictable overwhelming amount of negative reviews.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with Rise of the Machines unless you happen to be really picky.  Are you picky?  ARE you?</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I never like seaqulls that dont bring back the same cast. This movie prooved it. Only Shwartzenegger and whoever the shrink docotor is have returned for the film from the previous 2 great action blockbusters. And it certinly IMO suffred with out the original creator James Camron.<p>The plot takes place 10 years or so since the last blockbuster movie T2; Judgment day. John Conner is a loner, his mother has passed away and he is his familly Toto! I strongly beleive the intrest to this film is the fact that there is a female terminator, and theres guys enjoying seeing her in tight clothing. That kind of image never works for me so the movie failed in its attempt to sell scenes in a uncalled for way! I'd like to see alot more woman become action stars, there sure isnt enough of them, but this new terminator is hardly threatning at all, and unlike in T2 with the t-1000..this soupposed new upgraded terminator looks more downgraded!<p>A new Terminator has been sent back to not just kill John Conner but also another leader of the resistance and a bunch of other people too! And of coarse Arnold is sent back once more as a terminator to protect them.<p>The movie suffered in alot of plot ideas IMO, I dont care that Arnold returned...with few SFX shots gave some great action seaqunces, the SFX where no where near as impressive as the ground breaking SFX that T2 provided us with! This plot also rueins the whole genre of the Terminator. Particuly the most i did not like was the ending to this film. The ending IMO has been rueind, and has created a non beleivable ending, unlike the last 2 movies. If they make a 4th movie, they should consider highly about going back in time to prevent the events that happend in this film, other wise this movie has rueind the terminator story lines IMO.<p>Rent it first, many people judge this movie on Arnie and a female in tight cloths to sell a sexy image rather then concentrate on important and significant things to make the movie beleiable. The begining is kind of cool, then it drifts, then its going no where, then it picks up, then the end ruens the entire saga! Only a 4th movie can fix the bad idea on how to finish this film IMO!<p>Bonus features are forgetable, and its no wonder they cut a few of the deleted scenes, if they had have been included the movie would have done harm to the terminator saga even further!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>He promised he'd be back, and he is in "Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines," the third and probably final installment in the franchise that made Austrian weightlifter turned actor turned politician Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name. Why do I think this film is the last in the series? Because, primarily due to Arnie's abrupt reversal in his views about onscreen violence. "Terminator 3" isn't a great film. Before he had kids and decided to run for public office, Schwarzenegger had few problems blowing away hundreds of people in films like "The Terminator," "Commando," "The Running Man," "Predator," and several other 1980's actioners. What a difference a few years make. I knew Arnold had taken a turn for the worse when I witnessed the horrific "Junior," but the disintegration had begun years before. Schwarzenegger's dogged pledge to minimal onscreen killing essentially doomed any "Terminator" sequels. Granted, number two worked well because it employed Linda Hamilton, had James Cameron at the helm, and worked wonders with special effects. Sadly, "Terminator 3" does not have Linda Hamilton, does not have James Cameron at the helm, and the special effects aren't as good as what we saw in the second film. What a pity.<p>John Connor (Nick Stahl in this outing) survived the events in the second film and is now a young adult with serious issues. Always fearful of any unexpected robotic deliveries from the future, he's dropped out of society in a big way. Connor doesn't have a phone number, avoids credit cards and other traceable technologies, and floats from menial job to menial job. His mother Sarah died of leukemia several years ago in Mexico, thus leaving her son to fend for himself in a world that he fears. John can never shake the feeling that he and his mother failed to prevent Judgment Day, and he is about to discover feelings have a way of becoming real. Sure enough, a termination unit appears on the scene. This time out, it's the new and improved T-X machine (played by sexy Kristanna Loken), a robot wrapped up in the guise of a female capable of controlling other machines and sprouting weapons from its body. Fortunately for John Connor, the humans in the future managed to send back another Arnie terminator to serve as a personal bodyguard. From here on out the movie is your typical chase and destroy vehicle, as Arnie and the T-X battle their way through various settings.<p>The plot makes a few digressions with the introduction of Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), an old childhood sweetheart of John Connor who just happens to meet up with her old flame when John robs the veterinary clinic where she works. Moreover, Brewster's Dad just happens to be the military guy in charge of Skynet and a new generation of robotic weaponry instantly familiar to fans of the first two films. See how it all comes together? Arnie ends up protecting Brewster and Connor from the deadly attentions of the T-X. When queried by Connor and Brewster about Judgment Day, Arnold explains that nuclear annihilation is inevitable, and that Sarah and her son only postponed the inevitable when they destroyed the T-1000 in the second film. Since the world is about to go into the wastebasket, it is Arnold's mission to get Brewster and Connor to a safe location before the bombs fall. Predictably, our heroes aren't about to accept the fate of the world lying down. They convince Arnie to escort them to the military base where Kate's father is about to put Skynet online. If they can get there in time, they might succeed in averting disaster. Meanwhile, the T-X stalks them with relentless, ruthless precision. The conclusion to the film displays lots of explosions, nicely done special effects (again, not as good as the second film), and a few mild twists and turns.<p>"Terminator 3" could have been a great film. I fervently hoped it would attain greatness. Alas, the movie achieves only a rating of merely good. Of course, the biggest problem is Arnie's inability to mow down people. Let's face it--we all loved Schwarzenegger's early films where he wreaked massive destruction on scores of heavily armed thugs. You won't get any of that here. What further hurts the film is the absence of Linda Hamilton. She always gave the series a solid foundation, and the film suffers without her. They could have at least given us a cameo from Michael Biehn or Robert Patrick to serve as a touchstone to the earlier movies. Nope. The only person we see from an earlier film is the guy who played the psychologist, and even then his appearance doesn't work as well as it could. Plenty of other problems abound, including plot holes like Arnold just showing up at the veterinary clinic out of the blue, (In the other two movies, Cameron showed us HOW the terminator tracked down John and Sarah Connor. Here, he just shows up.) and the over reliance on comedic elements throughout the film. What works? That chase scene with the crane was cool, and the fistfight between the T-X and Arnie is worth watching more than once.<p>Give "Terminator 3" a chance if you liked the first two. I've sort of knocked on the movie in this review, but I probably would watch it again if I had the chance. It's sad, though. The filmmakers could have made an ultra dark, nihilistic science fiction film instead of this comedic parody of what made the franchise such a winner from the start. I blame Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film's failures; it's obvious that in order to get him to do another film, the filmmakers had to give Arnie free rein to do what he wanted instead of giving the fans what they craved. Let's hope future installments--highly unlikely, regrettably--will return to the roots of the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Can a machine really be that funny?<p>The new concept of a woman cyborg was very interesting.  This is the end of the beginning, I hope they can take it to a new level and develop what happens next....<p>This movie is worth seeing.

However, as John remains in hiding he gets into an accident that leads to an encounter between John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  The two of them are attacked by a new and improved version of the original T-800 robot called T-X  that is on a mission to exterminate all future leaders of the resistance.  However, another Terminator robot (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect both John and Kate against this new T-X.  This is the beginning for an action packed roller coaster that will bring the audience through highs and lows at a fast pace that will not slow down until the end.  This does not leave much time for contemplative work, but it does keeps the audience engaged from the beginning to the end.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines leaves the audience with a satisfactory cinematic experience where the audience is left with a supreme cliffhanger: a cliffhanger made to make another box-office hit that can bring in more revenue.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Terminator 3 does an average job of attempting to explain itself. There is both a prologue and epilogue that attempts to explain and link this movie with the other Terminators. We get to learn of how the world came to be in the future, and how, after visited by another T-101, John Connor is now the new leader to try to save the world from the rise of the machines. He meets up with Kate Brewster (Clair Danes) through a series of events and she also learns her role in the future of mankind. <p>I didn't really go into this movie believing it would be much, but was pleasantly surprised with some of the acting, action sequences and plot. However, as usual in action movies, some of the chase scenes were dragged out incredibly long. I think if this movie would have focused more on building a solid story line through building the characters it would have made for a more effective story. <p>One thing that definitely was a negative was the character of John Connor. He comes across as a whiny, Generation X slacker type that no one watching feels sorry for. He seems to spend his time feeling sorry for himself and complaining about having to lead mankind. He tends to become an irksome point of the movie, and hardly fits the description of &quot;hero.&quot; If they would have made him a stronger character I think it would have vastly improved the script.<p>Still, Terminator 3 is a fun movie. Sequels are definitely one of the hardest types to make successful, and I believe that Terminator 3 succeeds, albeit in a &quot;ho-hum&quot; way. <p>Recommended if you take it in with a relatively open mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>After a 12 year absence, a Terminator movie is around. One more time Arnold Schwarzenegger repeats his signature role, and despite this time the director of the first two movies James Cameron, the actress Linda Hamilton and the actor Edward Furlong didn't came back for T3, there's new blood on the series.<br /><br /> In &quot;Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines&quot;, there is a new Terminator model, the T-X (Terminatrix), played by the gorgeous Kristanna Loken, who does a good job as a cold and precise cybernetic killer. Also there is a new John Connor, actor Nick Stahl. On this movie John Connor loses a lot of the personality that Edward Furlong printed to the character in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;. However, the pretty Claire Danes fills the hole left by the &quot;new&quot; John Connor, Claire plays Kate, a brave woman that refuses to let the humanity to be destroyed.<br /><br /> The visual effects and the audio effects are incredible. The highlight is a vehicle chase scene, which is jaw-dropping. Despite T3 doesn't have the same depth of the first two movies, is a very enjoyable film and a worthy sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Since I haven't seen the previous two &quot;Terminator&quot; films, watching TERMINATOR 3 was like coming into a movie already half over. I'm sure I've missed something. However, ignorance hasn't stopped me before from being rashly opinionated.<p>The gist of the ongoing series is that machines and humans will be at war with each other in the near future, at which time beleaguered Mankind is to be led by John Connor and his wife, the former Kate Brewster. In the &quot;now&quot; of this film, machines are about to launch a nuclear first strike against humanity using America's computerized and newly automated national defense system. The good news is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator robot sent back in time to ensure that Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) survive the coming Armageddon to fight on. The bad news is that a more advanced Terminator robot, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), is sent back by the other side to eliminate the same Connor and Brewster. All the action revolves around the collision between the two hard-nosed androids.<p>At the risk of throwing a wet blanket of logic on the storyline, wouldn't a Nuclear Winter visited upon the planet by vengeful machines also destroy the very technology and industrial infrastructure capable of creating the advanced robots supposed to carry the battle into the future? Never mind; this is a Tinseltown fairy tale.<p>The two best reasons to see TERMINATOR 3 are Arnie, of course, who delivers some straight-faced gag lines that'll leave you chortling, and one of the best vehicle chases I've seen recently. The latter ostensibly takes place in Los Angeles, and, if not accomplished with models and computer generated FX, left me surprised that the city is still standing. Otherwise, the special FX technology used to depict the warring robots is pretty much old hat to those of us getting jaded.<p>The Connor and Brewster characters left me completely cold. As a matter of fact, they were both so annoying that I hoped in the depths of my perverse heart that the T-X would manage to slaughter them both. I mean, do we really need them for a TERMINATOR 4? <p>Loken's T-X might just as well have been a high-tech wind-up doll, though she was impressively poker-faced and relentless in pursuit of her programmed objective. The scene where &quot;she&quot; gets stuck to a giant magnet was inspired. And the one-on-one fight scenes with Arnie were so violent that I thought they'd make the perfect 21st century version of the Bickersons.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Don't doubt it for a minute:  "Terminator 3" lives up to its pedigree.  Whether or not it's as good or better than its predecessors, "Rise of the Machines" stands perfectly well on its own merits.  Schwarzenegger is his unimitable self, reprising the heroic role he assumed for T2 with an obvious gusto that shines undimmed through his killer cyborg's facade.  Nick Stahl is convincing as the enigmatic John Connor, and Claire Danes is appealing as his unexpected soul mate (aren't they always?).  And of course there's Kristanna Loken, the ice-cold Terminatrix who gives Schwarzenegger all he can handle, and then some.  The stunts are spectacular, the action literally non-stop, and the tone eerie and somber despite all the truly glorious comic relief.  No, this is not a James Cameron film, but that's not all bad. It *IS* a Schwarzenegger film, and a damn good one. But behind all its action and adrenaline, "Terminator 3" does have a brain, and is arguably more thoughtful than either of the previous chapters. Is Judgment Day inevitable?  Is there no fate but what we make, or is Destiny immutable?  Only time--and the next Terminator--will tell.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is not as good as the previous two, certainly not as good as Terminator 2, but is worth seeing for Terminator fans. Early on, there is a lot of spillover from the previous film and from "The Matrix". It looks like it will be another boring sequel, but turns out to be okay. I would have given two stars for the far-fetched explosions and probably one star for the incorrect display of fuel cells (they do not become nuclear weapons). The rest is good for factual filler (e.g., how SkyNet develops). Unfortunately, the final sequence leaves no doubt that there will be a Terminator 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>Though many critics have commented that this new Terminator is basically a retelling of the second film, I would like to begin by saying that I was pleasantly surprised by this third installment of this very successful franchise. Though the film lacked the direction of James Cameron, who was largely responsible for the birth of the Terminator series, it was nonetheless a worthy successor to his earlier works. <p>The movie is sharp, with a very definitive, high-tech look and feel about it. Unlike its predecessors, T3 does not have a lot of character development in it, save for a somewhat disarrayed and poorly developed relationship between John Connor (played by Nich Stahl) and Kate Brewster (played by Claire Daines).  The duo, thrown together in a moment of peril, at once loathe one another, only later to discover that they have feelings towards each other.  According to the Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Brewster will eventually become Connor's wife, (presumably this will be seen in Terminator 4). The development of these characters are probably the one notable weakness in this film. <p>What makes this movie work are the intense action sequences, as well as the comedic timing of many of Schwarzenegger's lines and situations. In the opening sequence, the Terminator appears just outside a strip club hosting an all-male exotic dancer review.  Schwarzenegger's character walks in naked, upon which women begin throwing themselve at him.  Upon approaching a male stripper, whose physique is a match to his own, he commands that the stripper gives him his clothes, to which the stripper raises an outstretched palm and stammers "talk to the hand."  It is probably one of the funniest moments of the film, and works well to give a moment of liteness to the overall darkness and theme of the story.<p>This movie is definitely a big-budget science fiction/action film with many high budget effects. The new Terminator (played dominently by Kristianna Loken)looks slick and sensual, clad in tight, red leather, combining the sexual appeal of a woman with the lethal force of a killing machine with a single purpose, to hunt down the future leader of a resistance that will rise against the machines and ultimately defeat them.  Loken is completely convincing as the T-X, a prototype Terminator with the ability to change shape and create complex weapons.<p>The opening and closing sequences are probably the most haunting.  Judgement day has arrived, and the movie closes with the first wave of the attack that will end society as it is presently known.  The imagery is haunting, and leaves the viewer with a reminder of the potential threat we all face in the onset of new and better technologies.  Not that this was the intent of the filmmaker, but to their credit, it works well in this film. <p>For anyone who is a fan of this series, T3: Rise of the Machines is a great film.  For those that haven't seen the earlier two, there is enough exposition in this film to allow even an uninitiated Terminator fan to follow the course of events that unfold in this story.  I hesitate to give this movie 5 stars, only because there are some minor weaknesses which, in some ways, makes this a slightly inferior movie to the earlier Terminator films.  However, it is a great film and a worthy successor to Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.  <p>The DVD edition of this film contains many extras, from storyboards to the development of some of the films incredible special effects.  It also features many interactive extras which are quite enjoyable.  <p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>My initial impression upon hearing that there would be a third Terminator movie was that it would be excellent, thinking that the majority, if not all of those involved the making of the first two films would be involved in making this third one.  Upon hearing that James Cameron and many others from the first two films would not be involved, some of those expectations were dashed.<p>When I saw this third film in the theaters there "was" an obvious letdown when considering that in "some" ways, the mythos that was established in the first two films seemed to have been forgotten.  Upon watching this film a second time, now on DVD, I've changed my opinion somewhat.  Taken as a whole, this film does extend upon the mythos of the futuristic battle between man and machine and gives an even greater impression of the "history" of events in the Terminator genre.  Where the film takes some hits is it's few too many attempts at brevity, which are interesting the first time but they're so clich&eacute;d as to actually distract from the overall enjoyment of the film.<p>Despite some of those misgivings about those "too many" trips to the humor well, I would still suggest to those that either saw the film in the theaters or have overlooked this film completely that they give this film an open minded viewing because in many ways it does develop the overall story of the Terminator!<p>What can one say about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his past and present performances as the Terminator; he brings the character back fairly well in this third film.  It is very interesting to see the T-101 model Terminator with a psychological profile but, as stated above, that is interesting but it also plays too heavily in the trips to the humor well.  <p>While Nick Stahl may be a good actor and may have done well in the other films he's been in, I thought his characterization for John Connor was more or less weak, they should've brought Edward Furlong in to reprise the character.  Claire Danes does a good job in her first action role.  The extraordinarily gorgeous newcomer, Kristanna Loken does an exceptional job as the Terminatrix, future performances by her should be looked forward to with great anticipation.<p>Jonathan Mostow does an acceptable job as the director of this film, given the script that he had to work with but one cannot help but wonder how different and that much better this film might've been had James Cameron taken the job.  The overall score for the film does an acceptable job in carrying the film along!<p>The Premise:<p>As we soon learn, Skynet, just prior to it's defeat sent back not two but three Terminators, The T-101 of the first film; the T-1000 of the second film and now the T-X Terminatrix of this third film.  The T-X Terminatrix is sent to terminate John Connor's lieutenants but to her great luck she not only finds one of the lieutenants in Kate Brewster but she also finds evidence that John Connor himself is nearby and becomes locked on him.  In comes Arnold Schwarzenegger as the latest T-101 sent to protect John Connor and his lieutenants and he is now not only a Terminator but also he's also a Terminator with a psychological profile, ready to dispense his "wisdom" at any time.<p>What follows from there is a very good Terminator movie that is entertaining but doesn't measure up to its predecessors.  I would still recommend it to fans of the series as it does do an acceptable job of advancing the Terminator story as a whole!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Feature film with 2 commentary tracks with the stars and the director<br />-Movie and Video Game Trailers<br />-Introduction by Arnold Schwarzenegger<br />-Go on-set with the HBO Fist Look Making of Documentary<br />-SGT Candy Scene - This is absolutely hilarious and should've made it into the film!<br />-"Terminal Flaws" Gag Reel<br />-T3 Visual Effects Lab:<br />*Build Your Own Eye-Popping Action Sequences<br />*Skynet Database of Weapons<br />*Personnel Dossiers<br />-Terminator Timeline<p>-Storyboards<br />-Dressed to Kill<br />-Toys in Action<br />-The Making of the Video Game</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Given that James Cameron wasn't involved in the making of this film and that "The Terminator" is his baby, his creation, one would've expected his involvement.  Take that and the fact that "T2 Judgment Day" seemed to put an end to Skynet and the horrible future created for this outstanding series and one might've expected the plot to be thin but that simply isn't the case.  This film does an outstanding job of extending the "Terminator" mythos and series as a whole!<p>The premise:<p>As we all learned in "T2 Judgment Day," seemingly all possibilities for Skynet to come into existence and launch its war against humanity are supposedly eliminated by that films Terminator, and Sarah and John Connor.  That isn't the case though as it seems that Skynet is an inescapable factor, leading to its taking control of every computer on the planet and waging its war against humanity.  Hence, we have the "purpose" for this film and the purpose for the Terminatrix to be sent back in order to once again chase down John Connor who is now in his early twenties.  Now we also have the purpose for Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator to make his trip through time to protect John Connor and others...  What follows is a well done film that is extreme in the action sequences and a fairly well laid out plot.  The Terminatrix is definitely a thrilling villain against Arnold's Terminator.<p>I'd say that my first impression of the film after this first viewing is that yes, it's a good film to go to the theater to watch and yes, even though one might think they couldn't extend the story after T2, it does.  In the final analysis though, when one compares the depth of the stories told in the first two films, one can definitely see that the series creator, James Cameron, either wasn't involved at all or at the least he wasn't involved much!  Which is pretty much why I can only give this film four stars!<p>Would I recommend that you go see this film, yes it is worth it!  Would I buy the DVD when it's released, yes!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Hey kido's this is a theatrical release, the only special features that you get to enjoy on this film at this point is the kid fidgeting and yammering away in the seat next to you, the infant wailing away several seats down from but so loud they seem to be right next to you and oh yeah, the couple three seats down from you that seem to think that the cell phone their yakking on is more important than the movie they paid to see.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Few directors are qualified to take up the reins of Cameron's classic Terminator film mythology.  T3 director Mostow does a very impressive and capable job, however, and keeps the story plugging along at a fairly tight clip.  With a running time of just under 105 minutes, the movie is trimmed of any fat or scenes of forced sentimentality (like the ones that slowed down T2 a bit).  <p>The chase scene in the first act, in which the TX chases our heroes in a 160-ton crane truck, is such a masterful blend of live-action and CGI that it defies criticism on any level.  The directory commentary on the DVD reveals that the sequence was originally intended to be shot at night, but the filming schedule necessitated a Summertime shoot, and the nights were just too short for the number of shooting days that would have been needed.  <p>Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl for this movie.  Thank goodness!  Stahl is a MUCH, MUCH better actor - Furlong just grew tiresome by the end of T2.<p>Best part about this film:  the story thread continues to its only logical conclusion, if not the necessarily upbeat one.  I for one would have felt cheated if the film had ended any other way.  T3's storyline stays true to the apocalyptic vision set up by the first two films.  AND, it leaves open the opportunity for a 4th film.  Yes, the story could support another installment.  Whether Arnold, Cameron, Mostow, Gale Anne Hurd, or other franchise principals would get on board for #4 remains to be seen.  But I'd love to know where the story goes from here.<p>As for the DVD:  the majority of the Disc 2 extras look as if they were culled from an Electronic Press Kit.  Where is Van Ling (mastermind behind the special edition DVD extras in &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;T2&quot;) when we need him?<p>The &quot;create your own effects sequence&quot; extra is majorly lame.  Majorly. <p>In short, you should buy this DVD to enjoy the movie but not get too excited about the anemic extras.  And there were DEFINITELY not enough extras to merit the second disc.  Fortunately the inclusion of a second disc didn't seem to affect the movie's retail price.<p>I enjoyed this film in the theatres last summer, but I enjoyed it even more on DVD when I viewed it with a less-critical pair of eyes.  12 years was a long time to wait for another &quot;Terminator&quot; film, so starting with my second viewing of this film I could evaluate it more on its own terms and not in comparison to &quot;T2&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>...........but this movie destroys T2 in every way possible.<br /><br /> &quot;Hey, the world needs another Terminator movie.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yeah, but how do we do it? In the last one, they changed the future. No terminators to come back in time....but for some reason John Conner has not vanished from existence yet, seeing as how he should never have been born.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yeah, that movie made absolutely no sense. Let's do this like it should have been done with T2. Lets work with the ideas that Cameron crafted in the original Terminator before he stopped caring about his creations.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yeah, forget changing the future....this one will end like it should.......with the machines destroying everything.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Brilliant!&quot;<br /><br /> I have a feeling that's exactly how that conversation went. From the very beginning of Terminator 3, we are treated to something that T2 lacked tremendously: a concept of fate. We see that John Conner was meant to meet Kate Brewster back when he was 13, but the terminators interfered. In the present, seemingly unrelated events (like a deer crossing the road), propel them back together again. This is the fate that James Cameron worked so hard to create....but then tried to destroy it in exchange for a 'happy Hollywood ending'.<br /><br /> No, the future cannot be changed...only delayed. Destiny will eventually have its way in this movieworld.....the only thing the characters can do is ride it out. But cheer up, John....at least you know you'll win in the end.......but then you'll get killed by a terminator. Oh, well...sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>The latest installment in the "Terminator" franchise is neither the tense thriller that the original was or the special effects tour-de-force blockbuster that the sequel was. Not only is Arnold Schwarzenegger the only returning cast member but the series creator, Cameron, is in no way involved either. On its own merits, T-3 is a loud and exciting popcorn movie but as an entry in one of the best sci-film series today, it is a borderline disaster.<p>Twelves year after T-2, John Connor is a loner walking the Earth (ala Kane in "Kung-Fu"), refusing to deal with the past and not wanting to except his role in the future. Enter T-X (Kristen Lokken), a lady terminator that is even more advanced than the previous T-1000 model. Her mission is to eliminate Connor and his future liutenants before they can rise up and lead the resistance to victory. As is always the case, the resistance has sent a Terminator of their own back in time to protect him. Sadly, the appeal of Schwarzennegger as the Terminator is somewhat lost in this newer film. He is no longer the comical yet indestructible father-figure trying to understand human emotions. Now, he's just some one-dimensional cyborg throwing around and blowing things up like nobody's business. <p>Once you look past the excitement and drama in this third entry, you notice how little it has to offer, story-wise. None of the characters seem to have any depth to them. Where in the last film, The Terminator grew through learning from its human counterparts, this time, it is already so many steps ahead of them. Nick Stahl's John Connor gets a few somber moments here and there but the movie never stops to really address the tragedy of the forthcoming nuclear war and why it needs to be stopped. Connor's romantic relationship with Brewster (Danes) is summed up as being "fate" via the fact that they once played "spin the bottle" together and the fact that they both happen to cross pathes so early on seems more like the result of lazy story-telling than any type of destiny. In fact, the only reason we know these two are romanticlly-linked is through Arnold telling them so. The comedy is equally weak as most attempts at humor just make the characters seem silly such as Arnold aquiring clothing from a male stripper. This sequel doesn't have any great trend-sending tagline either and instead plays on the old "I'll Be Back" quote and borrows the dated "Talk To The Hand" routine. <p>As a beloved fan of the classic Terminator films, I found that director Mostow and writers John Brancato & Michael Ferris had literally no idea what they were doing. As is often the case by the third film in a franchise, the idea of a multi-million dollar profit machine always outweighs the intergrity of the presentation. Schwarzenegger's cyborg spends more time telling us the story than Mostow's direction does, Brad Fidel's legendary "Terminator" theme is not found in any incarnation, and the ending is so drastically horrible that I felt that they would have been better off, making no sequel at all than trying to make this one. The only thing worse than the ending itself is the opening for yet another Terminator sequel. For shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This movie is just like a Terminator: It crashes around, makes alot of loud noise but is actually brain-dead. This film was supposed to be a "Blockbuster" but I did'nt get that impression when I was watching it. The Arnold is the only actor from the original film who plays the same character that he did in the firat 2 films. <p>  Terminator 3's big "draw"? A female terminator! (Whoopee..) She blows up stuff real good, can inflate her cha-cha's and can make cars drive themselves by taking over their cruise control systems. This movie's writers should have tried activatating their car's cruise control and letting go of the wheel: Presto -no more bad scripts. <p>  As I was watching this tribute to destruction, I kept asking myself "Would'nt the terminators cause a Moebius Strip?", an endless loop in time: Kid grows up into Terminator controlled world-->sends Terminator to past-->Terminator saves kid in past-->kid grows up into......<p>  Bottom line: the movie is OK if you do not think too much while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>The Terminator series has a huge fan base and I was looking forward to this installment. Unfortunately James Cameron is out..ditto Linda Hamilton. When a director and one of the stars decline to sign on, you know you're headed for trouble! The story is ambitious, but trying too hard to top the jokes of T2 they lose sight of the serious core that have made the first two film so good. The TX...well she's hot and the FX are good, the character seems to fall flat like almost everything in this film. It's an OK film at best, but with a running time of an hour and 40 minutes this film seemed longer than the second film which runs 2 1/2 hours!<br /><br />If your a fan of the series you will probably want to see this, but Terminator Salvation should have been the third film not this overblown and surprisingly boring entry. The two disc DVD has a nice DVD transfer, but I didn't find the extra material to be all that great. Of course the usual commentaries and trailers are present, but who cares? Arnold should have rejected this half hearted clunker and had more than just a CGI cameo part in T4 Salvation!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>If you watched the first two movies in this "series," particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:<br /><br />1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the "bad cyborg" Robert Patrick could do in the "Terminator 2," you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>Really great effects and sound that will truly test your home theater quality.  The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why.  Then there is a bit of a surprise at the end that in hind-sight fits the movie.  Overall, get the movie because of the effects, not because of a storyline, this way you won't be disappointed when a minor one shows up.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>A great continuation to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305079900">The Terminator</a> franchise.  I was wonderfully surprised at how skillfully this film was made without James (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8LY">The Abyss</a>) Cameron at the helm of it all.  Jonathan Mostow who gave us the fabulously instense <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B9UZ">U-571</a> directs this film with great flare, deftness, and respect for the franchise.  The script is also respectful of its predecessors and doesn't contradict them a la "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRZHQO">The Grudge 2</a>."<br /><br />The acting is all first-rate for this kind of film and Kristanna Loken is a real find as the "Terminatrix."  The effects, sound, editing, and action sequences are top-notch and should be at $172 million.  BTW: It may have cost a bundle to make, but it earned nearly 1/2 billion at the box-office.  When you consider that this is the third trip to the well, that's not bad at all.<br /><br />This is definitely Schwarzenegger's swansong as the terminator as he began his political career shortly after this film's release; nevertheless, he continues to fit the part perfectly and even brings a certain amount of depth to the role this time around as he had done in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009QG68">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>.  He is actually a better actor than he is often given credit for being.  He certainly doesn't look his 55 years in this film and his stature continues to intimidate.  He will be greatly missed in this role and on the silver screen as he now focuses on his political career.  What a life he has lead: world-class body builder, world-wide box-office smash actor, and now respected politician.  There is definitely great intelligence and strong-willed spirit with the brawn.<br /><br />While this is just popcorn fun, there is depth to this latest entry into the franchise as we and the characters discover that Judgment Day wasn't stopped, just postponed.  The story is exciting and suspenseful, but meaningful and touching too.  The ending sequence is actually moving and haunting.<br /><br />Rumor has it that Terminator 4 is being made where we finally live in the "future" time that we only saw in snipets in the prior films.  If it is made by the same folks who did T3, I will definitely wait in line for tickets.  I miss James Cameron's specific vision, but the folks behind T3 have a solid vision of their own and it's respectful to Cameron's at the same time.<br /><br />Finally, this two-disc "special edition" is worth the price to get all the behind the scenes info.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>My first opinion of Jonathan Mostow's &quot;Terminator 3&quot; was one of anger. The ending of the movie bothered me. To be honest, it still bothers me. The &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise had always been one of my favorites and I just didn't care for much of this movie. Having had a chance to watch it again on DVD, I will give credit where its due. Mostow did a compendable job with a great deal of things. The atmosphere of the movie still feels like a &quot;Terminator&quot; film. Most series lose that feeling by the third entry. Add in the fact that it's been close to twelve years since the last one and that's pretty impressive. My biggest problem with &quot;T3&quot; is that it never manages to do anything more than follow the same direction as &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. Despite the fact that it uses more elaborate effects shots, it still never captures the epic feeling of its predacessor. On the DVD's commentray track, Mostow makes mention of the fact that he takes the film's villian (Kristanna Loken) out of the movie for a lengthy period of time but forgets that Cameron did the very same thing in &quot;T2&quot; with Robert Patrick. Still, if you're just looking for a big, loud action movie that will blow the hell out of your speakers, this is worth a try. While it is miles behind the previous two films in innovation and style, the third &quot;Terminator&quot; is at least good for some by-the-numbers thrills. The movie both looks and sounds amazing. As a stand-alone film, it works but as a fan of the series, it hardly lived up to my expectations. It was good to see Arnold back in action though. The double-disc DVD has a humorous deleted scene and some other featurettes but don't be surprised if Warner Bros. ends up making an even better edition in the not too distant future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator role is unquestionably the role that put him on the map, and this third installment has been a long time coming (12 years after part 2). Is it as good as the pervious 2 movies? Right off the bat, I will say no. While most action fans will love the overlong chase sequences and fights, diehard fans of the original will see this as a letdown.<p>Apparently, the end of the second movie was wrong. Judgement Day was not stopped, it was merely postponed. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is once again confronted with the future when a female terminator (a very sexy female terminator) is sent back to kill him, since he is to become the future resistance leader, and his future lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The new female terminator, the T-X, is stronger, faster, and miles more advanced than the T-1000 from Terminator 2. True to form, Arnie returns as the original T-100 terminator (a different model, though)  to protect these two, who are important to the survival of the human race. <p>While the ideas put forth on paper are good, they seem insubstantial in the execution. The first two movies balanced action with a solid storyline, while the third seems like a by-the-numbers action movie with a story added in for effect. It  doesn't have the same look, feel, or emotional impact of the first two movies. Arnold is heavy on the one-liners here, but his performance lacks any substance, and comes across as wooden and annoyingly heavy on the self-parody.<p>Terminator 3 is not a bad movie, in fact there were many elements that I quite liked. But as a Terminator movie, it fails, if for no other reason is because it had a lot to live up to after Terminator 2. The secret to appreciating Terminator 3 is to lower your expectations, and no go into it thinking of the previous movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Warning: This review contains spoilers<p>It's safe to say that my expectations for this film were rather low when I went in to see it. Sequels that are held off this long (12 years) are rarely worth it, and the third movie is usually where these franchises start coming undone. Thankfully, within the first five minutes, all of my fears were put to rest. James Cameron is missing-in-action as director, and at the helm this time is the relatively unknown Jonathan Mostow, who injects his own flavor into the science-fiction/action genre and breathes new life into the franchise, while staying true to the roots. This movie is simply amazing. I would even use the word 'epic' to describe it. If you are familiar with the first two 'Terminator' flicks, you will be salivating at most of the scenes. There are also worries about characters that are missing and casting changes, but those should be put to rest as well. This movie benefits from starting from scratch again with it's characters and giving us new problems. I wasn't about ready to watch Linda Hamilton discipline Edward Furlong again for another 2 hours. The movie follows John Connor, now a young adult, who is homeless and as he puts it "lives off the grid." He thinks that he has prevented Judgment Day, but in his heart, he feels it is just yet to come. Sarah Connor, his mother, has passed away, and he is on his own. Not fifteen minutes into the movie, John discovers that there is a new batch of Terminators sent to his time yet again, one, is the loveable Arnie model, sent to protect him. The other is the unstoppable T-X (a.k.a The Terminatrix) who is an improved model over the T-1000 from part 2 and is, well, female. The movie moves at a non-stop pace. This movie gave me the adrenaline rush that 'The Matrix: Reloaded' needed, promised, and lacked. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire hour and fifty minutes this movie lasted. The story sucks you in, as it is revealed that Judgment Day is quickly coming up on the horizon and there may be nothing John or his allies can do to stop it. The whole movie has an underlying feeling of doom. Because Judgment Day is inevitable, and no matter what he does, the walls will come crashing down around John Connor. I have to say that I had a massive grin on my face when the machines started taking over. We have been hearing about it all for so long, it was amazing to finally see it happen. And it was all pulled off so well. This movie takes a lot of risks that most summer-blockbusters don't take. For one thing, it stays true to its roots and is a real fan-pleaser. Instead of providing a story that any newcomer can follow, this installment is a continuation of previous events and helps put all the pieces of the puzzle back together. Also, the movie is relatively violent, bleak and sprinkled with a bit of dark humor. It all works maginificently. I can't hand this movie enough compliments. All I can say to you is, put your fears aside. You can waste your time wondering what this movie would be like had Cameron directed it, but as it is, Jonathan Mostow contributed an exciting and fresh sequel to the franchise, that, tastefully enough, leaves room for more. Let's just hope T4 makes it here before the summer of 2015.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I never new there was a Terminator 3 till I started ordering the Terminator movies off of Amazon.

I didn't see any grain.  It even looks great when it is paused.  The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 (not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio), but is great anyway.  Lots of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.  All Blu-Rays should be of this quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie came quite a while after the second one was made, and to be honest, this movie simply doesn't add as much to the story. The first and second were awesome. I can't say this installment was bad or anything, but the story wasn't as tight as the first two, and felt rather unneeded.<br /><br />One thing I can say is that there's lots of explosions and property damage, so if you're the kind of person who likes seeing that, then you WILL enjoy this movie. There's a memorable scene where they're driving a truck with an arm and the arm drags along and destroys so many things as the truck is driving along, and it's quite the visual to see, or where Terminator and the female Terminator are fighting in the bathroom at the army base and they pretty much tear everything up - urinals, sinks, toilets, walls. Freaking awesome.<br /><br />This movie serves more as visual candy than a solid story, so it's not for everyone. Still, I enjoyed it, if not as much as the first two.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes star in this<br />2003 sci-fi sequel. A cyborg is sent to protect a young man and<br />a woman from a lethal female prototype. This isn't a bad sequel,<br />but I missed Linda Hamilton's character. This dvd set has nice<br />picture and sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected. So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.<p>Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding. And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference. <p>The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor. Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it? <p>AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze. Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Terminator 3 was an average film taken on its own. That is all it tries to be, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It is just another action film in an everlasting and ever-expanding pantheon of action films. The only saving grace is that it's a darned good action film. As a Terminator film, however, it falters quite miserably in carrying on the torch.<p>Just as the first sequel came years after the original, Terminator 3 comes about a dozen years after T2 (although it doesn't seem that long: it seems there's a new special edition DVD of that film every couple of months!). I guess I can't blame James Cameron for milking that cow as much as he can, nor can I blame him for refusing to helm this sequel. When you think about it, the minute that it was announced he wasn't going to make the movie, we should have known that it wouldn't be true to the first two: Terminator was Cameron's brainchild. Nevertheless, here it is.<p>The plot of the film is probably evident to anyone within several hundred meters of a television, radio, computer, bus stop, movie theater, etc. It is nearly a remake of Terminator 2 when you think about it: New machine comes back in time to kill future leader(s), old machine is sent back to save them. With such novelty it isn't a mystery as to how the plot seems to go nowhere amid incredible (and incredibly expensive) chase scenes. In all honesty, people who want a little introspection ought to look at the first two films, there isn't any here.<p>From a technical standpoint, the movie is a great success. With a budget in excess of $150 million, the film has sufficient resources for magnificent eye-candy. Car chases, explosions, robot effects, you name it, it is pulled off here with style and aplomb. The acting is also surprisingly decent. Arnold's last pre-political film has him back in the role that started him off. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are both good actors and help the film tremendously. Kristanna Loken is brilliant as the new 'Terminatrix,' showing no emotion at killing dozens of people.<p>The major problem with this film is this: Would it have been fitting for Saving Private Ryan to have been filmed as a straight-action film? Of course not. It had very important messages-just dumping them for the sake of killer battle sequences (no pun intended) would have been a waste. The same applies here. Although the Terminator series has always been a good action series (even the first: shoestring effects rock!), the action is the focus here instead of the ideas. The ideas not only take a back seat, they are pretty much swept under the rug. It has been said before, but I will say it again: the first two films were about making our own destiny, that the future is not set, as several characters have commented during the saga. However, here the message that the war of humanity against the machines is inevitable. This is about 180 degrees from the original philosophy. Instead of examining this or even trying to harmonize it with the original message (impossible, but they should have tried), they just plow along on the chase scenes. This movie has no real insight into present-day society, nor does it try to. Being as the action was in the first Terminator primarily to service to the story and now the converse is true, it is no wonder that Cameron opted out of his own creation.<p>In short, the movie was a Terminator film solely because the franchise is an entertainment juggernaut. The studio just wanted the name. They should have changed the names and actors in the film and just made it a non-franchised title. At the very least, it wouldn't have been referred to as a remake by me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is a solid sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)</a>, but it's story line and casting are a little weaker this time.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. This time SkyNet is targeting the John Conner in his 20s, and once again two Terminators are sent back in time; one to "terminate" and one to protect.<br /><br />There are a lot of technical issues with this movie (i.e. only living flesh can be sent back, remote control of cars and trucks the were not made for it, etc). The casting of John's love interest was an interesting choice, since she looks much older and more mature than he does and they should be the same age.<br /><br />The new "Terminatrix" is very cool and totally scary! Arnold also puts in a strong performance and still looks cools as the "obsolete" model.<br /><br />The Special Effects are very good and likely the best of the lot.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable movie with a little suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the franchise.<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This movie is a really great installment in the franchise and I think that this is one of those kind of films that grow more popular through the years. If you are a fan of the Terminator series, then you will find some fun to be had with this movie. There is ton of action and the story really advances the mythology as John meets the person who will eventually teach him how to lead the human resistance.<br /><br />The opening storyline of the movie is also very interesting when the new Terminator, the T-X, targets John's future lieutenants. The T-X is a very cool new Terminator and is more advanced than the T-1000. Arnold is awesome as always, the best line has to be when he asks the male stripper to take his clothes off. Overall, I think this movie is really cool and will become even more important when the next film comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"T3 - Rise of The Machines" is a decent entry in the big, dumb action (BDA) movie genre. Nick Stahl adds depth to the role of John Connor - future leader of the resistance and Claire Daines is pretty good as his love interest Catherine Brewster but Governor Schwartzenegger's acting has not improved - even playing a robot (the "good" termininator) - and Kristina Loken makes a memorable if rather one-note "bad" terminator. The film has all the stunning special effects and spectacular stunts you would expect in a BDA but the main problem the film can never quite overcome is an overall air of familiarity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This one is not the instant classic that the first and (especially) the second, but it holds up well enough as a good action movie. It is not as intense as the first. Nor is it as insightful as the second. The aim this time around is simply to have fun, and it meets that goal very well.<br /><br />Arnold is back here in his likely last appearance as a terminator from the future, and, despite the years that have passed since the first outing, he looks very much the same, as he should. Kristanna Loken is a welcome addition to the pantheon of terminator models, becoming both very sensual and very eerie.<br /><br />You may feel that the movie should have done more to deal with the concepts of fate and free will, like was discussed in the previous movie, but if you merely want to watch a movie that has great effects, great action and passably charismatic characters, you could do worse than this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Lots of great action and special effects.  It's hardly ever dull.<br />*Storyline relatively fits.<br />*Still lots of serious and lots of funny parts.<br />*Characters are not bad.<br />*The Terminatrix is an excellent enemy.  I like the fact that she combines the best of all previous terminators; it's a very systematic solution.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not as many memorable lines.<br />*Some things in the franchise have become convuluted.  This film introduced certain elements (like John Connor having a wife) that probably should have been left out.<br />*John Connor's character is weakened.  And now that I've seen "Carnivale," I will probably always look at the actor Nick Stahl as a reluctant farm boy instead of the future leader of the resistance.<br /><br />I never expected this film to have any more action than T2, but I was ultimately surprised as to how much there was.  The first half had loads of great scenes, including one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen.  The Terminatrix impressed me as well.  The film had a fair amount of both drama and comedy.  Some parts remain ambiguous or convoluted, but still fits okay with the other films.  It's not perfect, but it is enjoyable, and for the movies, brings everything into a mostly-full circle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I enjoyed watching the 3rd installment in the terminator series. This movie had a lot of action and was quick paced. As far as sequels go, this sequel is great as it takes the storyline to the next step.... which is that the machines do start a nuclear holocaust no matter how hard John & Sarah Connor attempted to prevent Judgment Day from occurring in the past.<br /><br />I can only speculate that a "Terminator 4" may possibly be made in the future in order to see the aftermath of the nuclear fallout and how John Connor actually leads the remaining human population in an uprising against the machines that have taken over the world. So, let's hope "Terminator 4" is made into a movie to complete the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>Compared with the utter drivel that's been out *this* year - Transformers, Beowulf, etc. - Terminator 3 is an enjoyable action to munch away the popcorn to. The special effects are decent, the action sequences memorable, and it's not too long.<br /><br />The problem with Terminator 3 is that the first two set the bar so high that it fails as a successor in the franchise. The plot is a rehash of the second one, the female Terminator is a joke (although nice to look at, plot holes abound, and it just so feels so ...  underwhelming.<br /><br />Of course, the first two are legendary so expectations are high. Once Fox has danced all over the grave of quality with The Terminator Chronicles being released soon, maybe T3 will look like the best movie of the decade.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>Cameron insisted that the second movie was the end of the story. However, in his divorce from Linda Hamilton, he gave her the rights to the Terminator movies, which she then sold, enabling this film to be made. It would have been nice to have Edward Furlong reprise his role as John Connor, however, he was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time. People complain that Skynet should have been terminated by the events of the second movie, however, Skynet is software, and all that was destroyed in the second movie was hardware, which would still be developed, although later in history.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>I like this movie much better than I expected to like it.<br /><br />Why wouldn't I expect to like it? Five reasons offhand: No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Brad Fiedel score. No Edward Furlong. And (as of T2) no future for the Terminators to come back from.<br /><br />But Jonathan Mostow has done a pretty good job with this one. Not perfect -- for example, I don't find Kristanna Loken's T-X anywhere near as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 -- but it's not bad at all. And his non-sappy ending returns the Terminator series to its pessimistic tech-noir roots.<br /><br />Nick Stahl's okay as John Connor; I miss Furlong, but Stahl looks as though he could actually _be_ the love child of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. And Claire Danes is surprisingly effective as Kate Brewster, John's future second-in-command and spouse. Marco Beltrami's score is good too, although I still miss the main theme from the old one. (We hear Beltrami's arrangement of it over the closing credits, but that's it.)<br /><br />Arnold, of course, is Arnold, and he's still why we watch. The stunts and special effects are very good.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but the outcome of this one may surprise you. In fact, it restores quite a bit of what T2 undid.<br /><br />The omitted 'Sgt. Candy scene' is delightful, but it's by far the best item in the bonus materials. Generally, on the Terminator DVDs, the deleted scenes are helpful in understanding certain plot points; this one's no exception.<br /><br />All in all, a nice addition to the Terminator series. Will there be more?</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>When I first heard that T3 was coming out I was terrified. I mean, no James Cameron? No Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton)?? A new guy (Nick Stahl) playing John Conner??? A female terminatrix???? An ancient Arnold creeking along as the terminator????? Boy, was I scared of the potential catastrophe this flick could've been! Well, my fears were unnecessary. T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES was a pleasant surprise. First, though Cameron would have done a completely different film with Linda Hamilton, they both opted out (of T3 and their relationship w/ each other) and there was no hope of their being involved. Jonothan Mostow does a great job, keeping the action at an insane pace, making T3 an excellent 2hr rollercoaster ride. Claire Danes is wonderful as the unfortunate Kate, sucked into the vortex of John Conner's destiny. Kristanna Loken is the perfect ice-cold assassin as the TX Terminatrix. She's beautiful, lethal, and indestructible. The perfect date for yours truly! Nick Stahl is John Conner. I liked him and found him quite believable. That leaves Arny as everyone's favorite cyborg. I was frankly amazed at how good he looks! This future governor of la-la-land looks physically like he did in the first two terminators! Either he's wearing a rubber body, or Arnold is in peak condition. Either way, he IS the terminator and always will be. He delivers his trademark T-101-liners with typical Arny style. As for the storyline, I was so caught up in the explosions and chase elements, I almost forgot what it was all about! It seems that judgement day has only been postponed and the TX has arrived to seek out and destroy John Conner. The T-101 intervenes again, this time protecting both John and Kate in an attempt to save the remnant of humanity from skynet's planetary conquest. Can they escape the TX? What secret does Kate's dad hold? Will Arnold take time off from his office job to do T4? Only time will tell. The only complaint I have is that it could have been longer. Another 20 minutes or so to flesh out the story would've been nice. However, I digress...</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Let's say you're an average Joe. You have your favorite sports car, a fabulous job, your own house, a beautiful wife and a great family. You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?<p>The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.<p>The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.<p>Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>All I have to say is what if you gave the Terminator franchise to a direct to video action director...that's what Terminator 3 is. The acting ...you can't blame the actors. They could only work with the lines they were given.  The special effects were not too bad. The ending does make it worthwhile though. The effects in some of the scenes are good and advance what we saw in T2.  I was hoping that Stallone would be a cybernetic rival to Arnold..but I don't think they could agree on who would get more screen time.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>The 1980s gave us "The Terminator;" the 1990s gave us "Terminator 2: Judgement Day," and now we have "T3: Rise of the Machines."  All things considered, I had every right to expect this movie to be a bust.  Not only did James Cameron (who directed the first two "Terminator" movies) bow out, but his ex-wife and star Linda Hamilton also said "hasta la vista, baby" to "T3."  Linda Hamilton's role as Sarah Connor was a crucial element to the first two "Terminator" films, and without her, my faith headed south.  But thanks to director Jonathan Mostow, he makes "Terminator 3" a worthy sequel that doesn't come across as a desperate attempt to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit.  Like "T2," Arnold plays a "good" terminator on a mission to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) against the relentlessly evil terminatrix TX (a wonderfully icy Kristianna Loken).  "T3" lacks the groundbreaking punch of its last two films, and Stahl comes off as a bit bland as John Connor, but the film overall succeeds as an above-average action flick.  Special effects-wise, there's nothing to write home about, but there are a few scenes that will have you hooked to the screen, including an extended car chase that's downright ugly.  It's also not afraid to make fun of itself by recycling one-liners like "she'll be back," "I'll be back," and "talk to the hand."  I can't say that "T3" will go down as one of the great action movies and I'm also not sure I would want to see a "T4," but it definitely exceeded my expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Leaving the theatre after the end of the first showing of T3 everyone was looking at each other sort of grimly.  Don't want to spoil it, but don't expect a happy, fluffy, thumbs up as the t101 goes into the molten metal.  Picking up where the second left off, the machines are trying to kill John Conner again, and while they're at it, eliminate some of his cabinet members from the future.  The new evil Terminatrix is the logical progression from the amorphous T1000 prototype from the second film.  I thought the actress playing the TX did a nice job walking the line between tough as nails ice queen and sexy in spite of herself-robotness.  I remember reading once after T2 that they compared Arnold to the T1000 as a tank to a Porsche, the comparison holds true here as well.  With her hair pulled back, she is sleek and dangerous in the same way Patrick was..  I actually liked this one more than T2, it wasn't as self-referentially funny.  There are moments of comedy, but they are tempered by the ominous situation facing the heroes, more than the second film. Could also be that we don't have to deal with the whining preen of Edward Furlong from back then.  The action and chase scenes are impressive and seem less CG-ish than the freeway chase in Matrix II [although that sequence still is unsurpassed in my opinion].  Overall, there is really is no down time lull that doesn't work, the quiet moments are handled well with Conner and soon to be more Claire Danes [sp] &lt;who also did a bang up job>].  Arnold was Arnold, some of the new quips had us laughing, `Talk to da hand'.  The DVD contains numerous extras but notably hilarious section on principals of the Terminator universe where they don't use the original actors from T1, T2 and have them running out of focus or Photoshop art effected.  There are two audio commentaries, one done with the three actors, and then one by the directory.  Upon repeated viewings I think it held up well as the third member of the franchise.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Honestly, I don't remember enough about the first "Terminator" movie or its sequel to know how logically "Terminator 3" Rise of the Machines" relates to them. I decided it didn't matter because the basic premise is itself illogical and because so many years separate the making of each installment that each has to stand on its own. If there is any parallel between the real world and "Terminator" world, it might be this: By the time "T3" was produced, nearly all the special effects could be computer generated. This technology has gotten so good that the line between `real' and `unreal' images is quite blurred. What all our real life machines can do in the future is both exciting and frightening.<p>"T3" takes place just before a super-computer tries to unleash a nuclear holocaust that will allow machines to defeat human beings. T-X [Kristanna Loken], a `female' killer robot, comes from the future to eliminate a twentysomething John Connor [Nick Stahl] and all those who might join him the resistance to come. Close on her heels is Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger], whose mission it is to save Connor and his future wife, Kate [Claire Danes]. There are problems for Terminator such as his being an older model than T-X. [Arnold is himself now in his mid-fifties.] There is the sullen, stubborn Connor, who has already been through so much that he doesn't have a clue as to how to lead a revolution. And, of course, when Connor and Kate meet, they don't much like each other. So, what makes them think they will ever marry?<p>There is lots of action here; in fact, the movie could be called one long chase sequence. To me, the chases were well paced and exhilarating. Long is a relative term.<p>Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are two exceptional young actors. Their presence helped make the movie for me. Both seemed to center the movie by giving it interesting performances. It can be argued, however, that they are too good to be in a movie like this. Neither are typical action/adventure types. <p>Overall, "T3" is one of the best `popcorn' movies of recent times</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>HD definitely does wonders for these kind of action movies. It really brings them to life, and does them justice. I did originally see it at the cinema, but HD certainly comes second to seeing a film at the cinema. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The film is actually R-rated in America, but was only 12A here. The previous two were 15's, so I thought were gory/violent bits cut out of T3. I seriously didn't notice whether there was anything cut. On a second watching, maybe, but I really wasn't looking for cuts. You have to feel sorry for Arnie throughout this film, he really gets a rough ride.<br /><br />The film starts off like T2 - except it's John Conner talking about the future, rather than Sarah Conner, who doesn't appear in this film. I'm glad she refused to do it, especially after her appearance in T2 - she did NOT look right with those muscles. To explain her disappearance, she was killed off (charming). She simply appeared via a coffin. Nick Stahl, who does a great job of taking over from Edward Furlong, plays John Conner. I will always know Nick Stahl from `The Man Without A Face', where he played opposite Mel Gibson. He was a lot younger in that film, but he still looks the same, even with stubble, and looks a tiny bit older.<br /><br />When the TX appears, played by "model" (and boy, can you see it!) Kristianna Loken, I was glad that I wasn't in the cinema with a bunch of teenage guys, who would have probably started wolf whistling. She does appear naked for the first couple of minutes, and her hair is artfully brushed to cover her up, so nothing is seen. She scares the living daylights out of a woman, before taking over her car. She also manages to scrape her long hair back into a tight bun, which is very stereotypical for a female in this kind of film. She looks tough and hard-faced. I'd love to see the outtakes from this film, to see whether she does actually laugh during scenes, which then have to be cut out. She remains expressionless, and hardly speaks. Arnie speaks more in this film! And in any of the fight sequences, does a hair get harmed or get out of place on her blonde head? No way!<br /><br />Of course, Arnie appears naked too, and immediately walks into a strip club, full of screaming women. He tells the male stripper (who sounds obviously gay) to give him his clothes, and then dresses up in them. He pulls out the shades, which are star-shaped and look as though they've been borrowed from Elton John! Thankfully, he finds a cooler pair of shades. Arnie wouldn't be the Terminator without his shades. Not quite Matrix shades, but never mind.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) plays an old schoolfriend of John Conner's, and it just so happens, that they "made out" in someone's basement. So there's a certain connection, although absolutely NO chemistry between them. She almost turns out to be a resurrection of Linda Hamilton's character, even John Conner comments on this! You need a tough female character (apart from stony-faced Kristianna), and Linda Hamilton filled that part very well, in the first two films. Now Claire Danes has taken over from her. She's a far cry from the only other role I've ever seen her in, that of Juliet in Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo & Juliet'.<br /><br />There are two, very obvious hints that there will be a T4, and personally, the format is getting a little tired now. You know the various Terminators are going to come back and try & kill off John Conner, and he's going to succeed each time. I don't think they can carry on with this story much longer, it will have been milked for all its worth by the end of the next film. And they should change the story - maybe set it in the future? (But would it still be called Terminator?) But what with the lovely Arnie being governor of California now, he obviously has lots more important things to do than star in another film.<br /><br />This is a great film, if you're a fan of the Terminator series. It's best if you have already seen T1 and T2 to get continuity of the film. It's easily my favourite, after watching them all a couple of times now.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>"Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" are two of the all-time classics of science fiction.  Debates rage back and forth over which film was better.  Is it "T2" with its non-stop juggernaut of action?  Or, is the original "Terminator" with its suspense, human drama, and fresh story?  The argument will like never be settled.  One question that can be answered, though, is 'Is "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"' as good as its predecessors.  The answer to that question is definitely 'no'.  "Terminator 3" is nowhere near as good as the movies that spawned, but, at the same time, it is not a bad movie either.<br /><br />The problems that plague "T3" may stem from the fact that James Cameron is not directing this time ("U-571" director Jonathan Mostow helms it this time).  They may also simply stem from the fact that there has been such a long layoff between movies.  "Judgment Day" came out in 1991, which "Rise of the Machines" was released this year, 2003.  The novelty has worn off by now.  It also maybe just the simple fact that movie is not much more than a series of protracted actions scenes that seem like they could have been cut from the earlier films.  The movie still manages to garner a positive review because, in its climax, it takes a bold and unexpected turn that shows real audacity and leaves the door open for additional sequels.<br /><br />"Rise of the Machines" focuses of the life of John Connor (Nick Stahl) in decade or so since the events of "Judgment Day".  While the destruction of Skynet labs seemed to have put an end to the technology that would have brought about holocaust of Judgment Day, Connor is unable to feel comfortable.  He lives an existence that make him near impossible to trace, fearing the monsters of the future may one day come back for him.  And, like in the previous film, they do.  This time, it's a female Terminator, the T-X (played icily by model Kristanna Loken) who has been sent back to kill Connor and thereby end the threat of the human who can defeat the machines.  In a carbon copy move of the previous film, Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator (or a copy of him) is sent back in time to defend Connor from this new threat.  From the point of their arrival, "Rise of the Machines" becomes nothing more than one long chase scene.  Along the way, Connor and the Terminator pick up an acquaintance from Connor's past, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and they rush to get away from the T-X.  It's important for them to stay alive because it seems that Judgment day was NOT averted, and Connor must live so that the resistance can be led against the Machines.  Connor still believes Judgment Day can be avoided and its a race against time to prevent it.<br /><br />Nick Stahl may not seem like a great choice to play John Connor.  He still seems childish and unimpressive (how are we to believe this man is supposed to lead the resistance?), but then Edward Furlong wasn't exactly an inspired choice to play him in "T2".  It's nice to see Arnold back in his familiar role.  Though, at times, he seems like a parody of his famous character.  Danes is really just window dressing in her role as Kate Brewster.  She doesn't really contribute much beyond a vast catalog of screams and pained expressions.  Loken's quite a looker as the T-X and is quite menacing, but the role doesn't exactly give her much to act with, so it's hard to evaluate her performance.<br /><br />Overall, "Rise of the Machines" is a respectable film.  It's not a great one, but it doesn't fail the way other sequels have after long layoffs ("Alien: Resurrection" to name one).  It's a classic summertime popcorn action movie.  It's also not a bad way to spend 2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>The Terminator films serve as the next evolution in the debate mankind has waged ever since the myth of Prometheus.  Technology&#65533;s good and evil status has haunted and perplexed us from the moment we stepped out of the caves. In the Terminator films, technology, given too much power, sends us all back into the darkened primordial soup.<p>Human fate is what we make it is of the great themes present in TERMINATOR 3: THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. The hope we are ultimately in control of our fate and our technology is one of the underpinning messages making the violent and seemingly nihilistic fantasies of the Terminator film saga work.<p>Granted this third helping of Arnold wrecking things reminds us that the novelty of the new has long worn off this brilliant and durable franchise. This is really a small nitpick for the third installment delivers the promised thrills, blazing guns and honest heartfelt humanity. TERMINATOR 3 also bravely allows itself to go into DR. STRANGELOVE territory with a downbeat ending that brazenly bucks Hollywood trends while simultaneously setting the audience up for another sequel.<p>Such is the great paradox of the Terminator saga. While these films have pushed the technology of filmmaking to new extremes, pallid imitators have forgotten the humanity at the core of narrative. Technology, as any proud Luddite can tell you, is a Pandora&#65533;s Box. Just remember at the bottom of the box lies the hope that mankind is wise enough not sacrifice itself at the throne of convenience and awe.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Terminator 3, contrary to my negative expectations.<br />After nearly a decade since the huge commercial success in both theaters and DVD market of Terminator 2,a film that James Cameron has invested so much technically, and creativally, I had a slight aversion towards this third installement, being disappointed before with similar revivals of classic films like Star Wars, but I was very much surprised by how well this film is made, and I made few observations,<br />First I felt that T3 was closest to the original Terminator film. T2 was surely a very ambitious and exciting and extravagantly directed film, but it had something which personally I found off putting: The robot/terminator had a deeper almost three dimensional approach..a robot who experiences human feelings is an angle that can easily fall in the trap of the one S word I hate in  movies, sentimentality.<br />Speilberg fell into that trap in AI and Cameron did border it in T2.<br />(The only robot with human feelings movie that works so well is Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner).<br />So the fresh thing about T3 is the fact that the terminator returns to his non-nonsense tough self with a very determined mission, and no time for cheesy emotions,quite similar to the first film.<br />The other fresh addition is of course Kristanna Loken. She adds an invaluable sexiness to the movie, a deadly and very pretty robot..not unlike Natasha Hentsridge in Species minus the nudity and love scenes.<br />Jonathan Mostow's direction was very good, and all the cast played their roles very well..but it is Arnold Shwarzenegger that I was mostly impressed with.<br />He is back on top form, and with the aid of make up and a still super fit body, he appears to be more comfortable than he was in any of his recent roles.<br />And while he traded signing film contracts and carrying guns, with signing legislations and carrying babies, in T3 he was able to demonstrate that the huge fan base he has acquired over the years was the result of the tough charisma and the cheeky humour he posesses.<br />And T3 is full of funny lines.<br />One example: When terminator goes with Stahl and Danes's characters to see Danes father, he says is a straight faced manner: 'We can reach CRS in an hour depending on the traffic! which I found hilarious!<br />T3 is also full of non stop action, a roller coaster of a ride that is crammed with very impressive digital trickery that will have you gasp in amazement.<br />Finally, I was totally surprised by the ending! a twist that will truly shock you and a perfect end to the movie.<br />So, thanks to producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna and to Jonathan Mostow and 'Governor' Shwarzenegger that this franchise was revived again to give us a very entertaining movie, full of heart pounding stunts, pleasent humour and a DVD experience you can enjoy over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>After having to sit thru the pile of crud that was "XXX" recently, I have to say how nice it was to finally see a real action movie. This is how you do it. Arnold may be getting older, but he can still show the young 'uns what an action film is. Are you listening Mr. Diesel?. The plots to these films are filled with techno gizmo and all that kind of stuff, so it hardly matters what exactly the movie is about. After all, it all comes down to the action and the special effects. This one has got it all. The first two films in the series were classics in the genre. It's tough telling how this one will rank in the series with die hard fans, but I am here to tell you that this is one fun ride. So, how exactly do you come back after the groundbreaking part 2?. How do you top it?. Apparently, after seeing the movie, you don't. The effects are fantastic and cool, but they don't seem to build much upon part 2. The female terminator is incredible, but her attributes don't outdo or better Robert Patrick's from the previous film. Basically, it just stays with the flow from the second film with eye popping action that outdoes everything in action films in recent years and great effects. The story takes place ten years later, although it has actually been twelve years since the last film came out. John Connor, now played by Nick Stahl, has been keeping a low profile. He has no phone, no address, and lives on the street. Can't find him that way. A female terminator named the T-X, played by beautiful Kristana Lokken, comes to town with one thing in mind. Kill John and prevent him from becoming the future leader of humankind. She starts going thru everyone associated with him and leaving them in body bags. In comes the T-101 cyborg(Arnold)to protect John, although he was originally designed and programmed to be an assassin. His mission is to also protect the lovely Kate Brewster(played by the lovely Claire Danes), who is an old acquaintance of John's and has a connection with him in the future. Arnold must keep them alive, keep the terminatrix at bay, and stop machines being controlled by computers and destroying the world. Arnold is back in action and reclaims the action king crown. He's getting older, but it is definitley not an issue. He doesn't look much different than he did 12 years ago. I would still much rather see a 55 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a 60 year old Harrison Ford, than a 25 year old anybody else. This film also has a welcome dose of humor as well. It is able to be funny and crack jokes and play with itself. Other action films take themselves so seriously, that they are laughable. Again, must I mention "XXX"?. Stahl and Danes are most welcome as the two human heroes. Stahl is a likeable presence worthy enough to cheer and root for. It is somewhat surprising to see Danes in a movie like this. She really fits well tho. She is human and brings real human feelings and emotion to the proceedings. She is very sweet and lovely looking to boot. Kristana Lokken does what there is to do with the character. She is icy and cold and lethal. It also isn't a negative thing that she is nice to look at. The dialogue is pretty tight, from what you can make out of it from all of the technical mumbo jumbo, and everything moves right along at a nice pace. There is even a cameo from Earl Boen, who appeared as Dr. Siberling in the original film. Nice touch. It is a bit sad that Linda Hamilton wasn't involved. She was missed. The movie is everything you'd expect from an action movie and everything you could want in a Terminator film. The action is incredible. It just keeps coming. A chase scene with firetrucks and all is an impressive sight. Teriffic. So, it's a slam bang, fun filled action ride that is sure to please die hard action fans. I enjoyed it a lot and I think anyone interested in this sort of thing will be too. Diesel still isn't ready to play with the big boys.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>I already despised this film before I even went to go see it.  How on earth can you have a Terminator film without Cameron or at least 2 of the 3 key actors?  Well, they did just that and it was actually enjoyable.  This film is loaded with humor, not the self-contained kind from T2 but rather a sort of homage to the previous two films.  Sure this is the easy way to do it in a trilogy, but it also has a familiar warmth about it.  And the homages don't just stop at the humor but encompass many aspects of the film.  This does give you the sense that they're running out of ideas, but I highly doubt that.  Most of this was on purpose, though it certainly does cost the film somewhat in the depth department to take this route.<p>There are two aspects of this film that truly make it shine.  First, Claire Danes is an absolutely wonderful actress.  If she hadn't been cast in this role the project would have been doomed.  She brings depth and humanity to a movie that already has us trying to empathize with a robot and another actor filling in someone else's role.  Second, we get a nice take on the other films' mantra of "There's no future but what we make for ourselves."  Now, imagine John Conner is a bit of an optimist who simply will not accept the laws of temporal mechanics.  That it'd take his pragmatic wife to make the tough decision to ensure their survival at all costs is a heck of a great idea.  The lengths we learn she is (will be) willing to go through, including allowing the T-101 to lie to her, is a wonderful development on the part of the writers.  The only people who could conceivably have a problem with this is the hardcore Terminator 2 fan, who believes that mantra defines the first two films and throwing it out would simply make a mockery of the series.  But since that's not me, it becomes a plus in my book.<p>I do have some problems with this film, though.  I know the actor who played John Conner before isn't exactly considered very reliable anymore, but getting someone else is at least as bad as being stuck with the other guy.  This other actor is definitely talented, but it's an unavoidable emotional leap and, resultantly, a drawback for the audience.  It feels at times like a soap opera, a franchise that can't be shut down...kind of like ER nowadays.  The actors become interchangable, and that's a shame.<p>Next, there's a scene in an Air Force hanger that is atrocious in almost every way.  Without any sort of earlier set up, we suddenly learn that Danes' character was taught how to fly in the very trainer they're running towards.  All the writers had to do was have her reminisce about her dad teaching her how to fly at some earlier point in the film, and there were plenty of opportunities for this when John and she are just talking.  <p>Then we have the T-101's hokey melt down in that same hanger.  The concept of this occurring is perfectly fine, but it's executed in a less than satisfying manner.  Even worse, as John's heading back to the plane he explains (!!!) exactly what we just saw for us with that special oh-so-succinct insight that poorly written "informative" dialog tends to have.  Simply put, the hanger scene needed major revision and reshooting.<p>Finally, the climax of the film at the blast door doesn't feel very climatic.  When we got there and the intensity suddenly revs back up, I had to think to myself "Oh, this must be the climax."  That's never a good sign.  The film actually felt like we had a ways more to go, as the intensity had not properly been built up during the preceding scenes to justify the emotional catharsis of the climax.  This might sound a little intellectual, but it's precisely because it was not quite instinctively and emotionally satisfying during this scene that I'm forced to use the left side of my brain to discuss it.<p>Even with this said, the resolution of the film is satisfying, so all is not lost.  As you can tell I liked the film and am not holding it up to a higher standard than would be justified.  The film is entertaining.  Danes is great.  The humor and homages made me chuckle.  The chase scenes are good.  Sure a lot of the CGI has that soft Star Trek Nemesis look, but the attention to little details like the sand turning into glass from the heat of the time portal made me sit up in my seat.  And last but not least, we get to find out how Skynet was going to be developed whether the original terminator had been sent back or not.  It's not a great film, but considering how low my expectations were I'd say it was definitely worth seeing.  Maybe now they can immediately make a sequel where we see the initial coping with the holocaust and the rise of the resistance up to the climatic sending of the first terminator.  Michael Biehn could certainly be recast for his role, entering the film in the second half.  I'd pay money to see that T4.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Years after Terminator 2, John Conner (Nick Stahals) is a loner for his mother was presumed dead when she left him later as he matured. However he is still having bad dreams about judgment day even from the stuff his mother told him years ago as now The Terminator (Arnold Schwartzenegger) is back as he's reprogamed to protect John Conner yet again and another bad terminator who is a female terminator with the qualities of the first two Terminator villains named T-X (Kristianna Lokken) is set to kill John and future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) so it could set up judgment day including the rise of Skynet.<br /><br />Co-starring Earl Boen who played Dr. Silbermen from the first two movies and David Andrews, this is the weakest installment of the franchise which doesn't have the magic of the first two movies from James Cameron. Miss Lokken is quite sexy as the new villain but is no match for the deadly villains of the first two movies even the T-1000, Jonathan Mostow who directed "Breakdown" and "U-571" is in place of Cameron for this installment does offer some good action sequences and decent acting but it's quite flawed even with some of the corny humor thrown in.

The out-dated Terminator-from-the-Future (Aronold Schwarzenegger) has to once again save stubborn, "Aw shucks, why me?" John Connor (Nick Stahl). Yes, he remembers his mother's admonitions and the dark, dank future awaiting Mankind. Yes, he remembers "Hasta la vista, baby." He's hiding in plain sight, roaming the country, staying anonymous. However, a gorgeous new Terminator, T-X (Kristanna Loken), has arrived in L.A. Her mission? Kill John Connor and all his future lieutenants.<br /><br />First thing of note, Arnold looks fabulous. He's pumped back up and whether it's a mannequin impersonating him, a realistic stunt double, or face and body putty, he's somehow erased ten years without looking like a feminized Michael Douglas. This time, the Terminator talks a lot. He's downright chatty. He has to explain what happened in THE TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. Someone also has to explain the dull, convoluted network, Skynet, that will cause the rise of the machines and the takeover of the planet to the audience and update the technical advances of the T-X over the previous T-1000 (Robert Patrick).<br /><br />No star wants to be responsible for "exposition," yet screenwriters have not been able to find a good way of bringing back the maligned, but essential, Greek Chorus. This has a way of slowing down the story, especially when you are being hunted by a raging, extreme killing machine with only one purpose. Thankfully, The Terminator only talks while firing a grenade-launcher or carrying a casket.<br /><br />Are we still waiting for Judgment Day?<br /><br />Screenwriters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (writers of David Fincher's complex, smart movie The Game, starring the aforementioned Michael Douglas) do not bother refining, or, for that matter, deepening the Terminator bible. That would be like updating The Koran. Instead, we have all the set pieces that are retread, but, who cares? The Terminator arrives naked, gets his leather outfit, and gets the sunglasses. His mission, again, is to save Connor. He's a new Terminator made to resemble the old Terminator, but still an older model. There's no "I'm your father" twist.<br /><br />It's really not easy to come up with a fresh, compelling stories, and sequels, with already terrific characters created, never seem to outdo the original. Why not start with the Terminator being called to his mission?<br /><br />Connor's reluctant aide is Kate (Claire Danes) who remembers kissing him in junior high school. Their fates were sealed. Danes has an anguished, intelligent face that works well here. What she lacks, and might indeed aspire to, is Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) ferocious determinism and iron will. Perhaps Kate will come into her own in TERMINATOR 4? Stahl's "I'm running away from my Savior of Mankind destiny" attitude leaves him wallowing around without much sex appeal. Perhaps he will mature and show some Spartan grit in the next one.<br /><br />It's all about the casting and Loken is a fabulous find. She's got one expression and, like Robert Patrick, its "pure resolve." Loken is so definitively exact that the beating she takes from Arnold is not gender offensive.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Mostow has a lot of technical dazzle to get up on the screen, so character work and nuisances are secondary here. The action scenes are extreme and spectacular, as T-X, in a mammoth crane, destroys everything in a fifty-mile radius. This is the kind of havoc we, the "Shock and Awe Nation," expect.<br /><br />I'm thrilled The Terminator has left behind obeying a boy and taken charge of the future. And finally, Judgment Day has arrived. The expectation was killing me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>worth it when I saw it in theatres<br /><br />the name lives up to itself<br /><br />and the ending is quite shocking<br /><br />because wether or not they make another T movie or not I will always like T and T2 and this one.<br /><br />I would like to have them make a T4 movie. but wether or not they do I will be understanding. perhaps the ending of T3 lets us know there might not be left much to tell to the rest of Judgement day with the Machines. or that there is much to learn of it and we have yet to know it all truly. we shall see which way it goes. but either way this film is amazing. has alot of comedy in it. alot of action just as much as the first and second T films. Arnold does great at playing a relentless, soldier if you will to protect Conner. I would of liked to have Furlong play the grown up version of Conner but Nick Stahl works just as well. he reproduces the way John Conner is like in T2. curious, smart ass mouth talker, dangerous, and smart all in one. I like that he can reuse what Conner has even if someone else plays his role. Kristanna Loken is sexy and scary as her role. she's the perfect female terminatrix as they call her somewhere in the movie or story. I can't wait to see the other movies she was in before this or after this movie. the whole cast is brilliant. Johnathen Mostow is just as innovative as James Cameron is with his first 2 Terminator movies. he adds just as much shock, comedy etc as Cameron did. both directors should be proud of themselves. wether Cameron would of made this or Mostow. I still would of seen it. all directors deserve a chance when they create something. so glad I got this on dvd. the Sgt. Candy scene is hilarious. and you really learn alot on disc 2 about the special effects, etc. quite a great movie. saw it 1 time in theatre. and 5 times on dvd. it will be seen more times played in my dvd player when I can watch it. rest assured people</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I think that what makes this movie so great in the acting, in particular Claire Danes.

It promises another movie: the one telling the story about the ultimate victory.<br /><br />8) No resurrection of Linda Hamilton, and<br /><br />9) the absence of the wide-eyed-teenage-boy-wow-! element.<br /><br />10) No unnecessarily 'noble' characters. Just people who do what turn out to be very stupid things for reasons which are perfectly valid to them. (This is known as 'life' and thus believable.)<br /><br />11) The transition for the stereotypical notion of the 'mainframe'/hardware-based Skynet to the 'distributed', software-based kind (a transition symbolizing that from the industrial revolution into the information age) was a touch of genius, and provided a neat rationale for the theme of this movie.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />If AS becomes governor and canna do T4, it doesn't matter. Actually I hope he won't be able to do it. Stahl and Danes are quite suited to the job. It'll be a different story, but so what? It may be a _better_ story, and, for that matter, it might actually give the whole series a proper closure.<br /><br />I just hope they make the T4 story consistent. It won't be easy to convince me how a few straggly humans defeat a huge army of machines, all of whom operate without a centralized 'command'. The only device that leaps to mind is a virus-disinfectant, but that would be quite unoriginal and wouldn't provide much of a story...<br /><br />Just don't let Cameron loose on this. Please, please, not!<br /><br />Till Noever<br />Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP<br />owlglass.com</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The concept remains the same.  The T-101 model terminator (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) comes from the future to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future savior of the human race, from a more advanced model (Kristanna Loken) sent to destroy him.  This time, it happens simultaneously with the long-dreaded ascendance of Skynet and the revolt of the machines.<p>T3 lacks the freshness of T1 and the intelligence and human drama of T2, but it certainly delivers as a special-effects laden thrill ride.  It also benefits from some genuinely unexpected events toward the end of the film.  Very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I pride myself on my ability to sniff a bad movie out before it hits the screens. After seeing so many movies, reading so many magazines (like Time, Entertainment Weekly, and Cinescape) and listening to so many interviews, you start to realize before a picture even hits the theaters when something is wrong. <p>I'm also a big fan -- I helped create the Terminator: Future Fate D20 Modern campaign setting. What, you haven't gotten a copy? It's free! Go! Go right now and get it (under Freebies)! <p>With Terminator 3, my Spidey sense was tingling. <p>The majority of interviews all centered on "how great it is to work with Mr. Schwarzenegger." Uh huh. That's nice. Whenever a director talks about how great the movie is, I get suspicious. <p>Then there's the, "we've made a new Terminator and she's a BAAAAAAAABE!" This idea already hit the comics and novels. But really, why? Why make her a beautiful woman? Is this going to be The Hidden all over again? The Hidden was great -- but it gave a reason for why the bad guy took on a luscious female form. And don't even get me started on calling her a Terminatrix. <p>And why bring Arnie again? My idea, which was used in the Terminator series of novels out now, was to have Arnie play himself as a human character in present time who is the model for Terminators. Glad S.M. Sterling agrees it's a good idea. <p>So, with all those thoughts going through our heads, Maleficent and I took in a matinee. Whenever we suspect a movie might suck, we go to a matinee so we don't feel like we were suckered. And... <p>We were pleasantly surprised. Terminator 3 is really quite good. It is not as good, in my opinion, as Terminator 2. Maleficent liked Terminator 3 better (she hated the squeaky punk in Terminator 2). <p>This movie follows a T-X (get it, Terminator-X or Terminatrix, although that's a term used only by Connor) who has gone backwards in time to kill all the lieutenants of John Connor since Skynet can't find him. <p>Right away, we know something is different. The T-X has a blue lighting scheme. Her interface looks more like a Windows environment than the old red-code Terminators. She moves with the same eerie patience that the T-1000 did. For the most part, she's expresionless. When she reacts at all, it's disturbing. A scary, beautiful woman. Go figure. <p>The reason for the change is because the future has changed. Skynet's birth came and went. If you saw the last two movies, the world was supposed to have gone to nuclear war already. But thanks to Sarah, Judgment Day didn't happen. Not yet, anyway. <p>Arnold is unbelievably bulked up. I thought maybe they digitally inserted his head on a younger man's body. Nope -- it's him. Naked. 50 years old and the man is bulked. I fear anyone dating his daughters (does he even have daughters?). <p>The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It focuses on the chase scenes, the running combat between the two Terminators, and the slow recognition of the whole scary plot by Kate Brewster, John's future wife. <p>The movie makes several propositions, which I found interesting. For one, it implies that history is self-correcting. Although John didn't meet Kate right away, he met her again a decade later anyway. Although Skynet wasn't built as a mechanical fortress, it was created as a virus over the Internet instead. In short, the future is NOT what you make of it. It all HAS to happen. It's just a matter of WHEN. <p>The director, Jonathan Mostow, recognizes his core audience. We've all seen Terminator 2. We know how Arnie got his clothes last time. This time, he walks naked into a bar with another fat guy with another shotgun guarding the entrance...and he says without blinking an eye, "You're early, go around back." Now the audience is confused. Why isn't he surprised Arnie's naked? We get the answer in a strip club for ladies who are hooting and shouting at the stripper on stage -- who just happens to match Arnie's dimensions. You've got to appreciate a movie that's willing to laugh at itself. <p>Although it has an "R" rating, this movie isn't that gory. The moments of possible nudity are actually covered up (no, you don't get to see frontal nudity on the Terminatrix). Almost like they were trying hard to make it acceptable for parents to bring their kids to see it. Hmmm. <p>The ending is very well done. I say this a lot -- this is one of those movies that had the strength of its convictions. There's a logical, unpopular conclusion to the events going on in Terminator 3. The movie embraces them. <p>If you're looking for a good popcorn movie and want to see robots beat each other up, this is a film worth seeing. If you're a Terminator fan and want to see more adventures set in the wild and wacky timeline that is constitutes the Terminator universe -- this is a MUST SEE.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>In many ways, this movie reminded me a lot of Alien 3. After two smashing movies, the third fumbled to nowhere. Terminator 3 proves to be a weak movie because it had a weak story and it betrayed the original concept. After Terminator 2, the story should have basically ended, if not what was the purpose of that movie? If Judgment Day cannot be stop, only delayed, Skynet could have sent terminator after terminator to the past. The entire logic of the science fiction story would fall apart.<p>Second, this new bad terminator simply wasn't as powerful or nasty as the one in the second movie. Pretty girl but she bite the bullet pretty easily. Second, the director don't have James Cameron's touch for action and story telling all at the same time. He can only do one thing at a time and its showed.<p>Bad film editing in the movie. After all, how did that RV crew managed to get into the top secret Skynet Center just at the same time as the bad terminator got in. At least the bad terminator can disguised herself as anyone, how can John Conner and his buddies get in that easily of entrance??<p>If this was a stand alone movie, it would have been more enjoyable but as part of the series, it definitely fail to deliever and while everything about the film was technically well done, it totally failed in the most important aspect of any science fiction movie, the story!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Not bad, but inferior to the previuos ones."  That's what I thought after watching "T3: Rise of the Machines."  Jonathan Mostow did a very good job, but not as good as James Cameron.  Many people say many things about Cameron, but one thing is clear; he insists on his own vision.<p>That is sadly missing in this so-so sequel.  The story is basically the same as "T2": another super-robot is sent from the future to kill John Conner, who is supposed to be the savior of the world after the coming war between machines and humans, and another robot in the shape of Arnold Schwarznegger is also sent to protect him.  This time, however, things are a bit different, the film wants to say.<p>You can find no Cameron's signature -- no Linda Hamilton (that's a big minus); no unique idea like liquid-type super-killer of Robert Patrick, or no Edward Furlong.  Think about this, you know, these people all get famous after appearing in this series, and that's the proof that Cameron, who might be a director demanding too much, is good at inducing the actors to give 100% potentials.  And of course, Arnie, who became an instant star with "I"ll be back."<p>But Jonathan Mostow fails on this score; compared to Hamilton and Furlong, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are playing unimpressive characters, not credible as the hero and the heroine we can relate to.  Maybe I am too harsh, considering the fact that they replaced other players on short notice.  Anyway, all people should agree that they should not meet each otehr THAT way (no future hero should be kept up in that place like a dog.)  And about the new-comer Ms Loken as the new-type terminator, I thought she (it) doesn't look strong at all, giving too many gimmicks.  The filmmakers should have known that only one kind of weapon will do for truely strong heroes and villains (see the previous Terminators and all the characters in "X-Men").  <p>The actions themselvs are exciting, I can tell you, but you have to wait for it to hit the screen.  The film constantly shows something engaging, and the director, he says in an interview, intentionally keeps the running time within 2 hours.  Surely the film is action-packed.<p>This is a kind of a film producer Mario Kassar did in the 90s -- like "Universal Soldiers" -- no logics, good actions, and plenty of humor thrown in the plot.  The only difference is, I again say, no James Cameron.  If you still wondering whether you should watch it or not, think about this point first.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>The plot of "Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines" is no different from that of T2:  two cyborgs, one programmed to kill eventual savior John Connor and the other to protect him, are zapped through time.  This conflict, a classic chase scene set-up, comprises the entire movie.  Without the questions of ethics and the unpredictability of the future uses of technology explored in T2, T3 is all action and no substance.  This will delight many fans and disappoint others.<p>Nick Stahl as John Connor is an unlikely hero: nihilistic, hollow-eyed, and physically unimposing.  Claire Danes is exceptional in her role as the reluctant but fierce Kate who maintains her class even as she watches Schwarzenegger spit out a bullet.  Schwarzenegger plays his cyborg as he always has, with the same deadpan delivery whether he is expressing a horrific truth or poking fun at the previous films in the series.  I know a lot of people object to Kristianna Loken as the new T-X model, but I loved her.  She exhibits both the cold ambition of a machine and the tastes of a predator.<p>The action sequences are all high-gear, breathtaking excitement even if the logic of them isn't always clear.  The screenwriters have provided some hilarious moments to punctuate the tension, many of which refer to jokes established in T1 and T2.  The ending is both surprising and surprisingly original, the only solid plot in the movie.<p>If you are a Terminator fan, you must see this film.  Chase scene devotees and those with a hunger for pure action will love it.  The two hours pass quickly when you're gripping the arms of your chair, but don't expect to take anything away from this movie.  If you want even a modicum of substance with your action, skip this.  Four stars for the action, two for the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>With the 3rd part of the series now installed, The Terminator goes the full circle: from groundbreaking (T1) to braindead (T3).<br />  The only question that lingers painfully on after watching this disastrouly bad film is whether it's actually a parody of the previous 2 parts. If it is, then it fails at that too because funny it isn't either.<br />  But, if this is supposed to be taking itself seriously (and i'm afraid it does) then it fails even worse because there's absolutely nothing serious about it oncesoever:<br />  -a childish and sorry excuse for a script that never takes off, goes (inevitably) nowhere and finishes in noman's land..<br />  -acting for which you'd have to conduct some serious search to find it in as bad quality as it's found here<br />  -a braindead explosion-festival that looks like a sony-station game with little ambition, where the good wipe off the bad and vice versa leaving the audience with a functioning brain in total apathy..<p>  This is really a pity considering that T1 which kicked this series of films off was cutting-edge on many levels and T2 did follow up in a respectable manner. This one though is obviously just a cheap vehicle for making money. There is no &quot;edge&quot; here, as all the explosion fair has been seen before countless times, there's no extension of the plot from the previous &quot;Terminators&quot;, there's frankly nothing.<br />  There are some things though that are in fact impressive, indeed far more impressive than the &quot;effects&quot; which are actually a bad repetition of those in T2: that would be the fact that &quot;Arnie&quot; seems to speak worse and more unintelligible english the longer he's in America. I cant begin to imagine how that could be possible but several times through this &quot;film&quot; i caught myself thinking &quot;what was that, what did he say???&quot;<br /><br />It hardly matters of course as there's barely anything of remote importance being uttered in this joke of a film but i'm still wondering.<p>  As for the rest of the cast, I've seen real B-movies with far better acting than this. I'm saying B-movies, cuzz this is what T3 really is. A b-flick destined for the video-club sematary at best, allthough you'b wasting your money even if you simply rented this. As well as your time.<br />  Hopefully he won't &quot;be back&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>There is a line in this movie in which the Arnie Terminator says &quot;It is time.&quot;  I so wish that someone would have told the writers and director that BEFORE this movie came out.  That is to say, it would have been nice if they had been notified that the TERMINATOR story had run its course.<p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and T3 was made.  This movie should be used as &quot;Exhibit A&quot; as to what happens when a good idea is recycled one too many times.  Instead of continuing w/the excellent story of 1 &amp; 2, this one comes off as generic, tired and rather silly.<p>One of the problems lies in the fact that the T-1000 from T2 didn't give the writers anywhere to &quot;go&quot; to make the Terminator in this one even more impressive.  So, what they come up with are some absurdly far-fetched powers that don't coincide very well with logic.<p>The lone bright spot of this movie is Kristanna Loken.  She is most assuredly cast perfectly as the new Terminator.  She is  drop-dead gorgeous, has a fantastic athletic body and she also has that &quot;don't mess with me&quot; look.  Seeing her come thru the time portal naked might just be worth the price of renting this movie - but the storyline certainly isn't.<p>It is sad that this movie was so bad, as T1 was a classic and T2 was even better.  All T3 does is throw in a lot of ad hoc details that un-do everything that T2 did.  Apparently the film-makers thought that the ending was going to be a big &quot;surprise.&quot;  Anyone who half paid attention to the movie could predict what would happen 1/3 of the way in.  <p> Sadly, the theme of the movie is nearly as predictable as how bad it looked like it was going to be.  For all TERMINATOR fans out there, I would admonish you to watch T1 &amp; T2 over and over again, but skip this one entirely.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>I am going to talk about the writing of this film, as there are 700 + reviews about Arnold, etc.<br /><br />First of all, there are two plots sandwiched together here. One is that of the Terminatrix, and the other is of Judgement Day. The two have little to do with one another. The fact that they happen within the same 24 hours, is not, and I repeat, is not a key element in the story, even if the writers try to trick you into thinking it is.<br /><br />I believe the Terminatrix female is a disaster. In her red leather suit, her overly-emotive head tilts etc., it's high camp, and often non-sensical (why would she jump onto the hearse when she could just blow it away with the plasma cannon?)... This portion of the film is a very pale shadow of the first two villains; and it is the driving force of the action portions of these films.<br /><br />The second plot involves the capitulation of America's Armed Forces over to Skynet, and I think this was accomlished quite well. I give any movie credit that pulls of a science fiction feat of this magnitude with such aplomb. Nick Stahl greatly assists in making this conceit believable. This is the true story of the film, and makes for all of the best scenes, including the excellent twist at the end. By then, the Terminatrix is just an afterthought.<br /><br />I would, however, like to point out some pretty big flaws:<br /><br />Nick Stahl seeking refuge in the clinic the same night that the Terminators come back to town, only to meet up with Claire Danes... is a ridiculous coincidence that is not a predicate to the story working properly; it is necessary just to get them together.<br /><br />Remember, that he meets up with her less than 24 hours before the end of the world, the same day the Terminators are sent back in time... when of course they could have been sent back at any time...catch my drift?<br /><br />Why would the Terminatrix want to assassinate the General? Answer: because or else she would not be in the final action scenes. He is not one of Connor's lieutenants and he was unable to stop Skynet's reign in any scenario. BAD.<br /><br />How could the kids escape in that Cessna with battle drones all over the place launching missles, etc?<br /><br />I do think that it makes sense that John Connor became important precisely because he met Claire Danes and her dad is this General. Otherwise he would just be a valley kid. But, this is not really explained clearly. And we would need a lot more backstory to make this element work.<br /><br />Overall, some great ideas that are not fully developed. I think most people who saw the film just sai "hey cool" and let these big loopholes go unpunished.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>People have waited 12 long years for this sequel.  Of course, you really should see The Terminator (1984) and  Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) to truly get the full story and know what has happened before to understand the present movie.<br />  The most incredible real-story is Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger and how timely this movie was.  After the release of this film, five weeks later Arnold Schwarzenegger announced on "The Tonight Show" that he was in the running to be a candidate for Governor of California.  It was the ultimate surprise.  The news media, the reporters and Republicans too were all excited.<br /><br />  On October 7, 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger won the Recall Election giving him a three-year term as the next Governor of California. He won again in 2006. Governor Schwarzenegger has decided not to work as an actor in films any more.<br /><br /> This 2-disc DVD set offers alot of interesting featurettes.  Two of them are of Arnold during some comedy for you.  There is a goof reel too.  You can choose a selected scene and pick the special effects you want to add.  Then see the clip of the scene play out the way you created it.<br /><br />  Followed by:<br />  ***"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Cronicles" tv series (2008-09)  The story is set after the ending of Terminator 2. The show is now in its second season.<br /><br />  ***Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins (2009). Christian Bale as "John Connor".</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>It has been said that a second movie in a series is never as good as the first and that it usually ends up being the worst. In this series, that has proven to be the opposite of what has happened. While the first film was the most imaginative, the second used that as a jumping point and added some spectacular effects and action. This movie attempts to do the same and fails.<br /><br />For those who have been cave dwellers for a while, the terminator is a robot from the future sent back in time to kill John Connors, the man who will one day lead a rebel revolt against the machines of the future. So much for movie one.<br /><br />Movie two had a second more advanced robot come back to kill Connors but also a copy of the original robot come back programmed by Connors to save himself. Movie two.<br /><br />This time around, Connor's mother has passed away and he is on his own, trying to do his best not to get caught up in anything that might change the future and result in his having to be the savior of the world. Yeah, like that's gonna happen.<br /><br />A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time by the robots of the future to destroy not only John Connors (this time portrayed by Nick Stahl) but those who will become his staff as well when the final battle comes. The T-X gets a good start on this killing off a few when she encounters John along with one time friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). With two for the price of one in her sights, she attacks.<br /><br />Too bad that Connors sent back another terminator to prevent this from happening. Yes, it's the old model played by Arnold Schwarzenegger that comes to help. But he is obviously no match for the updated model sent to kill and destroy.<br /><br />As Connors and Brewster get reacquainted with one another while on the run, the Hollywood stuntman's association garners a major paycheck as tons of automobiles are blown to bits and stunt men dresses as Arnold are slammed through various buildings. This movie is more about action and explosions than any real science fiction.<br /><br />No one wonders why it is that robots keep being sent back which means that the future never changed after all. If it had, why are they here now? And the reason they came about explained in the second film is given little validity if there is another way that the future could have yielded these monstrous machines.<br /><br />The acing is...well....who really knows since acting is not the reason to watch this movie. It does look well made, I'll give it credit for that. But it is one of the most hollow films I have seen I a long time. While I cared about Connors as well as his robot protector in the second film, I found myself not giving a hoot for anyone here. Rather than being thrilled and awed, I was bored.<br /><br />A sequel, to be a good one, should cover new ground and take us somewhere just a little bit different. This movie is a rehash of the last one without new dazzling effects or enough emotion to ring us in. It substitutes roaring explosions for the matters of the heart that made us enjoy the last film.<br /><br />One had to hope that with this film the franchise would die. But it didn't as the release of the new television series proved. Even the surprise ending was one that didn't really matter much by the time it was revealed. If you are a die hard fan, by all means watch. But make sure you watch the first two again and you will see where this one was lacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the high velocity sequel to the original Terminator (1984), set an extremely high standard for the Terminator franchise.  Even so, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003), directed by Jonathan Mastow (U-571, Breakdown), is very worthy addition to this science fiction saga.  The hard hitting sequel, concentrates on spectacular straight ahead action, while advancing the Terminator story to the infamous `judgment day'.<br /><br />Terminator 3 incorporates many of same basic elements from the previous films, particularly T2.  In his last action role before becoming the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns again as a different model of the Terminator, once again sent back into the past, tasked with protecting John Connor (Nick Stahl).  A killer T-X Terminator, played by the striking Kristanna Loken, is sent back in time, with a list of humans to be terminated.  As in T2, the T-X is an upgraded version of terminator, constructed of liquid metal, that can change its physical form to mimic anyone it comes in contact with.  In addition, the T-X can control other machines.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is John Connor's future wife, is also on the T-X's hit list.  Circumstances bring all the major players together, at Brewster's veterinary clinic, where the Terminator and the T-X have their first encounter, starting a thrilling and relentless chase, that lasts for the remainder of the film.  Special effects are a major component, and with people like Stan Winston involved, they are generally spectacular, and executed at an extremely high level.<br /><br />The story may be a familiar one, but the effectiveness of the tale is enhanced by some strong performances.  Some might argue that playing the Terminator may not require great acting skills, but few can match Arnold Schwarzenegger's huge screen presence, in this physically demanding role.  Borrowing from Robert Patrick's performance in T2, the striking Kristanna Loken plays a heartless killing machine with a feminine form.  She also has very few lines, as like Schwarzenegger, her role depends heavily on her athletic skills and physical presence.  It is quite an impressive performance, as clad in a dark red leather suit, and looking like a young Anne Francis, Loken is quite convincing as Arnold's physical equal.<br /><br />Last minute hire Claire Danes, handles her role well, as a character that goes through major transformations, and suffers the loss of loved ones.  Now in his 20's, John Connor is far from a world saving hero.  Nick Stahl is an interesting choice for this intriguing character, who does not seem very capable of fulfilling his destiny.<br /><br />Working largely from a very successful template, and featuring outstanding special effects, director Jonathan Mostow does a very competent job of executing a script that features a nice blend of familiar story elements, and some new twists.  Things are a bit rushed at the end, and the conclusion is somewhat anticlimactic, and uncertain, with the future in the hands of a somewhat shaky John Connor.  An exciting and violently fun adventure, Terminator 3 is a solid addition to any action film fan's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Okay...bad choice for directors, this guy Jonathan Mostow (Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers, U-571) is not he kind of director for this kind of films. The film looked very broad and wide...but it had very little in it.<p>First off, my favorite is Terminator 2 - wonderful story and direction by James Cameron (Titanic, The Abyss). The Terminator is also very very good as well. And for its time, budget and limited technically resources for its time in the 80's - it's a very well put together film, story and performances.<p>Terminator 3 - lacks an interesting story and is not character based. Just one action and destruction sequence after another and another and another. The premise carries the story to its ultimate ending of the Macines getting their way in the future. An infinite loop of Terminators. Big Deal.h<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger (Gov of California, True Lies, Twins, Pumping Iron) tried to make good of his image but I am sure was drawn to the project for the money. The script he must have seen was week and the fact that James Cameron was not involved should have said to the producers...why?<p>The twist in this one is a metal morphing dripping changing female villain played by Kristanna Loken (Academy Boys, Panic) who is not that clever or interesting. Claire Daines (The Hours, Romeo &amp; Juliet) makes an honest effort to do something with her role...but everything is so uninteresting - she tries. Even the recasting of John Conner by Nick Stahl (Bully, Thin Red Line) should have been a clue.<p>The film lacks story, James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and isn't the same....sorry, but it really is not that interesting and they now have killed the franchise all togtehr. But the new Govenor will be busy with other things now. Good luck Govenor Schwarzenegger! (11-12-03)</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>When I first heard about this movie I wondered what in the world they were going to do with the plot.  The first one was fresh and has become a touchstone of the popular culture.  The second one had so many wonderful and fantastic effects that you can forgive the plot for being a tweaked version of the first (with really cool tweaks).  Well, what they did was remove most of the requirement for a plot by making the killing machine absolutely relentless, hopelessly advanced, and who has maybe 100 words in the whole movie.  She is just there to chase and kill and then be squashed.  Kristanna Loken is effective in this role, but I don't find her as menacing as Robert Patrick was.  Her face is so controlled that you never get a sense of power.  You SEE the power and she is playing a machine after all, but there you have it.<p>Arnold reprises his role as a third identical robot (as close as you can be to identical 10 years down the road) and he does it quite well.  But he too is given few words.  Some of the jokes he gets are pretty good, but a couple of them are groaners.<p>The stunts are visually very powerful, but the bigger your screen the better they will look.  Some of them are so large that the actors almost disappear on a small TV screen.  <p>Nick Stahl is OK as a whacked out John Connor, but he seems to be panting in every scene.  Does he have a breathing problem?  Clair Danes is the best thing in the movie.  She is terrific.<p>The DVD extras are OK. There is a pretty funny scene where Arnold plays the soldier who was used as the model for the robot soldiers that became the terminators.  I don't know if it was made for the movie and taken out or just made as a joke, but it is memorable, but would have drastically altered the tone and pace of the movie as it is.  There are out takes, a special on the action figures for adults that is weirdly commercial but interesting at the same time, some stuff on the T3 video game, the HBO show that you have probably already scene and the customary voice over tracks by the director and another with some of the actors.<p>I enjoyed the movie and realize it isn't as powerful as the first two.  For what it tried to be it is very well done.  We hoped for more and were a bit disappointed that we weren't blown away.  But as I have thought about what is really there, I think it is OK for what it aimed at being.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The action is so mechanical and extreme as to amount to a parody of the earlier films. Violent action is no substitute for a good story. Scenes with mechanical machines going wild are implausible. But they provide a car chase like you're never seen before. Could that truck have so much kinetic energy to do that much damage and keep on moving? NO, you would need a freight train. The petite young blond terminatrix seems like a match for the Terminator. (Is this some kind of feminist message or a retelling of Genesis?)<br /><br />This film seems like a down-market version of the earlier films. The "network down" events suggest a fragility of modern life unknown in the past. The flight to the countryside reminds me of the actions of people during medieval plagues. When there is dialogue, as at the mausoleum, it is not first rate. "Don't do that." The special effects are certainly better than in the earlier films. The shape imitation in this film recalls the old horror films (like "The Wolfman"). What is original about this film?<br /><br />Next we learn that "Judgment Day" will occur in a few hours. Nuclear war will wipe out most people! There is a philosophical question in this film. Can the future affect the past? Orwell's "1984" said those who control the present control the future. But only in a fantasy can the future control the past. Those are just idealistic terms, the past is always gone. The present always determines the future, even if we don't understand how.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>This 2-disc Special Edition DVD has some of the best features that I have ever seen on a DVD. This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Science Fiction movies that I have ever seen. The performances are excellent as are the direction and script. You can tell that the producers of both the movie and the Special Edition really dedicated themselves to their tasks.  This is important because there are so many 2 disc "special edition" DVD's out there that when you really get right down to it, just are not all that special.</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>I was very impressed with all the action in this movie.

NOT A KIDS MOVIE!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>While the first couple of Terminator films were by no means great works of art, they'll seem like "Citizen Kane" compared to this unrelentingly tedious sequel.  Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as a "good" Terminator, once again sent into the past to stop an assassination by a "bad" Terminator (Aryan poster girl Kristanna Loken) that will change the future.  Or will it?  Never mind trying to make sense of what is going on on or why this film contradicts its predecessor, the plotting and dialogue are the stuff of 13-year-old imaginations, which is to say that lots of things happen but without the requisite character interactions to make you care anyway.  Instead, there are plenty of explosions and shoot `em ups, orchestrated by director Jonathan Mostow without the energized, pornographic attention to detail that talented schlockmeisters like James Cameron can bring to bear.  Nick Stahl, who looks so much like the lead in "Malcolm in the Middle" I expected him to break wind, is a better John Connor than the irritating Edward Furlong, but that isn't saying much.  Once promising TV star Clare Danes vacillates between stupid and annoying in her portrayal of a veterinarian who is, well, stupid and annoying - in fairness to her, the script does give her such gems as "Oh, my god" and "Let me out of here!" for banter.  Despite all the money spent on this film, it seems rather half-baked, and even the noisy climax in some relatively impressive sets will lull you into a stupor.  One of the few redeeming qualities, though, is to watch Schwarzenegger obviously age from the slathered-in-makeup, perhaps digitally revised figure he is at the start of the film.  Maybe they'd exhausted the budget for such niceties by the middle of filming.  "Terminator 3" might please less discriminating viewers, but anyone looking for an edge-of-your-seat thriller would be advised to look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>I'm going to try to make this review short and sweet. I loved the movie. I don't want to release much of the story, because I don't want anydody that hasn't seen it, to miss out on it. <p>This was a well made movie. It had a lot of anticipation. The special affects are great, the action is great, the acting is great.<p>I'd have to say what I was really disappointed with in the movie was the T-X. They just didn't do enough with her. In Terminator and T2 the Terminator's have this swagger. You just never though they'd kill those suckers. When they did you almost had a sense of relief come over you. The TX never has that swagger. You don't ever really think she's gonna get them. Your more pre-occupated on wether they will stop Judgement Day from happening. <p>Thats my only knock on the movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot. Arnold once again shows that he's the greatest action hero of all time. If you liked the previous Terminator movies, you'll like this. If you like science fiction or action movies, you'll like Terminator 3. If you like arnold you'll definetly like it. It's just a good movie. Not much else I can say.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Picture seeing something so drastically terrifying that it constantly plays within the ring tones of your mind, terrorizing not only your waking thoughts but also your dreams. Now imagine that these were thoughts of a world where machines actually step past the point of being machines and not thinking, actually questioning their service to man, and where they decide that they aren't expendable anymore. Now picture knowing that this was not some form of fiction, having actually tasting the proof as it first tried to terminate you before you were born and then came for you again, when you were older, only in a different form. If you can grasp that straw, holding it in front of you and contemplating the way that would taste, then you can somewhat understand the life that John Conner has been living. Still, that's all in the past, right? After the Governator went back in time and saved us all from the horrors of Skynet and the machines taking over in T-2, everything was fine. Well, not quite.<p>I went into T-3 perhaps not expecting a lot, but I was hoping that my 174 million dollar budget would perhaps deliver a punch that would top the last two installments. It seemed possible considering the lineup, with Arnold at the helm and a creative special effects team backing it. And it did that, too. Unfortunately, the amount of effects and bringing Arnold back into the fray for another round were two of the problems the movie suffered from and that took away from throwing me over the top.<p>This isn't to say that the house wasn't brought down in parts with those effects, because some of those wonders were amazing to behold. Watching all the little pieces of destruction, the carnage upon carnage, was interesting - at first. I actually liked the amount of sheer destruction and cold-blooded killing that happened, some of those scenes MASSIVE entertaining, but then the storyline started trying to work me back to Skynet and I kept thinking that I've already been here and done that. In fact, I had watched it quite a few times and was assured that Skynet would be brought down.  And then it started looking a lot like T-2 again, the thing chasing perhaps a LOT better looking but still an upgrade, and I kept noticing little flaws here and there. Yes, in some parts the effects were REALLY noticeable, not burying themselves smoothly enough. Some places actually looked blurred, with the size of the body being flung a little off or the digital blur not exactly human or machine enough, making you think of one word. Cheap. In a 172 million dollar film, I shouldn't ever think that. Still, some other stuff - the use of a crane and some of those lovely Terminator models coming to life - made up for that. <p>The second flaw was Arnold and his delivery. While nobody would say that he is expected to give a stellar job as the Terminator, I expect certain things. No emotions would be one, no yelling instead of taking his all-too-lovingly murderous time is another, and he did both of these a little herein. He didn't exactly seem motivated, like he knew his money was in the bag and that he didn't have to work for it, and that was somewhat annoying. The moves weren't done as well this time around, almost as if he was jogging through the motions and not putting his all into the film, and I found myself annoyed and looking to the back-up actors/actresses. A Terminator movie and I found myself drifting because of the Terminator! That honestly took a lot away from my experience and was a shame, too. Its a good thing the rest of the cast pulled it back from the edge. <p>I suppose it depends on what you want out of this film. If you want the redundant heartbeat recaptured for you, letting you experience T-2 with a darker ending, then this would be something you would like. If you can ignore some of Arnold in it, letting the little glitches in the persona get by you, then its all the better. As much as I complain about it and point out the negative aspects, I still see the result as something to watch a few times, noting the newer machines and the wholesale death being rained upon the stage. Honestly, its hard for me to tire of that effect.  <p>Also, the Sgt. Candy scene, the only deleted piece besides the gag reel, did actually make me laugh and gave the T-1 models a little backstory. So, there was something here besides a lot of mayhem.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is the best Terminator movie yet! I thought TX was not only a grand villainess, but she also was beautiful and everything an evil terminator should be. I loved the perfect fights and superb tension this film had, and Arnold's second Terminator hero was even better than the one in Terminator 2-Judgement Day(which I own the extreme DVD of, I should add!)There was more humor in this movie than in the first two, as well. Anyway, nuff said! This movie is a must-see for all who like Terminator or any action thrillers!</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>1. you have only 1 original character return to the series. 2. You kill off the 2nd main character (sara connor).  3. You replace the 3rd important character (sara's son) with an actor so bland your praying he gets terminated quickly.  4. Then shoot the whole mess in someone's back yard without the spectacular special effects that made this series so watchable.  I'll never know why Arnold didn't insist that the original cast be reunited one last time to finish off the story intact.  Well, whatever, I'm sure it was a money/greed decision.  I rarely like these kind of movie series, but, this one had heart and personality.  Too bad and too sad.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Read part 1 on the T3 DVD and part 2 of the review is on the Terminator 3 Swordfish double feature reviews. So yes I said I loved the ending and this film is bad but ain't that bad they had good action scences and a killer ending you got to see Judgement Day the  music playin is great  the songs called radio it's the only reason to get the sh***y soundtrack. While Nick Sthal blew chunks as John Connor his voiceover while Judgement Day is happening sends chills to your spine that's the only good thing about Sthal playing John Connor Schwarzenegger was the only good casting it's not Christina Lokken's fault that the T X was a mediocre villan it's the cliche script by JD Brancato & Micheal Ferris who I don't respect. They also wrote the script Terminator Salvation which comes  out next week I'm happy that we have no Nick Sthal as John Connor Christan Bale will be cool I like him alright he's a pretty good Batman. Linda Hamilton will narrate the movie no Claire Daniels. PG13 makes me a little nervous though</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Though the casting is perfect (Arnold again in his trademark role, Kristanna Loken as the sexy and equally as destructive "female" cyborg, and Nick Stahl appropriately looking like the spawn of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn) and the direction and pacing is tight and relentless, the DVD provides insight into the technical artists that are responsible for the fantastic effects of the movie, along with the preceding films in the franchise.<br /><br />The second DVD in the compilation profiles Stan Winston, visual effects director, and his talented staff as they explain the many "tricks" of the trade in the making of this movie.<br /><br />Though it might be a bit disconcerting to discover the process behind "movie magic," just revelations are informative to those that are really into the technical aspects of filmmaking.<br /><br />Much has changed in the almost twenty years since the first film was made and this sequel; and the filmmakers are anxious to explain the "how's" and "why's" of said change.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>I'd almost like to give this movie 3.5 stars...but not enough to upgrade my overall rating to 4 stars. The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new "John Connor."<br /><br />What I really hated was how the "Good" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind.<br /><br />Not a great way to "end" the series if this is, indeed, Arnie's last foray into the Terminator world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>The hype of this movie has been pretty low key. Arnold has gone out and done some interviews (actually, I think he's using this movie to sell his bid for the Governor job in California), but little else has been said.<br /><br />It is ten years later and the expected holocaust that Sarah Conner had nightmares of never happened. However, John cannot seem to let it go and is leading a hobo life in anticipation that Skynet will one day become aware. It becomes reality as a new terminator is sent back to destroy John Connor and his future lieutenant in order to rewrite history while the rebellion sends back their own terminator to protect him. This time, not only is John's life on the line, but also the lives of the world as the new Terminatrix prepares for the arrival of her master, the Skynet AI. It will be up to John and the old T101 (and his future wife Kate Brewster) to prevent that from happening.<br /><br />This movie is a hack in many regards and the source it steals from most is T2: Judgment Day. From the fact that there are two Terminators in a showdown to the fact that Arnold has to have the Ray-ban glasses, much of this movie can be seen in the previous movie. However, this time, Arnold is less the nurturing machine to the man-child John and more the sarcastic killing sidekick. Only Arnold has the one liners in this movie and he does say them with the relish he can get away with under his emotionless exterior. Another movie this borrows from is from the Matrix (even though the series came out 13 years earlier) but more in fact, the Animatrix. Of course, you can also say that the movie also stole from the Forbin project back in the 1970's. It sees a time, where there is no AI mainframe, where the computers will attack from the world wide web, which is different from the movies which also tried to characterize a supercomputer (HAL 9000) adversary as a physical box which could be overcome. The way that T3 falls is more like tha Anime movies like Ghost in the Shell where AI consciousness is gained in a global web.<br /><br />Going back to Animatrix, T3 follows the stories in that short stories DVD that reflect the human history and their war with the AI. It is similar (As with the Forbin Project) that human's are deemed as a threat to their existence and need to be wiped out. This movie portrays this fairly well.<br /><br />Another movie series this rips from is the "Planet of the Apes" series. Like those four movies which do a full circle and come around, the Terminator movies also do the same, and that's why I really liked the depressing ending. Some people think that the ending opens up for a fourth Terminator movie where it would end with Reese (Michael Biehn) going back in time to save the original Sarah. I guess the take of T3 will decide that.<br /><br />The acting is done well in most regards. Claire Danes, who plays the spunky Kate is almost unrecognizable (she always plays this weepy girly girl character) and is pretty good with the material she's given. Arnold seems to have this role down pat and is on cruise control. It is remarkable that in 20 years, his body has not changed much. Nick Stahl does a great job playing John Connor, but he does not look like the hero, resemble or carry himself like the John Connor first Terminator movie. For some reason that did bother me. However, even though he will always be ADD boy from "Man without a Face" he gets the aimless man with a mission thing down good and comes off much better than the whiny kid that was portrayed by Edward Furlong in T2. Kristanna Loken does a fantastic job as the TX, much better than the T1000 played by Robert Patrick in the second movie. All she is required to do is run, fight and look unemotional and she pulls it off well. Of course, this doesn't mean that she can act, but for this role, she knew what it requred.<br /><br />The main fault of this movie is not that is more of a classic big-budget movie, but it is an old style movie that has no flair or panache. Maybe I'm still being wowed by effect heavy or "slow mo in every frame" fare like charlie's Angels or the Matrix where every action frame has to stand out on their own, or epics like the "Lord of the Rings" where the computer devises thousands of enemies to fight the heroes, but this movie seems to be a little small. Take the scene where John is being followed by the TX and 4 cars she is controlling. 5 years ago, that would have been an amazing scene with ET and Extra doing round the clock interview on how they could destroy a building with an industrial crane, nowadays, it's like: "What, they didn't use a computer?" However, Mostow films it a little to matter of factly, no overhead shots, no wide angle shots. It's actually fairly choppy, like the whole chase scene (which actually looked better planned out than the Matrix car chase). Everything in this movie has a low budget feel to it and it is because this movie is relic of action movies past.<br /><br />However, saying that, as an older movie watcher, I did like the action scenes and I felt the movie did go at a quick enough pace. I feel that the movie didn't really with the issue of "Should John risk it and go and fight to save the present? Or Hide and know he will save the future?" That could have been an interesting premise. Anyway, compared to the Matrix Reloaded and Charlies Angels, this one is the best of the bunch and will provide a good time that exists slightly above the those who like their movies brain DOA....Rating: B-<br /><br />PS: In all these movies, how come the good guy doesn't come like several days ahead and take care of the situation?</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Well, this movie obviously isn't as good as the first two but it's still a pretty good movie. I mean, without James Cameron, it obviously couldn't be as good as it should have.<br /><br />The movie has basically the same plot as the others with one person sent from the future to protect someone and one person sent from the future to kill that person. In this one, Arnold is sent from the future to protect Kate, the would be wife of John Connor. But he must protect both of them but can only take orders from Kate. In the meantime, the female TX is sent back to kill her. So, there's going to be some rumble.<br /><br />The movie has awesome special effects and some good action scenes. The famous chase is great and the action is nonstop. But, in this one, Arnold actually tries to be funny. His line "talk to the hand" was just hilarious but I like it better when he makes me laugh on accident. So strap yourself in for a god movie with great special effects and good action. The movie isn't as good as the first 2 but blows away must # 3s in a series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Not being a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I hadn't seen the previous Terminator movies.  I have to say that this movie wasn't all that bad.  John Connor, now an adult, is living in fear of the events that took place at a young age.  On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit, the T-X, (Kristanna Loken) arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines.  The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, that is sent back by the human resistance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>You have to give Arnold credit---as he ages, he does so gracefully and although the lines and wrinkles on his face are noticeable, he manages to have a pretty buff body for a California governor.  Director Jonathan Mostow, who gave us "Breakdown" sets the pace extremely well in this no-nonsense, shoot em up, bang em up thriller.  Beautiful Kristina Lokken is a formidable foe for Arnie in this one, and she evinces both the menace and heartlessness of this killing machine sent back from the future to try and kill good old John Connor (Nick Stahl, this time).  Claire Danes as a pretty veterinarian assistant gets hooked into the fray, and it's non-stop action from there on.  Although this is an excellently done movie (the effects are mind-boggling), it may be time to retire this series, as it seems Connor is at the point in the movie where it all started a century ago!!!  But undeniably a butt-kicker!</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie has a finality about it and coinciding with Arnold been selected to become the Governor of California definitely puts the nails in the coffin once and for all.  Here, The Director manages to convey to the audience about the inevitable, that is irrespective of how much young John O'Connor tried to avoid Judgement Day, he can't change his destiny.  Here, we are introduced to his future wife, in the form of feisty Claire Dane from &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; fame.  These days, it seemed like all action movies tried to outdo one another in car chase scenes as we have witnessed in Matrix Reloaded, Bad Boys 2, 2Fast 2 Furious, and what we have here is just as good, if not better than the one in Judgement Day.  A lot of my mates told me that Judgement Day is simply a more superior offering.  I concurred to certain extent.  Perhaps, this movie lacked of James Cameron's clinical direction of the movie but Jonathan Mostow opted not to go head to head with James' style.  Rather, he went for the joyride, pop-corn style with lots of actions and memorable but hillarious one-liners.  I disagree with some critics who said that this is simply a repetition of Judgement Day with the nemesis replaced by a female version.  On the contrary, I see this movie completely from a different light.  Rather, it's simply an entertaining movie that promised to deliver &amp; it delivered well.  Definitely enjoyable to watch &amp; a movie that I wouldn't hesitate recommend to other viewers!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I Saw and Have TERMINATOR and T2, and I also have the DVD's of Both ,Including the First release of the Special Edition ( Actually 2 copies, one unopened in a Metal Case, and the one I use in a Silver Cardboard Pack).<br />I thoroughly Enjoyed T3.<br />It's all Set up for a Franchise, and with any Luck Either Arnold, or someone else ( Please God not the &quot;Rock&quot;) Will Carry on the Series.<p>Hopefully the Script and Director for T4 will be better, but... It's a Blast, and the Sergeant Candy scene is full on funny.<p>No Deep Meaning, just a Standard set of Blow em up, shoot em out fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Interesting that the three Terminator installments have come about a decade apart from each other.  The first came out in 1984, the second in 1991, and this third one in 2003.  After the very successful first film, the series exploded with the sequel, a film which was better than the original (very difficult for a sequel to do).  The second movie introduced us to some different special effects, as Arnold was now the good guy, and the new villain was made of &quot;liquid metal&quot;, and could morph himself into anything he touched.<p>Now, in this excellent third chapter, we have a similar situation.  Arnold is again the hero, with a villain who is more advanced than him.  This time it is a woman(Kristanna Loken) who can not only morph into what she touches, she has a right arm which can turn into just about any weapon you want, and she can control machines remotely.  The goal of the second two movies is the same, kill John Conner or those associated with him.  <p>The movie is missing Linda Hamilton, as Sarah Conner, and real life husband James Cameron as director.  Edward Furlong as John Conner in T2 is Nick Stahl.  Furlong is not missed at all.  Stahl does a credible job with John Conner as a late teenager who thinks the work he did in T2 has saved the world.  Wrong.  Claire Danes plays a veterinarian who gets caught up in the madness and who may play an important role later.<p>The absolute highlight of the movie is an early chase sequence involving all involved.  Danes and Stahl are in a pickup truck, Arnold is on his customary motorcycle, and Loken gives chase in a huge crane and destroys half the city.  At one point she drops the crane and wipes out an entire side of a road.  There's so much carnage it's funny.<p>This brings us to the conclusion, which I will not reveal.  I will say that while some sequels leave open the possibility for another installment, this one all but demands it.  The ending is logical and unlike most Hollywood productions, not happy.  It is subdued, but appropriate and I congratulate the filmmakers for this conclusion.  In short I am looking forward to the fourth film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>T3 was released ten years after the massive blockbuster T2.  Times have changed in the U.S. since 1992.  It is good that the hype and anticipation was not as big for the third installment as it was for T2, because the decent T3 would have been a terrible letdown.<p>T3 has a cute 'lil Terminatrix kicking outdated Arnold's a**.  The young man John Connor, who is more surly now than he was as a teen, is dragged all over kingdom come against his wishes.  He just wants to be left alone.  He does not want to be anyone's saviour.  Claire Danes is there to keep him in line along with Arnold.  <p>There is a fine line in films between being dark, and being depressing.  T3 is dark, but it comes near the line.  In essence, T3's message is that you cannot escape your fate, no matter how hard you try.  The only thing you can do is deal with it.  It really makes you think, which bespeaks well for the film.  I think a T4 is in order to bring back some of the hope for humanity that this third film took away from the first two films, and indeed that the last ten years have taken away from the innocent early '90's in this country.  Arnold looks physically wonderful in this movie, hardly different from the second film. He is an inspiration to all.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>Obvously its not over. Skynet still gets built. Judgement Day is still going to happen, nothing has changed. This movie is still in someways a rehash of T2, but it keeps the series alive. John is safe one more time. More explosions, more destruction, more, more, more. This movie is still a thrill ride, and a good one to own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>This third installment of the Terminator series is a demonstration that a theme for a sequence of movies often simply expires from exhaustion after the third time. What made the second movie so entertaining beyond the special effects was the relationship between Arnold as the good Terminator and the young John Connor. The Terminator evolved into a father figure, sworn to protect John, willing to terminate in order to keep him alive. The bad Terminator was very powerful, yet had some vulnerabilities so that humans, particularly Sarah Connor, could join the battle. In this case the bad Terminator is so powerful that not even Arnold can stand against her for long. Although having a female Terminator was a welcome change from the previous ones.<br /> In this movie, there is great action, but it dominates and it is action to cover up the lack of the good dialog and relationships in the first two movies. The high points are the references to the previous Terminator movies; the scene with the sunglasses is the best by far, although if you have not seen the first two versions, you will not see the humor in the situations. I found this movie to be a disappointment, the action is there but the previous movies also involved relationships that are lacking in this case.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>Edit: For once warner actually heard the voices of America and did something about that mess. I received a replacement blu "fixed" of those problems. I am giving it an extra star for that!<br /><br />If you use that, it's the only way to watch the show in 1080p. If you just played it, it'll go straight into 1080i! I really regret this purchase and wait a response from warner on that issue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>In the era of CGI as a substitute for story-telling - an era ironically given birth by this film's predecessor - Terminator 3 is a refreshing departure.  Certainly there are enough explosions, chases, gunfire, and jaw-dropping CGI effects to satisfy the visceral desire for excitement, but T3 also features memorable dialog, a well-constructed plot, and a philosophically satisfying answer to the question of determinism vs. free will posed by the first two films.  <p>James Cameron's lack of involvement with this production is actually a plus: like Steven Spielberg, he can't resist the urge to pull heartstrings by sometimes force-fitting contrived "touching" situations.  Termitator 2 is a terrific movie, but I still wince when Schwartzenegger's T-101 says "I understand now why you cry.  But it's something I can never do."  Some people found that moving.  I just thought it was corny.<p>Director Jonathan Mostow is, by contrast, more even-handed, if less technically astute (Cameron has a degree in physics).  Even the humorous bits ("Talk to the hand", the running sunglasses gags) come off as organic.  He is a skilled action director who doesn't ignore the human aspects of his story, and takes great pains to integrate them seamlessly with the genre tropes we have all come to expect. <p>The performances by Nick Stahl as John Connor (taking over for the troubled Edward Furlong), Claire Danes (radiant as his love interest), Kristanna Loken as the ultimate dominatrix-model terminator, and the ageless Arnold Schwartzenegger are top-notch.  Danes' performance is especially impressive when you consider that she was cast in the film and started shooting with literally no time to prepare.<p>Mostow's take on the story is less about the evil of big corporations like Cyberdyne, than about the destructive qualities of human nature amplified to apocalyptic proportions by our own machines.  For me, that is really the heart of the Terminator mythology, and he hits his target dead-on with an ending that is as poignant as it is surprising for a summer action flick.<p>The DVD is well produced. The extras are mixed, with a so-so making-of documentary, a fairly funny gag reel, and a sleep-inducing attempt at an interactive special-effects lab.  It could have done without most of them.  <p>The reason to buy the film is not the extras; it's the film itself, which, for the completist, belongs without apology next to the first two films on your DVD shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Terminator 3 lacks the inventiveness of T1 and the style and panache of T2; however, T3 is ultimately a very gratifying entry in the series.  The movie opens as a sexy female Terminator (Terminatrix) arrives from the future and begins systematically eliminating people (much of it off-camera - the movie is not especially gory).  As with the shape-shifter from T2, the Terminatrix has some ingenious new features.  Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as John Connor, now age 20.  He's been on the move since T2 and the subsequent death of his mother, never staying in one place or developing relationships.  He and Claire Danes become entangled and gradually we begin to understand her involvement.  Of course, Arnold arrives along the way - what would a Terminator movie be without him?  <p>The plot is clever and filled with humor, much of it courtesy of Arnold's quips.  There are also some excellent stunts, particularly a chase scene involving a crane that seems to destroy much of LA.  T3 is much more straight-forward and brisk than T2.  In a strange way, the movie is a *comfortable* action film; we know what to expect from the series and it delivers.  The ending is also satisfying while also clearly leaving the door open for T4.  Overall, it's a solid action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>this movie is the bomb. Kristanna Loken sizzles in her first role as the T-X. Arnold Schwarzeneggar as always does an excellent job as the T-101. at the end of the movie, a lot of bombs fall, which is why I say this movie is the bomb. Arnold became a governor so don't expect any other movie to come from him.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This one is without a doubt the worst Terminator movie in the series. I didn't hate it, but it was only fun to watch the first time around. It's definitely the most violent, so if you're a total blood and gore fanatic you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. I love that kind of stuff, but it didn't seem to make me like it any better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Sarah Conner is dead (R.I.P.) and the Nuclear war never happened, stopped it, didn't they?

Not having Cameron's visceral trademark M.O (Blow up everything) for the continuation of the series is criminal. But that's Hollywood for you. Now with Cameron only producing, Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U571) is set to helm this monster of a movie. With both star and budget problems and no Linda Hamilton, this could kill the franchise. Oh sure, it'll be impressive to see what it'll look like and Arnie's fans will no doubt get excited about the Austrian hulk's return to the series after a long string of action clunkers. New cast members include Kristanna Loken as the female terminator and Claire Danes. It's all speculation, but Cameron replaced by a shaky B-movie director, we can only hope that this will be a success that will terminate box office records and revive Schwarzenegger's career as one of the greatest action guys in movie history. And regardless of the film's problems, millions of hard-core fans are eagerly waiting for it's theatrical release in July 2 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>He come back still again and more kean strong better than never becaus ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER is SCHWARZY ! HE is UNIQUE in this world 20/20 with mention ! He don(t lie never when he say : "I'LL BE BACK SOON "</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I really, truly, thought the magic was gone when I heard that Jim Cameron wasn't going to work on this project.  I've never been so happy to be wrong.  Mostow did an incredible job meeting the high expectations that fans have for this series.<p>I'm not going to talk about the plot for fear of revealing too much, but I will say that this is the movie where John Connor finally meets his destiny.  This is where the questions and issues of a time paradox (ex: If Judgment Day never happened how did John's father come back in time?  Would he never have existed?) are finally answered (intelligently I might add).<p>And of course, Arnold (or Governor Arnold now I guess) absolutely IS the Terminator.  I don't think I have EVER seen a role more perfectly cast.<p>If there I had any complaints at all, it was mostly just for what I felt I was missing then anything.  I never thought I'd say this about an action movie, but I really wish there was a bit more dialogue and characterization for John Connor.  As I said before, this is THE MOMENT when he becomes the man he was destined to be.  I would have LOVED just a couple of extra minutes to watch him make the transition into the role.  <p>I'm holding out hope that extra footage will be added to the DVD.  I really got the impression that T3 was made with a strict eye on the clock.  The first two Terminator movies are around two hours (more for T2), T3 clocked in for almost exactly an hour and a half, if I remember right.  I honestly think that a lot was left on the cutting room floor; I'd love to see some of it integrated back into the movie.<p>Again, 4 out of five stars.  A very solid third entry into this wonderful sci-fi saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>About a couple of days after its release, I managed to check out the highly anticipated "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" at the theater, and let me tell you that the film blew me away! Especially since "T3" has spectacular action sequences and awesome special effects from start to finish! Yet, to me, "Terminator 3" is not better than "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (which will forever remain one of the best action films of all time), but it is, however, better than the first "Terminator" film from way back in 1984. I do regret them not picking James Cameron to direct "T3", but I do give kudos to director Jonathan Mostow ("U-571") for his intense direction of this film. And guess who's back?! That's right! Superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger ("Collateral Damage") is back in the role that made him a household name..."The Terminator"! Joining him are Nick Stahl ("In The Bedroom"), Claire Danes ("The Hours"), and Kristanna Loken (TV's "Mortal Kombat: Conquest"), in which they gave tremendous performances as well.<p>"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" starts out about 12 years after the events of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". The apocalyptic prediction of Judgment Day was never prevented, only postponed. John Connor (Stahl), now 22, is living "off the grid" (meaning no credit cards, no cell phone, etc.), being totally disconnected from society. During the film, Connor is being pursued by the T-X (Loken), another ruthless killing machine from the future sent by Skynet, the evil supercomputer that controls machines from all around the world. T-X's mission is to pick up where her predecessor (the liquid metal T-1000) left off: to stop Connor from becoming the savior of mankind. Then, soon enough, an obsolete, disadvantaged T-850 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect Connor and Kate Brewster (Danes), a girl from his past, in triumphing over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day...or it will be the end of life as we know it!<p>In conclusion, "Terminator 3" has it all: Action, suspense, a powerful storyline, laugh-out-loud humor that Schwarzenegger can always provide us with, and pulse-pounding special effects! "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is, without a doubt, one of the best action films that I've seen all summer and will be an unforgettable DVD must-have addition to the first two "Terminator" films!</p></br></body></html>

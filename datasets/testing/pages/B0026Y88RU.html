The story keeps you engrossed as it moves at a good pace and all the actors do an OK job that shouldn't make you cringe too much. I liked it more than most films of 2006, and you can do worse for a bit of afternoon entertainment. The twist in the tale was good and it finished with a satisfying ending. Not bad overall, but not outstanding.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.4 stars<br /><br />There are many things to love about this movie, especially its McG visual quality, its occasionally classic dialogue, and its basic premise. But the insipid and drawn-out love story is out of place and slows things down pointlessly; the plot gets a little too labyrinthine for its own good (and ours); and the overly frequent, much too graphic violence seems to delight in itself to no point but distaste.<br /><br />There are some fine lines and solid performances (Freeman, Willis, Kingsley), but the two stars/love interests are good not great, and the script, which starts out very crisply, gets a little too clever and folds in on itself for no special reason other than it can.<br /><br />Add up all the pluses and minuses and you get a film that is excellent in spots but not quite as a whole. Still, if you revel in glossily done-up revenge (and a very nice blu-ray transfer), and enjoy not knowing what's really happening while it all happens in very tight, attractive shots, this could be your baby.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Thank all that is good that the Hollywood publicity machine overlooked this film, thus creating a magnificent sleeper hit.  I was pleasantly surprised with this film.  It takes the viewer on a terrific ride through mobsters and mayhem that never travels stereotypical paths.  Well worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>At first I thought this was a Pulp Fiction type of movie.  A number of quirky characters, multiple plots, lots of violent, and Bruce Willis.  Sleven turns out to be a movie all its' own.  After a flashback to a time 25 years earlier, a present day case of mistaken identity leaves Harnett in debt to two rival mob bosses--Freeman and Kingsley.  Freeman wants Kingsely's gay son dead, so he is willing to erase the debt if it is done.  Meanwhile, master assassin Willis is a man for hire, but who is he really working for.  A lot of twists and turns fill this story.  When you see how it all comes together at the end, you will be surprised and fullfilled.  This is a good movie to check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in New York to visit an old buddy, he quickly runs into trouble. First he gets mugged. Then he arrives at Nick's house (his friend's) to find him not at home. Slevin makes himself comfortable but is soon interrupted by Lindsey (a very perky and fun Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor. They are instantly attracted to each other and the humorous sparks fly as they verbally joust with one another. Lindsey notices his battered nose (mugged?) and Slevin tells her what a terrible day he's having, which endears him even more to her.<br /><br />Shortly after Lindsey leaves, two thugs arrive and mistake him for Nick. They don't believe him when he tells them his name is Slevin and drag him out of the apartment clothed only in a bath towel. They take him to "The Boss" (Morgan Freeman) where he's told that Nick (i.e., him) owes a lot of money but can work it off by killing one man: the son of his biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).<br /><br />Soon after agreeing to do this, Slevin is then picked up by The Rabbi's thugs and told by him that he owes The Rabbi money, too, but can work it off by killing The Boss. Caught between the disbelief of two mob bosses about who Slevin really is, he's forced to make a decision. Or is he?<br /><br />At the beginning of the film we're introduced to a poor family man with a gambling problem. He bets a lot of money on a losing horse and soon he and his family are "rubbed out". And who killed the family? Yep. The Boss and The Rabbi before they became enemies. Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, a heartless assassin who eliminates the young boy of the losing gambler with a single bullet to the head. Or did he?<br /><br />Convoluted stories are often so complex that they lose cohesion and I was afraid that this might happen with LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Thankfully it didn't. The complexity is there and subtle, but handled with expert care by Aussie director Paul McGuigan. The flashbacks are impeccably pulled off as are the many action sequences. The fact that it all came together so nicely in the end made the entire movie watching experience effortless. Although I did try and figure out what was happening, there were so many well executed twists and turns that I was continually surprised and delighted.<br /><br />We always here the words "ensemble cast" when certain films come out with a few favorite actors sprinkled here and there, but this time the title is well deserved. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, Kevin Chamberlin and a smattering of other notables round out this pristine cast.<br /><br />Comparisons between Tarantino's directorial style and Mr. McGuigan's have been made, but Paul McGuigan's methods, I think, are more subtle in tone but direct in execution (I hope that makes sense!).<br /><br />The other notable point in the film was location. The filming of the sets held a consistent circular theme to them, including wallpaper, stairways, and cups. This theme is well deserved, as a circle has no beginning and no end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>The movie starts off with loose leads, leaving me guessing what's actually going on. Veteran Bruce Willis is the mysterious card and the rookie Nick Fisher seems helplessly tossed between two rivals Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu is the beautiful neighbor falling for Nick. The intricate plot has everything perfectly explained in the end - a 15-minute climax.  Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley face off one another in the top floor board room, not knowing they are just pawns in the game, not until the end. For people who like Ocean Eleven, Inferno Affairs(Hong Kong), this is a film they will thoroughly enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that is really frustrating to watch. You have some great actors like Freeman,Kingsley and Willis who are interesting to watch and then you have some not so great actors like Lui and Hartnett who are not very interesting to watch. The story is good but, the love affair between Hartnett and Lui takes up way too much screen time in this otherwise good action film. I understand the purpose of the relationship between them but, it seemed to switch the tone of the movie from violent gangster film to a romantic comedy at times. Hartnett getting his nose broken twice was just too much for me and those kind of "yuk yuk" jokes should have been left out of this grisly tale of revenge. As it is, it's a good film but, it could have been great!</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>This movie kept us guessing right to the end.<br />Very suspenseful thriller/mystery.<br />Lots of violence so, if that bothers you - you won't like this movie.<br />There's even some dark comedy.<br />Poor Slevin is a guy that gets caught up in the middle of a war between 2 crime families.<br />How will he get out of this alive??<br />You'll have to watch to find out!</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>In this movie about a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, a down and out guy looking to stay at a friend's house after a rash of bad luck.  What he doesn't expect is that he will be drawn into a murder plot involving two competing mob bosses, The Boss and The Rabbi.  When they ask him to commit a crime for a debt he doesn't owe, Slevin has no other option but to comply or lose his life.  I think you can guess which option he chooses.<br /><br />This film has an all star cast including Morgan Freeman as the Boss, Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, Lucy Liu as the nosy neighbor of Slevin's friend, and Bruce Willis as a hitman with no remorse.  I've never really thought much of Josh Hartnett as an actor, but this film changed my mind.  I guess there's a lot more to him than 40 Days and 40 Nights.  His pairing with Bruce Willis, as in Sin City, was perfection and the two together are downright dangerous.  I would definitely recommend this movie to the same sort of people who enjoy movies like Snatch and Pulp Fiction. It's fast-paced, occasionally violent, and big on flashbacks, but worth every second.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>I was pleasently please with this film.I hardly remember it being in the theater,and can only recall seeing the trailer once,so therefore at the time,I never thought much of this film.Josh Hartnet is becomming a  respecable actor,at least in my eyes.At the time of his emergence onto the big screen,I thought he was just going to be another poster boy,17 magazine wanker,but I have to eat my words as I am continously impressed with the work in his films despite some real muts he has partaken in.The title of the film itself, "Lucky # Slevin",it is just original as it is,so I'm glad I trusted my gut and saw this movie.It has a fantastic story/plot,not to mention characters and even better...a great script.Morgan Freeman is cast great as "The Boss",even better is the "Rabi" by phenominal actor Ben Kingsly and even Bruce Willis himself steps up as "Mr. Goodkat" not to mention... Lucy Lu.How perfect is that?Despite negative reviews or misinterpitations/misconseptions made by other amazon members about this film,Lucky # Slevin is in no way,shape or form anything like a Die Hard movie.Were you people high when you watched it?I don't know where that came from,but I suggest you lay off the koolaid.Lucky # Slevin follows much more in the footsteps of Reseviour Dogs,Pulp Fiction,Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Snatch,and The Boondock Saints.Bruce Willis's part in this film is very small,yet like all the characters,is intertwinded in the grand skeme of things,just go with the flow and you will understand.I dare not give anything away about this film,I'd only runin it for you,just trust me on this and see this movie,its a real kick in the pants.I guarantee you won't be dissappointed.Well worth owning,this is yet another gem I'm adding to my personal DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Interesting film here...<br /><br />The trailer sells it as a comedy (a mix between slapstick and romantic and caper).<br /><br />But the film is something else. Slevin (Hartnett) is visiting a friend (who you'll never see) and gets mistaken for him. So he is dragged to the presence of a big mobster (Freeman) who forces him to become an assassin. The mission? To kill another mobster(Kingsley)'s son. But the other mobster also drags him to his office and forces him to collect some money... and all seem to be a big vengeance plot orchestrated by an international assasin called Mr. Goodkat (Willis) for something that happened 20 years ago (that we see as the film's prolog).<br /><br />Having briefly explained the plot in 25 words or less, let me say that this story gets more and more unbelievable and far fetched as it goes. This is one of those stories who would never work... and the screenplay is so formulaic that nothing that happens in the end is surprising.<br /><br />A formulaic screenplay? Yes, because as it goes, you see exactly which parts of the story are deliberately left missing in order to be explained later. You know exactly when an action is interrupted in order for you to get the truth later.<br /><br />But there are good things... the cast is magnetic: Willis, Hartnett, Liu, Freeman and Kingsley.<br /><br />AND THE ART DIRECTION IS TOP NOTCH!!!!!!<br /><br />The wallpapers are beautiful, and the fabrics... and the style... you don't see one empty inch on the screen who hasn't been worked (well). Even when it does no look like it was. This film should be in the books.<br /><br />The art direction alone should make you see the movie.<br /><br />This is an average film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Director Paul McGuigan's films can sometimes be quite interesting.  In the medieval thriller "The Reckoning," he follows a troupe of actors who solve a brutal mystery.  In "Gangster No. 1," he follows a brutal crime rampage.  In "Wicker Park," he had editing so complex that it was difficult to understand what was happening when or why we should care.  "Lucky # Slevin" wasn't as good as the first two nor as bad as WPark, so somewhere in the middle.  The film is shot well with an outstanding cast.  However, the screenplay comes across like a Perry Mason without the courtroom where it takes the last 15 minutes of the film to unravel the plot.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett has yet to be recognized for deep acting ability.  He's been described as having a combination of good looks & puppy dog eyes.  He was the star of McGuigan's "Wicker Park"; so this is at least the second pairing of this star & director.  In "The Black Dahlia," Hartnett came across a little more deeply; although in "Sin City" & "Pearl Harbor," mostly he looks nice.  In this film, he's willing to parade around in a bath towel for what seemed like a half-hour.  His work is okay, but not exceptional.  He's like a male model in a movie.  As Slevin, he certainly masks any depth that is later revealed.  At best, this makes the ending come as a surprise; at worst, it makes the ending seem unbelievable.<br /><br />Lucy Liu broke through in Ally McBeal and has proceeded to make a name for herself in films with "Domino," "Payback," "Charlie's Angels" & "Kill Bill."  As Lindsay the coroner who lives across the hall, it's hard to judge whether she's just a simple neighbor wishing to help or somehow involved in a more complex plot.  Somehow, we expect her to be more complex than she winds up being, which is a bit of a letdown.  As a love interest, she & Hartnett seem like the odd couple.<br /><br />Mr. Die Hard Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, the assassin with a soft spot.  He's as nice of a guy as you could ever wish for to go around killing people.<br /><br />Two Oscar winners make up the supporting cast.  Morgan Freeman who brought home gold for "Million Dollar Baby" after three previous nominations ("The Shawshank Redemption," "Street Smart" & "Driving Miss Daisy") plays the Boss.  We think he's in charge, except for the flashback which clues us otherwise.  Ben Kingsley who won the Oscar for "Ghandi" (& also had 3 nominations for "Bugsy," "Sexy Beast," & "House of Sand & Fog") plays Schlomo who heads the rival crime syndicate.  After killing each other's kids, they meet their demise at the hand of mean puppy dog Hartnett.<br /><br />The film works as an interesting and complex plot that becomes clear only at the end.  The film doesn't work because Bruce Willis who can convincingly be mean is nice, while Hartnett who is nice plays mean.  Revenge occurs as Slevin falls in love.  Emotionally, this film doesn't hang together.  There is no apparent moral to the film other than revenge is okay if it's taken out against really bad badguys.  I bought the DVD without having seen the film before and liked watching some of the deleted scenes.  However, this one may be headed for a garage sale in the near future.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Lucky Number Slevin" is chock full of fantastic performances from great actors like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley.  Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast also do fantastic work.  But the direction is poor.  We see the strings in a lot of the scenes; dialogue being fired back and forth in an artificial and stilted manner - the fact that's across the board means it's a directorial and not an acting problem.<br /><br />And the script.  Wow.  It's a second draft Tarantino clone that needed a couple more drafts to be worth shooting.  It's chock full of unbelievable coincidence, unnecessary complication, and uneven pacing.<br /><br />This may be worth a rent.  But "Lucky Number Slevin" should not be purchased until you've spent a couple dollars on a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>It's so hard these days to come up with something new in the whole assassin genre but director Paul McGuigan has as well as screenwriter Jason Smilovic. We all know McGuigan has style from his Gangster No. 1 movie but Lucky Number Slevin takes it to the next level.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett whose acting choices can range from brilliant (Black Hawk Down) to head-scratchingly odd (Hollywood Homicide) is back to being brilliant. For much of the early part of the movie he acts wearing only a towel (the ladies all thank you, Mr. McGuigan) but it's no simple gimmick. It gives his character that literal fish out of water (yes, bad puns r us) sense.<br /><br />Throw in the absolutely delicious Lucy Liu in a role that finally showcases her ability to Kate Hepburn the snappy dialogue up while also being incredibly naturally sexy. She hits all the right notes on this one.<br /><br />Then I haven't even mentioned the heavyweights from Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis to Stanley Tucci. It's a superb cast and they all are note perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The story itself is a witty, intelligent yet with completely wacky premise that evokes an almost John Le Carre type spy storyline. Not that spies are the protagonists but there is a lot of "watching" what the other guy is doing and chess moves (there are a couple of actual chess scenes) as Hartnett pulls the strings to gain the revenge he so wants.<br /><br />Amazing bit of filmmaking.<br /><br />Extras are just commentary tracks and deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though Lucky Number Slevin ends up taking so many twists and turns that Josh Harnett has to explain it all to Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley (and the audience), it's still a very fresh and witty thriller with a great knack at developing characters we like; watch it and be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The first 15 minutes are funny. Then it gets boring because most of the time the actors are just talking. Besides the jokes are repetitive.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>"It's my favorite movie."<br /><br />I heard this from the person who recommended this movie to me.  Wow, there are a lot of movies out there.  This must be something special to be someone's favorite.<br /><br />I should have remembered that, in our vast world, there has to be a person who claims Smoky and the Bandit is their favorite.  Be wary of favorites!<br /><br />In Lucky Number Slevin, the viewer is set up to a strange set of circumstances.  An apparently random meeting in an airport waiting area results in a murder.  Two really bad guys (the Boss and the Rabbi) have been holed up in neighboring high-rises for 20 years, each afraid that the other would take him out.  Then, another "apparently random" non-meeting in NYC results in a case of "mistaken identity," and the twists and turns begin.  How are all these characters mixed up?<br /><br />Lots of blood splattering, one explosion, a repeatedly broken nose, and some asphyxiations.  No car chases.<br /><br />This is not a memorable film.  It is what you would get if you crossed Denzel Washington's performance in Man on Fire with Robert Redford in The Sting.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Josh Hartnett plays an unlucky, mild-mannered young guy with a broken nose, arriving at his friend Nick's deserted flat in New York City. There he meets some odd people who think he is Nick: one is a kooky and charming neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Liu) asking him for sugar and starts chatting with him; the other is two gangsters ordering him to come with them to a tightly-guarded room where their Boss (Morgan Freeman) lives a secluded life.<br /><br />But director Paul MaGuigan is not content with this premise which I find is already interesting enough to make a good crime thriller. The film actually begins with another set of stories apparently unrelated to each other, and the body counts rise very fast in the opening 15 minutes. That's even before you meet Josh Hartnett's character.<br /><br />In the second half of the story, the film ties up its loose ends, putting the pieces into the right places. I kept guessing the truths, but I was not impressed or thrilled with the outcome because each piece of the film presented in the opening is not emotionally involving, related in the flashbacks and fast-cut episodic scenes. Someone gets killed suddenly, then another someone, and then ... you will see the truths behind these apparently random killings, but you have to wait for more than one hour.<br /><br />`Lucky Number Slevin' has a potentially intriguing story with a great cast every producer would dream of, including Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci plus cameo of Danny Aiello and Robert Forster. For all its solid acting and dead-pan humor from some characters, I didn't find the film interesting as other people think because the film tries to explain too much or to include twists and turns more than necessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Many movies explore the theme of revenge, such as Kill Bill, Braveheart, The Sting, etc..., but few have put together such an intricate and detailed plot of how one individual gets back at those who have wronged him.  Looking at the trailer, this movie seems like an action comedy, but there is nothing funny about it; and there is not really that much action either.  This movie is pure drama.<br /><br />Slevin is the name of a racehorse that was supposed to win a race after being doped up with steroids.  But the horse dies from overdose during the race and hence loses.  An ordinary man has bet a lot of money on the horse, and does not have enough to pay up.  Local gangsters send out assasins to kill him, his wife and his son.  The assassin sent to kill the son, played by Bruce Willis, spares the boy, takes pity on him and adopts him as his own.  The boy grows up to become a professional killer himself, takes on the name Slevin, and takes revenge on those who killed his parents.  In doing so, he destroys the top two criminal organizations in NYC along with a cop played by Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />The movie has numerous twists and turns and leaves you guessing until the very end.  Some might liken it to Pulp Fiction, but whereas Pulp Fiction is more an exploration of the criminal underworld, this movie focuses more on how one bad turn can lead to another.  The character development is quite good; Lucy Liu probably turns in her best performance in years.  Josh Hartnett shows he can play a serious role, and Bruce Willis continues his tradition of playing gun-toting bad guys with merciful streaks.  All in all a good movie to watch and enjoy.  Some of the murder scenes are quite bloody though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Another great gangster movie. Fans of movies like "Snatch" and "Usual Suspects" should definitely like it. A mix of hard action with a little comedy and some great story twists make "Lucky Slevin" a winner. The story of revenge for a murdered family is not that new, but it is well told with some variations that will keep you seated. Great acting and lines are the key ingredients with good directing, sets, and music thrown in to top it off.<br /><br />I certainly plan to add a copy to my collection. I recommend it to fans of hardcore action movies. This is not suited for the whole family. A man in a friends apartment is mistakenly thought to be a man that owes money to two crime bosses that have been secluded for twenty years since their falling out. Each hires him to kill someone. Superb acting by Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, and Lucy Liu make the movie flow and very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Josh Hartnett stars as Slevin Kelevra in Paul McGuigan's farcical crime thriller "Lucky Number Slevin".  Hartnett is immediately immersed in trouble after stepping off a plane in New York, getting mugged.  After crashing his buddy Tony's apartment, in a case of mistaken identity, he is dragged before two rival crime bosses.  The Boss played by Morgan Freeman, head of an Afro-American gang and the Rabbi played by Ben Kingsley head of an Orthodox Jewish mob were previously partners but now lethal enemies.<br /><br />Hartnett, thought of as his friend is apparently indebted to both men and must do their bidding or forfeit his life.  The confusing plot had been spawned by an incident some twenty years ago.  A low level gambler and his family had been murdered owing to a losing $20,000 bet he had made on a fixed horse race.<br /><br />In this bizarre flick, Bruce Willis lurks about playing a hitman working for both Freeman and Kingsley.  Lucy Liu plays Lindsey, Hartnett's love interest and his friend's neighbor.  Stanley Tucci plays omnipresent detective Brikowski who is monitoring the strange happenings.<br /><br />McGuigan thankfully ties the storyline together as this befuddling but entertaining movie climaxes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I rented this movie with high hopes.

That was very nice to watch.<br /><br />I love the idea of the nosy neighbor, played by Lucy Liu.  I always think of her as a "brain" and its fun to see her here, as sort of a "smart" ditz, if you know what I mean.

However, I thought it would be a better movie if the pace had been a bit faster.  You gotta be wide awake and full of energy to watch this movie.  Otherwise, you could be lulled to sleep.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a gambling bet/horse race gone wrong, which resulted in some deaths in the '70s.  Then, you're fast forward to modern day time.<br /><br />Slevin (Hartnett) is staying with a friend, Nick, in NYC.  He needs a place to escape after he's been fired and discovering his girlfriend cheating on him.  Not only that, he gets mugged when he arrives to NYC.<br /><br />The problem is that Nick has disappeared.  The Boss (Freeman) sends a couple of goons to get Nick to answer for his debt.  They bring back Slevin despite his announcements that he is not Nick.  The Boss says that he'll waive the $96K debt (Nick's) if he'll do a job...assassinating The Rabbi's gay son.<br /><br />No sooner when he's deliever back to Nick's apartment that The Rabbi's (Kingsley) goons pick him up to answer to a $33K debt.  It just goes on and on. Poor Slevin!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lindsey (Liu) is Nick's neighbor.  She comes over to borrow a cup of sugar.  She's real chatty, witty and nosy as she gets herself involved with Slevin/Nick's debt problems.  Through the whole process, Slevin and Lindsey fall in love.<br /><br />Back to the story, Slevin has to finish the job for The Boss.  He stakes out a restaurant, while on a date with Lindsey, and spies The Rabbi's gay son.  When the Rabbi's son goes to the restroom, Slevin follows him in and sets up a date with him.  This is where things start to get interesting until the end.<br /><br />Goodkat (Willis) is an assassin.  Goodkat might puzzle you because he seems to be everywhere and makes you wonder if he's a double (triple?) agent.  You'll get your answer as the story progresses.<br /><br />Like I said...it was a good movie.  I only wish that the pace was a bit faster then I would have loved it.  I do have to say that I loved the different, eye-catching wallpaper that is shown in just about every other scenes.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the scenery as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>It really bugs me when characters in a film make a reference to an actual, better film. In "Lucky Number Slevin", two characters talk about Hitchcock's "North by Northwest", indicating the great film is similar to the exploits of the "real people" we are watching. Really, the only similarity is the case of mistaken identity.<br /><br />That gripe aside, "Lucky Number Slevin" is not a bad film, but it promises so much more.<br /><br />Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in Toronto... er, New York to visit his friend Nick. A few minutes after he arrives, he is mugged, losing his wallet. Nick is nowhere to be found, but Slevin makes himself at home in his apartment, taking a shower, shaving. Lindsey (Lucy Liu), the next door neighbor, bursts in, looking for Nick. They flirt, she leaves, she comes back in, they flirt some more. After she leaves, there is another knock on the door and the Boss' (Morgan Freeman) henchmen arrive to take Slevin to a meeting at the Boss' heavily guarded penthouse. The Boss wants Nick to pay back $96,000 he owes. He believes Slevin is Nick. Therefore, Slevin owes the Boss $96,000. Moments after returning to the apartment, another knock on the door. The Rabbi's (Ben Kinglsey) henchmen take Slevin to a meeting at the Rabbi's heavily guarded penthouse, directly across the street from the Boss'. Nick owes the Rabbi money as well. Lurking in the background, Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a professional assassin, may play a role in the game we watch unfold.<br /><br />"Slevin" has all of the characteristics of a memorable, amusing Noir-ish, wink-wink nudge-nudge game of cat and mouse. But it doesn't deliver on them.<br /><br />The reference to Toronto? This is yet another film set in New York, yet filmed in Canada.<br /><br />The cast is interesting but I don't get Josh Hartnett. He is easily one of the most boring actors working in Hollywood today. Why does he still get offered movie roles? He doesn't bring anything to the screen and frequently appears to be simply reading his lines from memory. Is it his looks? He isn't good looking enough to sustain his career as long as he has. But in this film, his lack of personality aids the character. We can wholeheartedly believe he would be mistaken for someone else because he has no personality of his own. But after this plot point comes and goes, we are then left with the actor's boring personality.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley immediately lift the film with their portrayal of the warring gangsters. The characters are interesting and multi-dimensional. But these actors bring such gravitas to their roles the film is robbed of any humor it strives to obtain. There are hints at humor throughout, but they don't lead anywhere.  Imagine an Elmore Leonard novel turned into a film. That is what "Slevin" wants to be. The Boss and the Rabbi are clearly inspired by Leonard's works, but both are so serious, so intent on their journey, we never laugh at them. Remember Don Cheadle in "Out of Sight"? That's what this film needs.<br /><br />Bruce Willis fares the best. As the assassin Mr. Goodkat, he is always calm and collected, adding the right level of danger throughout. He also keeps us guessing, as we aren't sure what role he plays in the game. Is he the mastermind or a pawn?<br /><br />Lucy Liu's Lindsey initially appears to be an annoying, precocious woman. Why is she taking such an interest in Slevin? She seems to be a tremendous flirt. And she is, but is there more to her character? In the first few moments of meeting her character, I wasn't sure I would be able to stand it. But as her relationship with Slevin continues, she takes more of a backseat. The end of the film provides an inexplicably sweet moment for their relationship.<br /><br />Writer Jason Smilovic and director Paul McGuigan ("Wicker Park", "Gangster #1") have fashioned an intricate, involving game. After an extended prologue, told in flashback by one of the characters, the story takes off through many twists and turns. The film wants to be clever, and it is, to an extent. Unfortunately, the prologue gives away the one big twist revealed in the end of the film. The filmmakers seem to realize this because after this revelation, we see another, referencing back to the prologue. This secret is so deeply buried, like insurance to make sure everyone watching is at least a little surprised.<br /><br />The film also wants to be funny. And it isn't. As good as Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis are, they are playing it straight, trying to be a scary and menacing. Hartnett walks through much of the film with a bemused expression on his face. He doesn't seem to believe what is going on, or appear to be very threatened by it, despite being constantly punched in the face. Hartnett's Slevin is a character we should be laughing with. Yet, we don't. Nothing he experiences is funny and Hartnett isn't a good enough actor to create the laughs.<br /><br />The filmmaker's seem to have the most fun with the production design. From the prologue, set in the 70s, to the present day, many of the interiors are filled with intricate patterns. Wallpaper is filled with 70s-era design, the Boss' penthouse floor is covered with an intricate tile design reminiscent of the 80s. Both of these eras are represented throughout the film, causing the line between the eras to blur. It is an interesting look; effective in helping to make the con seem all the more unusual.<br /><br />All in all, if the film had played it straight, it would have been more successful. But because it announces that we should find some of the goings-on humorous, we are looking for the humor as well. When it doesn't happen, the film loses some of its flash.  "Lucky Number Slevin" is an adequate diversion, but it could've been so much more. Now you have to decide if you want to pay $7 or $10 for "adequate".</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A young man from out of town (Josh Hartnett) is mistaken for the friend he came to visit.  He is informed by a mobster known as the Boss (Morgan Freeman) that he can erase a $94,000 debt by killing the son of his rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).  Feeling he has no alternative, he agrees.<br /><br />For me, this film fails on every level.  Its enigmatic opening tips us off that nothing is as it seems to be, which can be intriguing if handled correctly, but here it comes off as if director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Jason Smilovic are trying to be too clever for their own good.  The revelations at the end throw everything we have seen up to that point into doubt.  While I'm not interested enough to go back and watch it again with the benefit of knowing the ending, I'm pretty sure some pretty big plot holes still exist.  For example, wouldn't a powerful mob boss have some way to identify a man who owes him nearly 100K by sight?  Otherwise, people could skip out on their debts merely by changing apartments.  The dialogue is awful, too.  It's supposed to be terribly witty, but it comes across as the product of a writer who is far more amused by his own cleverness than I am.  Obviously, a lot of people disagree with me about that.  If you look this movie up on imdb.com, lots of people have posted their favorite lines.  To me, each one is worse than the last.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Lucky Number Slevin had the 2006 new film feel to it's screenplay. After hearing tags like "film of the year" I decided to give it a watch. I was not one bit disappointed but it truly is possibly the best film you will see in the three star category. It is somewhere along the lines of a new age fight club mixed with some tarantino aping direction. Despite the similarities, it somehow manages to remain original.<br /><br />I fell in love with Lucy Liu in this film. Josh Hartnett can definitely act. Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have definitely done better films with better roles. This film has a certain grip value to it which makes it highly watchable and non sleep inducing. Another film I watched right after watching Slevin was "hostel" Kill me but I liked it more. Both are good films. I'd give that four stars though.<br /><br />Fans of Seven will like this film quite a bit. Fans of Taxi Driver should keep looking. Fans of Kill Bill give it a shot. Fans of Oldboy...geez! we need to wait :)</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>If cast and acting could make a movie by themselves<br />this would have been a really bit one.<br />As it is, a lot of the plot is pretty obvious<br />with everybody pretty much ending up dead in this revenge<br />at 20 years. It actually comes out same old, same old, gang land<br />killings. The casting is better than the movie or the filming.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Far too clever for it's own good and too proud of itself because of it, Paul McGuigan's "Lucky Number Slevin" tries its damndest to be as classy and intelligent as say, "The Usual Suspects" or even "Memento" but it's reach far exceeds its ability to sell a simple, though certainly convoluted story.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett (where the heck has he been anyway?) plays a youngish man seemingly involved with a number of iffy situations (as in murder, mayhem, mistaken identity, contract killing, book making...to name a few) most of which are thrust upon him...or not, I think.<br /><br />There are genuine moments of brilliance buried here among the dark, dank rehashing of been there, seen that plot threads so McGuigan definitely has talent. Add to this the bright, funny performance of Lucy Liu and the ironic, tongue-in-cheek one of Josh Hartnett and "Lucky Number Slevin" adds up to a pretty good though flawed film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>There are some really good plot twists in this film.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I wasn't exactly sure about the whole idea and concept behind this movie as I walked into it tonight, since all it took was a fifteen second glimpse of a TV trailer and the ambiguous claim about a case of mistaken identity that uncoiled my interest into full blown curiosity.<br /><br />I was floored and blown away by the movie and at the same time really proud of trusting my gut feeling about good flicks. I was thrown off many times by the black humor since I knew it wasn't a comedy as Slevin (Josh Hartnett) had what seemed like a really unlucky chain of events that have spiraled him into a big, hot mess. As he arrives in New York to meet up with an old school friend after being fired from work, cheated on by his girlfriend back home and mugged down the block, all he finds is an empty apartment and no sign of Nick, his old friend.  He proceeds to shower and dress as unexpectedly the next door neighbor, Lucy Liu, drops by to borrow some sugar. They become quick friends with matching quirky personalities and from that point on things go from laughingly bad to worse.<br /><br />Slevin is mistaken for Nick, who apparently owes money to two rivaling mafia type bosses who hate each other and he gets pulled into their personal war. This movie was so full of twists and turns that I forgot to eat my snacks and almost left my purse at the theater at the end. I recommend not reading too much about it and skipping long trailers because this beauty can be given away on a silver platter and to miss that feeling in the theater of realizing the true story would be a sin. I was really impressed by the actors in this movie and I think Josh who looks like a teen-movie  type of an actor did a brilliant job! Bruce Willis is also quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, here as a slick top class assasin, I was impressed greatly!<br /><br />I enjoyed the twisted suspense, murder mystery comic relief type of a story so much that I was unable to concentrate on my book on the way home. I couldn't read or think, all I was consumed by was the story. This movies is an odd-ball, eccentric, quirky, unconventional and refreshing cinematographic achievement. The line between good and bad guy was blurred consitantly and the story dug deeper and deeper into my curious brain. I'm really glad I got to see it on the big screen.<br /><br />And last but not last let me tell you, the loud people in front of us who wear eatting and laughing quickly became mutes so sucked into the story that I forgot I was furious with them before. It kept everyone entertained and made them gasp at the right time and the hip music at the end really wrapped the whole thing together nicely.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Bodies accumulate quickly in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN - at least eight in the first 15 minutes, not including the horse. Then, I lost count.<br /><br />As background to "now", the film flashes back a couple of decades to a fateful horse race. A young husband and father, privy to a tip about a horse doped for extra speed, takes out a foolishly big loan from a bookie and bets it all. His horse comes from behind, but then fails to finish in dramatic fashion. With no way for the loser to pay back the loan, the local Mob makes an example by brutally killing him, his wife, and his young son. Flash forward to "now".<br /><br />Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in New York to visit his friend Nick (Sam Jaeger). On his way to the latter's apartment, Slevin is mugged, his nose broken, and his wallet stolen. Arriving at Nick's place, Slevin finds it deserted and the door open, but decides to stay the night. The next day, Slevin is kidnapped, garbed only in a bath towel, from the apartment by two thugs and forced to meet with The Boss (Morgan Freeman) in his luxurious penthouse. The Boss believes Slevin to be Nick and claims the latter owes him $96K, but gives Slevin the option of eliminating the debt by killing the son of his archrival in crime, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who lives in an identical penthouse immediately across the street. Unable to prove his real identity - remember the stolen wallet - Slevin has no choice but to agree to terms before returning to the apartment. Then, as if the day wasn't going bad enough, two of The Rabbi's goons kidnap Slevin and force him to meet with their employer, who, unaware of Slevin's shotgun arrangement with The Boss, claims that Nick owes him $32K. Both mobsters give Slevin three days to meet his obligation.<br /><br />Slevin's life is further complicated by Lindsey (Lucy Liu), Nick's perky across-the-hall neighbor and NYC medical examiner, hard-boiled plainclothes cop Brikowski (Stanley Tucci), who has both The Boss and The Rabbi under surveillance from a dilapidated van who and wonders how Slevin enters the equation, and Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a mysterious paid assassin who's apparently working both sides of the street, so to speak.<br /><br />LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is a fiendishly clever, albeit bloody, masterpiece of misdirection and long-delayed justice with a completely unexpected plot twist. This is perhaps the first film of 2006 that contains Oscar-worthy performances - Best Supporting Actor nominations for both Freeman and Kingsley.<br /><br />The film, at times a very dark comedy, is given its lighter (and romantic) moments by the Lindsey character, whose presence on the screen is marked by a soundtrack turned quirky and playful, and her interaction with the vulnerable Slevin. As a couple, the two are enormously appealing.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is in top form as the calm, dapper, efficient hit man working in the background to control the strings of his puppets, which apparently even include both The Boss and The Rabbi.<br /><br />The cinematography, enhanced by uncluttered, modern and/or otherwise visually engaging sets, e.g. the first visit to the airport waiting room, the penthouse occupied by The Boss, and the hallway outside Nick's apartment, is inspired. Even the wallpaper in Lindsey's bedroom is eye-catching.<br /><br />After a long work day followed by an evening meal, I'm likely to nod off even during a better-than-average film. LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN kept my eyes open and riveted to the Big Screen for its entire runtime.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Lucky Number Slevin" is a film that starts off making it clear that there is a con game going on and tries to lay out its cards on the tables in the opening scene.  This is a risky maneuver because while you will not be able to figure out "what" is going on by the explanation Bruce Willis' character gives of the precipitating event in the "Kansas City Shuffle," you have a better than average chance of answering the "who" question.  Obviously the game has already begun by this point in the story, but this is our introduction and clearly we are going to have to play catch-up.  If you have figured out "who" in the first five minute, then waiting for the "what" to be explained might get to be a bit maddening.<br /><br />This film takes another risk in that the dialogue of Jason Smilovic's screenplay is trying to achieve a nuanced feel akin to crossing Damon Runyon with Quentin Tarantino, with the former being the dominant gene (actually Smilovic made his bones developing "Karen Sisco" for television, but the connection to Elmore Leonard strikes me as being rather tenuous).  You are either going to like this way of speaking or you are going to hate it (there might be a third option in that it simply does not work).  I rather liked it and was perfectly willing to go along with the approach, largely in part because most of the weighted dialogue is coming out of the mouth of Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kinglsey.  The play the Boss and the Rabbi respectively, a pair of major gangsters who live in penthouse apartments across the street from each other, unwilling to venture out into the world because the other one will whack them.  They remind me of an old "MAD" magazine bit that contrasted the polite and refined dialogue of villains with the harsh language and tone of heroes.  Freeman's Boss being polite has the ring of a death threat.<br /><br />Also mouthing such dialogue is Josh Hartnett's Slevin, but he is a kid so it comes across as him just being fresh, which is why he gets his nose broken so many times.  Slevin is in town and when a couple of thugs show up in Nick Fisher's apartment looking for Nick Fisher, they assume Slevin is Nick.  This is a bad turn of events for Slevin and things get even worse when another couple of thugs show up and make the same assumption.  At least the second time the poor guy is actually dressed.  Fortunately, Lindsey (a scene stealing performance by Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor across the hall is able to do more than lend a willing ear, because she sees some method to all this madness even if Sleven does not.<br /><br />I went along for the ride here and the results were largely enjoyable.  There comes a point when the funny dialogue stops, but that is because there is no longer anything funny about the situation.  The sudden gravity could be too much for some viewers as well, but in the final screen and the final set of revelations the remaining characters remain true to themselves, which seems to surprise them more than it does us.  This 2006 film is directed by Paul McGuigan ("Wicker Park"), and if he is doing a 21st version of a Hitchcock film his directing style does not call attention to the fact.  He lets the actors do the heavy lifting, and with this particular cast that is a no-brainer.  All things considered, this one is going to be hit or miss big time with audiences.  Even if you decide to wait for it to come out on DVD, give this one a shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I didn't see this coming. I was expecting some criminal movie a la Guy Ritchie but what I got was a whole lot different. At first it seemed like some average criminal movie: well, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as two gang bosses, Bruce Willis as a hitman, Stanley Tucci as a cop, Lucy Liu as a hot autopsist and goofy Josh Hartnett in between - it was fun. Especially with funny lines like: "Why do everyone call him rabbi?" - "Because he's a rabbi..."<br /><br />It was closer to the end when I realized the film was not what it seemed to be. And to be more precise - it was not what it pretended to seem to be. Just like with Paul McGuigan's last flick "Wicker Park". Remember watching it and then gasping at one point: "Wow"? Same thing happened to me here and I must say McGuigan is a hell of a director. He is pulling the wool over our eyes during the whole movie just to come up with such a twist in the end we will not know what to say.<br /><br />And even when it looks like an ordinary story which we saw a lot already, it looks good. Because of the fine acting, sharp directing, brilliant screen-play with smart and ironic dialogs... You don't get a feeling the movie is played out and second hand. It's indeed fresh, it tastes and smells delicious. It's light and it melts in your mouth.<br /><br />In a way after I exhaled that "Wow" after finished watching the first thought that came to my mind was: "It's the second "Usual Suspects". I wouldn't actually insist it is so but when you watch it you'll get me. By the way if I were you I wouldn't read anything about "Lucky Number Slevin" before watching, no reviews or annotations. I wouldn't ask friends who saw it about it. Don't try to learn anything about this film beforehand even if those are some insignificant details. And stop reading this also (I'm shutting up at last) - go and watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />If you think you may have a bad day, consider the day Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) is having. He's just lost his job and his apartment, and found his girlfriend in bed with another man all on the same day. To top it off, he gets mugged, has his nose broken and loses all his ID cards when he comes to New York City to stay with his high school friend Nick Fisher who fails to meet him at the airport, disappears in the thin air and leaves Slevin stuck in a mafia-war between two families respectively headed by the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, and he is the Rabbi and the gangster) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman as regal as usually. OT: just before we began watching "Lucky Number Slevin", we returned from "Evan Almighty." It was a double treat to see Morgan Freeman playing God and the mafia boss at the same day). A mysterious assassin Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) seems to have plans on how to use Slevin as a "body" (does not sound too promising for Slevin if you ask me) for his present job. A tough NYC cop (Stanley Tucci) does not want a wild card Slevin in his city. The last thing Slevin needs is a romance with the Nick's next door neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who happened to word as a coroner for NYCPD while he tries to turn the tables on the gangsters. Yes, of course, the movie brings to mind the classics like "North By Northwest" with the case of a mistaken identity, "Pulp Fiction" (with its style, coolness, and sharp dialogs, and with the small details like a family watch with a long history, and three stars of three Tarantino's movies), "Usual Suspects" (with the way the story has been presented), and "Professional" (well, sometimes the world class assassins have hearts and feelings that they are not supposed to have) but the movie is very entertaining - it is paced extremely well, the use of flash backs is most effective, and the actors, all of them bring style and grace to their roles. Just to see the only scene between Freeman and Sir Kingsley is worth the price of renting. Between my husband and myself, we figured out the story and the secrets behind the lucky numbers rather early into the movie but we still enjoyed watching it and were riveted to the screen until the very last moment, and that's the sign of a well crafted and interesting movie for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I didn't know what I was getting myself into when we went to see Lucky Number Sleven last night.  Having read some reviews that said it tried too hard, was too smart for its own good, etc, I just didn't know what to expect.  I didnt' know much, or anything really, of the plot.  I'm glad I didn't and I would recommend you don't either.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me while watching Sleven was that there were a number of deaths upfront that didn't make a lick of sense.  However, knowing this kind of film, I knew that eventually the webs would tighten to explain everything.  While some reviewers are correct in saying that Lucky Number Sleven ultimately is too smart for its own good, it is still a fun, dark and violent time.<br /><br />Sleven is sleekly and stylishly directed.  The cinematography uses tricks to give a quickly moving, sleek and interesting feel.  From the beginning montage, to the end, the cinematography is visually stimulating.  As is the sets.  The wallpaper in particular caught my eye.  A mixing of classical contemporary style (as seen in the Boss' penthouse) mixing with modern designs.  Visually pleasing to say the least but also helps set up characters.<br /><br />The casting is perfect.  In fact, this is one of the first times I've seen Lucy Liu in such an effervescent and bubbily role.  It was a breath of fresh air to see her playing a non-bitchy, fun-loving person.  Her banter with Josh Hartnett provides a ton of surreal humor and situations.  Bruce Willis was terrific as the mysterious Smith, Morgan Freeman playing against his usual good guy role was terrific as was Ben Kingsley--though that's no surprise.<br /><br />I don't want to talk about the plot because that's part of the fun in these films.  I will say it is basically about Sleven being in the wrong place at the wrong time, so to speak.  And he is mistaken for his friend who owes a lot of money.  From there the plot takes off and the pacing is pitch perfect.  It's kept alive by manic energy, absurd situations and hillarious banter between the characters.  I was smirking, smiling or laughing through most of the film, even when it takes a couple turns into some darker territory.<br /><br />A dark comedy, film-noir, Lucky Number Sleven was not at all what I expected.  It was a lot better, fun and insane.<br /><br />4 stars -- above the average, mostly because of the cast and the witty repartee that actually serves a point, but it tries too hard to be placed among the Usual Suspects and Mememtos of the world.  Good humor, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Lucky Number Slevin is a satisfying revenge tale (reminded me of Sleepers a bit) that's told, through flashbacks, editing, and piece-meal revelations, in a way that keeps us guessing about what exactly is going on and who is in on what, until the twist at the end.  Bruce Willis is perfect as "Mr. Goodkat," a world-class hitman who tells us the start of the story - about a family killing 20 years ago - but his own role in it isn't clear until the end, though he appears here and there.  The real protagonist seems to be Josh Hartnett.  He's mistaken for "Nick" and grabbed by thugs who bring him to "The Boss," Morgan Freeman, who insists Nick owes him $96,000, and must kill someone to pay it off.  Before the day is out Hartnett falls in love with Nick's neighbor Lucy Liu and is again abducted by the Boss's rival, Sir Ben Kingsley.  There's a lot of humor in this middle part of the movie, but first and last thirds are intense and violent.  What's amazing is the way it all comes together to a satisfying conclusion that explains everything - which is really all in the story-telling, the way it's put together to let us know the right clues as the story unfolds.  The cast is terrific, with Robert Forster and others, besides those mentioned above. It's not appropriate for kids - too much sex, in addition to considerable violence - but otherwise outstanding.  So what's the Kansas City Shuffle?  You have to see the movie to find out!</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>You know I gave no attention to the previews for this movie at all. I'm pretty sure that I just didn't take it seriously. The preview portrays it too much in a comedic genre. What it really is a smooth assassin film with some comedy. The film starts out in a terminal with a man just sitting and waiting until an old man in a wheelchair (Bruce Willis) appears out of nowhere. The old man looks harmless of course and starts telling the guy about the story of a Kansas City Shuffle.<br /><br />The story is based in 1979 and is about a fixed horse race and how everything goes wrong and people end up getting hurt. The purpose of the shuffle is actually to make someone look in another direction. What Willis does after he tells this Kansas City Shuffle tale well you'll have to watch and see. After this a man in present day named Sleven (Josh Hartnett) is introduced. He came to town to meet his friend but before he gets there some bad things happen to him. First he gets kicked out of his apartment, he catches his girlfriend cheating on him, and then he gets mugged.<br /><br />He didn't have a rough week he had a rough day and so much more is coming for him. After he arrives a cute but annoying neighbor (Lucy Liu) greets him. She just won't leave him alone or stop asking him questions. While sitting in his friend's apartment in a towel someone knocks on the door. It's two guys coming to get him and take him to The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who is well the boss of a mob. The Boss informs him that he can't find his friend and because of this he owes him money. After Slevin is dropped off not too much later two men knock to take him to The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). The Rabbi is well a Rabbi who also happens to be a boss of a mob.<br /><br />What may be one of the longest synopsis ever or a least that I've ever had to write this film is definitely worth it. All that and that's only half of the movies story. So many things happen in this film that make it a bit predictable but exciting. The story was done nicely from the pace to the order of the events. It starts out sort of cool with Bruce Willis in the opening scene but then it goes into a bit of comedy. So already you don't really know what to expect from it. Then Lucy Liu is thrown into it and I'm thinking it might go more towards a comedy cause her character was wacky.<br /><br />I was surprised because the twists were woven in perfectly. Lucy didn't mess with it at all and Hartnett did a nice job. Bruce Willis made the film, well him, Morgan, and Ben. I love the back-story, which was very original. The action or gunplay was just enough to give the movie a bit of a grimy feeling to it. Though this movie is predictable or at least some people will get it quickly I like how it was done. It makes you believe one thing never totally letting go of its seriousness and then they go a little deeper. This had a great cast, it was well written, and I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to see a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>OK, so "Lucky Number Slevin" falls easily into the Tarantino/"Pulp Fiction" mold, from it's graphic violence and plot twists, to the off-beat humor and quirky characterizations. And it won't take long to guess what the big 'secret' is that holds everything together (although it is intriguing to see who fits where in the scheme of things). Saying all this, however, I really enjoyed "Slevin"!<br /><br />A lot of the entertainment of the film comes from first-rate actors obviously enjoying themselves. Trapped in a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett, sporting a broken nose and lack of wardrobe in the early part of the film, takes every mishap and disaster with such aplomb that it's easy to see why mob bosses Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley look at him in stunned bewilderment (remember the gangster in the Marx Brothers' "Monkey Business" hiring the totally whacked-out Groucho and Company as shipboard bodyguards? Hartnett has that same "Are we on the same page?" attitude as the Marxes). Even more fun is the relationship between Hartnett and neighbor Lucy Lui (who has never been cuter or more energetic). When she walks into his 'borrowed' apartment, sees him naked, leaves, then pops back in, hoping to catch "the next show", you KNOW there is chemistry! And when was the last time you saw verbal sexual foreplay consisting of obscure James Bond trivia? That scene has such a Kevin Smith 'feel' to it that I looked for his name as a screenwriter!<br /><br />Bruce Willis is also fun, as a very smug hit man (he seems nearly 'typed' as a hit man or cop, these days). Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, and "Forrest Gump's" Mykelti Williamson also shine (it was nice seeing Aiello and Williamson, who I haven't seen much of, of late).<br /><br />Certainly, the ultimate 'pay-off' lacks the 'punch' of "Pulp Fiction", "Memento", or "Go", but it does reveal a compassion that is surprising, considering the body count!<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Paul McGuigan's jaunt into 'Tarantino Land' is stylishly diverting!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is great as the assassin, and Josh Hartnett is pretty good as the main character, though he looks a lot like Ashton Kucher to me. Lucy Liu got on my nerves as a little too chirpy. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley are somewhat wasted on the material, which is a revenge plot fantasy adventure.

Starring Josh Hartnett as Slevin, a feckless young man caught in a gang war with his pants down and Bruce Willis as Goodkat, the iron assassin who almost never fails, "Slevin" capitalizes on the father-child buddy movie with skill and elegance and features the best dialogue since "Pulp Fiction."  It is great to see first rate banter once again a part of blood-thirsty vengeance--together they make such beautiful music.  It has elements of the Newman's "Road to Perdition" with the first rate dialogue and excellent plot treatment of "The Sting."<br /><br />Just as Kevin Spacey's character in "Suspects" was so hopeless he was great, so is Josh Hartnett as the innocent Slevin caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Collared by two outstanding thug caricatures in a friend's apartment during a chance visit, he is mistaken for a poor stiff who owes inappropriate debts to inappropriate people.  What ensues is some of the most entertaining flashback story-telling since "Suspects" with the best rough and tumble dialog since "Pulp Fiction."  None of the dialogue is ad-libbed--it is all spoken exactly as penned by Smilovic.  According to director McGuigan "The words were so particular to this film that if the voice were to change, it would change the film dramatically..."  Kudos for him--at least for this film it works.<br /><br />Lucy Liu plays Lindsey, the over-involving girl next door who comes to borrow a cup of sugar from Slevin's friend and almost shares his fate at the hands of Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis).  If the film has a failing it is that these youngsters are too good to be true.  But compared to the character of Lindsey, the Mt. St.Helens of ever-erupting freshness, it is easy for the old fogies in the film to look bad.  Or at least to look old.  Liu continues on her run of box office successes after her role as Cottonmouth in Tarantino's smash hits "Kill Bill" Volumes 1 and 2 and as Alex, one of the deadly trio in "Charlie's Angels."<br /><br />Which brings us to Messrs. Freeman and Kingsley, two men whose skills and reputations have passed the professional into the legendary.  If you have time before you see this film, see Sir Ben in "Sexy Beast," possibly the best depiction of a real gangster in the last twenty years.  Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci in "Goodfellas" are the only ones who come close.  His recent box-office buster as Fagan in "Oliver Twist" had more lines than his part as Schlomo "The Rabbi" in this film, but was nowhere near as good.  Smilovic wrote the part of The Rabbi specifically for Kingsley and Sir Ben is able to take that brutally realistic gangster persona from "Sexy Beast" and bring those memories into the exact time-adjusted part for this film.  He is the same character, only aged to perfection--cranky in his old age, but still mean as a snake as ruthless as they come.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman has taken bits and pieces from his "Million Dollar Baby" character of Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, the washed-up palooka who still packs a punch and con Red Redding in "The Shawshank Redemption," and grafted them together into this visage of "The Boss", an aging black man who sacrificed everything to rise to the top of the New York mob.  There is nobody he hasn't killed or had killed, however innocent, to further his rise to the top.  But he can never forget the friendship he used to have with his arch-rival The Rabbi.  He can never stop wondering if his power was worth the loss of his son and his best friend.  He and The Rabbi now share penthouse apartments, fortified with three inch bulletproof glass, across the street from each other in the City.  Every day they stare down the barrel of their mortality and wonder how they could have done it differently.<br /><br />First rate supporting performances by Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman; gangsters with a gift for gab putting on their bad faces as Hartnett's flawed father figures.  Some of the flashiest two-fisted gun slinging by Willis since his work as the shooter in "Last Man Standing."  After his recent spotty record of pot-boiling lead roles, this clever and dynamic performance may be Hartnett's lucky number.  Writer Smilovic turns up the voltage.  Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>Following on from the good things already said by others:<br /><br />It's one of those flicks where nothing is as it seems, and I'm definitely going to give it a second viewing, because in the end I realized how everything was just so nicely wrapped up and the tangled web untangled itself in that second most pure of motivating emotions: REVENGE (the first one being 'Love' of course). You think 'The Bride' in Kill Bill is p-oed? Kiddo, you ain't seen nothing yet. Just about everybody in LNS dies by bullets, projected from silenced semi-automatics--not swords--but it works just as well. Lots of brains and gore spattering across the place, plus a neat twist at the end in a tale of a gazillion tangles and twists and quick non-linear time warps to explain what the hell was actually going on. And things just ain't what they seem. Nothing ever is.<br /><br />Revenge in LNS was not a dish eaten completely cold. In the final act, when the worst offender of them all gets his brains spattered across the inside of his car, the purity of the emotion and its raw darkness--and at the same time it's utter inevitability and sheer rightness--is beautifully portrayed by an actor, for whom I have acquired a new respect; for he evidences both, a subtle comic timing that needs to be seen to be believed, as well as a capacity to look like an almost-evil implacable dispenser of justice that had been far too long in coming. Very nicely done. Highly recommended for those of my disposition--though those of more tender sensibilities might find the blood and gore somewhat off-putting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I liked the acting was good; no wonder as they are talented actors. I did particularly like Lucy Liu effort that I thought was a nice touch in the story. The characters well several are overdone but it made for interesting stories. I was wondering how they all were to come together but when they did the stories with there twists were good. It was over the top but then that is Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Viewers will find themselves guessing wildly, along with the two mobsters in the movie that don't realize which end is up until it's too late. When the brutal killing of a young father unleashes a plan for revenge, it's hard to tell who is being played for a fool and why. I love it when the bad guys get jerked around! Bruce Willis plays a hit man with a heart, but who can still make pre-meditated murders go so smooth it's nearly poetic. There are some kinky sex scenes, but they aren't thrown in haphazardly. Lucy Liu's character is a good sidebar, playing a coroner who tries her hand at unraveling a string of clues based on what she's learned from detective shows. What she doesn't realize is she's putting her own life at risk by getting involved in a plan years in the making that will end up in bloodshed.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>There's really nothing much to complain about when it comes to this film. It's absolutely, unfailingly entertaining and rewarding by the minute. With great action scenes, high tension, an intricate and clever plot, great dialogue and a superb all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci, Lucky Number Slevin is a true pleasure, and for fans of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, it's practically too good to miss.<br /><br />Therein lies the film's problem - it tries a bit too hard to imitate Tarantino and to a lesser extent Ritchie as well, and in the process it loses something of its own voice. It seems that McGuigan actively tried to create a cult film, and to a certain extent he gets the job done; Lucky Number Slevin has some very memorable characters and some highly quotable lines of dialogue. In the end, though, it's just not quite memorable enough to carry that weight. It's a very impressive directorial debut, no doubt, but it has neither the soul of Reservoir Dogs nor the energy of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. In trying too hard to be cool and sleek McGuigan forgot that he has a voice of his own, and the film lacks a bit in soul and feel.<br /><br />Still, it's lots of fun, and certainly stands on par with a lesser Tarantino work - True Romance (Tarantino's script) immediately comes to mind. Lucky Number Slevin doesn't have the spark, the inventiveness and the cultural awareness that make Tarantino great and unique, but it never gets dull, and never loses its perfect pace. The storyline may be far-fetched but it works, and the twist ending is both surprising and satisfying; and killer performances from three key figures - Willis, Freeman and Kingsley - make the fast, tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogue an extreme pleasure. Lucky Number Slevin is not to be taken all too seriously - it's basically a crime thriller, to be taken more or less at face value, and despite the constant Tarantino comparisons it has nothing of the cultural and artistic statement of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill. For fans of the genre though, and for anyone looking for an evening of pure entertainment, you can't miss with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Reviewing films encourages following the opinions of fellow reviewers whose thoughts nail movies dead center: often reading reviews by certain reviewers encourages or discourages this reviewer regarding a controversial film.  Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film  almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.<br /><br />The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning.  But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff.  To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.<br /><br />The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem.  But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis.  There are some holes in the plot but the action is so well paced that they are inconsequential,  and for this viewer the end justifies the means.  A surprisingly and unexpectedly good evening's entertainment!  Grady Harp, September 06</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish and humorous action thriller featuring a star studded cast including Josh Hartnett (Sin City), Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Oscar winners Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Sir Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Lucy Liu (Kill Bill), and Stanley Tucci (Road To Perdition). The movie also features cameo appearances by Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing), and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown).<br /><br />The film focuses on a man named Slevin Kelevra, played by Hartnett, who is mistaken as a man named Nick Fisher by a pair of mob rivals, one a black man known as The Boss, played by Freeman, and the other a rabbi known as The Rabbi, played by Kingsley. The Boss's son had just been killed and he is sure that The Rabbi is behind it. So, The Boss assigns Nick, or Slevin, to kill The Rabbi's 'fairy' son to wipe off the debt of $96,000 that Nick owes him. The Rabbi, on the other hand, tells Slevin, or shall I say Nick again, that he owes him $33,000. The man working behind the scenes is a mysterious cold-blooded assassin known as Mr. Goodkat, played by Willis, who's planning a Kansas City Shuffle (you're not supposed to get that until you see the movie), while the private detective Brikowski, played by Tucci, is keeping an eye on that's happening and wondering who the heck Slevin really is.<br /><br />Without giving away the twist of events, the movie and its characters hold many secrets that eventually come to unfold at the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed Lucky Number Slevin a lot. The only flaw I'll point out to is the lack of background study on Bruce Willis's Mr. Goodkat character. Otherwise, this movie earns a Lucky Number four stars, or should I say flour stars?!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This movie boasts one of the most impressive casts of actors in recent memory. You got the heavyweights in Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, the middleweight in Bruce Willis, and the lightweights in Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu. They are all very good in playing these weird and quirky characters. The scene with Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley at the end is reminiscent of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro meeting face to face for the first time in Heat. Though this scene isn't quite as good, it is still some cool stuff.<br /><br />The dialogue is the only thing I didn't enjoy as I much as I had hoped. Some of it was good, but too much tried to be a Quentin Tarantino clone of sorts. I also had a problem with the fact that the ending explained everything down to the last detail. I prefer a movie that tells you what happened, but still leaves a little room for your own ideas.<br /><br />All in all, the movie was fun, inventive, had memorable characters, and you can't go wrong with the actors here. Even Josh Hartnett was good, especially as the film progressed, and Lucy Liu really  brought life into the picture and was a cutie to boot. Bruce did his silent hitman thing well, complete with an icy stare. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both ham it up in a good way, and they are fun to watch.<br /><br />Lucky Number Slevin may have an awkward title leaving people to be confused more than wanting to see the film, but it was a fun ride for me and I hope it finds its audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>I was gifted this movie and my first thought was, "What the hell is a Slevin?", but thanks to its clever dialogue, tongue-in-cheek humor, and excellent actors, Slevin quickly made it onto my short-list of favorite films.<br /><br />This is a film that savors contrast, both in visual as well as narrative terms. Almost everything, from the wallpaper and floor tiles, to chessboards, and especially the central characters, suggests duality, light and dark, good and evil. The film itself goes from clever comedy to brutal revenge tale in the space of a single scene.<br /><br />Cool visuals don't make a movie, but Slevin has plenty of cool in other places as well. Hartnett and Liu are charming and have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a long time. Freeman and Kingsley are fun to watch in roles they don't usually get to play, and Willis delivers his usual steely-faced assassin bit with just the right amount of humanity.<br /><br />DVD has no extra features - nada, zilch. So if you dig that stuff, you'll miss it here. Dolby Digital is available though, so you can at least get that theater quality audio.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>After hearing from friends and reading about this movie being associated with Tarantino's work, I promised to myself I would not go for that comparison in my review. Well...maybe promise is too strong a word. There is nothing I can do, because the film is exactly, and I mean exactly, the type of production you would associate with the creator of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908242">Pulp Fiction</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2LEY">Reservoir Dogs</a>. And to tell you the truth, those two films are a very good benchmark, if you liked them, you will definitely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />There is one aspect of the film that is going to put some people off right away: the non-linear plot. If you enjoy a film in which the different scenes have a clear relationship to each other, you may want to skip this one. However, if you have a good time with movies that give you what seem like unrelated tidbits of action, until these are connected towards the end, it is time to check cell number 1. Cell number 2 relates to violence, and this film has a pretty good amount of the vicious type of it, accompanied by loud sound effects. In this sense, once again, think "Pulp Fiction" and if you are good with that experience, you get to check cell 2. Finally, we get to a more common ground among viewers; those that like surprising twists in the plot and unexpected connections among characters that make you go "Aha!", which I think is the majority of people, can check cell 3.<br /><br />After you get your three checks, add on top of that some really great performances by an all-star cast, and great music Tarantino-style (sigh, I did it again), and you have the full package. Now sit back and enjoy, just as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed very much Scottish director Paul McGuigan's LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, a movie that works a little like an Agatha Christie novel. From the beginning of the film on, we have to confront facts that could or couldn't be true. For instance, Mr. Goodkat's frightening story about the slaughter of an entire family told to Nick Fisher seems very much real to us but, as soon as the hitman kills Nick Fisher, we have doubts about the story's reality. Secondly, the rest of the film is told according to Slevin's subjective point of view so that we are led to believe that what Slevin sees or tells is necessarily true. Like in an Agatha Christie book, we have to wait for the last 10 minutes of the film to discover who was lying and what really happened during the former 90 minutes. It's the essence of Cinema : to manage to convince the audience that what is shown on the screen is true.<br /><br />Now, I didn't feel any peculiar Tarantino influence in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, the movie lives by itself and frankly, it deserves to be seen if you like a smart story with good actors such as Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Stanley Tucci, Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A DVD zone Bruce's new haircut.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A very good film, Lucky Number Slevin, brings to the screen the story of an out-of-towner visiting his friend in New York who is brought before two powerful gangsters to whom he apparently owes money.  A case of mistaken identity or is there more than meets the eye?<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu (gorgeous as always!), Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Lucky Number Slevin is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Describing LUCKY SLEVIN is hard.  I enjoyed it a lot, but discussing much of the plot would give too many things away.  And there are really some nice surprises along the way.  Even when you see some of them coming, the writer and director manage to yank the carpet out from under you all the same.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, Josh Harnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, and Stanley Tucci deliver great scenes, coming off as chilling and quirky.<br /><br />Lucy Liu is a scene stealer in the early part of the movie, though.  She pops into the neighbor's apartment and bumps into Josh Harnett, who's dressed in a towel for about a third of the movie.  The dialogue exchange between them reminded me of the old THIN MAN movies starring William Powell and Myrna Loy.  It's rapid-fire and witty, so you have to be on your toes to catch it all.<br /><br />After a somber beginning about a chronic loser betting on a horse in a fixed race, the story picks up some twenty years later as two bookies are murdered.  Later, Slevin (Harnett) is mistaken for a man named Nick Fisher who owes the bookies money.  Unfortunately, now the bookies' bosses are trying to collect.<br /><br />In short order, Slevin is taken to The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and is told he can pay up the $96,000 he owes, or kill the son of a rival crime boss.  The rival crime boss is The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who later has Slevin kidnapped and brought in.  Slevin is then told he has 48 hours to bring in the $33,000 he owes the Rabbi.<br /><br />Things start to get complicated from there.  Obviously the real Nick Fisher has disappeared.  Lucy Liu gets determined that they should investigate and find out what happened to him, which provides for some really fun scenes between her and Harnett.  Then the police get involved, watching Slevin and trying to find out who he is.<br /><br />Through it all, Bruce Willis walks quietly and calmly, a professional hitman who has his own agenda and is orchestrating everything.<br /><br />The directing, the looping of the scenes to play over things that weren't brought out earlier, the flashbacks to earlier events, all play out really well.  The movie also reminded me somewhat of Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, which also played with time and sequencing of the stories.<br /><br />Although the end bogs a little as everything is explained, the trip leading up to it is great, and it was fun matching wits with the writer.  I had some of the overall story figured out by then, but I was still caught unsuspecting twice!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Lucky Number Slevin is one of those movies that sat around my media room unopened for a few weeks before I finally decided to view it. Too bad. I watched a couple of clunkers prior to watching this really good movie.<br /><br />I'd not heard much about Lucky Number Slevin's plot other than what I read on the outside of the DVD case. And that little blurb on the DVD case really wasn't that compelling. That's good because, as it turns out, the movie really captures the viewer with a where-the-heck-is-this going plot.<br /><br />Lucky Number Slevin is full of action, comedy, high suspense and moves along at a pace that keeps you in your seat for the full run. It has tons of very good performances by very good actors and the dialogue is captivating.<br /><br />After showing up at his friend Nick's apartment, Slevin is mistaken for Nick and thrust into a war between two crime lords where he's asked to either kill or be killed. Not much choice for the desperate Slevin. And that's all I'd venture to offer for fear of spoiling this flick with some great surprises and twists.<br /><br />Be warned, indeed other reviews here and elsewhere mostly have unnecessary spoilers and that's a shame. It's also a shame that a movie as good as this didn't do as well in the box office simply because the producers needed to make the promos deliberately ambiguous so as not to reveal any of the twists and turns. Kudos to them, because this is a film that is much more fun to view without too much upfront plot knowledge.<br /><br />If a good, action-packed thriller is your cup of tea, then Lucky Number Slevin is right up your alley. Worth the purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I decided to see this film after reading a couple of very interesting reviews. They were hinting at something different and intriguing, but the reviewers appeared reluctant to admit they were bowled over by the film. I tend to be distrustful of reviewers who "love" a film since it usually reflects the movie might be a little too different and might just be trying to hard to do something new. "Slevin" doesn't try to reinvent the genre (whatever it might be in this case), but it does certainly present sharper portrayals of prototypes we have encountered before, and there is also much more care given to a storyline that could easily baffle audiences. Instead, here is a film that delivers, with a very satisfying payoff!! 2006 has definitely given us outstanding work by Bruce Willis, an actor that manages to prove he is very reliable, versatile, and quite talented in some very unorthodox vehicles ("Pulp Fiction", "16 Blocks"). He now embodies the epitome of cool, with a performance that shows he can put enough energy to keep this very unpredictable tale going.<br /><br />The movie is an ensemble piece, and Bruce stands out as one of the mysterious pieces in the movie. There is great work by both Freeman and Kingsley who are two of the most versatile and best actors of their generation. When they are in their separate scenes they dominate the screen, when they are both together, the results are explosive. Lucy Liu is sweet and quite effective as the romantic performer. Josh Harnett makes a bid again for stardom in a performance that shows the right script can do wonders for talent like his.<br /><br />Going through the elaborate screenplay requires multiple viewings, but watching it for the first time can be a very enjoyable ride. It is only fair to say that any of the classic Greek tragedies certainly provided inspiration for the multiple twists and clever plot lines that hold the story together. The screenplay is the work of writer who understands background and depth are necessary to create interesting characters.<br /><br />Be prepared to see the multiple sides of the underbelly of society, and how deceptive looks and appearances can be. Also some stereotypes will be shattered as the writer allows its audience to have fun along the way. "The Usual Suspects" was only the introduction to the wildest ride of the year. Hope this is remembered later in the year because this is outstanding film-making, and whoever said that being bad doesn't pay, might not be rethinking that appreciation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Back in 1995, "The Usual Suspects" blew my mind, like it did to a lot of people. It was clever, it used an unconventional (at the time) narrative structure and it played fair with all its twists and turns.<br /><br />Soon after, it was totally overshadowed by all the filmmakers trying to do their versions of "Pulp Fiction," but it was inevitable that someone, someday, would channel "The Usual Suspects." And that's just what "Lucky Number Slevin" does.<br /><br />That's not a bad thing: I love "The Usual Suspects," but just like the films created by all the would-be Tarantinos, "Lucky Number Slevin" is a lesser film than the one it apes. It's a bit too clever with the dialogue -- which, despite deleted scenes showing how much many of the scenes were cut down, could still use still more cutting -- and the character bits are more clever than plausible much of the time. What mobsters would really be called the Rabbi and the Boss? The stylized nature of the film is either too stylized for a realistic film or not stylized enough for a less realistic one.<br /><br />That said, it's an entertaining ride. The cast is uniformly strong, and it's a treat to see Lucy Liu playing the girl next door (literally) instead of Yet Another Asian Dominatrix Type. The mob bosses are played with well-credentialed scenery chewing relish by a pair of Oscar-winners (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). And if Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis don't cover themselves in glory, they turn in solid performances.<br /><br />It doesn't escape from the long, long shadow of "The Usual Suspects," but "Lucky Number Slevin" is a fun (if overly self-aware) film in the same vein.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>When "Lucky Number Slevin" came out in theatres, it got pretty bad reviews. While critics didn't like it, audiences have responded to it really well which prompted me to watch it. This is not a movie that you're going to hear mentioned at Oscar time, but it's a perfect example of Saturday night entertainment. First off, it's obvious what movies have inspired it...Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, etc. And it's not better than those movies by far, but it's extremely entertaining, has great actors in it, and has good dialogue. The latter which sometimes sounds like outtakes from Pulp Fiction. After a strange opening (which won't make sense until the end of the film), we meet Slevin (Josh Hartnett, 'The Black Dahlia'). Slevin is having a bad day. He got fired from his job, his apartment has been condemned, he's caught his girlfriend cheating on him, and a mugger has just broken his nose. Now, he's at the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher and Nick isn't there. After meeting Lindsey (Lucy Liu), a friend of Nick's, two gangsters show up and transport Slevin to a large building; Home to The Boss (Morgan Freeman), a mobster who's son has recently been gunned down. Turns out, Nick owes The Boss a lot of money and since Nick is nowhere to be found...Slevin is responsible for paying the debt. Problem is, he owes The Boss 96,000 dollars. Instead, The Boss offers him a deal. Murder a rival mob boss' son. Slevin goes back to Nick's apartment, but is picked up by two more gangsters and transported to the building across from The Boss'.Here is The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, great as always); The Boss' rival. Nick owes The Rabbi some money too and Slevin has 48 hours to deliver it. Add in a hitman named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who seems to be playing both sides of the table and you have "Lucky Number Slevin." One thing I'm surprised the film didn't get more notice for was it's complex, intriguing, and sensical ending. The ending is actually really unpredictable and makes sense. The film's biggest flaw comes from the fact that it drags slightly in the last 20 minutes. Not the ending, but the pace of the film just lessens. Anyway, while I'd recommend seeing Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects before this, this is a really good movie and proof that you shouldn't always listen to well-known film critics.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>This was a super movie. Nice intelligent writing. Terrific acting by Hartnett, Kingsley, and Freeman. Willis' role cold probably have been played by anyone, but he was effective.  Lucy Lui was OK as the love interest, though not as cute as the part should have been. Her acting was good.<br /><br />The storyline was good, the beginning frustrated me a little - not knowing what the heck was going on. But you catch on fast and before you realize it, the game is ON.<br /><br />I liked Josh Hartnett in this the best yet of any of is prior films. He comes out of the cardboard box much more and we can see there is an interesting actor there. Kingsley is awesome & Morgan freeman is always superb.<br /><br />One complaint: what Einstein took decided to delete those funny scenes at the end of the DVD?  They were FABULOUS!  I liked the real ending though better than the optional alternate ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>What happens if you are in the wrong place, at the wrong time? "Lucky number Slevin" gives you a hint of that. Bear in mind, though, that appearences are not everything...<br /><br />The main character is Slevin (Josh Hartnett), who visits his friend Nick, and falls into the middle of a war between to mob bosses. Those mob bosses, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman), decide to use Nick to kill each other. The problem is, Nick has disappeared, and The Rabbi and The Boss think that Slevin is Nick. Now Slevin must decide what to do, taking into account that he has only a short amount of time to decide, and that he is being watched not only by the police and the criminals, but also by Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a notorious assassin. What will he do? And will he be able to keep himself and Nick's beautiful neighbour (Lucy Liu) alive?<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will like this movie, if you are looking for something entertaining that will not make you think you too much, and provided you don't mind the fact that there are many violent scenes. "Lucky Number Slevin" is not perfect, but has an hectic pace, many twists, and the kind of ending that will surprise you. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>This is the movie that put Josh Hartnett on the acting map for me. His earlier works have been easy enough to avoid and consider yourself lucky if you've been able to do so. I do hope this is a transition on his part into better roles; he was entertaining. His quick-witted quips keep you laughing and help you avoid the need to wonder what on earth is going on in the movie. They fill you in due time, even though I wouldn't be surprised if you figure out the ending before it unfolds; you wouldn't be the first.<br /><br />It seemed a little silly to have Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley in roles such as these since they were relatively small roles. But they definitely added big names to draw attention to a movie more people should see.<br /><br />I feel like I should have more to say about this movie, but I can really sum it up by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Lucky # Slevin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I'd been told that this movie was not particularly well-reviewed by the critics. I rented it anyway and I was very pleased with the viewing experience. Not to delve too deeply into it, there is some amazing star power in this talent pool. From Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman, on to Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci and down to Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu- there are plenty of excellent performances to go around.<br /><br />This movie is similar to many others you've seen, no doubt. There is a crazy back and forth plot happening and all is revealed at the end, after many twists and turns. The difference is that this time, it is actually interesting along the way - AND the ending actually comes together and ultimately makes sense.<br /><br />I would recommend the movie. It's  interesting and it should be able to keep you entertained for 109 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>This story takes us to the track<br /><br />A father with high hopes<br /><br />The sure thing that he's counting on<br /><br />Proves gambling's for dopes<br /><br />Flash forward to the present time<br /><br />A young man on his own<br /><br />He's in New York to see a friend<br /><br />But finds he's home alone<br /><br />Wrapped only in a towel<br /><br />He meets hot Lucy Liu<br /><br />The neighbor from across the hall<br /><br />(the towel drops on cue)<br /><br />And soon he's in deep trouble<br /><br />Wrong place at the wrong time<br /><br />Before he knows what's happening<br /><br />He's in the world of crime<br /><br />Atop two concrete buildings<br /><br />Each in an armored cage<br /><br />There lived The Rabbi and The Boss<br /><br />Now both in their old age<br /><br />Once they were friends, but now they're not<br /><br />The bitter blood has flowed<br /><br />Now neither ever leaves his home<br /><br />To go out on the road<br /><br />The Boss wants him to kill someone<br /><br />The Rabbi wants big money<br /><br />But through it all he keeps his cool<br /><br />And keeps on being funny<br /><br />Bookies falling down like flies<br /><br />And who is Mr. Smith?<br /><br />His reputation is so bad<br /><br />He's like an urban myth<br /><br />Violent and bloody too<br /><br />And with a shocking twist<br /><br />If you like funny gangster films<br /><br />This one should not be missed<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 22, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>This ridiculous movie, which is just recycled Quentin Tarrentino brashness, is so ludicrously over-plotted and so absolutely in love with it's hipness that this viewer really had to struggle to get to the end of it. Just like the recent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lucky Number Slevin is yet another irreverent excessively violent crime thriller that purports to by edgy and gritty.<br /><br />Thinking their story is smarter, edgier and cleverer than it actually is, the filmmakers hinge the story on a case of mistaken identity. Clad in a low slung towel for most of the film, Josh Hartnett plays Levin, a good-humored twenty-something who misguidedly gets himself caught in a face-off between a thuggish rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and an impassive crime lord (Morgan Freeman) imaginatively named Boss on the streets of New York.<br /><br />There's also Bruce Willis as a cool and smirking hit man, who figures into the mix, as does a flighty coroner (Lucy Liu, the film's lone bright spot) who lives next store to Levin and helps him sort out the various riddles and settle some scores along the way. The film begins with an extended back-story from the 1970's involving gangsters, murder and horseracing and once you put two and two together Slevin's relationship to the underworld kingpins isn't exactly hard to deduce.<br /><br />The movie's final twist is ridiculous and the overly talky script is downright irritating. Slevin's plot twists, action antics and potent cast may hold your interest for about the first ten minutes, but regardless of its immediate violent thrills, this revenge thriller / crime tale gradually loses it's luster as it disentangles in the threadbare threads of its own contrivances.<br /><br />And then there's Josh Hartnett - he's fabulous eye candy, but his performance is so bland and lackluster that it lacks the essential ingredient of urgency. It's the final indignity to an audience who has suffered through two hours of smug sadism - and subliminal homophobia - in the pretext of "entertainment." Stay well away from this one. Mike Leonard September 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"Lucky Number Sleven" is a story about names, mistaken identity and revenge.  This thriller mystery has gives a fast and clever ride with visual treats popping up throughout.  The story starts in the 1970's showing a family man caught up in a fixed horse race.  He loses all he has to face a bookie debt of $22,000.  He is beaten up and killed by hit men while his son waits in the car for him to return from the race.<br /><br />Then we fast forward to the present time and a slender Sleven (Josh Hartnett) arrives at his friend Nick's apartment in New York.  Sleven has been mugged and his wallet stolen, and he enters Nick's unlocked apartment.  Nick has disappeared, so Sleven makes himself at home and takes a shower.  Soon a cute and perky neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) pops in to borrow a cup of sugar to find Sleven fresh out of the shower in a purple flower towel - the scene with the towel is way too long.  However, the dialogue is sweet, smart and sassy between the two and they "click".  Lindsey feels that something bad has happened to Nick and starts her own private investigation to find Nick while Sleven mulls what to do without his wallet.<br /><br />After Lindsey leaves for work, Sleven is kidnapped and taken to meet with one of Manhattan's two most feared crime bosses (Morgan Freeman).  The Boss thinks Sleven is Nick who owes him $96,000 and forces him to agree to kill the son of his main rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) within three days.  This is because he believes the Rabbi has killed his son.  Sleven is wise-cracking throughout, which seemed odd, but the plot is complicated and surprising at several points.  After meeting with the Boss, Sleven is again kidnapped and meets with the Rabbi.  The Rabbi says Nick owes him $33,000 and in order to pay him off gets a murderous assignment.  Throughout we see the Police following Sleven and another strange assassin, "GoodKat"  Bruce Willis, working with both underworld bosses<br /><br />Despite all the mob murder scenes, there is a springy charm throughout the movie, especially between Lindsey and Sleven.  Quick dialogue and creative camera work help the plots and twists which sometimes confound the viewer, but hang in there to get the satisfaction of the surprises.  A comic book dialogue between villains gives  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley a somewhat sly kick.  I enjoyed the scenes of crime bosses looking across at each other from the highest floors of adjacent skyscrapers.  Their self-enforced confinement of 20 years inside palatial offices emphasized the shackles of fear crime creates.<br /><br />Lucky Sleven was a nice surprise for an under-rated movie, a stylish, smart thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>This was fun. Bloody, witty, and cool. A nice thriller with a bunch of bankable stars attached (Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kinsley, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, the list goes on). Enjoyable to the last moment, even if the ending is a bit too Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Around the genre of the gangsters there have been many interesting proposals. In this case we must recognize a very original treatment of the genre through audacious narrative ellipsis and a mesmerizing employment of the camera eye.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman two legendary actors, in the role of the respective bosses give us a tour de force performance that join forces to an intrepid and fabulous script, that must be seen carefully through his puzzled construction. Arresting images and a memorable stage make of this picture a must-see. Unstoppable tension and solid argument that reminds us  Tarantino (Reservoir dogs) and Tony Scott (True romance).<br /><br />Don' t forget this young promising director.</p></br></body></html>

But when it comes to plot, characterization and the inevitable love interest, it's an entirely different story. Or, rather, it isn't one. And that's a problem. Hamstrung by repetitve romantic and 'character' scenes, the plot never gets off the ground. While this may have been a deliberate choice - a movie-length Act 1 to an endless series of sequels - it just isn't interesting. Rather than coming up with a character-establishing adventure which is thrilling in its own right (as Brian Singer did so well in "X-Men"), writer/director Mark Steven Johnson opts for a more schematic, episodic approach, yoking it all together with tenuous motivations and a ponderous explanatory voiceover. Perhaps aiming for a broader demographic than under-25 males, romance is over-emphasised at the expense of the edgier, darker undercurrents which could have been more interestingly explored. But maybe that wouldn't have helped. For me, there's always something a little silly about these comic book superheroes violently working through their childhood traumas. It works on the page, but on the screen it feels false: perhaps increased fidelity to visual reality demands the same at the emotional level. Ironically, without the antidote of much deliberate humour (used to great effect in "Spider-Man") we end up laughing anyway. As he so often is in other roles, Ben Affleck is spectacularly unconvincing as Murdock/Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes an appealing heroine as Elektra, so it's a shame she won't be back. Colin Farrell as Bullseye finally gets to release the inner Irish wildman the tabloids keep telling us about, and is the only one who seems to be having fun. Michael Clarke Duncan booms his way through another scary-big-guy performance as the utterly superfluous villain (can anyone even remember what he wanted?). And John Favreau? I just pray he packed on the pounds for the role.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Believe me if I had listen to the bad reviews, I definately would have missed out on a truely amazing movie. Yes it is dark, and some viewers won't get it, but this is a superhero movie not another Citizen Kane(overated, but good). After the success of Spider-Man, Daredevil was destined for runner-up status. Darker than Spider-man (and has better special effects), this $80 million extravaganza was packaged for maximum global appeal, its the plot beginning when 12-year-old Matt Murdock who is accidentally blinded shortly before his father is murdered. Later an adult attorney in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Murdock uses his remaining, superenhanced senses to battle crime as Daredevil, the masked and vengeful "man without fear," pitted against dominant criminal Kingpin and the psychotic Bullseye, who can turn almost anything into a deadly projectile. Daredevil is well matched with the dynamic Elektra. This is a Hollywood product that die-hard fans will love. .... Why do people expect a huge deep thought provoking plot from a superhero movie! Daredevil is a must see!!</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>After the hugh success of SPIDER-MAN, it was obvious to many film observers that superhero films were back in vogue in a major fashion.  DAREDEVIL is the first film since SPIDER-MAN to test that theory and, while the film isn't perfect, it doesn't disappoint.  This movie tells the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who lost his sight when his eyes are exposed to toxic waste in childhood.  However, his remaining senses are amplified to a superhuman degree.  When his father is murdered by mob enforcers, Murdock decides to fight injustice in his own unique way.  By day, he works as a lawyer while he metes his own dark brand of justice nightly as the red-garbed vigilante, Daredevil.  Eventually, he meets and falls in love with the shipping heiress, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).  However, both of them are drawn into tragedy when they become unwittingly involved in the schemes of the city's crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his half-crazed assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell).  <p>At first glance, Affleck would be an unconventional choice for a superhero lead as he tends to play affable, yet somewhat bland, leading men-types, but he pulls it off quite well. You can believe that this is a man who is driven to fight crime while fighting his own inner demons. Also, with so many other characters competing for attention, Affleck succeeds in making and keeping the character as a major focus in the film.  This is opposed to the Batman films where the hero was lost among the villians and supporting characters. Garner is both beautiful and lethal as his love-interest. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin doesn't have an awful lot to do, but he does make the most of his appearances as the man-mountian behind the crime syndicate.  Colin Farrell is probably the only actor in the film who camps things up a bit as Bullseye, but he succeeds in making him a character to be feared even when we chuckle at his quirks.  <p>Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson obviously has a love for the material, having adapted it from the classic Frank Miller-written comics.  He also keeps the film going at a good clip, keeping the film at just over 100 minutes.  However, it would've been nice to see some character motivations more fleshed-out.  The plotline where Joe Pantoliano's newspaper reporter is looking to expose Daredevil is practically glossed over and it would've been nice to see more of the Kingpin's motivations. But this is mere quibbling on my part.  Johnson and his cast treat the material with respect and the film is never allowed to drag. Indeed, it succeeds where the last 2 Batman films failed in presenting its dark hero.  While DAREDEVIL probably won't reach the heights achieved by SPIDER-MAN, it is still a worthy entry in the superhero derby. Definitely one to recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Daredevil is empty, and silly.  Of course, you'd expect that from a movie that has a laughably bad fight/dance sequence involving Ben Affleck.  Yes, you heard right.  I was tempted to yell out, "Hey!  They're break dance fighting!"  Of course, I didn't.<p>Daredevil has plot that is mush--predictable when it ought to be surprising, dull when it ought to be exciting, and funny when it never really intends to be.  Ain't that a recipe for disaster?  I won't spend more time dissecting it because it just isn't worth it.  It represents the inevitable:  Bland corporate types seeing the Spiderman and X-Men money machines and wanting to cash in with uncreative drivel.  "Find me a superhero!  From Marvel if you can!  And get the Sexiest Guys on Earth to star!!  That's the ticket."<p>Don't make the same mistake I made.  Don't waste a good two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>I have to agree with Mauricio J. Heilbron Jr, MD in that this film gets slammed more than it deserves. While nothing mind blowing, I have to say this story was better than Ang Lee's HULK. My only real knock on it is there was spots that should've been explained like how did Matt Murdock get through school and into college? Where did he live during that time between his lawyer/Daredevil days and the days after his father's death?<br /><br />Still, I believe this film is the victim of the "Spider-Man" shadow. Don't get me wrong, I loved Spider-Man but it seems that every film based on a Marvel Character (with the exceptions of X-Men and Blade) gets compared to Spider-Man and I think that's so unfair. DD especially gets it because despite his own great history, most in the mainstream remember him as a on/off partner of the famous wallcrawler (though I would love if one day they did a film with those two teaming up).<br /><br />Anyway, Ben Afflick is okay as Daredevil. Jennifer Garder did surprise me as Elektra. Colin Ferrel is excellent as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan does a very believable Kingpin!<br /><br />I recently bought the blu-ray version of this film and it is great! It features the director's cut of Daredevil (which is the superior version in my view) and all the special features from BOTH the original 2 disc theatrical release and the original director's cut release! This improved film along with the bonus features make this THE version of DD to own!<br /><br />On the D.C. version, it goes from basically a hero looking for revenge for the death of his father and lover (Elektra) to a darker, more brooding anti-hero who seeks redemption. It also shows the Kingpin as more of a threat than the original theatrical release did and it features a subplot that makes the film make more sense and ties it together better! In one of the bonus features, it is revealed the reason the subplot was removed was for 1. time and 2. to make it PG-13 so that younger viewers could see it.<br /><br />While I know you have to do what the studio wants (and it wanted a PG or PG-13 film), DD is best told as an R-rated type film. While he isn't The Punisher, he isn't Spider-Man either. I personally wish this would've been the film that would've gotten released.<br /><br />Well, I digress and say that if you want to see this film and have a blu-ray player or a machine that plays blu-ray discs, GET THIS VERSION!</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>Maybe not the worst ever, but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.<p>I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much, he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics, and I was looking forward to this film. Yes, it's a comic book movie, but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film, you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay, Daredevil is blind, and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses, we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to, we get it, no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either. <p>This film takes "ridiculousness" to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike Spider-Man, he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However, there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible, I don't care how great he can here, there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air, or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give Spider-Man a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him. <p>By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts, it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win, which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall, yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra, his love, yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies, mistakes, and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license, but this film makes "Armageddon" look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity, there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider "Tomb-Raider" a masterpiece in comparison.<p>Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie, this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.<p>Did I mention that Bullseye (with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell) actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paper-clip into his neck?!<p>That being said, if you like this film, the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well, and the featurettes are fairly well done. This DVD has everything you could want if you're a fan of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>I thought it was smart, well written, well directed, and struck just the right tone for the material. Ben Affleck manages to make you believe in Matt Murdock, Jennifer Garner is both effective and stunning as Elektra. The movie focuses on the lead character and pushes almost everything else to the background. It's a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>I resisted Daredevil, because, frankly, there is such a glut of ?super hero? movies.  Not they are bad, but there are Xmen, Hulk, Spiderman?seems there is always another one, but nothing really that stands outs.  But I must say this movie surprised me.  With engaging performances by Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads, nice support from bad guys Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell and as the nose-for-news reporter Joe Pantoliano, plus super effects, it?s a fun movie.  There is a driving soundtrack that really sets the mood for the movie,<br /><br />music that will cause you to go out and buy the soundtrack.<br /><br />It?s a tight rope act to bringing a comic book story to the screen, too often a movie will take itself too serious, or it comes across as too cartoonish.  Davedevil manages that balance.  You have enough seriousness to keep you hooked, but it has that ?stretch the boundaries? feel to retain the comic book flavor.<br /><br />The store is the typical line.  The young idealistic kid witnesses his father playing muscle for the local hood.  Shock by the ?fall? of his hero, he runs away and ends up losing his sight to a chemical spill.  The kid fights back and takes the<br /><br />advantages his other senses now give him and won?t give into the tragedy.  The death of his father, later sending him down the road as the avenger for the downtrodden, the defender of justice.  Garner plays his love interest, but she is a pawn sacrificed by her fathers misdeed.  The romance between Affleck and Garner is solid, the chemistry very believable.  Great fight scenes.  All the mix to make this just a very enjoyable movie in this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>The Man without Fear hits the movie theaters and delivers in some areas and questionably in others. Ben Affleck plays a good enough Matt Murdock and his costume looks better than the ones in the old comic books. The fight scene at the bar needed some editing but most of the other scenes were somewhat good to very good. Garner delivers an average performance as Elektra. One of the problems with this film is that there were several logic holes. See spoilers at the very end if you want to read about some of them. Good choice with darkness and lights. Pretty good soundt rack fitting the themes of Daredevil even if some of the lyrics are a bit too much on the nose. Jon Favreu plays the beloved sidekick Froggy, Colin Firth plays Bullseye, Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin, Erik Avari plays Elektra's father and Joe Pantoliono plays the intrepid reporter. Small appearance by Ellen Pompeo, as the secretary of Murdock and Froggy's firm, who would later star in "Grey's Anatomy". The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again. SPOILERS: Elektra should have known she was fighting Matt long before she removed his mask; the fight scene between Matt and Elektra looked cool but a blind guy fighting it out publicly in front of a ton of kids is going to get passed around and then the secret identity is revealed. Woops. If his opponents knew that extreme noises would stun Daredevil why didn't they use them to great impact at the end of the film rather than fighting off? Those dudes weren't exactly chivalrous in combat. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; ACTION SCENES: B minus to B; TONE/CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday (2nd viewing); OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I am familiar with the basic story of the Daredevil comic books, so I think the movie does a decent job of adapting from the book. Sure, some people don't like this, and I don't claim it's a GREAT movie, but I honestly didn't think it was bad at all, and feel confident giving it a 4-star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>I'm not a real big Ben Affleck fan. The guys is just way to hyped for my taste, but I must say he was pretty dang good in this movie.<br /><br />Matt Murdock(Affleck) is blind. He's been blind since he was 12 when chemicals were spilled on his face. However, the chemicals changed him. While his sight was gone all of his other senses were strengthed to compensate for the loss of his eyes. Shortly after his accident his dad a boxer was killed after a fight for not throwing it. Matt had promised his dad to do something with his life so Matt does. He goes to law school and becomes a lawyer.<br /><br />Matt runs his own firm in Hells Kitchen with Frank Nelson(Favreau). They look out for the little people and are best friends. Matt fights crime by day as a lawyer, but at night he is the superhero Daredevil who is bring down crime and trying to stop the Kingpin(Duncan).<br /><br />One day Matt comes across a beautiful woman. After a short physical engagement he finds out that the woman is Elektra Natchios(Garner) daughter to a billionaire shipping heir. The two quickly fall for each other, but the Kingpin has declared war on the Natchios family and they aren't safe. The Kingpin has hired Bullseye(Ferrel) to kill them. Know Matt must save the woman he loves before time runs out.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is great. An all star cast was put togther for it. This movie had one of the biggest casts for a movie in 2003 with Affleck, Garner, Duncan, Favreau, Pantoliano, Ferrel, and cameos by Stan Lee and former Daredevil illustrator Kevin Smith. All of them are great in the movie and there isn't anything  to dislike about them. I can't believe Michael Clarke Duncan put on 20 more pounds for his role as the Kingpin. The guy is huge. I liked Jennifer Garner a lot. This woman is gorgeous and I could watch the movie for her alone.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good. They rival the first Spiderman movie. The costumes are pretty good as are the sets. This really was a well made comic book movie.<br /><br />Daredevil isn't your normal superhero. He's a much darker character. This movie is no Spierman or X-Men but it's good. If you like Superheros or action movies then pick this one up. It's pretty cheap and you won't regret it. It was a surprise hit grossing ove a 100 million in the U.S. so come enjoy what millions of other people have.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>No, it's not as good as Tim Burton's Batman, nor the original Superman or the recent Spiderman movies. But Daredevil still is a good comic book film that wins much of my praise by being true to the page in creating a very dark character in a harsh world<p>Still, it is not without its flaws, and if it weren't for some very unique traits I would rate this film as only mediocre. But what works here works exceptionally well. Beginning with the traditional origin story of Daredevil (Ben Affleck), a blind superhero whose remaining senses are greatly heightened, the movie shows how he became a vengeful vigilante who kills the bad guys rather then turning them in to face a potentially corrupt court system (Daredevil's alter ego Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day). This world is mean, and so is its superhero. But he wrestles with his conscious and wonders if he is a bad guy too. In this comic book world, people die. Including those you don't expect to. In other words, it more accurately depicts real life while still in a superhero world.<p>One particular unique thing about the film is how it illustrates Daredevil's radar sense. The vibrations he picks up are shown in a fantastic visual effect that has to be one of the best film realizations of a superpower in history. From the origin scene when he goes blind to a wonderful scene with Elecktra in the rain where he first "sees" what she looks like from the drops of rain on her face, the technique is used for characterization and "film moments," and never just to show off a cool special effect.<p>Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect. There isn't enough development of Elecktra and Daredevil's relationship, and bad guy Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) doesn't have enough screentime to villainify his presence. All the characters could have benefited from further characterization as well. But this is a comic book movie, after all, and in the end what matters most is how much fun it was. And Daredevil is a blast.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>Superhero movies. They're on their way this summer in the forms of the Incredible Hulk, a "League" of gentlemen, and some guy named Wolverine. Could Daredevil just be a taste of what's to come? If so, then I say bring on them crazy superhero mutants!<br /><br />Daredevil was a great surprise to me. To begin with, I'm not a fan of Daredevil, Ben Affleck, nor Jennifer Garner. Not that their stuff bores me, it's just I'm not big fans of their work. Daredevil changed that.<br /><br /> The story is simple. Murdock is a blind guy who has enhanced all of his abilities through his handicap. He uses these abilities to revenge the death of his father by giving justice to the city he lives in. When he meets Elektra, a new sort of justice comes into play.<br /><br /> Our leads give a fantastic performance and their chemistry was awesome. The rooftop kiss in the rain scene is - in my opinion - one of the best kiss scenes. Colin Farrel gives a hoot of a performance as a co-villian and Michael Clarke Duncan rocks as usual.<br /><br /> The action in this movie is high. There are a number of great fight scenes and action sequences. A bunch of adrenaline here.<br /><br /> I only have one complaint with this movie, and it seemed it moved too fast at times. I need a little bit more character development (partially with Elektra) for me. But other than . . .<br /><br /> Daredevil was a fun adrenaline-filled movie with the right amount of a side love story to settle it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>I was there when the Daredevil series hit the Elektra saga and the excitement that Miller &amp; Janson had already brought to the moribund series was incredible.  The mature story arcs with adult themes and actual character deaths were handled in a way not seen before in mainstream comics and put that group of artistic works over the top.  Daredevil the movie borrows liberally from that timeframe, after developing the lengthy back story of Matt Murdock's `blinding and awakening'.  I frankly didn't mind Affleck as Matt Murdock.  He certainly played him a lot more tortured than I remember from the Miller era. Duncan as Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin, also interesting but manageable.  Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner as Elektra round out the cast nicely.  The final death scene of Elektra is hauntingly familiar to fans of the comics, Bullseye uses the same dialogue leading up to `but me, I'm magic..' and who can forget that impaling on the sai with the tip extended through the body but not the clothes, making a small tent.  Yikes.  Garner doesn't bring the darkness inherent in Elektra out, but she actually did a pretty good job if you don't bring any preconceptions into the theatre.  I actually thought it was a pretty good film within in the confines of what it attempts to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A Film by Mark Steven Johnson<p>Daredevil is based on the Marvel comic book character.  Matt Murdoch (Ben Affleck) is a blind lawyer by day, but by night he is Daredevil, a vigilante crime fighter.  The movie opens and traces the origins of who Matt is and how he became blind, and later how he became Daredevil.  While this is not the main thrust of the story, it is essential storytelling to show us who this blind guy who runs around in a costume fighting bad guys is and how he got that way.  When he was a child, Matt was blinded by some toxic chemicals (aren't they all).  It took away his sight, but his other senses were heightened so much that Matt developed a sort of radar (sound waves reflecting off objects gives him a sense of where they are, much like bats).  When his father was murdered, Matt dedicated his life to helping those who could not protect themselves.  In the real world, this led to him becoming a lawyer and fighting for justice, but when the law does not work, he becomes justice himself and fights as Daredevil.  <p>It is after this exposition that we get a chance to see what the story of the movie is going to be.  We meet Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a caf&eacute; and Matt is interested enough that he tries to follow her.  Elektra doesn't want to be followed and they get into a little fight that is pretty much their courtship scene.  It is very well done and it gives us clues on how they get interested in each other.  While Elektra and Matt are getting more and more acquainted and friendly, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) has put out a hit on the life of Elektra's father (Erick Avari).  Kingpin sends out Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill her father and in the process Bulleye ends up implicating Daredevil.  Elektra doesn't know who Daredevil is yet, and now Daredevil wants to take down Kingpin.  This is the major conflict of the movie.  <p>Bullseye steals pretty much every scene he is in, but I don't feel that there is any exceptionally weak part of the movie.  Daredevil (the movie) isn't great, but it is a solid comic book movie and despite the backlash against Ben Affleck he actually does a credible job both as Matt Murdock and Daredevil.  Solid casting all the way through the movie. As a film, it was a little bit better than Spider-man.  It isn't as good as X-Men,  but this movie has been unfairly bashed.  Like I said, it isn't great, but it is a decent little movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Daredevil" has always been one of my favorite Marvel characters.  It truly was a surprise to me when I first learned that a film was actually going to be made about him.  He teamed up with Lou Ferrigno's "Hulk" when that TV series was used to crank out a few TV movies, but that particular flick was wretched.  It did no justice to the "Daredevil" character.<br />This "Daredevil," however, stays fairly true to the comic book, although I felt the story dragged somewhat.  The worst part of the movie was when Murdock and Elektra first meet.  The scenes with the two of them "play-fighting" came across as too rehearsed and just downright sugary.  Too sugary for a complex hero like "Daredevil."  Other than that, the movie is very good.  Comic faithfuls and general movie-goers alike will not be let down by this film.  It contains enough action and humor for anyone, and seems to flow in the same vein as Michael Keaton's portrayal of "Batman" in the first of that series of movies.<br />The film is very dark, and very violent, which stays true to form when compared with the comic book, especially during the Frank Miller era.<br />Whenever I watch "Spiderman," I get this happy feeling from when I was a child still growing up.  It takes me back to a time when superheroes were clean cut, patriotic, and all-around good guys.  When I view "Daredevil,"  it takes me to my teen years when I thought the world was against me and no one was ever going to help me through.  At that time, superheroes were no longer the good guys, they had become as complex as normal human beings and fought with themselves more than against an enemy.  This type of hero is closer to the real deal, he has problems, both physical and emotional, and there are no defined enemies anywhere.<br />One other small note, if you have young children, I don't suggest letting them watch this film.  "Daredevil" was geared more toward adults in the comics and so is this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>and have a 6.1 or 7.1 system then you'll really want to see and hear this film.  I have a THX 7.1 system and even though i thought the film was lacking in all aspects, the sound is out of this world.  I'm not a fan of this kind of film, it was fun to watch but not really worth the money to buy.

The one thing that separates this costumed do-gooder (who goes by the name Daredevil) from his comic book brethren like Superman and Spiderman is that Murdock/Daredevil happens to be blind.  The same accident involving radioactive chemicals that, as a boy, deprived Matt of his eyesight also had the bizarre effect of heightening and enhancing his other senses, most notably hearing and touch, to an astonishing degree (it should be pointed out that little is done in the story with taste and smell).  The accident also appears, inexplicably, to have given him the power to defy the laws of physics and gravity.  Like any superhero worthy of the title, he uses these preternatural skills to right wrongs and bring justice to the imperiled and helpless citizenry living in the urban jungles of New York City.  <p>The hero's handicap seems to be about the only element, in fact, that distinguishes the movie "Daredevil" from the earlier films based on those other characters.  As conceived by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, the tone of this film is a few shades darker than the one in "Spiderman" and a few shades lighter than the one in "Batman" and "Darkman."  Since there is nothing particularly fresh or groundbreaking offered in this film, one begins to wonder why Hollywood feels such a compelling need to drive this particular genre into the already over-saturated ground (even adolescents, the target audience for this type of film, seem to be tiring of all these offerings lately).  "Daredevil" provides all the requisite scenes of its superhero soaring through the air, jumping from building to building, and karate-chopping his way to victory over a plethora of bad-guy enemies.  But it's all starting to feel a bit old hat by this time, so much so that, even in the moments when "Daredevil" is good, the film doesn't feel innovative and fresh enough for us to really commit to it.  Ben Affleck, with his earnest and stolid seriousness, does manage to bring a certain gravity to the main character - and his relationship with Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a young woman with some "superhero" moves of her own, is genuinely charming and touching at times.  There is a lovely scene in which Matt envisions Elektra's beauty by hearing the raindrops falling on her face.  It is in rare moments such as this that "Daredevil" rises above the conventions of its genre, but such moments are very few and far between indeed.  Most of the running time seems to be spent on characters performing acrobatic kickboxing moves on tops of skyscrapers (all of which are decked out with statuary in places where nobody would ever be likely to see it).  Colin Farrell invests the implement-wielding villain, Bullseye, with an air of sly menace that makes him a worthy foil to the lovestruck boy wonder of the piece.  I must say, in way of a caveat, that some of the violence in the film is uglier and more mean-spirited in nature than is, perhaps, justified by the material. <p>"Daredevil" tries for a little thematic richness by dramatizing the internal conflict being waged inside Matt's psyche between the need to let the legal system runs its course and his own desire to achieve a little vigilante-type justice for the victims when the court system itself fails.  But that theme is never dealt with at any great level of depth.  The art direction, action sequences and special effects are generally impressive, but even they contribute to the generalized feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that hangs over the work.  Maybe it's finally time to outgrow our obsession with superheroes who come out of nowhere to fight our battles for us - and time to stop always thinking of ourselves as some sort of defeated underdog in need of protection.  There are certainly enough life-sized heroes living and working in our own communities and neighborhoods to serve as our inspiration.<p>Movies like "Daredevil" may, finally, have run their course.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>With every rule there are exceptions.  The rule for Daredevil is you either loved it or hated it.  Die hard Daredevil fans will most likely hate it due to it butchering of the story lines taken from the comics themselves.  Those who are not fans will most likely enjoy it for it effects, the love story and kinetic action.  I am the exception that I spoke of earlier.  Yes, the characters, story arcs and even some of his powers have been altered for unknown reasons, but if you watch it for what it is, it's pretty good.  No where near the statis of Spider Man, or Xmen (1 or 2), or I suspect even as good as the upcoming Hulk.  But Daredevil was never a wholly mainstream book and it's readers were not always faithful.  Changing writers made the books appeal dip up and down like a rollercoaster.  In turn the cutural consequences of messing with the character didn't carry the weight that it would if characteristics were changed for Spider Man or Xmen.  I liked the movie as a whole, but some aspects were foolishly changed and I cannot understand why.  It's action packed, the chemistry between Garner and Affleck is good, but not great.  Affleck actually plays the character well, and accuratly.  It's strange that with his hollywood status, and his well known liking of the character, that he let this inconsistancy happen.  But it could have been his idea, who knows.  There will most likely be a sequel, let's hope things get better.  I would actually give it three and half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>Daredevil is my first superhero film. No, I didn't see X-Men, Batman, or Spiderman, but from the moment I read the synopsis of Daredevil, it was the only choice for me. I come from the school of tortured souls: Louis from Interview With the Vampire, Nick Knight from Forever Night, Father Kiernan from Stigmata. I want my hero to be both powerful and remorseful. Daredevil is both. <p>Blinded as a child by a freak accident, Matt Murdock's other four senses are hypersensitive. As an adult, Matt is a pro bono lawyer in Hell's Kitchen, but despite his best efforts, his clients don't get justice. By night Matt dons a red leather costume complete with horns and doles out the deserved justice to rapists, murderers and thugs. But he is a tortured soul and seeks spiritual relief in a nearby church, the priest being one of the few that knows of his dual identity as Daredevil.<p>Matt views his gifts as more of a curse: tormented by the extreme noise of the everyday, he sleeps in a sealed chamber. His cupboard is stocked with Vicodin and assortment of painkillers. His body is covered with scars, showing all too well that he is only human. And his life gets more complicated when he meets the beautiful (yet lethal) Elektra. Both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring chemistry and believability to their roles, and there is definitely onscreen chemistry between the two. Matt's faith is tested as he is faced with losing everone and everything he's ever loved at the hands of Kingpin; it's a bitter fight to the finish.<p>The storytelling is at times disjointed, the camera work seizure inducing (made me think of MTVesque Stigmata), the music an ear splitting blend of rock, alternative, and Rob Zombie. The visual and stunt work is incredible, with superhuman leaps, suspended kicks, and weapon trajectories (never knew that paper clips could be lethal weapons, did you?). There are moments of dark humour, most provided by pottymouthed Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jon Favreau as Matt Murdock's sidekick. Sadly, the love story between Elektra and Matt didn't really play out much, and the film is short (103 min.). I found the ending unsatisfying, although it obviously sets up a sequel. In spite of a few hiccups along the way, Daredevil is one heck of a wild ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Like every big movie star on the map Ben Affleck has his share of bad movies that no one cares about. Daredevil is not one of those movies. I was surprised to see that DD was entertaining from start to finish. Keep in mind that I'm hardly a comic book freak, in fact I've never read a comic book in my life. A sin perhaps..but oh well. It didn't stop me from enjoying the cool characters and style of this comic book turned film. Ben Affleck was surprisingly effective playing a super hero. I didn't picture it at first. He plays the title role. And causes no room for complain here. Colin Farrell plays the villian Bullseye. And although he wasn't on screen as much as you might think, he was quite a presence when he was. Now Jennifer Garner was a scene stealer as Elektra. She was worth the price of addmission alone. Rounding out the immpessive cast is Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. I've heard others say he's about as scary as a giant teddybear. Well he is a great actor in my opionion and I thought he played the role very well. Once again not on screen as much as I expected. The main thing that DD does right is that the hero is the main focus like he should be. One complain about the Batman films was that the villians always outshined and over shadow'd the hero. That's not the case with Daredevil. FINAL WORDS: DD is an excellent action adventure film that can be enjoyed by old fans and new ones.  ..MOVIEBUFFS: Look for Kevin Smith in a cameo.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I have Both DD Dvd Movies, The Original Double disc and the Director's cut. Garner is very Beautiful and as Electra very good, While Michael Clarke Duncan did a great job as Kingpin, It would have been better had it been true to the comic book. Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. and Collin Farrell As "Bullseye" is really good too. The Director's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot. Both versions are good. Buy both.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Daredevil has a bit of every superhero mixed in, and has made an all-powerful superhero. Or perhaps not! Technically, in my opinion, it should be DaredevilMAN (Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc), but they probably thought that was too complex for people to understand.<p>Ben Affleck is really good in this, and he plays the part of a blind guy perfectly! I was a bit sceptical about this, as I wasn't sure it would look right, but by the looks of it, he had contacts in, making him look like he had cataracts or something!<p>Although, he can actually &quot;see&quot; particularly if it's raining, which was kinda weird. The whole scenes where he &quot;sees&quot;, is really very much like the scenes where Keanu Reeves gets blinded in Matrix Revolutions by the nasty guy, and he sees shapes in the fire etc. Well, these scenes are quite similar, although more blue, and nicer.<p>I really Jennifer Garner as a character, although her whole storyline was dropped at one point, for a very good reason. But at the end, it almost seems like she was still around, if you get my drift. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean!)<p>I didn't like Michael Clarke Duncan as the bad guy in this. After seeing him in movies such as The Green Mile and Armageddon, and others which I forget, he always plays the good guy. He's the big friendly giant, and I just keep seeing him as John Coffey! Everyone knows Michael Clarke Duncan is a bad guy, but he apparently had to gain an additional 40lbs, on top of his usual weight, which would make him pretty heavy! (It doesn't really show, as he looks bigger in Armageddon &amp; The Green Mile)<p>I wasn't sure about Colin Farrell being in this movie. Personally, I don't like the guy, but I'm sure it's the way he's portrayed in the press: doing god-knows-what with Britney Spears,  drinking , smoking, all the things that I find a turn off in a guy. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy however. But oh my God, sure he didn't have a lot of lines to learn, but this has to be the first movie I've actually heard him SPEAK in! I've seen trailers for Phone Booth, and believe it or not, all you non-believers out there, the guy is not an American, but he's from Ireland. And he speaks in the most gorgeous 'Orish' accent ever! Shame he didn't have more lines to say, cos I could have listened to him talk all day!<p>If you look closely, you'll see a very surprising person making a cameo! The one and only Kevin Smith! I thought it was him, but he looked different. I think his beard was a lot more trimmed!<p>There's a lot of braille used in the movie, due to the fact that Matt Murdoch is actually blind. The start credits use lights from the skyline to form braille, and then spell out the actors names. Also interesting, the necklace at the end of the movie, also spells out Elektra in braille.<p>Most of the extras look quite good, and I was pleased to finally see the the entire video for Evanescence's &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. (This was the song that brought them to the attention of the music industry, but another song of theirs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, is used during a funeral scene, adding a whole other dimension to the song. It's one of my faves of their songs, and seeing it played at a funeral scene, is really creepy - the lyrics totally match.) The rest of the extras look good, but basically, you need a chance to actually sit down and view them all. The extras include: audio commentary by director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster; &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil&quot; documentary with optional enhanced viewing mode; Jennifer Garner screen test; 6 multi-angle scene studies; Kingpin featurette; HBO First Look special; &quot;Moving Through Space: A Day with Tom Sullivan&quot;; 3 music videos: &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; by Fuel, &quot;For You&quot; by the Calling, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; by Evanescence; still gallery; &quot;Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil&quot; documentary; and &quot;Shadow World Tour&quot;: an in-depth look at &quot;Daredevil's sight&quot;. On the back of the DVD, it is mentioned that there is a gag-reel, but it's not obviously included as a separate extra - it's probably in amongst the extras that I skipped!<p>This is a great DVD, and will be a welcome addition to anyone's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Marvel Has awesome superheros and Daredevil is one of them.

He lives in<br /><br />external darkness, but yet he sees the light in<br /><br />innocent people who he defends by day, and harms their<br /><br />perps that have been discarded by the justice system<br /><br />and thrown into his own brand of justice. He plots<br /><br />revenge on anybody that harms the innocent. He then<br /><br />takes on the man that is making him do his job.<br /><br />The Kingpin is his main enemy and he must bring him to<br /><br />justice before anymore perps get back on the street<br /><br />Well, I have seen some comic book movies bomb and fail<br /><br />to grasp what the comics are about.<br /><br />I also have seen some filmmakers tarnish what is held<br /><br />dear to some people. I have to say, This is how a<br /><br />comic book movie should be done. Everything is not<br /><br />perfect, but it gets its point across and makes sense<br /><br />and makes the film enjoyable to watch. Also, even<br /><br />though there were some horrendus actors, I have to<br /><br />say, that Ben Affleck pulled off the performance of<br /><br />Matt Murdock decent enough. I also thought that<br /><br />Jennifer Garner was just eye candy and Colin Farrell<br /><br />was wasted as Bullseye.<br /><br />There were humongous plot holes in this. I<br /><br />was absolutely questioning how some of the things were<br /><br />being done and why. Some stuff felt out of place and<br /><br />and didn't really gel with what was going on in the<br /><br />film. It really made the experience of watching the<br /><br />film less enjoyable. I do not like point out plot<br /><br />holes to myself when I am watching a movie. I want the<br /><br />director to make sure the film has no plot holes. When<br /><br />a film has plot holes like Daredevil had, it makes you<br /><br />question the writing of the script and the screenplay<br /><br />by whomever wrote it. It really ticks me off when a<br /><br />writer makes such mistakes when he is writing a movie<br /><br />and trying to insert plots. What the writer did here<br /><br />was a failure to express what was going on. The only<br /><br />thing that I liked about the writing/screenplay was<br /><br />that he kept it dark and grimy and evil and good.<br /><br />The acting by Ben Affleck barely impressed me because<br /><br />Ben Affleck isn't that great of a actor and in his<br /><br />other roles, he has failed to impress me with his<br /><br />chops. The only movie that I actually liked him alot<br /><br />in was Good Will Hunting and he was very impressive in<br /><br />that. Mainly, I prefer his counterpart, Matt Damon,<br /><br />who by far is a more accomplished actor than he is. I<br /><br />hate to say it here, but Colin Farrell was wasted<br /><br />here. He was basically the best performance out of the<br /><br />bunch and I was satisfied with his performance as<br /><br />Bullseye. Jennifer Garner is just eye candy, plain and<br /><br />simple. She was there to provide the steamy part of<br /><br />the movie when she has the part of Matt's crush,<br /><br />Elecktra. I cannot believe they decided to make a<br /><br />spin-off of a eye candy character. Micheal Clarke<br /><br />Duncan is, in my opinion, a decent actor at best. I<br /><br />feel that he has had one great performance in his<br /><br />career and that was in The Green Mile. Again, he<br /><br />failed to impress me as the Kingpin and I was left<br /><br />unsatisfied after the movie ended.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws, its sometimes<br /><br />good performances  and sometimes not so good<br /><br />performances . But it was still a entertaining movie<br /><br />that I enjoyed watching but had the experience ruined<br /><br />by the gaping plot holes, the sometimes cringe worthy<br /><br />acting, and the lack of where the film was going. I<br /><br />was enjoying the experience of a comic book on the<br /><br />screen but the flaws absolutely ruined it for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>As of this review there are 172 used and new copies of this movie for sale.  172?!  I have never seen any film that so many want to be rid of at one time.  Alright, the main problem, and this carries on throughout the story, is that I expected Morpheus and Neo and Trinity from "The Matrix" to show up at any moment.  Or, at least, to see Batman go flying by overhead and pausing ever so slightly to cover the Moon.  Where o' where did Daredevil's super-abilities come from?  Okay, for the sake of comic book fantasy I can buy into a blind superhero with the ability of echo-location.  It makes for some interesting and often cool special effects shots mixing sound and visual action.  But at no point does it make clear why he can suddenly jump off a building, fall for ten stories, then bounce athletically from scaffolding to scaffolding until he lands without a scratch.  By the end of the film Daredevil is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, across four-lane streets!  Also, there are so many moments that rip off "Batman" and "Batman Returns" that this film is really nothing more than another contrived superhero flick.  Also, contrary to my earlier statement which involved specific special effects, most of the other effects are horrible, looking more like computer game characters battling one another, then editing in close-ups of the character's faces.  It all makes for some surreal continuity and requires a serious suspension of disbelief.  Overall, this is a lame superhero movie with a flat script, bland performances, and ideas stolen from previous blockbusters in the feeble hope at repeat success.  Don't help out the studios who insist on making the same kinds of films again and again.  Do not buy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>Blind in his youthfulness throught his father a child within aggressives other children begin to develop very many others senses whitch make of him a isolated human prodigy but also he defelop a considerable physical force and become an acrobat fighther very much rapid (interpreted by BEN AFFLECK) the death of his father has marked his mind forever !

There are a few plot holes, but the movie is worthwhile.<p>On the technical aspect, DVD's don't get much better than this.

Although some things have been changed and Bullseye has no costume it's a very good film.  It is more realistic than Spiderman and I'd like to say much better. I think this would make a great TV series because DD fights contemporary criminals like the Kingpin and other parasites of society.  Let's hope we see them again in some type of series.

The movie is not super fantastic, I guess I did not really like Ben Affleck in the role, and the fighting scenes just seemed too stiff, and not fluid and natural.  I did like the scene where a young daredevil fights three bullies blind was really nice.  Colin Fareel as bullseye was excellent casting.  He plays crazy really well.  Him losing the power to use his hands renders him powerless.  Nice touch.  I also liked Micheal Clarke Duncas as Kingpen.  With his imposing size he made a good villan.

I didn't mind the plotline of 12 yr. old Matt Murdock being blinded by a splash of Industrial waste and soon after developing sonic vision, I just couldn't get into the story.<br />Ben Affleck was all right as adult Matt but I think I liked the young actor who did Matt Murdock at 12 better. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra but you can see her doing much the same every week on TV in Alias,for what she probably cost they should've given her more screen time. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was pretty good although I think he gave up too easily in the climactic battle with Daredevil.<br />The best fight scene in the movie, if you could call it that, was when Elektra and Matt Murdock had a sparring match on some teeter-totters in a playground.<br />The extra's are what I'd most likely buy this one for.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>There are several reasons why this movie is such fun.

Ben Affleck as the Daredevil superhero and Colin Farrell as the villian &quot;Bullseye&quot;.  If this film did not have Colin Farrell in it, I probably would not have  seen this film on DVD and there is an &quot;Easter Egg&quot; in the &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen&quot; frame. Just press the left arrow on your DVD remote.  I enjoyed this film better than the recent Spiderman and the first hour of The Hulk (2003). I was surprised to see David Keith (An Officer And A Gentleman), an actor I like, as the Daredevil's father and a boxer.  Good casting there.  Also an excellent cast of Joe Pantoliano and Paul Ben-Victor.  By the way, keep watching the end credits.  There is a funny clip of Colin Farrell as &quot;Bullseye&quot; that changes the story and the entire fate of his character.

First, Daredevil is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name). <p>  Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you could'nt really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say "original" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.<p>  Will they make a sequel? Probably, the producers should make one, maybe next time they'll have Frank Miller help with the script.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>After X-Men blew everyone away by actually being GOOD, movie rights to comic books started popping up all over the place. It was like after Survivor, one after another a new reality show came out and it's still going. Then came a very good adaption of Spiderman. Then came this. Well this...eh.<p>Matt Murdock is 12 or so with a prize boxer fighter of a dad. After witnessing something a bit troubling that his dad is doing, he runs off and gets blinded by toxic. Only instead of being permanently blinded, his other 4 senses actually are heightened and his vision becomes like a radar using sound. In one scene, a train makes his vision go all screwy, a simple tap on some bars creates a wave which &quot;clears&quot; the vision and keeps it normal.<p>Murdock now grown up, is getting a bad name on the streets and also meets the gorgeous Elektra, the daughter of a wealthy tycoon. Due to some bad timing, Elektra sees Daredevil escaping, thinking he killed her father. Not only dealing with Elektra's revenge, he must tend with Bullseye, a psychotic who has extreme accuracy with anything he throws, and Kingpin, the head honcho and a massive man.<p>After watching this film, I didn't really have desire to watch it again, unlike the first 2 Batman's or Spiderman. Despite some fine acting(and very good looks) from Jennifer Garner and a very nice job from Colin Farrell and a rather surprisingly good Ben Affleck, watch this once</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>There is something extremely deep, dark and foreboding about Mark Steven Johnson's "Daredevil." In many surface ways it is like the Tim Burton "Batman": with even the daylight scenes taking on a muted, smoky, fuzzy ambience probably as a way of showing how our blind hero views the external world.<br />Daredevil is like no other Super-Hero of recent memory though, for his human traits out number his extraordinary ones: he is first and foremost a feeling human being searching for a way to avenge the death of his father and doing it in the only way he knows how...by killing off all those who have done his father wrong.<br />Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil as a vulnerable man prone to all the usual human foibles even though possessing super-human traits: hearing, smelling and interpreting voice and motivation. Affleck is a conflicted hero, prone to seek the guidance of his priest and feeling flummoxed and unsure by all that he does.<br />Jennifer Garner plays Electra, Daredevil's love and ultimately his nemesis with a physicality and sexual allure only hinted at by her TV series, "Alias."<br />Garner and Affleck are like Superman in that they are above reproach in their behavior in the world that they inhabit. It is up to Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to throw a wrench in the proceedings with his over-the-top prerformance.He kills as sport and stands for everything that Daredevil and Electra do not: rampant humanity gone berserk. Farrell is disgustingly assertive, aggressive and repulsive: a great, physical performance.<br />"Daredevil" is a success because it takes itself very seriously and does so without the least amount of adherence to any known code of ethics. It creates an extraordinary world and inhabits it with characters that have the ring of truth and substantial humanity that strike us as reality, though perhaps jaded, in our world as it stands today in this year, 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This turned out to be a very entertaining movie.Ben Affleck is<br />the star of this movie in the role of Daredevil and Matt Murdock.<br />He is blinded as a 12 year old.He develops radar like vision and super reflexes and abilities.In adult life he becomes an attorney and also becomes superhero Daredevil.He fights to obtain justice.He meets a girl named Elektra(played by Jennifer<br />Garner).He father is ordered killed by the Kingpin(played by<br />Michael Clark Duncan0.He gets hired killer Bukk's Eye(played by Colin Farrell)to do the deed.Elektra attempts to avenge her<br />father by doing battle with Bull's Eye.She loses and the vengance<br />is left to Daredevil.He does battle with both Bull's Eye and the<br />Kingpin.This is an exciting movie that you will enjoy watching.<br />Buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner actually can do this stuff...it makes you feel sorry for Ben<br />Affleck having to do fight scenes with her.

It is a sad story with an kind of upbeat point of view with a mystery of the Mother's necklace.<br />From a Marvel comics point of view, it is an upgrade for the second line superhero, the Daredevel, to put him in the ranks of Spiderman and Batman.<br />Ben Affleck is too gentle a fellow for this type of role and probably shouldn't have been cast for it: he is more a Gary Cooper type "reluctant hero" than the revenge crazed blind man. It needed a person who has a glow of inner torment... he did a good job anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Daredevil is by no means a perfect film but when it comes to eye candy films I take them for what they are which is eye candy. Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always. My only complaint with the film was I feel it needed more action but I'm guessing since this wasn't a hit then we won't get sequel with loads of action. It's a fun film just don't take it seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, should probably be described as one of Marvel's lesser superheroes; at least, nobody has yet penned a Complete Guide to him, as they have to Spiderman, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, who have also been given filmic incarnations.  And on the whole, so far, I think their versions are better than his.  DD, like Spiderman, calls New York his hunting ground, and like Spidey he is perceived as a vigilante.  But when DD is "at work," he's all business--there's no humor or lightness to what he does at all, and unlike Spidey, he often sets out specifically to kill those he sees as transgressors against justice.  His motivations are to some extent understandable--his alter ego, Matt Murdock, is an attorney whose father, a boxer trying for a comeback, was murdered on the night of his great triumph, and Matt himself, as a boy, was often a target for bullies--and even laudable to anyone who has grumbled about people "getting off on technicalities" or "beating the system."  And, as is shown in an early courtroom system, Matt's superpowers, which include greatly enhanced hearing, serve him as a kind of biological lie detector: when an accused rapist claims on the stand that his victim "enjoyed it," Matt knows by the rate of his heartbeat that he's lying.  Still, this is a very dark, violent film, and not one that I could really enjoy.  To be sure it has its moments: the early flashback to Matt's boyhood, showing his strong bond with his father, how he got his powers, and how he began to train them; the beautifully choreographed "fight" between Matt and the love of his life, Electra Nathios, on the day they meet; Daredevil's heart-stopping leaps from New York's towering buildings.  And villain Bullseye is a very creepy psycho--just the kind of person you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  At the end, though, I found myself wondering about questions that weren't addressed.  How did an orphaned kid from a poor neighborhood find the money to go to college and law school?  Why and when did Matt/Daredevil confide in his local priest regarding his secret identity?  How does an attorney whose partner gripes (good-humoredly) about their heavy load of pro bono cases afford Matt's sleek, high-tech, almost Fortress-of-Solitude-ish apartment?  Why, when he wants to go to sleep (as opposed to sleeping *with* somebody), does he submerge himself in what appears to be a coffin filled with water?  How did Matt explain the wound drilled through his shoulder by Electra's sai?  Any of these questions could have been answered very simply with a line or two of dialogue.  It's the business of a movie to make its "world" real to its viewers, to be plausible within the parameters of the universe it's set in; if it's fantasy, that's one thing, but the Marvel movies are supposed to take place in a reality only a step or two sideways from our own.  When the filmmakers don't seem to care enough about their reality to "make it real," they spoil the movie for me.  So this is a DVD I *won't* be buying, and not one that I can recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>I loved DAREDEVIL when I saw it in theaters.  Despite the severe miscasting of Jennifer Garner and Michael Clark Duncan, it was one of the better superhero movies I'd seen.  Ben Affleck is superb as the title character, and Colin Farrell hit the Bullseye (I know, that was terrible, forgive me) in what is clearly a field day for him.  Upon seeing it many times since, I realize that it's still a good movie, but in need of something . . . . . . . . . more.<br /><br />Bring on the Director's Cut!<br /><br />To be released this November, the D.C. of DAREDEVIL will definitely make it one of my favorite comic book movie adaptations.  One of the theatrical version's problems was that you could kind of tell that it was an R-rated movie trapped in the body of a PG-13 movie (similar to this summer's KING ARTHUR).  But rest assured, the DVD coming this November will be the R-rated cut, incorporating some twenty minutes of new material to make the movie just over two hours.  The DVD will have a new audio commentary track with the director among others, sport a DTS  soundtrack (sweeeeeeeeeet), and a feature entitled "The Making of a Director's Cut."  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, for those of you who already bought the first DVD edition) there will be no second disc with bonus features, but that's where the current DVD will still be handy.  Here's what I would (and plan to) do:  Throw away the first disc and the cover for the theatrical edition, and put the Director's Cut cover and disc in the 2-disc case.  Then you'll have the ultimate DAREDEVIL DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>I liked this movie a lot; I have to say that before I start picking it apart. This movie had a lot going for it; it just didn't take it as far as it should have.<br /> I'm a huge Marvel Comics fan. I am fiercely loyal to the brand, and I seldom, if ever read comics published by other companies. As such, I have been very happy with the majority of movies based on Marvel titles. X-Men was fantastic, Spider-Man could have used a little more polish in the CGI arena, and Blade 2 was at least good for a laugh.<br /> Of the Marvel movies I always imagined that Daredevil would be one of the most difficult to do as a live action movie, simply because Matt Murdock is so deeply tortured, and the characters around him are so deep that it would take the perfect cast, the perfect director, and a good solid script to pull it off... the same with any other Marvel comic-turned movie. So far so, good, right?<br /> Daredevil did not have the perfect cast. While Affleck was perfect for Murdock (I know not everyone agrees, but I think he did great) and Farrell turned the cheesy villain Bullseye into something really cool, Jennifer Garner's Elektra left much to be desired... especially since she looks nothing like the comic character, not even remotely close, and as big of a fan as I am of Michael Duncan Clarke I was not impressed with him as the Kingpin, but that's the script and director's fault. I sincerely believe that this flaw in the film was the result of lacking screen time. Daredevil did to Kingpin what Star Wars did to Darth Maul.<br /> The plot was also a bit shallow in some regards. The movie did a great job in focusing on Matt Murdock, and his tortured soul, and presenting the world from his eyes... it did not do a good job of presenting the world around him from any other perspective. We do not get to know Elektra, we do not get to know Foggy, we do not get to know the Kingpin, or Bullseye. That's where this movie goes wrong.<br /> Spider-Man did a great job of allowing us to get to know both Peter Parker and Norman Osbourn, as well as Harry Osbourn, Mary Jane Watson, and even Aunt May. Spider-Man was a little on the long side, but that's a plus. I can sit through two and a half, or three, or even four hours of a good movie no problem. In contrast, Daredevil seemed too short for me, and the only hope I had by the end of the film was that they sequel wouldn't take long because I was not happy with the way the film ended, I was left hanging.<br /> I think that this movie should have left the audience, and Matt with a bit of a mystery to solve. Who was the Kingpin? Did he even exist? Elements of this mystery were there, but should have really been played upon. Perhaps we should have seen Wilson Fisk as a Philanthropist, someone that the uninitiated audience, as well as the community of the film would be shocked to find out turns out to be the Kingpin. Or at least the community of the film if we HAVE to have the interaction between Fisk, and Bullseye. Maybe Bullseye could receive emails instead just to ad to the mystery?<br /> What this movie did right was beautifully done, however. We got to know Matt Murdock very well, and for that I have to say kudos. I just wish that the movie had developed the other characters of Hell's Kitchen as well. The movie would have been a lot better that way. Instead it left me wanting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>DAREDEVIL is a film that needed a lot of fixing up. One of the main and most interesting characters gets the kicked out the picture half way through. Conceptually it kept close to the original comic but it lacked the story. The film's visual style was also a little confusing in parts. It is one of those films that tells the origins by starting with an event at the beginning that isn't explained until the end. Very disappointing when you realize it was nothing special.<p>Directed by Mark Stephen Johnson (Jack Frost, Ghostrider) the film is a little slow and dark in the beginning. The story doesn't start to get interesting until the main temptress played by Jennifer Garner (Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can) shows up and has some great fighting sequences.<p>The most interesting character is Collin Farrell (S.W.A.T., Phone Booth) interpretation as Bullseye. He is exciting and evil and really seems to be the only one who is having fun in the film. He is energetic and exciting.<p>The story is that of the making of the Vigilante known as Daredevil. The beginnings are shallow and short and the accident not really explained much and the father is played by David Keith (Office And A Gentlemen, Firestarter) who gives a short but meaningful performance.<p>Now as for Ben Afflect (Sum of All Fears, Pearl harbor, Armageddon) as Daredevil, he was week. He was more interesting as the alter-ego Matt Murdock. Even that was a a little shallow. <p>Overall it is an okay rental movie and certainly watchable on cable - but nothing to write home about. I think they rushed the script to ride the tales of the Brilliant production of Spider-Man. That was good writing and production. 5-20-03</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>Ben as a super hero? No thank you. This man cannot act. And whats up with the scene where he likes that woman so they go outside to fight? Thats a weird a need I add STOOPID way to flirt. Give me more Colin and less Ben and maybe just maybe I would have liked this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>To be honest I'm getting a little sick of these comic book movies, and the worst part is my friends don't care so I'm constantly being dragged to see these bad movies. <p> If movies like "X-Men", "Spider-Man", & "Daredevil" had been released 10-12 years ago I would be having a blast at the movies, but that's not the case. And I'm not interested in comics anymore, and I don't remember the story-lines concerning the characters.<p> One of the many reasons I didn't like "Spider-Man" was because I didn't feel Toby Maguire was a good choice for the lead. I don't think of him as a heroic leading man type, Affleck on the other hand is liked by the ladies so he stands more of a chance at pulling off the role despite the fact he has no talent as an actor. And in all honestly I could of liked this movie more than "Spider-Man" or "X-Men", but, here's why I didn't.<p> First of all Affleck seems a bit to smug to me in this movie. He acts too much like a know it all. I didn't like his interruptation of the character. My second problem acting wise has to do with the "Bullseye" character played by Colin Farrell. A person I think has been OVER-used in Hollywood in just a short amount of time. Already in the past year has has appeared in "Minority Report" (Which is a good movie) and "The Recruit" (Another good movie) but here he plays "Bullseye" like a vilgilante gang member. Not at all what I was expecting this character to be like. I pictured the character to clearly be evil a little disturbed, but, smart, slick, sneaky and sly as a fox. Colin Farrell plays him like yes he's evil, insane, and a biker. Totally a wrong choice. But who's to blame? Farrell or the director? Also, I can't understand why Michael Clarke Duncan was chosen in his part. It all seemed wrong.<p> I did some reading when I went home about the daredevil character. I read my old marvel comic trading cards and read that daredevil and Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) meet while in college. Which doesn't happen in this movie. I also never read anything about daredevil's dad being a boxing, but, that may just be my fault. Going back to Garner though, she just isn't given a good role. Infact no one really is well written in this movie. And Garner doesn't really make the character believeable. <p> I have one question for everyone, this was never explained in the movie, why does "Daredevil" sleep in water? That confused me.<p> For those who liked "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" I really doubt you'll be coming out of "Daredevil" enjoying it. It's a film I think so far, is one of the worst of the year (and I'm sure that opinion will stick).<p> Bottom-line: A silly poorly written comic book movie that didn't seem to bring it's characters to life, the way "Spider-Man" did. We really don't believe in what we're seeing. A missed chance at what could of been a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>lets get its flaws out of the way first.its not necessary to show a small boy being blinded,screaming in agony at the hospital and the like.what is it with movie makers and graphic portrayels of kids suffering?damn!would you all stop it already.the whole daredevil comic was also summed up in one movie.it has been out a long time.some of daredevils stunts all over the rooftops were hardly belivable,especialy for a blind man.and lastly,that the kingpin is a gigantic,fat white guy not a pretty big,thick,black man.are we color blind?does it just not matter what a guys color is?i bet you a lot of people would get mad if a movie got made about oprah with rosanne playing her or one about martin king with danny devto cast as the doc.now the cat woman is black too.this is stupid.can eveyone just stay the right color please?in this one a kid gets blinded .his other senses get bettter,but his take off to super extraordinary levels.he becomes the daredevil.lawyer by day,masked vigilante by night.well,the kingpin whos now a homeboy crimeboss.since were on the subject,crimeBOSSES,are almost always white.the thugs are black.check your statistics!but,anyway the kingpin is getting pod that his men keep getting wasted.yes,they are white.so,he gets this crazy irish guy called bulleseye to kill him.bulleseye has a few powers of his own.1-anything whatsoever he picks up,he can use lethaly.2-he never misses-except in this movie when hes fighting the daredevil,3-his bones are laced like wolverines with admantium.im betting they didnt use that in the movie either.ben affleck plays daredevil.it is the best ben affleck movie ever! i like jay and silent bob strikes back better.but he was in that for only a few minutes and whined like a littlke girl the whole time.youre the parent you make the call with this one.i couldnt really say.it is one of the better comic book films lately.if you liked them,youll like this one too.elektra is a long time rival of daredevils in the comic book but here shes his girlfriend and she is HOT!!!!!!!!!too bad she never goes full frontal.hype says its not that good.the real deal is its better than the average comic flick.the action is awesome.there is a fight between dd and everyone i named.will there be a sequel?if you watched the credits,and lets be honest,nobody does,you ll see bullseye all muffed up in a hospital bed.now this did happen...........wait a minute!no it didnt!daredevil had a building fall on him from bulleseye.nevermind!its a good movie.the creators just had a hard time seeing to make it with thier heads so far up thuer asses.maybe thats why its about a blind guy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Maybe I'm getting old or something, but remember in the days of superheroes of old (Superman, Batman,etc.), the superheroes were just that ---SUPER.  In this flick, Ben Affleck as Daredevil gets his butt kicked by Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell----he's like wimpo the magnificent!  I know they do this to make it more "realistic?", but look folks, no one likes to see their good guy get bounced all over the place, especially by a woman!!!!!  That out of the way, DAREDEVIL didn't fully work for me because it is sooooo DARK and DISMAL.  Even the lighting is moody and morose.  Granted, most of the CGI effects were impressive, but unlike SPIDERMAN, they weren't as fluent or viewable.  Daredevil moves around so fast you can't really tell what he's doing.<br />Affleck surprised me with a good performance, particularly in his non-Daredevil scenes; Garner was gorgeous, but it was hard to swallow her kung fun antics; Colin Farrell was very good as Bullseye--he's the only one who looked like he was having a good time; Duncan is wasted as Kingpin; although a good actor, he was woefully miscast in this one.<br />Although DAREDEVIL is ultimately entertaining, it's like eating an eclair..it's good while you're eating it, but it's really just a lot of dough with no filling.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Have never read one single Daredevil comic book in my life I guess my review is kind of unbiased. Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one. <p>For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.<p>But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.<p>A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios. <p>The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track. Plus a bunch of extras I don't care about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>Because that pretty boy Ben Affleck was choosen to be the star character, I had honestly expected this movie to suck. Fortunately, after watching it, it turned out to be a great movie.<p>The acting is well done, with a very heartbreaking storyline. Daredevil does many stunning airial acrobatic moves. This has everything that I had expected to see in the Spiderman movie (a movie which I hated).<p>Daredevil is a true Marvel classic.

Most movies are using the matrix moves these days so, what can you expect. I ejoyed the bad guys the most meaning: Colin Farrel. He had alot of enthusiasm that brought out the bad guy in the movie. If your a Colin Farrel fan then I highly recommend!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>When I saw this movie in the theaters, it didn't impress me as much as I wanted it to, but seeing it again, it's starting to grow on me.  While having a few issues with the movie, I think it was fairly well done.  Being an avid comic book reader in my youth, I was very familiar with the characters, so I did have preconceptions of how I thought the movie should have been, and maybe that was the problem.<p>The movie tells the story of Matt Murdock, a blind, idealistic lawyer who does a leather outfit and seeks justice at night, played by Ben Affleck.  As a young boy, Matt is blinded in an accident by biohazardous material, but his four remaining senses are subsequently augmented to superhuman levels.  This includes hypersensitive hearing to the point where he can visualize sound waves reflecting off objects allowing him to 'see'.  We also learn how his father, a professional boxer by trade, was murdered because he refused to participate in a fixed fight by taking a fall.  This sets up Matt's motivation for becoming a superhero of sorts, using his special abilities to help those who can't help themselves, both in and out of court.<p>After all this origin stuff is laid out for us, we fast forward to the present, where we see Matt in court involved in a case against a particularly nasty sort of fellow who manages to get acquitted of a rape/abuse charge.  Later that night, Matt dons his outfit, and begins to seek his own justice against this fellow.  <p>We also get to meet Matt's future love interest, Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner.  We find out her father is involved with a major crime syndicate run by Carlton Fisk a.k.a Kingpin, played by the ever enormous Michael Clarke (The Green Mile).  Her father wants out of the business, to which the Kingpin decides to set him up for a fall and make it look like Elektra's father is really the Kingpin.  Fisk calls in a hire assassin, Bullseye, played by a baldheaded Colin Farrell.  He goes after Elektra's father, and ends up getting into an altercation with Daredevil.  During their fight, Bullseye manages to kill Elektra's father and make it look like Daredevil was responsible, so this sets up a fight between Elektra and Daredevil.  I don't want to go further into the story than I already have as not to spoil anything, but, as you can probably guess, Daredevil and Bullseye end up having a climatic fight at the end of the movie.  Oh yeah, and Kingpin gets his due, also.<p>There were some major and minor differences between the comic book and the movie.  The biggest was Kingpin.  In the comic book, he's a fat, bald white guy while in the movie he's a large, muscular black guy.  Was this a good or bad change?  It didn't make a big difference to me, but I didn't feel like Michael Clarke's character could have been the head of a major organized crime syndicate.  Ben Affleck played his role well, but his performance always seemed a little off the mark.  He just didn't seem to really get into the character to me, like a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit.  Jennifer Gardner was probably the best in this movie, as she seemed to really fit in with the character I remember from the comic, although the comic book Elektra had black hair and seemed a little more ethnic in her Greek background.  And her fight with Bullseye...what was up with that?  She was an expertly trained fighter, and Bullseye's main ability was to be able to turn almost any object into a deadly weapon by way of being able to throw it and always hit his mark.  In the comic, he was not an amazing fighter, but in the movie he was able to hold his own against Elektra and Daredevil.  Whatever....Colin Farrell did all right, but just didn't seem right in the part.  And that bullseye brand on his fore head...man, that was goofy.  Also some of the music just didn't seem to fit the scenes...like the scenes were filmed to fit the music, and not the other way around.<p>I guess if you liked Spider-man, then you will probably like this movie, as the formula is the same, but the chemistry just doesn't seem to work like it did in Spider-man.  This movie is a little darker, and doesn't have the whimsical element of Spider-man, but it seems to try and stay true to the comic book, which I appreciated.<p>As far as extras go, there are tons.  Like 8 hours worth.  There are some extras on the first disc along with the movie, and then the whole second disc is all more extras.  One extra I thought was pretty cool was the running visual commentary, like the old Pop Up video show on VH1.  There is also an enhanced audio track for the visually impaired, of which I am not really sure what it is, but reminded me of that Python bit on the Holy Grail movie where they had a guy shouting things for the hearing impaired.<p>Oh yeah, once the movie ends and the credits roll, keep watching as there is a bit more of the movie about half way through the credits.  I missed it in the theaters, but caught it here.  It's worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Every few months it seems, marvel is releasling a movie adaptation of one of its classic comicbooks.  This year, we have had (or will have) "X2," "The Hulk," and "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."  But buried beneath them, is "Daredeveil," a frenetic, eye-catching spectacle, but with enough heart and humor to help rise above it rumored shallowness.  Key to the movies' success is Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, who hits the right amount of brood and anger as "The Man with no Fear."  I would say that "Daredevil" reasserted my confidence in Affleck as a good actor.  <p>As a boy, Matt Murdock is blinded by a chemical waste accident, but his other senses functioned at superhuman levels, more than making up for his lack of sight.  As a man, he is a determined lawyer representing the downtrodden in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.  At night, he wages a secret war against crime as Daredevil, a red-leather clad superhero.  His new enemy is the rumored Kingpin (an imposing Michael-Clark Duncan), one man who controls all the crime in New York.  At his disposal, Kingpin has a legion of criminals, most dangerous is the gleefully evil Bullseye (a delicious Colin Farrel) who can turn any object into a lethal projectile.  Caught up in the middle is Elecktra (a beautiful Jennifer Garner) who develops a relationship with Murdock and her doomed father (Erik Avari).<p>Even though "Daredevil" is a satisfying action movie, it does leave room for improvement for its inevitable sequels.  The characters could use a little more development, and the story could use a little tightening.  Also, was the play-fight between Murdock and Elecktra in the playground necessary?  I don't know.  To me, it seemed a little shallow as it balantly goes for eye-filling candy, instead of a little substance.  But other than that, "Daredevil" is a dark, lurid and satisfying action flick.</p></br></body></html>

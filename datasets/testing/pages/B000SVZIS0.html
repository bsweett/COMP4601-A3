Much like other reviews, I'm a big fan of the original Planet of the Apes. Since this film's release, I've heard bad things about it, and I chose to stay away from it until recently. After finally watching it for the first time, I can't say it was as bad I thought it would be. However, its definitely not on the level of the original film at all. For me, the biggest problem is differences in the story that just doesn't make sense when compared to the original film(s). For example, how are the humans able to speak? Or can only some of them? Besides the Leo character, I believe there was only 4 humans speaking in the film. The rest kinda stood around blankly. Yet, they apparently could understand what was being said. For some or all humans to be able to understand and speak, it takes away the uniqueness of the Leo character (Wahlberg)that should have made him special. That was a very important plot device in the original film. Also there seems to be some weird attempt to have some sort of sexual tension between Leo and the ape Ari. It's just odd, and thankfully it didn't develop further in the film. As for the "surprise" ending that has gotten a lot of criticism, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense. There are theories out there by fans that do attempt to explain it. However, I read that Tim Burton himself said it wasn't supposed to make sense, so who knows. I realize the whole story arc of the Planet of the Apes films can be confusing, and any storytelling involving time travel is a recipe for confusion. But I think this was just the movie trying to be too clever and knowing that the original had a surprise ending (one of the best endings in any film I've seen, by the way), it was just a weak attempt to match it. The the effects and make-up were probably the best thing about the film. All the apes looked very good, except for the few female apes, which looked ridiculous to me! Not that the make-up was bad, but it was the way it was designed. Why did the female apes have modern human hairstyles? And I felt the make-up was too human looking to start with. You could see too much of the actress' features through the make-up. Were they trying to make the female apes more attractive? Was that the reason behind the vague love connection between Ari and Leo? I hate to say it, but honestly, Ari kinda reminded me of Michael Jackson! The acting was pretty good as well. The supporting cast includes Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Kris Kristofferson. And even includes a cameo by Charlton Heston as an ape, which I thought was pretty cool. Mark Wahlberg was okay as the main protagonist, but of course it wasn't nothing compared to the performance of Charlton Heston in the original. Probably the best performance in the film goes to Tim Roth as the nasty General Thade. Though perhaps the character was a little too over the edge at times. In fact, I thought the depiction of the apes overall was a bit too harsh, primitive, and tyrannical. I felt that the apes had a bit more of civilized manner about them in the original. But most of them in this film seem to have an overly negative and aggressive attitude. Some people have complained about this film being too long or too boring. I didn't necessarily get bored or feel that the film was too lengthy (around 2 hours), and I thought the film was interesting and entertaining enough. However it isn't as dramatic, clever, or entertaining as the original whatsoever. I'm sure there's a lot more of other complaints I've overlooked that someone that's more familiar with the original series can, and probably have, pointed out. But for me, this film wasn't as bad as I expected, and its actually a decently made film. But when there's an attempt to remake or "re-image" a classic image, 99% of the time you're fighting a losing battle. That's probably why soon after the movie's release,  Tim Burton was quoted as saying "he'd rather jump out a window" than direct a follow-up. I'm kinda of thankful that they chose not to continue with this story, and went backward in the story arc with Rise of the Planet Apes, which is a much better film. But that's another review for another day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with this Tim Burton inspired remake is the beginning and the end.  The middle is pretty decent.  The film opens on a space station that is experimenting with chimps as pilots in some deep space probing.  One chimp is sent into one of those ominous clouds we always saw on "Star Trek".  When he loses communication, our hero, Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys the commanding officer and flies out after him.  Yeah right.  The writers couldn't even keep the original name of the main character.  Leo is somehow better?  Anyway, once Leo inevitably crashes on an unknown planet, he is immediately caught up in a mob scene where humans are being rounded up by apes on horses.  These humans don't do much to resist or contribute to the movie for that matter.  Estella Warren plays a honey-haired Daena who has eyes for Leo but based on their lack of chemistry, I suspect it's just procreation on her mind.  Leo does strike up a bond with a couple of the more liberal apes.  Primarily Ari, nicely played by Helena Bonham Carter in spite of monkey make-up that makes her look like Paula Abdul.  Ari also has eyes for Leo and my guess is that Wahlberg's character is supposed to reciprocate.  Unfortunately while Carter delivers a convincing performance, Wahlberg is a cold fish throughout.  Too bad, I liked the angle.  This middle section has a goodly amount of action, chills and thrills which leads to a less than satisfactory conclusion.  Most notable in this remake, is the performance of Tim Roth as bad-ass ape, General Thade.  He is a take-no-prisoner kind of military man.  Roth's mimicking and expressions are first rate.  It's enough to make the movie watchable.  The end comes of course and it is here the bad taste in your mouth will linger.  Unlike the brilliant ending provided for in the original, this one is just plain stupid.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>Hmm, I watched this one on the telly the other day and in my view it is a better film than it gets credit for. A little more effort in filling in plot holes would have been nice though, although the ending (spoiler warning) was made as it was to spawn a sequel, it was annoying to have had them miss out on the opportunity to make an "Aperaham Lincoln" gag, which was of course mighty frustrating. The thing that annoyed me most about the film was that the humans could speak, for me, the original 1968 film had Charlton Heston's main shocking capacity to the apes, was not that he was a spaceman, but that he could talk. By having everyone being able to talk, it immediately robs Leo Davidson's character of the one thing that would have made him uniquely interesting and that bothers me. The idea that the apes and humans had originated from the crashed ruins of the Oberon was another rather elegant plot twist that impressed me, the fact that the crew reported that the revolting apes had overcome them was a little paradox however, it would have been better if the computer log had said that they were abandoning the wreckage of the ship (or the ship, I am unclear if it had crashed before the ape mutiny) and going off to found a colony somewhere. And where did the horses come from? Don't tell me that on the Oberon, the apes were doing the exploration, and presumably the horses were in charge of repairing the ship or something? A little more care and thought would have made this a decent film, but even so, it really not that bad, I enjoyed watching it for the second time (after seeing at the flicks in 2002) more than I thought I would. And one last thing, as if a big mighty gorilla would less an tiny chimp boss him around. If I was one of the gorillas, I would have told general Thade to get stuffed.<br /><br />Its always hard to remake such an iconic film as Planet of the Apes, but this is a decent enough effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>you know, i was excited about seeing this film, after all, tim burton doesn't fail, but unfortunately he did, or at least the screenwriter did...why burton signed on after reading the script fails my knowledge. and why mark whalberg and other quite good actors also signed up after reading the script fails my understanding as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I had read all the hype concerning the ending of this movie and how it is not a good &quot;remake.&quot;  In watching the film, however, I was totally absorbed with it, until that awful, awful ending.  (More on that later).  Burton's direction is good; the ape makeup is the best ever; Helena Bonham Carter is delightful as the ape Ari; Mark Wahlberg made it through the movie without having to take his shirt off (Charlton spent most of the original in a loincloth, if you'll remember,ladies).  The irony of having Charlton Heston cameo as Tim Roth's dying ape father is splendid.  Paul Giammatti is wonderful as Limbo, and Estella Warren is gorgeous and effective as the beautiful Daena.  I liked the heroism the humans evidenced by the end, and Roth's diabolically manic performance was awesome.<br />Danny Elfman's Afro-influenced score also great.<br />Now, the ending..what makes it worse is that in Tim Burton's commentary, he never actually tells you what in the world he was hoping to achieve with this completely inexcusable ending.  Not only did it negate what we had just viewed, it made Wahlberg's heroic efforts completely useless.  I remember in the first when I saw the crumbled Statue of Liberty, my mouth drop opened and the full impact of the movie is irreplaceable.  Burton's enigmatic ending is just so far out of left field and so preposterous, it destroys what could have been a film Burton could be proud of.  For true impact, watch the original, not that it's better, it's just that it makes sense.<br />Shame on you Tim!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "re-imagining" of the classic 1968 original is big on spectacle but short on story. Starting out like traditional sci fi film (albeit with Mark Wahlberg- what's he doing here?), Planet of the Apes is a very different plot from the first one, and one with lots of spectacle and action, but not so much substance.<p>The plot of the film is very action-orientated and made me want for more background story. Sure, the action set pieces are great, but to have more on how the rouge humans came to the planet ruled by apes would have been appreciated. But like many action films recently the action and SFX make up for the usual lack of a meaty story (or script for that matter).<p>However, Burton's visionary flair does not disappoint, in that sense the film is fantastic, as is Tim Roth as General Thade, leader of the army of apes, and the imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as one of the commanders of the army. The only stink of this movie actually, is the aforementioned Mark Wahlberg, who threatens to redefine the term "wooden".<p>After some huge battle scenes we go to the legendary ending, which understandably confused viewers. Where the original's ending was great, this one is a real thinker, and when it was released, opinions of its climax flew over the net as fast as naked Brittneys.<p>The DVD is great though, and makes for some awesome entertainment with great visuals. If only they had spent as much money on getting the story right as they had on the special effects and this would be a great movie, instead of just a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>This movie isn't like the 1968 classic Planet of the Apes. The plot isn't as substantive or thought-provoking. Rather, it is an action movie more along the lines of the contemporaneous The Time Machine. However, the makeup for the apes is pretty good, even after 8 years. Overall, this can be a fun movie to watch, but won't have the staying power of the classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just run of the mill science fiction filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. Since we have all become such sophisticated filmgoers over the years, the denouement is predictable and is somewhat just unimpressive. Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Davidson is convincing and likeable. Tim Roth as the brutal adversarial ape Thade is convincing and dislikeable. The real culprits here are uninspired Tim Burton's direction and a very bland script by Mark Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner and William Broyles Jr. Composer Danny Elfman's score is nondescript. One standout element is Philippe Rousselot's artistically alluring yet gritty cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of time</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This remake of the 1968 blockbuster is an entirely different movie. If the viewer expects it to follow the original, the viewer will, undoubtedly, be disappointed. While the storyline is basically the same in that simians have enslaved humans, it has decidely different twists.<br /><br />First and foremost, Rick Baker's ape make up surpasses that of the 1968 version. It is unbelievably good, almost remarkable. The makeup, coupled with the simian specific behavioral nuances, and the final filip brought to the simian characters by the actors themselves, brings the simian characters to life, making them very three dimensional.<br /><br />The storyline is fairly simple. A Major Davidson, while traveling in a spaceship, attempts to rescue a space pod containing one of his favorite chimpanzees and finds himself caught up in an electro-magnetic disturbance. This storm causes him to crash land on a planet, where simians are the dominant species, and humans are their slaves. No sooner than he lands, that he finds himself enslaved and enbroiled in survival.<br /><br />He discovers that there are two opposing camps of thought amongst the simians on the issue of humans. One school of thought, favored by Ari (Helen Bonham-Carter), favors equality, while the other, espoused by the sinister General Thade, urges extermination. There is also a romantic sub-plot between these two protagonists.<br /><br />What happens to them all provides much food for thought. Wahlberg is somewhat wooden in his portrayal of Davidson, which is somewhat surprising, as he is usually a pretty competent actor. Tim Roth is absolutely terrific as the single minded and ruthless General Thade. While Helen Bonham-Carter is good as the liberal simian, it is Paul Giammatti who very nearly steals the show as Limbo, the slave trader. Look for Charlton Heston in the role of General Thade's dying father. This unbilled cameo is a nice touch and a salute to the 1968 film.<br /><br />Tim Burton did an excellent job with this remake until the very end, when the movie seriously goes off course . This is unfortunate, as it serves only to have a jarring effect on the viewer, leaving the viewer to wonder what happened. With a better ending, it could have been a five star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This remake of the 1968 blockbuster is an entirely different movie.

The make-up FX for the apes in this film looks even better (i.e., more articulate and realistic) than the groundbreaking and influential make-up that John Chambers created for 1968's original PLANET OF THE APES, and had auteur Tim Burton and his crew stuck closer to the basic plot and overall socio-political subtext of the first film, they could have created a thought-provoking and aesthetically breathtaking update of what author and film historian Eric Greene calls the American myth of the 20th century.  Instead, Burton's take on PLANET OF THE APES is a tepid piece of celluloid that, while still visually stunning, is a travesty at best.<p>Okay, then, the film itself is pretty lackluster.  But what about the DVDs?  In this day and age when technology allows tons of information to be packed onto one or two little plastic-and-aluminum discs, many lousy films are marketed with bonus extras that are actually better than the film itself.  And the 2-Disc Special Edition of 2001's PLANET OF THE APES is a prime example.  It is loaded with lots of cool bonus features like commentaries (one by Burton; the other by composer Elfman) and deleted scenes, but the real treats are the featurettes that take the viewer behind the scenes in several aspects of the making of the film.  Just a few of the items discussed: The creation a special &quot;school&quot; for the actors so they could learn to move like an ape; costume design and creation; make-up FX; music for the film; and much more.  Even for a rather dull remake like this film, learning a bit about how the cinematic illusions are created is fascinating.  This alone makes the 2-Disc set worth purchasing.  (Note: the 1-Disc version that is also being marketed offers extras, too, but this includes only the two feature commentaries and some very limited behind-the-scenes stuff that can be accessed while viewing the flick.)<p><br />The compendiary review: <p>Tim Burton's &quot;re-imagining&quot; of PLANET OF THE APES is a pale shadow of the original.  However, the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD from Fox Home Entertainment has some outstanding extras that actually make the package worth purchasing.  <p><br />The ratings: <p>Movie rates at 2 stars; DVD with extras deserves 4 stars.  So the average rating for the movie and feature-packed DVD set is 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>This re-release of the original two disc set isn't anything special. The idiotic plotting and narrative weakness hasn't been fixed. While Tim Burton is a fine and talented film director with a sharp eye, many of his films suffer from narrative holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through. Those previously films didn't have the disadvantage of such a poorly cast film. Tim Roth chews so much of the scenery I'm surprised any of the sets were left standing during shooting. To be fair, Roth appears to be making up for the lack of acting skills by two of the leads (and I'm not referring to Helen Bonham Carter). Mark Wahlberg's idea of emoting is to act like he's constantly out of breath. Perhaps the oxygen levels dropped on the planet and he's suffering from carbon dioxide poisoning. It would certain explain the performance and some of the idiotic decisions his character makes.<p>There's entirely too much left to coincidence in the plot of this remake. I'm certainly not offended that they tried a different tact and, in fact, much of the basic plot elements could have been strung together to make an engaging, interesting film. That didn't happen here unfortunately. Still, Planet is interesting eye candy and for that I give it 3 stars. The extras on disc 2 I give 4 stars (although what's provided is out of proportion to the quality of the film itself--more is still less I suppose). The film itself and its goofy acting, deflated story and poor casting I'll give 1 star. It's not the worst film in the world but many of the elements here would have made Ed Wood proud.<p>If you really love this film then stick with the previous DVD edition as there hasn't been much improvement and, in fact, it appears to be from the same original transfer. The occasional edge enhancements that cropped up in the original release are still here. The transfer itself is visually stunning at times. The extra audio tracks with commentary from Burton and composer Danny Elfman are interesting. The 5.1 mix still sounds really good despite some compression issues.<p>On the whole, Planet mach 2 is a less than overwhelming experience. If you enjoyed the previous release, you'll enjoy this one but the only major difference you'll find is the digipak cardboard packaging and slipcase.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>I really can't put it any clearer than my opening line; the original was far from perfect, but it achieved what it set out to, and was enough of a cult favourite that it inspired 4 lesser sequels (the mark of any true BLOCKBUSTER).<p>As with the shot-by-shot remake of Psycho, it's just another example of Hollywood's tiredness.  There's nothing new under the sun, so to hell with it, we'll just bring those apes out of mothballs.  <p>If was impressed with anything, it was the technical aspects of the film, the make-up artists, and the sound-editing.  It's truly a great sounding/looking DVD, but all the extras contained within do not compensate for what's basically an old, overdone concept.<p>If you're more into picking up DVDs to simulate the feel of a theatre, then by all means pick it up!  The rest of us will settle for excellent cinema instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>A lot of bluster arose before the unveiling of Tim Burton's "reimagined" version of "The Planet of the Apes," to which the eccentric Burton responded by making his straightest movie ever. The apocalyptic tone drained away, the 2001 film is a by-the-book action flick, done well, but no more, with a twisteroo ending that isn't worth explaining. Mark Wahlberg is a bland human hero, while Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth steal the film as a helpful, civic-minded ape and a warlord general. Burton delivered a bombproof studio hit with few if any risks attached, instead of employing his hit-and-miss spin; in this case, the latter would have been the smarter artistic play but a financial reach.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>I really had no desire watching this whole movie the first time i saw it.

The need for a sure hit? A renewed cinematic reinterpretation? or as is the case of Tim Burton, as I suspect, a long life dream to pay hommage to a book/ film he greatly admires?<br />No matter what the reason is, it is surely a venture wrought with difficulties from the start. How many adaptations or remakes have succeeded more than the original? very few, even the ones that are adapted from a foreign film, and as a result don't have popular recognition, have invariably failed to capture the originality or power of the first film, whether the adaptation/remake is copied frame by frame,(Assasins, Vanilla Sky, Birdcage etc...) or 'inspired by'.<br />The original Planet of the Apes was certainly a classic masterpiece..A beautiful piece of moviemaking that has a lot to offer than mere entertainment.The film has has such an impact on audiences, and spawned many sequels and a TV series, that to remake it, even by an able and creative director like Tim Burton, will whether it is an actual remake or a different adaptation of Boulle's classic book, it will be associated with the original.<br />I could not watch this new version without thinking of the original, and this is why I did not appreciate it so much.<br />The casting is very good, and Walhberg is indeed a good actor, but Estella Warren was somehow miscast as the beautiful female 'savage' turned Walhberg side-kick.She is too distractingly beautiful and fresh to be her intended character, and I expected her, whenever she was in a close up to advertise for some shampoo or beauty product.<br />The make up is great though, and the DVD is packed with extras.<br />Yet something remains missing from the film. The sheer power and philosophical undertones, the harshness and apocalyptic atmosphere of the first.<br />Although Burton's ending of his film is quite clever, it remains somehow a bit polished to have the same power as the scene that confronted Heston and with him the viewers in the first Planet of Apes.<br />You can certainly still enjoy this film, only if you manage not to think of the original Planet of the Apes, something I found very hard to do, and for that reason I was disappointed, and hope that Hollywood, the movie industry and film makers would rethink their strategy and method whenever they remake or adapt a film that is a classic.(Dr Zhivago was recently remade for British TV and flopped instantly!)..and remember it is indeed extremely hard task.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>PLANET OF THE APES is a good DVD to have.

Even behind 3 pounds of facial make-up - they are wonderful.<p>This movie does tribute to the original, but the original was much more entertaining for me. I am not a big Charlton Heston fan, but I must admit he did far better in the original. The story even has a twist I didn't like. The ending was changed. The original has a much more powerful revealing ending.<p>Basically it is the same story, but the action and story focuses on the changing of history and alternate time-lines. They borrowed all of these concepts from Star Trek. There was a lot of originality here except a few performances.<p>The DVD extras are the best I have seems which made this movie redeem itself on DVD. It has a lot of behind the scenes documentaries from teaching the extras how to be apes to costuming, sets, wardrobe and the detailing of the new make-up  technologies that we have. The details and interviews and interviews are detailed and very interesting. There are music videos and a script-to-screen comparison for those script fans.<p>The movie itself could have been better - but the DVD has a lot of DVD extras that make it worth while.

This re-imagining obviously won't play well with fans of the original, but holds appeal to those looking for straight-out action/adventure.  Fast-paced, pulse-pounding, funny, and even rousing, this is ideal summer-based entertainment.  The ending is a bit silly, however (still enjoyably so).</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A poor adaptation of Pierre Boule's original book and of the original film starring Charlton Heston: there's no comparison and I don't mean that as a compliment. Another typical Burton caricature production which seems more like something prepared as advertisement for a McDonald's Happy Meal promotional toy collection.<br /><br />  The story now takes place on some distant planet instead of Earth where Mark Wahlberg lands by accident while conducting a chimp-pilot experiment. Trapped on what becomes a hostile ape planet, he gets help from good apes to fight the bad ones. Predictable plot, no character depth, and no real story worth pondering over; only a poorly directed bubble-gum film prepared for mass-consumption and aimed at your pubescent audience. I give it two stars only because the special effects were very well done.  All of the satirical elements present in Rod Serling's original script have been removed to leave nothing of worth except stupid anachnronisms, placid human faces, and a simply atrocious screenplay. Whereas the original movie had a profound message about social evolution and ignorance, this movie is but a noble experiment in computer animation and nothing more.<br /><br />  It's fun renting it to watch one time; the second time you see that Burton is just monkeying you around. If you're counting on seeing an improved rendition of the original film, you'll be sorely disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>What happened to Tim Burton. Or, perhaps more accurately put, what happened to the image of Tim Burton propogated so well by Hollywood? After watching his remake of PLANET OF THE APES, all I can say to Mr. Burton is take a bath, get a haircut, and drop the brooding genius pretense. There is nothing brilliant, artistic, or even mildly above average about this film. Think "Stargate Meets Planet of the Apes." And even a horrible film like Stargate had an ending we could understand.<br /> But, then, maybe that's Mr. Burton's game. Present an ending that even Socrates couldn't unravel. There! That's the proof of his brilliance. Only he of old man sunglasses and dirty hair is capable of understanding this "twist." Sorry, though, I don't buy it.<p>The ending of this film is so bizarre and so stupid that it defies belief. But it is worth dissecting it if for no other reason that to project what the sequel might be. (Oh, there will be a sequel. The ending begs for one. "Please, give me chance to explain this shocking non-sequitur!") Here are my best guesses for the sequel:<br /> (1) It was all a dream. Marky Mark is a zookeeper who wakes up from this nightmare, frees all of his chimps, and falls in love with a particularly attractive Orang. (She'll be animatronic in the film--with perky, human-like breasts, perhaps.)<br /> (2) Marky Mark entered a parallel universe in which an ape version of Tim Burton is making Planet of the Humans. Mark is recruited to star in the movie and is ultimately placed in a zoological park for retired animal actors.<br /> (3) Marky Mark was driven insane by his experience with apes and now sees all humans as Apes, including his mother--which leads to some dramatic incidents involving bananas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Tim Burton has created a library of films that continue to delight and amaze his fans with quirky characters and off-beat stories. Burton helmed such diverse films as "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure", "Batman", "Ed Wood" and "Sleepy Hollow" stamping each with his unique sensibility. Each of these films has been a feast for the eyes, creating vivid landscapes and re-imagining time and place. What Tim Burton films lack is a screenplay that spends as much time on character development, dialogue and exposition as is spent on the visual look of the film. "Planet of the Apes", Burton's latest film, is his take on the 1968 sci-fi film.<br /><br />Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is an air force pilot on a research space station, assisting a team experimenting with chimp-manned missions. When his favorite chimp gets lost, Davidson hops into another pod and tracks his lost friend. Davidson crash lands on a planet inhabited by apes and humans. However, on this planet, apes rule the humans. The apes are very advanced and have set-up a society which seems to be patterned after the Roman model. General Thade (Tim Roth) is the leader of the ape military and his right hand ape is Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). Most of the apes are so fearful of the humans that they relegate them to slave status and hunt down any that are not in their control. The Senator's (David Warner) daughter, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) is disgusted by their treatment of humans and immediately thinks Davidson is interesting. Davidson soon leads a small group of humans to escape. Among them is Daena (Estella Warren) and her father, Karubi (Kris Kristofferson).<br /><br />The single best thing about this reimagined "POTA" is the make-up by Rick Baker. The new make-up allows the actors playing apes to actually build characters, to have facial expressions, to act like advanced apes. Roth is particularly memorable as the evil Thade. He moves like an ape and appears very menacing as he threatens and cajoles other characters. Bonham Carter is also very good as Ari. She manages to convey an intelligence and thoughtfullness for her character that I don't think would have been possible with less advanced make-up.<br /><br />The production design is interesting, but somehow it seems incomplete for a Tim Burton film. Basically, three main sets are used and they are fun to look at, but the production design does not extend beyond these areas. In "Sleepy Hollow", his production team built an entire village. When Ichabod Crane is venturing into the woods, they looked like they belonged to the time and place. In "Apes", it basically looks like they shot scenes in a desert.<br /><br />The actors playing humans fare less well than their ape-suited friends. Wahlberg looks stunned throughout the entire film. He is also unable to build the key relationships that he needs to build. He is unable to show any real anger towards Thade or build any romantic attachment between Ari or Daena. In fact, the `love triangle' between Davidson, Ari and Deana is just laughable. Any time Davidson has a `meaningful' scene with either Ari or Daena, Burton cuts away to the other female watching with a jealous look. Estella Warren is not a good actress. In both "Driven" and "Apes" she plasters one expression on her face and gosh-darned she is going to stick to that expression.<br /><br />The set-up involving the space research is interesting and holds the attention, but once the action centers on the planet, it becomes boring. I think this is in large part because Davidson never actually appears threatened by Thade or Attar. Yes, Thade and Attar are threatening Davidson, but Wahlberg never makes the character appear threatened. As soon as he is captured, he attempts to break out. Also, he doesn't appear to actually want to help the humans or the apes on the planet. As soon as he can, he jumps at the first chance to escape from the planet, leaving both Ari and Daena behind.<br /><br />The ending was the final straw. Without discussing or revealing too much, it doesn't make sense. The visuals and the story don't support the `kicker' ending that the filmmakers felt was necessary. If you are going to have a `kicker' ending, it needs to make sense. If it doesn't make sense, it spoils the film and leaves a bad taste in the mouth.<br /><br />Tim Burton is a gifted visual filmmaker. I would like to say that he is a gifted filmmaker, but I feel it necessary to add the `visual' qualifier. He spends so much effort and time on the visual he needs to devote an equal amount of time and attention to the story and characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I guess that you'd have to be skeptical of movie that has as many 1 and 2 star reviews as it does 4 and 5 star reviews. But in my opinion, Tim Burton's 2001 remake of the classic 1968 version of Planet of the Apes was a victim of a lot of unjust criticism.<br /><br />Most of the criticism is from preservationists that just don't like their classics tampered with. To them I say fair enough, but I'm also here to say that as much as I loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7PX80">original movie that spawned 4 sequels</a>, a television series and an animated TV series, I liked Tim Burton's version the best. Burton's film explained how it could all be possible better than the original while at the same time adhered to the spirit of Pierre Boulle's original novel. Sure Burton took some liberties of his own too, but he also paid honorable tribute to the '68 sci-fi classic in several scenes.<br /><br />I think that a lot of criticism was also created by the whole time warp thing too. Jumping back and forth in time can be a difficult thing to pull off; it can be very confusing. And it is indeed confusing in Burton's remake. But ultimately it all adds up and is very cool when you finally "get it".<br /><br />Marky Mark Wahlberg also received some pans for his performance, but I thought he was great. And the apes, most notably Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan & Paul Giamatti, all looked great; they were scary, amusing and the acting was excellent. The movie is action packed and thoroughly entertaining through and through. Like I said earlier, I was certainly a fan of the original, but Burton's movie to me was less of a remake of the 1968 film and more of a better adaptation of Boulle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345447980">1963 novel</a>.<br /><br />I bought this movie once on DVD already all the way back in 2001; but I wouldn't hesitate to give this a try on Blu Ray and I recommend that you do too...especially if you've never seen the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>After a spectacular crash on an unknown planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), an impetuous astronaut is made prisoner in a barbaric world where the human race is enslaved by talking apes.

Yet, of all of his movies, this one lacks development and leaves you with a &quot;so-what&quot; feeling.<p>The costumes were fantastic and the make-up effects of Rick Baker were oscar caliber.  Yet, the one thing that the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; had that this version does not is realism.  In the original, you believed that they were on a strange planet.  In the new version, you can't help think that they're on a set somewhere.  Some back-lot.<p>More importantly though, the story was poorly written, and the ending jumped too much without explaining some details.  There were just too many coincidental things that you were just supposed to believe.  The first sign of a poorly written movie that needed a way out.  Like, where did all the humans come from and how did they hear about the rebellion so fast.  Oh, it doesn't matter, it's just a movie.  They had to be there, or there couldn't be a battle scene.<p>All in all, I bought the DVD.  I buy all of Tim's movies.  Despite the fact that the movie was a little of a disappointment, the DVD is awesome.  Excellent special features, and when it comes to the movie... don't read too much into it... it's just a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>As a fan of the original &quot;Apes&quot; and the subsequent sequels that came from it, the idea of going back to this subject seemed to be redundant and at first, unecessary.  However, I did manage to enjoy this &quot;re-imagining&quot; of one of my favorites.  In a weird way, it resembles my love of Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and it's remake in the great Western &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;.  To say it doesn't have it's problems would be wrong.  As much as I enjoyed the solid visuals and great make-up (used to great effect by the actors), I had to ask about the minor details, like the history of the humans and apes, which isn't touched on enough, in my opinion.  The ending is a little too open-ended, but at least works in leaving us as disoriented as our hero is.  It's not the remains of the Statue of Liberty, but it'll do.  The music by Danny Elfman is quite impressive, even touching upon the original's percussive score.  The 2 disc DVD set has a commentary with Elfman, as well as one by director Tim Burton, some interesting documentaries about the make-up and training for the actors playing the apes, and a lot of other material that at least elevates this up for a rental at the very least.  Despite the little complaints mentioned above, it's not that horrible of a film, and unlike some of this summer's cinematic horrors, at least it's interesting to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Planet of the Apes" is a joyless, soulless and utterly pointless remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic.  The original film had two strong elements going for it:  its expansive visual style and its playful spirit.  Both qualities have been effectively eliminated in Tim Burton's update, along with the sense of wonder that came, thirty-three years ago, when the material was still innovative and fresh.  What viewer can forget the time he first saw that stunning final shot of the earlier version, with a weary Charlton Heston coming upon the remains of the Statue of Liberty - then bellowing in outrage at the tragic reality hitherto unrevealed to both him and us?  Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar "surprise" ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.<p>Much of the effectiveness of the original "Planet of the Apes" lay in its deliberately paced buildup.  The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.  In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies.  <p>Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were.  Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans - a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges.  For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original "Planet of the Apes" was not a DUMB movie.  I wish one could say the same for the remake.  The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next.  <p>And here we come upon another problem with the movie - one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton.  It is simply shot too dark.  One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting.  These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings.  In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.<p>Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface - a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter).  How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters.  Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line.  <p>It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today.  One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this.  The original "Planet of the Apes" managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest.  My prediction is that copies of it will still be on video store shelves long after this remake has hit the bargain-price recycling bins.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>The first challenge when watching this movie is to try to forget the 1968 classic.  This movie exists entirely as its own singular entity, with more action, a stronger emphasis on the civil rights and animal rights debate and almost completely eliminating the evolution theory debate that formed the backbone of the original.  <p>There is more action in this movie, too, with some genuinely spectacular visual effects extremely worthy of an Academy Award.  <p>But enough of this.  I would not have bothered with watching this movie had it been directed by anyone other than Tim Burton.  He is one of those directors who has a distinct personality, like Terry Gilliam, early Steven Spielberg or Alfred Hitchcock, there are certain trademark moves or images that he uses that distinguishes each movie as a Tim Burton film.  (He would have been the ideal choice to direct The Grinch, as his imagery often has strong parallels to the illustrations in Dr. Seuss)<p>Those images are muted in this movie.  Probably by necessity as the setting is more alien than anything Tim Burton has presented us with before.  His strength was in showing movies where the real world was twisted into a surreal extreme (the pastel colors of suburbia in Edward Scissorhands; the towering cathedrals of Gotham in Batman &amp; Batman Returns).<p>We still get off-beat scenes such as an ape wearing a toupee &amp; dentures mixed in with the action &amp; adventure, but as it stands, the scene that stands out as feeling the most like a vintage Tim Burton moment is the controversial twist ending.  It does play with the final revelation of the conclusion of the original Planet of the Apes movie.  But of course the last shot of that movie was a final commentary on nuclear war, while the ending of this Apes picture is simply there to play with our minds.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  While the original Apes will always be regarded as a classic piece of filmmaking in its own right, this Apes movie will be regarded as an entertaining addition to Tim Burton's body of work as a filmmaker, something of a change of pace from his regular productions.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>This movie is really a bit of a paradox. There are parts that I like and parts I hate, and though ultimately its an entertaining film I can't promise that I'm gonna take out my wallet to acquire a DVD or video. My feelings for this film can be divided into two categories:<br /><br />What I hate: everything with the humans<br /><br />What I love: everything with the apes<br /><br />The human characters are all too generic or barely developed for you to like them. Oh sure, you root for Mark Wahlburg, but he'll be the only one you're cheering for. The other human characters consist of: a black guy who has one or two lines then dies because, hey, he's the black guy; an annoying kid who is told to stay where he is and predictably runs out towards the apes, gets in trouble, and has to be saved; and a super-model woman (didn't know they had airbrushes on an ape planet) who is supposed to be the love interest though there's no connection except that Mark Wahlburg is a man and she's a woman, so obviously they have to fall in love.<br /><br />This now brings me to my next point: the apes are the best characters in this whole movie. And how can you miss with the actors playing them? Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti...but the one that tops them all is Tim Roth as General Thade. Tim Roth is EXCELLENT as the film's villain, and you can tell he really gets into the character. He constantly moves, talks, and acts like Thade. I know this film getting an Academy Award nomination may be a bit of a stretch, (then again, knowing the Academy Awards these days...) but if I had been in the nomination panel, Roth would have definately gotten my vote for best supporting actor.<br /><br />But it's not just these characters that either hurt or help my feelings about this movie. I was constantly hearing this wasn't a remake but a "re-realization" of the original story. Yeah, OK, then explain to my why there are constantly references to the original film through out the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan tells Mark Wahlburg, "Get your hands off me, you damn, dirty human!" Charlton Heston makes a cameo as Thade's dying father and, lamenting about the human's technology, mutters, "Damn them...damn them all the way to hell..." (the audience booed at that when I saw this in theaters) These moments add some corniness to the otherwise independent take on Pierre Boulle's original novel. Speaking of which, I was surprised to see this film take the novel's original ending, and I personally thought it was a nice touch. I won't give too much away, but if you've read the book then you'll know what I mean. The only difference is a change of location.<br /><br />This is one of those "one-time viewing" movies. Catch it on a movie channel or rent it from the store before buying. If you like it, buy it, if not, you won't feel bad for spending $15+ on something detestable.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Undoubtadly the worst film that Tim Burton has ever directed; this re-make of Planet of the Apes tries hard to be a solid action/sci-fi film, but despite it's merits the film is just a mess.  Not to mention some flat casting with Marky Mark Wahlberg finding himself on a planet overrun with highly intelligent apes who are in charge and humans are slaves.  There are some nicely orchestrated action scenes (although some are just dull) and special effects to be found here, plus the ape makeup is fantastic and is reason enough to watch this otherwise dull movie.  The rest of the otherwise stellar cast is beyond wasted: Helena Bonham Carter (the best looking ape I've ever seen), Tim Roth (one of the best character actors around today), Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Kris Kristofferson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Charlton Heston in an inspired cameo which pays great homage to the original film, but the absurd ending (which also tries to pay homage to the original film) is beyond laughable.  The DVD itself is loaded with tons of extras and Fox did an excellent job at assembling a superb DVD package, but it's just too bad the film is almost a waste.</p></br><a href="../users/A5QE86H97FDJA.html">A5QE86H97FDJA</a><br/><p>This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.<p>At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<p>This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". Here's how I would have written it:<p>An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<p>But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>Believe it or not, Charleton Heston does make an uncredited appearance in this 21st century updating of one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.  In the original, he was the lead, an astronaut thrown forward in time to a planet ruled by Fascist apes; in this clunker, he appears AS AN APE!<p>Truly the best example committed to film to denounce remaking classics, Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES stinks from every possible direction.  The acting (with the sole exception of the lovely Helena Bonham Carter, disguised thankfully under ape makeup) is one-dimensional; the special effects we've truly seen far better elsewhere; the set production is relatively archaic; and I think you get the picture.<p>The twist ending to POTA (the original's makes this one so laughable) almost promises a sequel, but let's hope apes do rule the planet by then and cinema is an art form long abandoned in favor of banana mashing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>I can't believe all the bad reviews.

This disc has great sound quality too!</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I know that remakes are often ill-received (and rightly so all too often), especially by loyalist to the original, but when I read comments on this specific remake that the oscar-winning outstanding make-up is laughable, the acting a joke (through all that make-up by top-notch actors), or that there is nothing original here, I can't help but wonder what film those folks were watching and I have to question the objectivity they may or may not have had going into this film and we all have a bias when entering a remake or a change to an established character.  I know that I had no intention of seeing, let alone liking the new James Bond, Daniel Craig (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale</a>), but when I gave him and the film a chance, I was enormously surprised.  I think this film needs a second chance by those who so off-handly dismissed it.<br /><br />I agree 100% with Amazon's review and synopsis of this film.  This remake is rather inventive and original in it's own right and is far closer to the novel than the original.  The themes of racism, civil right, justice, love, and sacrifice are handled far more deeply and sincerely than the original film did although that is still an outstanding film in its own right.  Of course, the make-up in this remake is nothing less than astounding and believable by the famous Rick Bakker and completely outshines the original film.  The special effects are nothing great, but they are good.  The acting, the heart of this film in addition to its literate script, is terrific by those in the ape make-up as their voices, eyes, and gestures must mean more to resonate with the audience because of the heavy make-up used.  I do, however, agree with critics here regarding the casting of Mark Wahlberg who is rather pedestrian in this film.  He simply lacks charisma in this role and I found myself caring very little for him even as the hero in this film.<br /><br />An interesting twist in this film that admittedly annoyed loyalists to the original is that in this film all humans speak, which makes sense to me as why would we "forget" how to speak in the future when the apes take over.  While I always thought that was a silly aspect to the ape film series for none of us to talk in the future, I must admit that it does make the apes seems even crueler when they go after humans that speak.  I guess that only enhances the racism theme prevelant in all the ape films.  After all, we did, sadly enough, considered African slaves to be soul-less and a less form of humans and they were capable of speech too.  In fact, slaves owners only considered them just "property" and not even human.  Again, this concept of having all humans speak in this remake makes the film all the more thought-provoking.  In addition, the short-lived <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJZ0K">Planet of the Apes: The Complete TV Series</a> also had all the humans speak.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an extraordinary film and definitely not worthy of the very harsh criticism its recently received although everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.  I just think some need to give this film a second and real chance (minus the bias one may have for the original).  I highly recommend this film as an adventure, sci-fi tale, and message for its timely social commentaries.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Planet of the Apes" is a remake of sorts of the 1968 film of the same name, directed by Tim Burton. I haven't seen the original, but I thought I'd see the remake first to minimize disappointment by comparison. I really liked it, actually, and once again I'm suprised at the low average amazon response.<br /><br />It's 2029, and a space station is sending chimps out into space to investigate a large magnetic storm. Leo is an astronaut there, and one of the trainers of the chimp. His favorite is sent to investigate the storm, and vanishes within it, so Leo blasts off after it in his spacecraft. There is a bright flash of light, and Leo crash lands on a wild jungle of a planet, full of talking Apes, who keep timid humans as slaves. There are a few that are compassionate towards humans, but only a few. Where has Leo landed? His homing beacon still works, and it appears his crewmates have landed on the other side of the planet. If he can make it back to them, he'll be able to escape this savage, nightmarish world. But will he be able to escape?<br /><br />Apart from the Danny Elfman score, it would be hard to tell this was a Tim Burton film, if you didn't already know. Then again, Burton's spookhouse quirks don't really lend themselves to remakes of 1960s sci-fi, so maybe that's why they're kept to a minimum here. The special effects, the design of the spaceships, the costumes and makeup are all really classy I thought. They're great to look at, but they're not overdone or obsessed with being state-of-the-art. It's a heartfelt retro, rather than a slavish imitation, I thought. I also thought the way the Ape soldiers moved, closely mimicking real life primates, was a really interesting touch. I haven't seen the original, but I know enough about it to tell you that the ending is very different in this version. I'm still trying to piece together why it concluded in the way it did, its a bit of a head scratcher (in a good way, though)...<br /><br />Personally I think it's worth a look for sci-fi fans. It's not the deepest movie in the world, but it's an entertaining spectacle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, the film does have quite a few problems. Yet at the end of the movie, I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. Instead I felt like the film was merely serviceable as it had all the makings of what could've been a great film yet something or everything just completely fell apart. And also, unlike obvious ones like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and maybe Big Fish, this is probably the first time you couldn't tell Tim Burton made it. It could've been made by a James Cameron wannabe and you couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />On the orbiting space station Oberon, they discover an electromagnetic storm. They decide to send an ape in a spaceship(despite the fact it's an electromagnetic storm which could very well mess with the electronics) and sure enough he's in trouble so Leo Davidson has to rescue him but in doing so he's caught in a time wave and is sent into the distant future, crash landing on a planet. On this planet, turns out that walking talking apes rule with oppressed humans being locked up and branded.<br /><br />Not giving up, he leads a group of humans and a senator's daughter Ari and her bodyguard away from the ape society with hopes of getting home. But Thade, a nasty unforgiving ape wants to exterminate all humans and he's got a particularly big vendetta against Leo.<br /><br />Is it as bad as everyone makes it out to be? It's hard to say. The makeup is excellent, miles beyond the original. It's got a proven director at the helm, Danny Elfman supplying the score, and the cast is nice enough. However, the cast is one of its problems. To me Mark Wahlberg is in what I call the Bruce Willis group, meaning that no matter how angry or sad they get, their voice and mannerisms get in the way, making them sound bored and bland. What was surprising was Helena Bonham Carter who finally looks desirable, unlike in Fight Club. And personally, I can't stand Michael Clarke Duncan. He reminds me of one of those guys who gets one A on a test and all of a sudden thinks he's valedictorian material.<br /><br />No review of the Planet of the Apes remake...sorry, "re-imagining" without mention of the ending. While it does change things from the Statue of Liberty ending of the original and even echoes the book, it's mishandled and poorly explained that by the end of it, you're going to look on the net just to get some kind of explanation on the thing. Whatever likability, if any you develop, in watching the film just gets tossed out the window upon watching it.<br /><br />Walking in thinking it's going to be a great movie in line with the original will get you nowhere, neither is thinking it'll be a great Burton movie. Lower expectations and maybe...maybe a decent film will spring up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>A decent blockbuster yet a weak film overall, Tim Burton`s "Planet of the Apes" is surely lacking. The set design is ok, the costumes are appropriate and some of the acting is actually good, but the characters are flat and the plot is way too contrived. A watchable flick to pass the time, it doesn`t possess the absorbing atmosphere os most of the director`s oeuvre, becoming just another mildly entertaining popcorn-movie. Tim Burton could do better than this by-the-numbers adventure.<br /><br />Watchable but far from memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>This modern remaking of Planet of the Apes is ultimately a victim of its own hype.  It is by no means a bad movie, but it is also not the blockbuster thrill ride of an adventure it was forecast to be.  Then the whole brouhaha about Charlton Heston's cameo appearance and the lines he delivered gave the movie an undeserved stigma of mockery.  The whole gun control mythology built up around Heston's dialogue is as inane and improper a talking point as I have ever seen.  As for the movie, it does offer a lot of good, sometimes impressive action complemented by better than average special effects.  The apes, with a couple of exceptions, are also remarkably realistic.  The real weakness of the movie is the plot.  It seems simple enough.  Mark Wahlberg, in an adequate performance, plays Captain Leo Davidson, who decides to go after the lost space-going chimp he has trained to explore an astronomical anomaly.  He gets sucked in to the cosmic anomaly and thrown out several thousand years in the future on a planet run by intelligent apes (not monkeys, it is important to note, especially if you are in the company of apes).  Here humans are enslaved under a brutal system rife with abuse and mockery.  Not all apes support the policy of militant slavery as best represented by the cold and ruthless General Thade (Tim Roth).  Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a senator's daughter, believes that apes and man can coexist, and she ends up helping Davidson and his gang of escaped slaves to safely flee the city.  Unfortunately, what Davidson leads the humans toward is the ultimate showdown between apes and men on the planet.  A little monkey ex machina is thrown in toward the end, and this plot point works fairly well.  Not content to stop here, though, the filmmakers throw in a final twist that I applauded the first time I watched the film but regard with some ambivalence now.<p>Unfortunately, Planet of the Apes gets too cute for its own good.  Ari, a central player in events, does not carry the force she should, in my opinion, because the same makeup artists who did an outstanding job on General Thade and others tried to make her look too human; at any rate, she doesn't exactly scream "ape" at me.  Then there are all of the little in-jokes and attempts at witticism.  I'm all in favor of including the obligatory "get your hands off me, you damn dirty human" line, and I would have even welcomed the classic "a planet where apes evolved from men" quip (which was not used here, for good reason as things turn out).  However, the babbling slave trading baboon-type character with his constant complaints and ill-fated use of the "can't we all just get along" line annoyed me to no end.  Adequate characterization is lacking in several places in this movie.  I'm not sure why the human Daena (played by the exceedingly human female Estella Warren) was even included here; her obvious feelings for Davidson remain unexplored, as Davidson seems to have eyes only for the much less enticing ape woman who helped him escape.  I also cringe whenever I see Kris Kristofferson in a movie, but I guess that's just my own problem.  <p>While the movie does seem to pull punches with the storyline, it is quite generous in terms of the extras to be found on the DVD.  I have not watched any of these special features because I'm not impressed enough by the movie to really care about them, but the fact that the bonus DVD does offer commentary, five extended scenes, a music video, six documentaries on the making of the film, and some other goodies should not go unnoticed by anyone thinking about buying Planet of the Apes.  I will say that the movie can be a lot of fun to watch, but it took too much of a low road in terms of storyline and characterization to win my enthusiastic approval.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>There are, of course, problems associated with being a movie geek like me. One is the tendency to get neurotically attached to the work of favorite actors and directors, to become emotionally involved with their work. They become like family, and there is nothing more irritating than a family member disappointing one. <p>Director Tim Burton [Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow] is one of my favorites. His new, 'reimagined' version of Planet of the Apes is weak. So, I wasn't merely disappointed, I was angry. How could Tim do this to me? What was he thinking? Why would anyone so imaginative even think of redoing a classic? How could he bring shame to the 'family'? Yet, what difference can my feelings make? Burton doesn't know me from Adam.<p>In this version of Planet of the Apes, Capt. Leo Davidson [Mark Wahlberg] is part of a space mission that is studying the effectiveness of training primates to pilot small space craft. [Don't ask.] When one of the chimps gets lost in a freak magnetic storm, Davidson goes after him. He, too, gets lost and winds up on a planet where apes rule and human beings are the lesser species. He does battle with the apes. Aided by Ari [Helena Bonham-Carter], a kind ape and sort of an animal rights activist in reverse, he escapes, along with a band of humans. Ari helps Davidson and the others find the apes' sacred city, where Davidson hopes to rendezvous with his spacecraft. <p>The movie shifts between comedy, satire and serious action-adventure, leaving the viewer to think that the director was uncertain about which direction his 'reimagining' was supposed to go.<p>Big budget Hollywood spectacles aren't expected to be realistic, but Planet of the Apes completely disregards anything even remotely logical. Davidson crash lands into the planet. He must have been going three hundred miles an hour. He walks away. Minutes later, he encounters the ape army for the first time. One soldier hits him hard enough to throw him about thirty yards. Another then kicks him hard in the head with his heavy boot. Our hero cannot only still get up and walk, he hasn't a single scratch nor even a hair out of place. It's a ridiculous scene and a prime example of bad screen writing. <p>Walhberg's Davidson is a curiously flat hero. Burton has 'reimagined' him as a character with absolutely no imagination. He's not even curious as to why the apes speak English, a fact that would astound most people. He shows little desire to help free his fellow human beings from bondage. He cares only about escaping from the planet and, by extension, only about himself. If he's the hero of the future, I don't like him much. When he achieves his objective and gets back to Earth, the climatic scene there is simply a blatant setup for a sequel. <p>Visually, Burton hasn't lost his touch. This is a lush and handsome movie, filled with the rich, dark tones that are the director's signature. The apes are realistic. They are ingeniously designed so that they are easy to tell apart from one another. I loved the way they reverted to ape behavior whenever they got angry. Oddly, this was one of their more human characteristics. But none of these pluses makes up for a lame story and a lack of vision. I can highly recommend Planet of the Apes - the original 1968 version, that is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>In his own time-honored way, Tim Burton has made yet another enjoyable movie, however rotten the ending may have been.<br />Frankly, Mark Walberg should have just stayed on the now free planetarium of apes, instead of ending up where he did.<br /><br />He didn't even get the girl, well....in the conventional way at least. Actually, he seemed to be pretty populare with both species on that footing. Hmmmmmm. Must have been that manly physique of his.<br /><br />I've watched the first planet of the apes when I was younger, and I must say at least this updated version is alot cooler and interesting to watch for two hours. And its rather funny to see Charlton Heston's roles switched from the human hero to the dying father of General Thade, although his dialouge still ran in the same rut of the first one, giving us a pretty clear idea how his relations with human's lay.<br /><br />There's even a few scenes with Paul Giamatti (Sideways,Big Mamma's house,)as the slave trader. And if you've ever seen big fat liar, one can clearly see he went for the blue body garb with orange hair once again.<br /><br />A good action flick with plenty of CGI environments to spice up the apes world. The few shots of outer space in the beginning wasn't bad either, I especially enjoyed the magnetic field that Mark flew into. But enough of that, I won't bore you with any more details.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>What in the world was Tim Burton thinking of when he directed this mess?  Burton is a very talented director; I loved "Sleepy Hollow", but someone should make him write 100 times on a blackboard "IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT."  The original "Planet of the Apes" is one of the best sci-fi films ever made; it didn't need re-telling, so what was the point in remaking it?  The story line doesn't work, the apes look like humans dressing up in simian costumes on Halloween, and the dialogue is from hunger.  There's a lot of grunting and groaning that I guess is supposed to convince us that this is how apes communicate, but it's only marginally worse than the spoken lines in the film.  The mind-blowing scene in the original, Charlton Heston staring open-mouthed and bug-eyed at the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and realizing he was home all along, couldn't be duplicated in the remake, so this time around we get Mark Wahlberg zooming home from Apeland in a rocket ship and crash-landing on the front steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, only to discover that the Memorial has undergone a facelift and Lincoln now looks like the Most High Ape who successfully revolted against human domination and established the reign of the simians.  It just doesn't work; but then, neither does the picture.  See the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>Let me say this:  based on supplemental features alone, this is probably a 4 star DVD.  There are many documentaries and such, though I must say Tim Burton is very annoying on the commentary track.  He seems to go on and on without really saying anything insightful.<p>The movie is a mess.  If you're familiar with the original film (it's hard not to compare the two), you know what an impact the ending has on the whole movie.  By trying to match that shocker ending, this new version COMPLETELY NEGATES the ENTIRE film that built up to it.  I defy anyone to actually make sense of it.  Not even Tim Burton could!  Sure, he said it made perfect sense to him-- but he didn't want to explain it for fear it would foul up Fox's plans for a sequel.<p>This is a completely disposable blockbuster.  Watch or re-watch the original, or even it's sequels, before wasting time and/or money with this.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I saw the original Planet of the Apes as a child, so I was pretty geared up to see this one.  While I won't say that I didn't enjoy it, if you're a fan of the classic film, then you might want to stick with that and give this one a pass.  For one thing, Mark Wahlberg was okay as Captain Leo Davidson, but he could have done so much more with the part.  His previous role as Bobby Shatford in The Perfect Storm proved he can act, but in this movie he was so stiff and wooden that someone could have slapped him and it wouldn't have had any effect.  Helena Bonham Carter did all right as Ari, and Michael Clarke Duncan was terrific as Attar, but other than Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as the father of General Thade and Kris Kristofferson as Daena's father, most of the acting in this movie just left me cold.<p>My major issue with this film lies not with Tim Burton's directing--Semos knows that Burton can make a fairly decent movie every now and then, and the story in this one was okay--but with the ending.  It just came off as too contrived and hokey, and it really didn't strike me as a good way to open things up for a sequel.<p>In the end, I'll just say what I did at the start--if you're a newbie to the Planet of the Apes films, then go ahead and watch this one, but if you're a fan of the classic Apes movies, then pass this one up.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>The First Planet of the Apes(the good one) was a masterful work intriging in its sutlety and well deserving in its reputation.  This movie hits you with all the skill of a blast from a shotgun.  You see in the first planet of the apes the other humans didn't talk for a reason, to have them talk would have messed up a perfectly good story(like it does in the 2001 verson).  So instead of seeing the new &quot;supercharged&quot; one just stick to the classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>An astronaut trying to retrieve a monkey in space ends up landing on a planet inhabited by talking human-like apes.

I could not dream of a better movie to see. It was quiet unique about the story about how he traveled in time. And the end, it was quiet interasting how this movie ended, too.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows allowing for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the costumes, and the music are all EXCELLENT.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to the human slaves who do not have a "slave" mentality characterized by fear and humility; instead, they behave like...

A reimagining of the 1968 classic "Planet of the Apes," Burton would use the same concept and put a different twist on things. Major Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) has to recapture a lost monkey pilot who was testing out a space pod, but unfortunately, he got sucked into a time funnel. While traveling into the distant future and crash landing on a planet ruled by apes, Davidson had to fight authority. He gathered a group of humans to rebel against the mean General Thade (Tim Roth) and regain equality. An ape with the name Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) believed the humans were being mistreated and helped them fight. The battle sequence that involved Davidson's spaceship blasting the apes away was forever genius. I have never laughed so hard seeing monkeys fly. Even Donkey Kong would've thought that was funny. Silly monkeys! Even though this movie doesn't surpass the original, it's still worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>I am a Tim Burton fan, although his standard practice of sacrificing a good story for good visuals gets on my nerves.  That wasn't the problem with this movie, though.  Well, at least not the main problem.  The problem here, and it's the same problem he ran head-on into with the dreadful "Mars Attacks", is that he's trying to make a campy and kitschy homage.  But you can't intentionally concoct camp and kitsch; they are unintentionally and organically grown from the best of intentions.  And they are especially undermined by a plus size budget.<p>Witness the references and gimmicks he throws at the screen, hoping for a knowing chuckle from an aware audience: an ape yells "Take your stinking hands off me you damn dirty *human*"; Charlton Heston makes a cameo and cries "damn them all... damn them all to hell" again, only this time he's an ape; and a twist ending utilizes a famous landmark for shock value.  Taken out of context, these all seem like damn good ideas.  But when they're the screenwriters' only good ideas, how much weight can they really carry?  Not much, I'd say. <p>My hope going in was that Burton would at least do a fine job creating a contained world, one that we'd never seen before.  Well, I'd seen it before... in the first "Apes" movie.  Sure, there are more vines on the walls, and most of the scenes in "Ape City" are filmed during dusk or night hours instead of under harsh sunlight, but the basic pod-like structure of the city was too familiar to give any credit to Burton and his production designers.  As for the apes themselves, most of the time their make-up looked magnificent.  Each character had his/her own distinctive face with a budding personality.  Unfortunately, when shot in close-up the make-up tends to look fake, and not nearly enough attention was paid to the women's make-up as the men's.  Also, the nature of the apes' social interactions could have been explored further.  The film touches on this subject, showing apes quietly grooming each other, or displaying their position in the pecking order with solid punches.  But anyone who's read Will Self's satire "Great Apes" (which borrows its central idea from the original "Planet of the Apes") will know that there was a whole spectrum of actions that could have been shown, but sadly weren't.<p>The most grievous error, to my mind, is the fact that Burton had a wonderful cast of actors to work with (I count at least four Oscar nominations in the group), and barely a single, well-defined character to offer them.<p>Helena Bonham Carter gets the most to do.  Her Ari, a senator's daughter, is the vocal conscience of the film, aghast at the second-class treatment humans get.  She is intelligent (or at least relative to her company), passionate, and strong-willed.  Carter also manages to wring some sex appeal from Ari, with either a lingering glance or a gentle nod of the head.  Too bad her subtle advances towards astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) are never reciprocated.  Wahlberg, an actor who I usually like, is as bland as white bread here.  He is nothing more than a talk-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick macho guy.  I can't remember Leo ever stringing two or more sentences together.  He is vaguely heroic, patriotic, stubborn, and simple-minded.  These attributes could have worked -- the innocent thrust into a fantastic situation -- but Leo is supposed to be a complicated man with complicated problems; too bad he isn't.  If Wahlberg as Leo gets to play three different colors here -- red, white, and blue -- then Tim Roth as General Thade gets only one: blood red.  Roth is a fantastic actor, limited to constant anger here.  Thade is never allowed to show any humanity (or, rather, chimpanity).  He's stuck in fourth gear for the entire picture.  And frankly, I didn't find him that menacing.  Michael Clarke Duncan pulls off his big and burly silverback gorilla quite well, although it's more of a physical role than an emotional one.  Estella Warren is really just around for eye-candy (she has wonderfully pouty lips, and appears to have an endless supply of lipstick!).  It's one of the most inconsequential roles I've seen in years.  Paul Giamatti, as a human slave-trader, is dirty, grimy, quite real, and terribly funny.  He seems to be the only member of the cast (besides possibly Roth) who understands how to perform facial expressions under his make-up.  He needed more screen time, if only to help break up the monotony.<p>As the story winds down to its inevitable big-bang conclusion, things get a little muddled.  The explanation of the apes' origin was handled quite well; it's the one plot point that the filmmaker's appear to have thought through, and nearly duplicates the surprise end of the original "Apes" movie.  But then, we are treated to a ludicrously hokey `deux es machinas' conclusion to the final battle.  And from there, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the incredibly illogical conclusion, which is just shock-value for the sake of shock-value, and a bold-faced lie.  The filmmakers show the audience one thing, and then expect them to believe another.  It just can't happen the way it does.  If anyone can explain to me why it can, please do.  Otherwise, I will continue to be angered by the deception.  And resentful of the memory of this shoddy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg is strangely miscast as the human antihero who must try to escape from the Planet of the Apes in this interesting spin on the now iconic Rod Serling story.  Roddy McDowell may not be around for this one, but Linda Harrison and Charlton Heston are both cleverly inserted and the real scene stealers are the wonderful simian makeups on the costumed cast members.<br /><br />Sets, design, music are all wonderful and while die hard, nostalgic fans of the original can find plenty of fault with a new version, lots of credit goes to the creative forces (including the studio) for coming up with 2 hours of diverting sci-fi action and comedy.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti channels Burt Lahr's Cowardly Lion in his slave-trading orangutan and Oz's still-scary winged monkeys are lovingly memorialized by director Burton (whose stammering commentary track was a disappointment).</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Here's a remake that is often silly, the ending is so far over the top it has skid marks, and Mark Wahlberg goes through every single scene with the same constipated grimace, yet I still had fun watching Tim Burton's version of PLANET OF THE APES.  A little technology since the 1968 original goes a long way, including some dynamic special effects, and ape makeup that looks astonishingly real.  (How does Helena Bonham Carter in full ape attire actually look good?  I dunno.) Plus Burton lets his apes monkey around; they're actually jumping and screeching and doing stuff with their feet--not to mention some intimate grooming.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the original story to know (or care) which version pays more homage; what I do know is if you can get past all the silliness (and the urge to hose down a greasy Kris Kristofferson) you will enjoy some actors mucking it up as apes, including a wickedly funny Paul Giamatti and a hulking Michael Clarke Duncan.  Tim Roth plays the villain ape in primate evil fashion, while there's even a cameo by the great Charlton Heston himself, in, irony of ironies, ape makeup.  No, PLANET OF THE APES will never make my Ten Best, yet Tim Burton's tongue-in-cheek tribute to the original is still pretty darn fun.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Year of Release: 2001<br />Director: Tim Burton<br />Country: USA<br />Runtime: 119 minutes<br /><br />THE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.<br /><br />I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of "Planet of the Apes." The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.<br /><br />It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.<br /><br />This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.<br /><br />These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualties to the remake.<br /><br />For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.<br /><br />Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's "friend."<br /><br />As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.<br /><br />The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).<br /><br />I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.<br /><br />Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the "Lincoln Memorial" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or "Beneath," but it's, at least, on a par with "Escape." And it's certainly better than "Conquest" and, especially, "Battle."<br /><br />The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious "Apes" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or "Beneath"), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>A bland, generic, corporate-motivated PG-13 near-dud of a movie.  I never saw the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, but it had to be infinitely better than this mess.  The DVD, from what I understand, is a well-assembled package, but a mediocre movie is still a mediocre movie.  Proceed with caution.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>POA isn't reimagined as much as underimagined. The production design, cinematography, make up and most of the effects work are among the best of the year. The screenplay, on the other hand, is another story (pardon the pun). Clearly reworked a number of times by a number of writers (the old equation was for every writer credited add two more so, if we use this, there were at least six writers involved. Even if this isn't true it shows) Film making by committee only works when there is a vision. Burton clearly doesn't have it for this workmanlike remake.<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with story details as others have covered that already. I will, however, cover the quality of the film, discs and extras. The film has it's moments. There are a number of stunning set pieces but little follow through. The opening sequence could have been even more stunning if there was a sense of suspense and if Mark Wahlberg could act. He can't. I have to ask this--why is he seemingly out of breath throughout most of the film? There clearly was a lot of thought put into the acting (or in the case of Tim Roth overacting--maybe he was trying to make up for the short comings of other cast members). The acting varies depending on performer. There are a number of striking performances buried in a pile of over and underwhelming performances.<br /><br />The meat of the disc is in the ability to watch picture in picture with an explaination how how a scene was created. The audio commentary by Burton is less than informative at times (when it comes to the left of center ending...he can't justify it beyond saying, it works for me). Like many remakes (Wild Wild West comes to mind), POA is a misfire. Rule of thumb for most films is that if Kris Kristoferson can be found in any frame of the film, it's probably bad (there are rare exceptions to this rule).<br /><br />The second disc goes bananas with documentaries about the making of the film. These are actually quite interesting. You're able to a variety of make up tests all at the same time and choose which one you want to listen to. Interesting concept that should be applied to a number of contemporary film classics. This makes purchasing the disc or renting it almost worthwhile.<br /><br />If there is a sequel to POA, Burton only has to go up from here. Like the first Star Trek film, POA has a lot of potential. It just doesn't measure up to what inspired it. The original film despite the fact that many of the effects haven't aged well (although the stunning crash landing sequence could teach Burton a thing or two about film making and suspense. A pity Franklin Schaffer isn't around to offer some advice), the script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson (Emmy and Academy Award winners)was always intelligent. Both Serling and Wilson knew when to play it straight and camp it up. I'd give POA 1 1/2 stars for the film and another star for the extras.<br /><br />A pity that millions of dollars was wasted on this film. Another criticism--this one directed at 20th Century Fox; the great extras and fine packaging is how the original film classic should have been treated. The shoddy extras on that film and the lack of inclusion of the documentary (or even parts of it) is inexcusable. Although Franklin Schaffer isn't with us any longer (nor Serling, McDowell or Wilson), Kim Hunter and Charleton Heston are very much alive and active. Both could have been called on to provide an audio commentary. Fox needs to take a hint from the reissues that Anchor & Bay have been doing. For a great example of how a film classic should be treated check out The Wicker Man (the 2 disc set) or The Devil Rides Out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>There was no justification to "reimagine" this 1968 sci-fi classic. From a box-office standpoint, the 2001 "Planet of the Apes" filled 20th Century Fox's coffers as a cynical, money-grubbing enterprise. Artistically, the film represents a low point in director Tim Burton's mostly impressive career, with an all-star cast hopelessly lost in space. A thoroughly unpleasant experience.</p></br></body></html>

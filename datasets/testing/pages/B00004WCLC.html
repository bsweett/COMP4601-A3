After seeing it 3 times, I now realize it's a brilliant work and one of the all time classics for a drama.  The performances are just unbelievable.  All of the actors completely immersed themselves into their roles.  This type of passion is rarely seen in today's cinema.  Paul thomas anderson captured magic in a bottle and Magnolia lives on as a documantation of brilliant cinema. It is story driven and character driven and it is why Paul Thomas Anderson in my oppinion is one of the best directors and writers in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Even braver and deeper emotionally than Paul Thomas Anderson's<br />wonderful 'Boogie Nights', and in some ways a more mature, if less<br />blazingly dynamic work. Full of amazing shots, amazing performances.<br />The epic, multi-layered film 'Short Cuts' wanted to be.<br /><br />That said there are a few flaws. The biblical ending doesn't quite work<br />for me. I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that's<br />less emotional than the film that proceeded it. And a few<br />moments of irony are forced. That was true in 'Boogie Nights' too, but<br />because that film had a lighter, more self-mocking touch, even the<br />heavy handed moments didn't stick out.<br /><br />None-the-less, this is a must see film, overflowing with great<br />performances, unconventional storytelling, heartbreaking moments, and<br />an honest look at where we are and who we are as a society.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>'Magnolia' is quite a film, and though I could find fault with it, it is almost too impressive and monumental to attack. It is kind of like a mosaic, where a lot of interrelated characters and intertwined stories keep our interest, keep us waiting to see how it will all connect and how all the story threads will be tied together--but some are while others end ambiguously. The promised epiphany is never delivered--and yet I am forced to applaud Anderson's bravado, spunk, and panache. I think the title, Magnolia, was meant to imply that the various and sundry story lines were like the petals of a flower (it seems like whenever they are in a different room, there are always pictures of flowers on the wall). The title "Magnolia" not only refers to Magnolia Blvd in Los Angeles, where much of Magnolia takes place, but is also similar to the term Charles Fort (who is referenced many times in this film) coined for a hypothetical place where things that fall from the sky originate - "Magonia".<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: Have you ever been struck by lightning? It hurts.<br />=========================================<br /><br />The mosaic, flower petal structure is kind of like the Oscar winning Crash--but at least Crash, it could be argued, had a unifying theme of racism and racial tensions in Los Angeles to tie it all together. Magnolia does have a kind of a thesis, that strange coincidences happen in life, and if they were in a movie, you wouldn't believe it. Perhaps it could be summed up as "truth is stranger than fiction" except it is hard to see how the strange mixture of banal, and mundane with fantastic and surreal, add up to anything remotely resembling a coherent artistic statement.<br /><br />------------------<br />Jim Kurring: Now, some neighbors claimed they heard screaming and a loud crash.<br />Marcie: I don't even know no loud crash.<br />===========================<br /><br />I mean, just as things are getting to their grimmest for several of Magnolia's many story lines there is a musical sequence where all the characters, some even dying of cancer, sing along to an Aimee Mann song. The song, "Wise Up," was also used in the film, Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise. Think that was weird? You ain't seen nothin' yet, though, when there is a deus ex machina moment of Biblical proportions (don't want to spoil it for anyone, but check out Exodus 8:2, and therefore keep an eye out for the numbers 8 & 2 which feature prominently in Magnolia).<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: I'm sick and I'm in love.<br />Thurston Howell: You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: That's right. That's the first time you've been right. I confuse the two and I don't care.<br />==========================================<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson is a very ambitious director, and one wonders how he seemingly went from grip to auteur overnight. He has absorbed so much film history that you would almost think he was just a copycat but he always uses what he has learned in a very creative and original way. He likes to work with an ensemble of actors, and in that he is like Robert Altman, the Coen Brothers, or even Will Ferrell, and indeed lots of his regulars are also shared with those directors. John C. Reilly and William H. Macy spring to mind. Though he must be comfortable working with his stalwarts, he is not afraid to approach big name actors. It is my understanding that he approached Tom Cruise on the set of 'Eyes Wide Shut,' the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. How he got Cruise to play Frank T. J. Mackey, the leader of a strange cult who conducts seminars on how to "Seduce and Destroy" females is anybody's guess, but the result was Tom Cruise's most unsympathetic yet riveting movie role.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Gwenovier: Come on, Frank. What are you doing?<br />Frank T.J. Mackey: What am I doing? I'm quietly judging you.<br />==============================<br /><br />So, as I'm quietly judging Magnolia, the verdict is guilty of being a most impressive cinematic monument in spite or because of its total lack of a coherent message. Really great performances from Magnolia's ensemble cast, and a really compelling vision from director Paul Thomas Anderson. A really long movie, but one that held my interest throughout. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Claudia Wilson Gator: Now that I've met you, would you object to never seeing me again?<br />=====================================<br /><br />DIRECTED BY PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FXWU6">There Will Be Blood</a> (2007)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00151QYWG">Punch-Drunk Love</a> (2002)<br />Magnolia (1999)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a> (1997)<br /><br />FILM ROLES OF JULLIANNE MOORE<br /><br />I'm Not There.

If you pay attention at the beginning of the movie, Anderson's point is simple; there are no accidents and things are never seemingly random events that occur due to blind, doo-dah luck. We're presented with a canvas of characters: a male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)caring for a dying TV executive (Jason Robards); The dying man's unhinged wife (Julianne Moore)who tries to hold it all together when she realizes she's fallen in love with a man she simply married for his money; the dying man's estranged son (Tom Cruise)a guru for lonely men who sells a self actualiziation program designed to help men seduce women and treat them like dirt; a child (Stanley Barry) on a winning streak on a TV game show who feels like he's a freak on display; the host of the show (Philip Baker Hall)who is estranged from his only daughter (Melora Walter); a lonely police officer (John C. Reilly) and a winning contestant from the game show (William H. Macy)who is now all grown up and on a major losing streak. All of their lives intersect in Los Angeles in this marvelously acted if slighly overwrought drama.<br /><br />Anderson's ambitious film unfolds over three hours interconnecting, twisting together all these different divergent stories into a cohesive whole. They are all damaged people trying to repair themselves in the large, impersonal city of Los Angeles. Although it's a bit overlong with too many crescendos, it's another well made ensemble piece from Anderson.<br /><br />Everybody focuses on the frogs and their meaning. They do indeed descent like sort of plague but, more importantly, they manage to unite many of these divergent characters, deal out grim justice and help those who have made a mistake undo it. It all goes back to Paul Thomas Anderson's theme that things always happen for a reason and we all have some sort of purpose even if we don't understand the consequences or how our own little lives intertwine with others.<br /><br />The stories are framed by Aimee Mann's thoughtful, melodic songs and Jon Brion's effective score. While it isn't a perfect film, it's notable for its ambitious story and the Altman-like structure of the film. In fact, "Short Cuts" and "Magnolia" have a lot in common except that Altman's film works as a sustained narrative better than Paul Thomas Anderson's film. You can put that down to experience vs. talent--both are extremely talented film directors with their own unique view of the world.<br /><br />This two disc set has extremely good image quality with robust colors and a sharp picture. While this is about 5 years old on DVD, it still looks exceptionally good (and better than other films released along the same time frame). The 5.1 sound mix sounds terrific although some of the dialogue was drowned out at the trimphumant conclusion of the film if listened to in 2.0 format vs. the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround format.<br /><br />The extras include an exceptionally good documentary on the making of the movie which, while illuminating, isn't always enlightening.We also get an assortment of deleted scenes, TV spots and Aimee Mann's great song "Save Me" and the music video that aired at the time helping to revive her career. A complex, fascinating mediation on love, lonliness and anger and all it all both uniques and divides us all at the same time, "Magnolia" isn't for everyone but then again everyone has their own favorite flower.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I'm not naive. I'm not unrealistic. I'm tedious and overly critical when I watch films, looking and searching for flaws and agendas. This film, this Magnolia, was a piece of heavenly humanity on film. We see a number of seemingly all-together folks who need SOMETHING in all their lives to fill their various voids, their pains, their yearnings. This something comes together in many realistic ways but under the umbrella of a miraculous event at the end of the film.  <p>Each character has demons to answer to in this movie. For one man, his grievances come in the form of pushy parents who took his boyhood by making him focus singularly on winning a boy genius competion. Years later, when he is grown, another young boy must grow through the process of a selfishly pushy father who is always makes sure to say, "I love you" whenever talking to his son, even if his actions say otherwise. <p>There is a woman who's married a man for his money but later falls in love with him as he dies of cancer in his living room. The man's son, Tom Cruise, is living with his own pitfalls and attempts harboring his pain by playing the daily role of a extremely confident sex guru. "Tame her" is his theme and his following involves thousands of men with voids themselves. <p>There is a Christian cop who has the heart of a lamb but the insecurities of a psych patient. He falls for a crack-head who has ancient scars of her own to deal with. It is their relationship, in my opinion, that steals the show. <p>There are others, of course; a talk show host who has three months to live; a compassionate male nurse who attempts the reuniting of two bitterly astranged family members; a young black boy who - for the briefest of moments - manages to steal our hearts in a handsome display of well-being for his fellow man.  Despite their confident smiles and tones, each person in this film is deeply frail. Each wanders aimlessly through stormy torments but, luckily for all of them, hope and resolution rises firmly on the horizon.  <p>A stirring film with raw emotion and deep compassion. This film has plenty of vulgarities so be warned; however, without some of it, the truly humanistic style would fail to be portrayed. WATCH THIS FILM!! Engrossing, intriguing, thought-provoking and beautifully graceful, Magnolia is an emotional powerful film if there ever was one.  <p>The acting in this film is TOP NOTCH and so if the music. If you have three hours to spare, give this film a chance! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Magnolia&quot; is a film of the highest regard, taking on a massive amount of story and turning it into three hours of nothing but real-to-life scenarios and themes. These experiences are embedded in the lives of various people who we are intoduced to throughout the movie, who quietly and outwardly affect one another's lives throughout the course of a single day. This is done with the utmost precision and intelligence in storytelling and brilliance, providing an intriguing and mesmerizin look into their lives. There is not a single theme left untouched, a certain lifestyle or event unturned, and in its slow and building narrative, I found myself wanting to know more about these peoples' lives instead of becoming bored with it. <p>On this point, the movie delivers, starting off by introducing us to the characters, all of whom will appear thin and uninvolving during the first third of the movie. Rich man Earl Partridge is terminally ill, under the care of male nurse Phil Parma while his young wife Linda runs around in circles for his medication and retainment of her sanity. Frank T.J. Mackey, whose middle initials remain a mystery until later, runs an organization called &quot;Seduce and Destroy,&quot; which teaches men to &quot;respect&quot; the male member while taming the female. Overly emotional cop Jim Kurring, a simple man who talks to himself, aspires to become involved with coke addict Claudia Gator, who likes loud music and has an extreme hatred for her father Jimmy Gator, who is the host of a game show named &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; and is ill with cancer. A contestant on the show, Stanley Spector, is ruled over by his father, who cares more for his son's fame than his well-being. And Donnie Smith, a well-known contestant of the show many years ago, wants a pair of braces in hopes of attaining a relationship with a local braces-sporting bartender. <p>The movie takes all of this in stride for the first hour, but soon takes a different avenue in the characters' lives. Things begin to take a turn for the worse, or the better; it's all in how the audience views these changes. We learn things about the characters that some willingly admit, some have tried to keep hidden from the world, and some who cannot help but let their feelings escape. This outward emotional vent takes the movie into a realization period: these revelations are what tie the separate stories together, and it's intriguing to watch how each one reacts to different truths, and the actions they take upon these discoveries. <p>The story requires a lack of logic; its dealings with chance and coincidence are very heavy-handed and will lead most viewers to disbelieve in its story and twists. I, too, found myself beginning to dwindle away from the story until things started picking up, and then I realized that in paying attention to the mere coincidences the story takes on, one will certainly miss out on the important themes, emotions and feelings that the movie conveys. There is a point to the movie, and if you can make it past the first hour, which may test the patience of some, you'll find that it's well worth the wait to discover just what secrets it has been hiding. <p>The final act of the movie is all about coming to terms with ones self, with others around them, and with the realizations of the past, the present, and the effects both will have on the future. Through each of these characters' lives, we learn many different things: The past cannot be put away, no matter how hard you may try; sins are forgiven, whether it be the committer of that sin or a person who finds them in turmoil. These, among others, are the many themes and realities of life that come to pass in a day in the life of these people, and they are what seal the film's fate as one of surprisingly heartfelt emotion and understanding of the human heart and mind. <p>The cast for this movie is, bar-none, the best I've ever seen in any film. Period. In a movie like this, the cast makes the movie, and here, there is nothing but total admiration for such intriguing performances. The leads and supporting roles are played by Tom Cruise (Frank), whose peformance is one of the movie's best, Philip Baker Hall (Jimmy Gator), Melora Gator (Claudia), William H. Macy (Donnie), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Phil) in his best and most moving performance to date, Jason Robards (Earl Partridge), Julianna Moore (Linda), John C. Reilly (Jim Kurring), who provides most of the film's insight and thought, and Jeremy Blackman as Stanley. These actors are so interesting to watch onscreen, partly because of their talent, and partly because director Paul Thomas Anderson infuses them with his enthusiasm and joy of making this movie so brilliant. <p>There is never a meaningless moment in &quot;Magnolia:&quot; what we're left with is an intense and energetic examination into the ways that chance affect the lives of everyday people, and the things we do in life that affect who we become emotionally, physically and socially. Anderson is able to make all of this work by tying up all loose ends as the movie draws to a close, leaving us with no questions as to what happens to the characters as they move on in life. The cast, the moving ways in which the script manipulates them, and the overall effect are outstanding, making this the best picture of 1999.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>In order to get<p>P.T.'s rambling, froggy flick<p>Bring with a bible</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>How the Hell did the Academy chose which actors to nominate for this film, that would have driven me crazy. If you look at the cast list, you'll obviously see alot of exceptionally talented actors. And if you watch the film, you'll be shocked to see that nearly every one of them is also in their best role. Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Phillip Baker Hall, John C Reilly, William H Macy. They are all (once again) Phenominal. The opening 5 minutes of the film is also one of the greatest openings i've ever seen.. Ever. Did I mention that the middle and the End are also brilliant, It really is a great film. If your still sceptical.. See it anyway, at over 3 hours, your bound to find something you like.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>I loved reading the reviews on this one. Some really loved it, others really hated it. Some in between, too. I would not call it great, but I really did like it. It's hard to believe it was over 3 hours long. I thought EVERY actor was VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. And I was never bored. I do think it was kinda' strange. I would only recommend this one selectively. The word PRETENTIOUS came up often in the negative reviews. I do not agree with that. Different yes, pretentious no. Not for everyone on a number of levels. Die Hard it's not.<br />It is difficult for me to understand how anyone could find Tom Cruise' performance anything other than stellar. I really liked John C Reilly in this, and I normally don't. Macy was fabulous and so was Moore. Robards was really good and so was Hoffman. A really great cast, and EVERYONE was at the top of their acting game. BRAVO.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Director/writer/producer Paul Thomas Anderson delivered this Christmas present to critics and filmgoers in 1999 with his follow-up to the successful "Boogie Nights."  Many of the same cast members reappear here, in what could be described as a messy stew of mostly unlikable characters.  Anderson's sense of filmmaking tends to mimic some of Robert Altman's best films ("Short Cuts", "Nashville" come to mind) in which an ensemble cast with little connection cross paths in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Anderson sets the stage at the beginning showing what appear to be newsreel clips of unusual and coincidental events from the 1940's.  In one of the film's story lines, an old man (Jason Robards) lies dying in his home, full of cancer.  His much younger wife (Julianne Moore) who had married him for his money is now prescription drug dependent and remorseful as he nears death.  The man's estranged son (Tom Cruise in an Oscar nominated performance) is a televangelist-like motivational speaker whose pitch is to convince men they can sexually exploit women.  Another pairing is Claudia (Melora Walters) as a cocaine addict who gets a visit from a cop (John C. Reilly) who lacks self-confidence in his personal and professional life.  Phillip Baker Hall is an aging game show host who just learned he is also dying of cancer.  He's also the father of Claudia.  One of the game show contestants is boy of about 12 (Jeremy Blackman), brilliant and controlled by an overbearing father.  A previous contestant who became famous (William H. Macy) is now nearly broke and contemplates robbing his former employer.<br /><br />The film is full of stellar performances throughout.  Watch Cruise as Frank Mackey when his cocky banter with a female journalist devolves into total silence as she probes his early life.  Check out Robards as the dying TV executive when he confesses to his caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) his many regrets regarding his family.  The always remarkable Moore stews in a scene where the pharmacists question her need for the strong narcotics she is getting at a drug store.  The film is certainly not without controversy and humor as many of the events seem so random and unlikely, but go back to the opening.<br /><br />Then there is the final act and the now iconic "rain of frogs."  What does it mean?  Well, I'm not sure.  There is the biblical passage out of Exodus where God speaks of this event if the "slaves" are not allowed to leave with Moses.  Are the "slaves" the children being exploited in the film?  Perhaps the best answer is the closing seen where young Stanley (Blackman) sits in a library during the frog falling and says "This happens.  This is something that happens."  Probably just as much as the cast singing over Aimee Mann's "Save Me" in individual scenes.  Anything might happen on Magnolia Street.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>There was a time when making films that were going against all possible rules in the profession was a dear pastime of some film makers. This film is one of these. Everything is upside down.<br /><br />First an irritating musical sound tracks behind and often over the dialogue. The absolutely absurd succession of short sequences of characters that have nothing in common at first sight and even at second sight. Some connections only become clear at the very end of the film. A lot of old people who have been forgotten on burial day though they are more ghostlike than just plain phantoms,, oops! Sorry, sorry senior citizens, all in the process of dying of all kinds of unnameable ailments, mostly cancer if I heard the words properly in the short silences of the music track.<br /><br />All of them are abominable. Particularly the men, but at the same time the women are not better, subservient and only interested in the security they are and have been provided with. Some are vultures even, and openly so. The younger ones are not more presentable. A drug addict, a social climber, and a few others. We are in the deepest pit of a zoo and all the predators were put together down there like twenty spiders in a pot.<br /><br />Among these one cop who is a fool who believes people can repent and even repair their mistakes and that his real function is to forgive them and by forgiving them lead them into reforming. Marvellous, divine, angelic, with a good dose of sugar on top and whip cream &agrave; la mode.<br /><br />But for such an end to be reached you need a miracle and the miracle happens in the middle of the night after everyone has failed, flunked, fled away from their responsibilities, confessed their crimes. The worse oldie is that dying man who bluntly and flatly tells us that he was in love with his wife, his high school crush, sweetheart, but that he cheated on her for twenty-two or twenty-three years just because he wanted her to be a man since she was intelligent and could not be a woman. Closet homosexual who finally abandoned her in the hands of their son who was at the time under age to take care of a dying mother. Absolutely pathetic and that son finally arrives and cries on the bed of his dying father. This time burlesque.<br /><br />And to make that miracle of reformation happen God will send a powerful sign in the middle of the night from the sky and that I won't reveal. But it really is Mark Twain revisited. The taller the tale, the more believable. Though it turns this story into a farce, a grotesque commedia dell arte prank. So what's left at the end?<br /><br />This world is neurotic at least, psychotic in the middle and schizophrenic at most or at best. We don't live in our minds and in our gentility. We live in the surrounding noise of constant elevator music which at times sounds like a tornado in a culvert. We are blended, mashed, pureed by this constant continuous sound track and we start reacting like demented puppets suffering from Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, a condition that causes people to make repeated, nervous tic-like movements and utter innumerable swear words strung up like never-ending necklaces of excrement. This is a serious disease and the film seems to tell us it is the normal condition of everyday life for everybody starting as soon as the person can utter two words and they probably don't say mama or papa any more in Los Angeles, but rather kaka and some onomatopoeia for the backside hole that brings the soul to the fundament of the body, the backside exhaust pipe of the individual, the AAA-soul.<br /><br />But if that is the depth of our lot then God is right to send some severe punishment down onto us to make us recapture some dignity. By the way, you will probably see that Tom Cruise could do better than he does in many of his films. He must have been inspired by this story of AAA-souls lost in the mud of senior-citizenship and midlife crisis.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Like anything people can create, opinions will vary and it's nice to have that choice of being able to like what you want and pursue your specific interests since there's so much material and picks to choose from. But then what if a film gets unanimous acclaim and everyone enjoys it yet you didn't like it from the start or just simply were too slow to notice its faults or greatness? Such was the case with Magnolia which I found on first viewing to be incredibly self-indulgent and seemed as if it wanted to do anything it can so that people can see what a complex and ambitious work it was. Second viewing? I liked it more.<br /><br />The film has a wide assortment of characters with the key being that they all intersect and through association, know each other. But basically we have a self-help guru for men (Tom Cruise), a talk show host (Philip Baker Hall), an ailing old man (Jason Robards), his wife (Julianne Moore) and his nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the talk show host's daughter (Melora Walters) who meets a nice cop one day (John C. Reilly), and a former contestant on the show (William H. Macy). The film takes on the issues of death, consequence and fate and whether things can really be called coincidences.<br /><br />Magnolia I think is one of those kind of films where there's just a genuine spunk of energy and spontaneity that even if you didn't like it, you had to admit there's a lot of passion to make it work and everyone gives it their all. From rock-solid performances all around from Cruise (yes, I said him: forget the crazy antics, when he wants, he CAN act) to the Reilly/Walters story to the confidence in the writing and directing, it's a film I can certainly appreciate. But that don't mean it isn't completely flawless: the length might get to people (3 hours and 10 mins or so), the frogs will completely come out of left field if it wasn't spoiled before and some storylines or characters could've been exorcised completely. On and the tagline might as well be "we may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us" so it's repeated no less than 4 times.<br /><br />But the film for all its issues never once gets dull or you start to tune out of the whole story. From the characters to even the pacing and several memorable moments, there's always something that'll click. And when something doesn't, such as a cop's run-in with a profanity-spewing woman (like every word of dialogue literally has a swear in it it seems) or a long stretch of scenes accompanied by tense score that makes it seem like a 20 minute long crescendo, there's character moments like a bedside confessional or the delightful closing shot that helps bring the film back. It might not all work but not once does it feel incoherent or sloppy.<br /><br />1999 was a huge year for movies with stuff like the Blair Witch Project doing something different and fresh though not altogether innovative to American Beauty which brought with it more indie-minded filmmaking to the Matrix and its visuals, Magnolia fits right in. Not the most accessible film in his oeuvre and even polarizing for some but it can connect with some.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>its a two tape long movie but its great and its actors do good. the end with all the frogs was unexpected fot me and it was hilarious to see that, its rainging frogs damnit!!!

In  attempting to do so much, the film actually suffered from excessive  brilliance.  Paul Thomas Anderson gives us a powerful auteur piece that  succeeds on most levels, but comes up short of its true potential.<p>The  story follows one day in the lives of nine major characters and a host of  minor ones whose lives are loosely connected to one man by various threads.  Anderson does inspired work, giving us deep character development for each  of the nine.  Many themes run through the work, but the most pervasive is  that of guilt and remorse.  Moreover, almost every effort at atonement was  rejected or thwarted in some way, evoking great pathos and a sense of  despondent fatalism.  This is clearly some of the best and most thought  provoking dark writing ever done.<p>From a directorial standpoint, the film  was a magnificent display of directorial virtuosity.  Anderson handled  scenes, actors and visual details with the flair of a maestro.  The swirl  of scenes from character to character, the use of the camera and music, the  juxtaposition of scenes, everything was superbly done.  Yet, the whole was  less than the sum of the parts due to Anderson's inability to let go of  elements that encumbered the film (an irony since one of the main themes of  the story was about being able to let go).  <p>Michaelangelo once commented  that inside every block of marble, there is a masterpiece, and the sculptor  needs only cut away the right pieces.  Editing is one of most excruciating  tasks of an auteur since each excision discards part of his soul.  However,  stoical editing is the area that differentiates great writer/directors from  the good ones.<p>This film had everything necessary to be one of the truly  great films of our times, but it suffered from excess.  There were too many  characters.  The story would have lost almost nothing by eliminating Donnie  (William Macy), Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Claudia (Melora  Walters).  These characters really didn't add that much to the  philosophical points being made in the film and made the film unwieldy.  This would have trimmed forty-five minutes to an hour from the film and  turned the focus more on the relationship between Earl Partridge (Jason  Robards) and his son Frank (Tom Cruise) that was the very best element of  the film.<p>Also, Anderson went overboard on the profanity.  I am no prude  in this regard.  I believe that profanity adds realism to a film because  people are frequently profane in real life.  I disdain the self-righteous  prigs who are offended by it.  However, overuse of any device to the extent  that it starts to burden the story ultimately detracts from it.  Anderson  crossed that line.  It seemed like he was trying to set a record for  frequency and volume of vulgar expletives.  If all the profanity were  edited out, the film would have been 30 minutes shorter and Julianne Moore  would have had about five lines.<p>Finally, the plague of the frogs taken  from Chapter 8 of Exodus was ill advised, as was the chorus of song by all  the major characters at their point of greatest despondency.  Anderson was  trying to make important points with both of these devices, but in the  process, they trivialized an exceptionally powerful drama to the point of  eye rolling incredulity.<p>Anderson was so uncompromising about every  detail of his artistic vision that he missed the Big Picture (pun  intended).  The final version that was released would have been better  released later as the director's cut.  If Anderson had edited the  theatrical release effectively, he could have had it both ways.  He could  have had a commercial success, critical acclaim, and he still could have  given people an opportunity to see his entire vision.  <p>As to the acting,  this is probably the best ensemble performance I have ever seen.  Tom  Cruise was nominated for a best supporting Oscar and much as I love Michael  Caine and his performance in "The Cider House Rules", this was no contest.  Cruise was electrifying.  This was one of his best performances ever.  I  also thought Jason Robards' performance was worthy of supporting actor  nomination.  He was tremendous as the dying patriarch.  The rest of the  cast was phenomenal without exception.<p>It is easy to understand why this  film failed at the box office (at $23M, it grossed $14M less than its $37M  budget).  It was far too abstruse, intense, dark, philosophical and wry  (not to mention lengthy) to have popular appeal.  Of those who actually saw  it, most either loved it or hated it.  I must admit to feeling both  emotions.  I loved its genius but I hated that its final form didn't do  that genius justice.  Thus, I rated it an 8/10.  It will undoubtedly become  a cult classic rather than the true classic it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Strange things happen in life; random occurrences sometimes so bizarre that the reality of it is often stranger than fiction, things one would say could only happen in a movie, and if they did, you wouldn't believe it.  But then again, maybe those things happen in movies because they actually do happen in real life.  And when they do, is it fate, or coincidence?  Are these "random" acts isolated, or merely pieces of some larger, synchronistic puzzle that somehow fit together in the end?  Thought provoking questions for the ages, some would say, proficiently addressed here by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson in his discursively brilliant film, "Magnolia."  Anderson puts the lives of a diverse cross-section of individuals and seemingly unrelated incidents under the microscope for an examination of these random acts and coincidences, from which he ultimately draws some conclusions about providence and happenstance.  What he finds is fraught with irony and underscored by the notion that what happens to one must and does, in fact, effect another sooner or later, for better or worse.  All of which serves to point out that no man stands alone; in the end, bills come due and must be paid.  We must all face the consequences of past decisions and actions, at which time the relevance of the irrefutable symbiotic nature of Man comes so vividly into play, wherein dissimilar individuals may reap the benefits of simply being a part of the community of Humankind.  Or then again, perhaps not.  The story Anderson weaves is fast-paced, sometimes frantic, and thoroughly engrossing, achieving levels of emotional intensity that are at times remarkable.  The quick pacing of the film belies the gradual way the story comes together to form the tangible connections derived from the intricacies of the plot.  It's a dynamic piece of filmmaking, extremely well written and delivered by Anderson and his superb cast.  There are a number of memorable performances here, among them Tom Cruise, who plays Frank T.J. Mackey, a self-styled guru of the "men's movement," whose teachings are anathema to feminists everywhere.  It's an intense performance (for which he deservedly received an Oscar nomination), quite unlike anything he's done before, and possibly his best work since "Rain Man."  Other notable performances are turned in by William H. Macy, as "Quiz Kid Donnie Smith," the once gifted youth who emerges dysfunctional in adulthood, and by John C. Reilly, as Officer Jim Kurring, a caring individual with a truly benevolent nature.  But the most superlative performance of the movie is given by Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a male nurse named Phil Parma.  His sensitive, subtle portrayal of this caretaker to dying man Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), is delivered with nuance and incredible depth, and provides some of the most poignant moments in the film.  While taking nothing away from Cruise, who was outstanding as well, Hoffman is the one who should have been nominated, moreover, should have won, the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his work here.  A performance just doesn't get any better-- or more real-- than this, and it is unacceptable that it should not be recognized as such.  Rounding out what is, in essence, an ensemble cast, are Philip Baker Hall (Jimmy Gator), Julianne Moore (Linda Partridge), Melinda Dillon (Rose Gator) and Melora Walters (Claudia Wilson Gator).  One of the best films of 1999, "Magnolia" conveys a moral without moralizing, is rich in metaphor and altogether captivating, with an ending that may take you aback, if indeed, you haven't been paying close attention (there are at least two clues during the film, admittedly obscure, but there nevertheless).  It is intense, unremittedly so, and may leave you breathless and pondering the mysteries of life; but this is filmmaking at it's best, and especially for avid movie-watchers, one that absolutely must not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>Wow!

If your writer/ director, Paul Thomas Anderson you create a brilliant three hour opus titled "Magnolia", involving a television quiz show and nine desperate, lonely, interelated characters.This is sort of the film version of the pop culture game, "The Six degrees of Kevin Bacon".But instead of Kevin Bacon, everyone has some sort of connection to a Jeopardy style game show. Some characters are intricately involved with the show, while others have a fleeting connection.The movie introduces us to a lonely police officer, a sexist motivational speaker, a dying old man, his unstable younger wife, a male nurse,a drug addict,a has-been former child celebrity, a game show host and finally a child prodigy.Besides the TV program, all these characters share that they are in desperate, lonely, pain (emotional,physical or sometimes both).All these characters feel that they have love to give, but they just don't know where or how to place it.They have all made mistakes in the past and they want a second chance.As John C. Reilly's lonely cop says, "sometimes people need a little help, sometimes they need to be forgiven, that's a tricky call". P.T. Anderson has crafted and structured an amazing film. In the first forty minuets, everything seems messy and all over the place. With lightning speed pacing and cross cutting he presents us facts about all nine people.But as time goes on, the pacing slows down and we strip away layer apon layer (or petal after petal) and learn about what motivates these people. You would think that this would be a depressing film, but it actually has quite a cathartic feel to it (especially the very stange, out of nowhere, ending). The wonderful script is brought to life by a great ensemble cast.Standouts include Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, William H.Macy and Tom Cruise. But to be honest all the actors give fantastic performances.Special note should also be made for the wonderful soundtrack made up of songs written and sung by  music artist, Aimee Mann. Supposedly these songs inspired Anderson in writing this film.The DVD of the movie is superb. It has a wonderful clear picture and sound. There is a whole second disc packed with extras including an hour and a half, detailed, video diary of the making of the film. This is a great DVD and a must for fans of good drama!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>It's hard to know where to begin with 'Magnolia', the Paul Thomas Anderson modern classic.  Basically it's a sprawling drama which takes place over one day and looks at a variety of different characters that are in some slight way linked to one another.  Yes this is one of those movies, obviously inspired by Robert Altman, that takes a look at 'life' and what changes it.  Although each story is linked there are three main stories which the cast centre around.  Firstly there's a dying man (Robards), secondly there's the participants of a game show and lastly there's a police officer and a drug addict.<p>It starts off incredibly well, explaining what exactly effects our lives, be it coincidence, chance or divine intervention.  Then the movie glides in and out of these people's lives, which seem to be falling apart as they wonder where things all went wrong and how to get back on track.  Although at parts this can be sad and depressing and the movie as a whole could easily be called pretentious in its efforts to contain the meaning of life in three hours.  Yet it's so gloriously entertaining, moving and beautifully acted that it definitely stands out as one of the best movies of recent years.  Being a series of vignettes every watcher is bound to find some stories more interesting than others but as a whole this is really a superb piece of cinema.<p>Even in their relatively small roles the actors are absolutely superb.  The three that really do impress thought are Julianne Moore as a woman on the edge, Jason Robards as a dying man and Tom Cruise playing what is undoubtedly his best role as a insprirational speaker.  To anyone who thought that Cruise was just a pretty face, 'Magnolia' shows that he is not only capable of being a great comedic actor but also one that can really emote.<p>The soundtrack is almost completely made up of Aimee Mann tracks, which Paul Thomas Anderson even claims to have based the movie on.  Listening to the tracks this certainly makes sense, with Mann's tracks at times giving things a lighter tone and at times suggesting the emotional trauma that the characters are going through.  Indeed, what is one of the film's best points is that it does have a number of small characters that are genuinely funny and help stop it all getting bogged down in its serious tone.<p>This is one movie that is absolutely gorgeous and extremely involving, although probably not to everyone's taste, especially if you are offended by bad language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Aimee Mann's gorgeous score and Tom Cruise's momentary brilliance are the only two feeble reasons to trudge through this self-indulgent rigmarole of a movie. Which is barely enough to make it worthwhile. <p>All the characters in the movie fumble through their tragic, unfulfilled existence and the theme couches a fairly depressing message -- that we always end up hurting the ones we really love. Whenever something unusual or magical happens, it is ineffective or downright silly (e.g., a rain of frogs -- don't ask!) <p>Worse, all this out-of-focus saga runs for a sprawling 3 hours. The music is so loud in most sequences that it drowns out the dialogue, what kind of a creative cinematic device was this if beyond me. The language is often of a streetside variety. <p>Oddly, one of the less important characters, Donnie (played by William Macy) says something interesting:  &quot;I really do have love to give...I just don't know where to put it.&quot; Which perfectly summarizes my sentiments for this farcical excuse for a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Paul Thomas Anderson knows a thing or two about homages.

Roger Ebert<br /><br />Eleven people caught in LA who's lives intertwine during the film. A film of such magnitude that I had to stop and try to put pieces together. I have seen this film three times and each time am struck by the brilliance of director, Paul Anderson.  How did he keep all of these characters in place and put together?<br /><br />One life runs into another and another. Great performances all.  Need, love, humanness, forgiveness, anger, hate, joy, are all brought to the fore within these characters.  Tom Cruise in one of his best performances as the crude Frank- 'The Cock Has It'. Jason Robards as the drying man so loved and hated. Julianne Moore as his young wife, hooked on drugs and trying to find her place in life. Philip Seymour has the nurse who loves his patient and tries to do all he can to fulfill their last wishes. John C Riley, as the cop trying to find love and truth .  William Macy as the child prodigy quiz kid who never grows up. Phillip Baker Hall as the TV quiz master who has cheated and lied and wants forgiveness as he is dying. Their are other connections, the young quiz kid who wants his father to be nicer to him. The father who wants his kid to bring him fame and fortune. The young woman hooked on cocaine trying to forget her life. All of these lives come together and in the final minutes of the film the skies open up and all have their lives in front of them.<br /><br />"Magnolia"makes it three-for-three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson, 29, who follows Hard Eight and Boogie Nights with his most ardent and ambitious movie yet.

PT anderson directs this movie as an epic and he paints this expansive story about a bunch of individuals with an operatic pallete. The soundtrack score is the most bold and audacious. There is a long sequence of shots which is accompanied by repeated staccato notes. The director and the composer are being bold here. Right from the prologue scene up until say 45 mins into the movie, PT anderson builds the scenario with the bold score and his balletic and long steady cam shots. The problem is that the the build up is so good that the movie is forever building up. The premise we are given is that these seemingly disconnected lives playing out in parallel are going to come together in some unexpected commonality or shall we say a kind of "got you" twist ending. But it isn't meant to be a Shymalan film although the first half plays so mysteriously that keeps you wondering "where is this movie heading" and what has all of these seperate stories got in common. PT anderson's amazing direction of the story makes us believe there is more to this and there is a higher plan in all of this that we are not seeing. But plain and simple this is still just a story about those seperate characters who often have a single of multiple connection to the other characters in terms of aquantainces and relationships. I enjoyed the film for the pure art of the film making of it and the amazing element of suspense that is bred into the story which keeps us guessing on where the story is heading. The movie ends in a sequence of scenes of biblical proportions. Although the matter in the story is little, the style and execution of the screen play is eye candy. I loved this movie. It's one of those 3 hr movies which you can actually see again right after you finished your first viewing. Extras include - behing the sceens dairy of the production, interviews with actors and PT anderson and the co-writers of the movie. This one is an all time cult classic for me.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>I saw "Magnolia" in the theatre in January, 2000. While I wasn't wetting my pants over the film as many critics were, I liked it enough to buy the DVD later that summer. Now that I've given it a recent viewing, I've concluded that "Magnolia" ranks up there with "Doctor Zhivago," "The Piano," and "Gladiator" as one of the most overrated films to hit the silver screen. There's as much to admire as there is to pick at, and while "Magnolia" has great performances and a promising premise, it's a strange step backward for the director who gave us the vastly superior "Boogie Nights." To summarize, 11 people in southern California are somehow united through circumstance, tragedy, or bloodlines. None of the characters are very likeable, and a handful of them are so stupid or immersed in their own angst, you pray they get hit by a lightening bolt to put them out of their misery. The Black characters, all background roles, offer little more than crass stereotypes: the fat and boisterous ghetto woman, the preteen pickpocketing "rapper," and the timid journalist who gets disrespected by a smug, self-help guru (Tom Cruise). Some scenes require you to suspend disbelief to digest fully. How that cop (Reilly) was able to befriend and romance that train wreck of a drug addict without so much as suspecting her condition is beyond me, and for that reason, that subplot failed. And while Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted and articulate screenwriter, he must have skipped the class in film school that taught dramatic subtlety. The score, while lush and beautiful, gets overempowering for a huge portion of the movie as it tries to underscore the film's dramatic tension. Completely unnecessary. Hitchcock will tell you that less is often more. And the film's bizarre final scene, which aimed to "tie up everything together," was unacceptable and showed that Anderson failed to come up with a way to coherently end the film. And the length? I've seen three hour movies that dragged at a worse pace, but a film like "Magnolia" could have been trimmed by at least one hour. <p>You'd think that by reading the above, I would despise "Magnolia." Quite the contrary. While there are good performances and intriguing moments, I don't think it deserves to be put on such a high pedestal. For that reason, its considerable warts earn the film a mere B- in my school of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>With the sprawling and ambitious Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson establishes himself as one of the most gifted film makers of his generation. Over three hours long, the movie will prove too much for some viewers, but I found this look at a day in the lives of some San Fernando Valley residents to be fascinating. Some of the characters' lives are interconnected to other characters, while others are connected in only coincidental ways. The movie spends a lot of time dealing with the differences between coincidence and fate. <p>Jim [John C. Reilly] is a cop who earnestly tries to do good. He is desperate to be loved, and when he meets Rose Gator [Melinda Dillon] during a domestic disturbance call, he is seemingly oblivious to her problems, which include drug addiction and a lot of mental conflicts. Rose hates her father Jimmy [Philip Baker Hall] with a passion bordering on the homicidal. Jimmy is the host of the longest running game show in TV history. He has recently been told he has two months to live and is trying to right some of the wrongs he has done to his wife and daughter. The show is called What Do Kids Know? and it pits three kids against three adults. The current child contestants are close to setting a money record, led by Stanley [Jeremy Blackman], an eleven year old who is miserable because he knows he is nothing but a freak to the audience and a meal ticket to his father. Across town, Donnie [William H. Macy], who was a champ on the show thirty years ago, is trying to make some sense of his life, which has gone downhill ever since his short experience with fame. The show's producer, Earl Partridge [Jason Robards], is also dying in his luxurious home, tended to by a wonderfully altruistic nurse, Phil [Philip Seymour Hoffman], who will do anything to grant the man's dying wish, which is to see his estranged son, Frank [Tom Cruise]. Frank long ago changed his name and has become wealthy by creating a very odd self-help program, which claims to give men control over women...  <p>Magnolia was passed over at the Oscars this year, though there are a number of award winning performances. Of particular note are those of Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. I never thought I'd be saying this, by Cruise really should have won Best Supporting Actor.<p>Much has been made of the movie's startling and unconventional ending. I thought it was perfect, though many people disagree. I will note that there are clues all though the film that tell you that the event depicted will probably occur.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I cracked up reading the comments of the folks who gave this outstanding movie 1 star. I suppose they aren't happy with a movie unless there is a car chase, and a few explosions, and a thousand bullets.<br />Forget the naysayers, forget the people who couldn't keep more than one plot line in their heads at a time. They're happier watching reruns of South Park.<br />If you want to see cinema as a work of art, this is your movie. It is not to be taken literally. It is a work of allegory. For instance, quiz shows are not live, and they don't have shows pitting children against adults, with the children besting the adults. There obviously wouldn't be a 'Seduce and Destroy' infomercial. It is all over the top to make a point. And that point is....relationships, love, and loss. What a powerful film. Yep, it's long, but well worth it. This is a must-have DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This three hour film of several intersecting stories regarding various  tortured parent-child relationships set in modern California has some good  things going for it.<p>The directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (of Boogie  Nights fame) is superb.  He knows just where to cut, just where to add  tension, just when to do a close up probing a character's deepest  feelings.<p>The acting was outstanding.  The entire cast, including Jason  Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H.  Macy and John C. Reiley were great.  Each part was meaty, giving the actor  ultimate opportunity to showcase his or her ability.  It's as if the writer  wanted to create good roles, and he certainly did.  Specifically, the roles  for aging men were outstanding.<p>The music was well used too, sometimes  introduced discordantly, creating and enhancing the several themes.<p>In  spite of its length, the movie wasn't boring as the audience kept craving  more and more of the unfolding several stories which were character driven  and intense with startling changes that kept me wide eyed and  interested,<p>However (and this is a big however), there were a few  elements that just didn't work.<p>There was a complicated introduction and  ending which was supposed to illustrate coincidence and destiny which left  me puzzled as to why it was there.<p>I never was able to figure out why the  movie was titled &quot;Magnolia&quot;.<p>And, after all the buildup and  tension and fine acting performances, about three quarters into the movie,  all the characters broke into a song which was totally out of place.  From  then, it was downhill all the way -- with a startling unexpected climax  that came out of the blue with no foreshadowing and made no sense  whatsoever.<p>This film is an intense emotional experience and will  undoubtedly have several well-deserved Academy Award nominations.  Too bad  it just doesn't hold together.<p>Recommended for film buffs for some of the  aspects that are nothing short of pure genius.  But if you're looking for a  story that makes sense, and a feeling of completeness, stay away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Like each one of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson's other films, I found Magnolia to be excessively long, desperately wordy, hopelessly plodding and wholly hypnotic. Anderson's developed an innate talent for crafting versatile, flawed, joylessly realistic characters facing the end of their rope, and in that regard this might just be his best work. While the author's deliberate pace is admittedly a major hurdle, it also allows him to explore his cast to an intimate degree that's untouched by his contemporaries. His characters seem so resistant to forward momentum, in fact, that the eventual arrival of major plot developments often caught me completely by surprise, like being stabbed in the heart by a sloth. Though Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore and William H. Macy deliver the most rewarding performances, this is really an ensemble piece that would fall flat without the presence of an equally powerful supporting cast. A terrific exercise in characterization, it's tragically narcoleptic at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Magnolia,"  from director Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights"), takes on the difficult task of focusing on ten major characters who illustrate the film's theme -- that odd things happen all the time and coincidence is inevitable no matter how carefully we plan our lives.  Characters are sent over the brink of polite social behavior by conflicts between offspring and parents, adults against children, employers with employees,  cancer, and fame vs. anonymity.<br /> Julianne Moore and Melinda Dillon play wives to men (Jason Robards, Philip Baker Hall) dying of cancer.  Cocaine addict Claudia (Melora Walters) and former wiz kid Donnie (William H. Macy) are the damaged offspring of cruel parents, while home nurse Phil Pharma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and cop Jim (John C. Reilly) ooze compassion from every pore.<br /> Most notably, Tom Cruise plays misogynist crusader Frank T.J. Mackey, whose motivational speeches are captivating in style, repulsive in content. The actor has seldom been so fiery on screen.<br /> The problem with "Magnolia" is its length -- over three hours.  This epic running time allows Anderson to explore each of his characters with some depth, but the film never comes together and, at the final credits, remains a collection of interesting scenes and people thrown into an uncertain mix.  Bonus extras include "Magnolia Diary" -- a featurette chronicling the making of "Magnolia" --  a music video, a Frank T.J. Mackey seminar, the infomercial "Seduce and Destroy," and a trailer and TV ads.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I really like this movie, but it's not one that I can watch over and over again, like I can most other movies. There are many plots, subplots, twists and turns, but the story line with Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore was the best. It reduced me to sobs more than once. Everyone should see this movie, but don't be surprised if it's not one you'll be in a hurry to see again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Magnolia" is a long, depressing, sad, and tragic movie that is done in a very beautiful and unique way.  Very rarely does a film like this come by.  The film is complex, but it doesn't try to follow a basic plot structure.  Characters talk like real people, instead of just talking about things that center around the plot or point.  I do admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it that much.  I knew that I didn't hate it, but it was something that I didn't really care for at the time.<p>I decided to re-evaluate it after seeing P.T. Anderson's masterpiece, "Punch-Drunk Love."  I fell in love with it immediately.  You know how all the critics were saying that seeing that movie really makes you want to re-evaluate Adam Sandler?  Well, I decided to do the opposite.  I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re-evaluate P.T. Anderson.  So, I decided to give "Magnolia" another chance.  And I am really glad, because this time around, I really enjoyed it.<p>The movie focuses around several different characters, who seem to have a connection somehow with one another.  It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.  It's like a bunch of different stories, but they're all happening at the same time.  We keep going back from character to character.  Each character is either being troubled, hiding a dark secret, looking for some kind of redemption, running away from the past, or dying.  This film is about coincidence and chance; secrets and confessions; blame and forgiveness; sorrow and pain; and most importantly, redemption and rebirth.<p>There are so many different stars that were in this non-commercial film.  It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction."  The cast includes such stars as Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Blackman, and many more.  They all do a fantastic job in this very difficult movie.<p>P.T. (Paul Thomas) Anderson is quite the writer/director.  He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.  There isn't just one idea going around in the movie; there's dozens of them!  Each person who watches the movie is bound to take something different from it.  The writing and directing was really amazing.<p>The DVD has a few extras to offer.  Those extras are the "Frank T.J. Mackey seminar," the Mackey infomercial, a teaser and theatrical trailer, TV spots, the "save me" music video, and a documentary of the making of "Magnolia" that is over 70 minutes long!  The picture quality was very crystal clear and the sound was very high quality.<p>Be warned, this is not a film that everyone is going to like.  If you do not have the time nor patience, then do not attempt this one.  The film is 3 HOURS LONG!  That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!  It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.  If you want a movie with a point that is very clear, a very identifiable plot, or a quickly paced story, skip it.  Don't even bother putting this in your DVD player, or VCR player.  This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.  Just be warned.<p>I am glad that I took the time to revisit this film.  I really did enjoy it more the second time around.  I wasn't prepared for a 3 hour long and depressing tragedy when I watched it the first time awhile back.  Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.  This is not a commercial-friendly film; this is not a film that is going to be loved by the majority; but to those who do end up enjoying it will be rewarded big time.  Overall, "Magnolia" is about second chances.  I am glad that I did just that, and gave it a second chance.  Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.  A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I liked Paul Thomas Anderson's &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; when I saw it a few years ago, so I gave &quot;Magnolia&quot; a shot after stumbling over it at the video store. The promise of a three plus hour runtime did not put me off in any significant way: I often enjoy reading very long books or watching lengthy films because I always figure that more time equals more character development and better background. I even violated one of my usual rules--reading a few reviews about a film or book before diving in--and watched &quot;Magnolia&quot; with precious little information about the plot. Even after learning that Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore starred in this film, two actors I usually despise, I STILL decided to give this one a chance. What really suckered me in was the roughly ten minute opening sequence, one of the most original and intriguing opening sequences I have ever seen in a movie, about a murder filled with amazing coincidences hinting at inescapable fate. I logically assumed from this information that &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take as a central theme the power of coincidence and human fate. Well, I wasn't far off because these two ideas inform a significant part of the movie. But there is something else going on here that transcends these ideas and moves Anderson's picture into the realm of the religious.<p>&quot;Magnolia&quot; concerns a day in the life of a host of characters both big and small in modern day Los Angeles. Hollywood bigwig Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lays dying of cancer in the living room of his house, attended only by a caring male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and his confused and drug addicted wife (Julianne Moore). Partridge's estranged son, a seedy infomercial misogynist named Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), knows nothing about his father's impending death and probably wouldn't care much if he did. His concern at the present is a taped interview he agreed to do with a nosy reporter, an interview that ominously threatens to lift the carefully crafted veil of secrecy Mackey placed around his personal life and childhood. Having his dirty laundry aired publicly inspires Frank to look deep into his soul and make a painful decision about whether he should reconcile with his past or not.<p>Meanwhile, a show Partridge once produced, called &quot;What Do Kids Know,&quot; is airing in another part of town. The long time host of the show, Jimmy Gator, discovers he has an incurable illness. The show must go on, though, so Jimmy walks out on stage to fire questions at the current wunderkind, Stanley Berry. Stanley suffers privately from the attentions of his overbearing father, a guy who pushes his son to succeed on the show at any cost. Related to the television show are Jimmy's wife Rose (Melinda Dillon), his drug addicted daughter Claudia, and former child star Donnie Smith. Smith once appeared on some of Partridge's shows but has since fallen on hard times. His job at an appliance/electronics store has just dropped out from under him and he can't seem to line up a date with the bartender at his favorite pub. Jimmy's daughter Claudia, who hates her father for initially unspecified behavior, meets up with a clumsy yet macho<br />cop named Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and begins to tentatively connect with him. <p>I know you can get this cast information from nearly anywhere. I just wanted to see if I could untangle the byzantine structure of this film in the space of two short paragraphs. There are many more characters parading through the scenes of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; and Anderson carefully ties them all together without ever bogging down. Obviously, the cast list isn't nearly as important as what these characters do and how the actors portray their deeds. All of the performances in this film are excellent. Tom Cruise steps out on a limb here as the insensate Mackey, a guy who tries to deal with his emotional baggage by dumping on women in his &quot;Seduce and Destroy&quot; infomercials. As good a job as Cruise does here, John C. Reilly steals the show in the role of police officer Jim Kurring. His manic behavior, his eternal patience (see the amusing scene with the lady in the apartment), and his rigid opinions about right and wrong are often hilarious and deeply sad at the same time. Everyone here should pat themselves on the back for a job well done.<p>The first part of the movie defines the various characters and explains their situations. Then comes the emotional roller coaster ride as nearly every person in the movie suffers a humiliating set back of some type. Mackey's lies about his past become known in deeply embarrassing ways. Officer Kurring loses his firearm; a huge humiliation for a cop. Jimmy Gator and Stanley Berry both undergo enormously awkward situations during the filming of the television show (in front of a live audience, no less). Physical and emotional pain comes spilling out from nearly every character about midway through the movie. Then something remarkable happens: the healing begins. The characters &quot;sin&quot; and then atone for their behavior in various ways. I saw someone refer to this movie as a Christian picture, and I think that claim is true to some extent. A frog fall that would make Charles Fort proud might make some viewers doubt the veracity of this claim, but even this odd event towards the end of the film has a scriptural basis. Can Hollywood make a Christian film in these modern times? Apparently. Match the religious themes with a great soundtrack, the performances, and the somber feel of the film and you have the makings for a marvelous three-hour experience. Give &quot;Magnolia&quot; a glance soon.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>I purchased the movie because the reviews were intriguing and the Blu-ray version was on sale at Amazon for less than $10.  The used prices on the movie were as much or more than the new price so I figure if I hated it I could sell it and get my money back. I won't be selling it, ever.<br /><br />I do not believe you can watch Magnolia once and understand what is happening. It becomes clearer on subsequent views because the movie plants very clear clues throughout but in a non-linear fashion.  The metaphysical side of the movie is extremely subtle but always present.  The spiritual transparency reminds me of an old quote "Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous."  I thoroughly enjoyed the whispy nature of the metaphysical side of the film.<br /><br />On the first viewing you'll probably connect with one or more of the story lines but may still be confused about the movie's point, especially by the ending.<br /><br />On the second viewing you begin to understand better that Earl Partridge is the patriarch of all the interconnected stories.  All the stories deal with Love in its many, many forms, and quite a few are presented in Magnolia. Besides connecting with one or more story lines you begin connecting with the expressions, reactions, and resolutions we all make about Love in our lives.<br /><br />The third viewing is just fun to try to find all the references to Exodus 8:2, like a Where's Waldo on a moving screen.  This exercise is actually more enjoyable to do with more than one person.  My wife caught references I missed and visa versa.  I seriously doubt we found them all after three viewings.<br /><br />By the second or third viewing you'll begin to understand the major message of the movie, besides Love, is "you may be through with the past but the past ain't through with you."  It is this point that will keep you thinking or talking about Magnolia long after the credits fade.  My wife and I talked for hours, connecting circumstances in our resolved and unresolved pasts with the experiences of the characters in the film.  We both said "how'd they put our lives in that movie?"  It is this point that is key; as human beings we all have similar patterns in our lives and Magnolia brilliantly displays some of the most familiar.<br /><br />If you have an analytical nature; if you enjoy thinking deeply about the messages of films, buy Magnolia.  If you just want to be entertained, Magnolia ain't the flick for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>This movie has a lot of depth. It also tries to do too much with itself. My wife couldn't stand it and thought it was a very long waste of her time. I'm not so sure.<p> Each character is interesting. Each one is written well. Each one with one exception has a mouth on him or her. We have a chronicle of dysfunctional characters doing wrong and dysfunctional things. About half way through the picture I had the oddest feeling that there was a happy ending waiting for me.<p> Since it is such a counter culture picture and the culture of the last 20 years celebrates all that is dysfunctional a counter culture picture can only be one of confidence and redemption and happy endings. We see that here.<p> I'm sure PETA had a fit at the end of this picture. I also think that it could have achieved its ends without the stunt. It had the virtue of being totally unexpected and so irrational that it shocks people to reality (Sept 11th).<p> Then again it could just be a cheep stunt for some guys who couldn't figure out how to get from a-b. Either way you'll find the performances all very good particularly by the supporting cast. (Three cheers for Henry Gibson who has more depth than anybody gives him credit) and if nothing else this movie will DEFINATELY give you something to talk about.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>Magnolia is possibly the best film of the 90'es.

I did happen to like certain aspects of it and liked certain characters more than others. I could have done without a 10 year old rapper kid jibber-jabbering about being a prophet.<br />  This movie really reminded me a lot of Crash, or maybe because Magnolia actually came first Crash really reminded me of it. The movie seems to be a primer in the chaos theory. The famous example of chaos theory being if a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world it causes typhoons on the other side of the world, or maybe big fat bullfrogs raining from the sky. A lot of movies seem to want explore this degree of separation theory. I am getting a bit over it as they say.<br />  Everyone except Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds was in Magnolia from Boogie Nights, I began to wonder if the just didn't have the script reading on the same day.<br />  Overall I think this movie was well thought out, but a bit too convoluted and maybe just too many characters with too many sub-plots.<br />I gave it 3 and half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The nineties Decade aroused the greatest interest all over the world. The American Cinema fortunately, decided to bet for risky and innovative themes: Consider this brief list of the most remarkable and original films since 1990: Schindler's list, Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Brave heart, Silence of the lambs,  Seven, American beauty, Goodfellas, Twelve monkeys, The Green Mile,  Matrix, Devil's advocate, The man who was not there, Madison bridges, Leaving Las Vegas, Crossing Miller, As good as it gets, Thelma and Louise, The Truman Show, In search of Richard III, State of grace, Short cuts and this one are undeniable a convincing evidence that a new generation is fighting hard to establish new codes.<br /><br />Magnolia was somehow, a work that clearly anticipated related films (The butterfly effect, Memento) and became a mainstream within the ambit of a new approach narrative as well a true rearrangement of the classical structure, kinetic frenzy, ellipsis and aggressive camera angles, but mainly a real concern for expressing, exploring that confirm that old statement of Orson Welles: "The cinema is a ribbon of dreams" .<br /><br />For some reason or other, you feel there is an evident close to the literary genre. The film is extremely ambitious: to face the challenge to tell twelve stories, linking them and focus about the little triumphs and failures, of the merits and miseries of the common people. The hidden side of the soul of apparently top personalities of the big show (Tom Cruise's character), the bitter critic of the TV show and the breakthrough of a genius child, as well as the not planned evolution of irrelevant facts will constitute in a real tour de force for the viewer. I mean this is film you must watch free of problems, and far to consider it a simple entertainment. It is mature movie without special effects. And far beyond the fact of being nominated for the Academy Awards, the picture will show you the importance of the crossed incidents that may cause the interruption of a successful life, or the turning point of an peaceful existence.<br /><br />Dazzling edition work and brilliant performances of Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>I couldn't imagine sitting through a three-hour film, but Magnolia's fascinating plot and eccentric characters captured me. It is the story of  various people and the errors that have haunted their lives. Tom Cruise  plays a cold-hearted sex guru whose secrets are exposed during an  interview. He is angry with his father (played by Jason Robards) for having  abandoned his family. Julianne Moore plays Robards's trophy wife, a  tormented woman who lives with the guilt of having married him for his  money. The old man's last wish is to find his wayward son and apologize for  his wrongdoing. There are other stories in the film. TV game show host  Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) is dying of cancer and wants to reconcile  with his cokehead daughter (Melora Walters). Also, a whiz kid from Gator's  game show (Jeremy Blackman) is tired of his father's high expectations.  There are other stories and other characters, all of which are somehow  connected. This is a rather touching film that should have gotten more  recognition. But why is it titled Magnolia? I still can't figure it out. I  know it's symbolic, but symbolic to what? Anyway, don't let the length of  the film discourage you. Believe me, it's worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Possibly the best character movie since "Short Cuts," this film is more off the wall and a whole lot of strange.

His scenes were breathtaking at times.  John C. Reilly also did a superior job, but these men aren't alone.  All the cast was super and you care about the characters.  At the end of the movie you really get to know them and feel almost that you might have made a friend or two.  Look out for the raining frogs.  That part was simply great.

They are all supposed to be connected by fate in some way, which is supposed to be revealed by the end.  A narration at the beginning of the film talks about strange coincidences and connections, alleging they are facts.  Let it be known that they are NOT facts, especially the most promoted one, the one about "the jumper" who was fatally shot as he fell past a window by his own mother aiming a gun at his father is pure fiction.<br /><br />There is dying, wealthy, elderly Earl Partridge (Jason Robards)and his young, beautiful wife (Julianne Moore).  Linda is clearly on the edge as she goes to hunt for liquid morphine for her husband.  Sensitive and caring nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wants to grant his client's wish to see his estranged son, perverted toadboy extraordinaire Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who has an empire in "self-help" for men to learn to "Seduce and Destroy" all the p***y they want.<br /><br />Then there is Irish cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, looking for love as he whistles along his merry beat.  His annoying chatter belies a sincere and kind heart, and he meets Claudia Gator (Melora Walters) on a noise disturbance call to her apartment.  He asks her on a date as she is snorting cocaine behind his back.  Claudia's father is famous game show host Jimmy Gator.  Jimmy is dying, but his daughter refuses to see or speak to him.  Jimmy is hosting a show called "What Do Kids Know?" and boy genius Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is going to make or break his father's fortune on the show.<br /><br />Former 1960's quiz show kid genius Donnie (William H. Macy) is having a nervous breakdown as he is fired from his job at Solomon Solomon (Alfred Molina) furniture store.  In fact, most of these characters have a nervous breakdown of some kind.  The story is riveting.  There are many more amazing and enjoyable characters, literally too many to mention here, although I would like to.<br /><br />At some point in Magnolia, you will quietly break down and cry.  It is a different point for each viewer.  It is just that kind of movie, the kind that can be a cathartic experience.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes about Magnolia.  One of the best acted and most gripping scenes at the beginning is never followed up on!  And toward the end of the film, a surreal, post-modernist event unrelated to anything in the film, unexplainable and unexplained, distracted from the brilliant scenes before. I feel this was personal on the part of P.T. Anderson, who wrote, directed, and co-produced Magnolia.  It lent NOTHING to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>magnolia is a mosaic of human life that tells of several diffrent stories in l.a. that all seem to center around a talk show called "what do kids know?". the sotrys consist of a dying cancer patient, his male nurse, and his trophy wife. a sex guru with a hidden past. a talk show host, a child protegie an dhis selfish dad. a former game show winner suffering from unreqainted love. and the last, a coked out girl playing hot and cold with a cop. all these stories, under anderson's control, are carefully woven together that leads to a shocking end were it promises to rain something other then rain. everyone gives a great performence even tom cruise, who lately has fallen on hard times due to his antics but this film made me forget all that and it proved to me that cruise, despite his antics, is a good actor. so, if you loved anderon's other film boogie nights, then you'll love this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Great movie.

Phillip Seymore Hoffman shines.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>I know I've given it one star, but only because I could not give it a negative 10.<br /><br />.... It's just the "F" word strung together over and over for three plus hours. In fact, if you took out all the times the "F" word was spoken, then you'd have a twenty minute movie....<br /><br />I ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson's Boogie Nights. Now, I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made....<br /><br />After an hour into the film, I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better. After two hours, I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave. At over 3 hours I had to stay until the painstaking end and then I literally, screamed out, "I want those three hours of my life back!"<br /><br />Just absolutely horrible!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. The movie was so stupid that I began laughing at the stupidity. Right around the scene where all the characters are singing together is where I came the very close to pushing the &quot;stop&quot; button on my remote control. After that I had given up all hope for this being a good movie. That's disappointing too because the beginning of the movie is so good. The stories they show in the very beginning are interesting. The stories they show during the movie are not only confusing but boring. And not one story has a satisfying ending. The little boy genius story was the most interesting but it went absolutely nowhere. Tom Cruise was the worst. He did a great job acting but his character was so disgusting that I felt embarrassed just to be watching it. Each story can be connected but to do so is stretching it...A LOT! I love how it rains frogs and nobody seems to think anything of it. At that point you can tell that the director has given up on this and he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.<p>I would also like to give 1 star to the song at the beginning of the movie, &quot;One Is The Loneliest Number.&quot; I thought that song would never end. I was hoping for a power outage at my house just to shut that girl up!</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>wow!!! it was gripping, heartfelt, and very much sad..<br />this is one of the best films i have seen it is a near master piece.<br />with such a great cast.. im no big fan of tom cruise but he did a great job in this film.. it would take me too long to tell u ABOUT the story, so lets just say everything is connected in one way or another..<br />a great film from the director of  boggie nights, and punch drunk love..<br /><br />Rater R for, Strong Language, Drug Use, Some Violence, Adult Content, Some Nudity, and Some Sexual Content</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>The movie opened with 3 curious incidents of coincidence in the past. The first hour then unfolded the backgrounds of 2 dying men, his daughter, a policeman, his son, a nurse, their wives and 2 prodigy at TV quiz show.<br /><br />The second hour saw the important decisions these people made. At one point, the camera shifted to and fro among 6 (or more) stories against a pulsating music background. The pace and grip closed in, leading the audience to yearn for more. The heavyweight character actors executed their parts beautifully and the shots were well-sequenced, successfully building up an atmosphere of urgency, I found Julianne Moore at the pharmacy store a mesmerizing performance. She was so beautiful yet cold, quiet yet restless, until her sudden outburst of spitting venom bespoke her guilt-ridden state.<br /><br />The last hour wrapped up only after a bizarre natural disaster, forcing the characters to a closure and a reflection of their chaotic lives. Without the improbable disaster, it would not be convincing that these people, all suffer from a relationship crisis, would alter their paths, heading for a better future.<br /><br />There is just a fine line between stories of clich&eacute;s-pretensions and sincerity. Even more difficult to cook all these stories in the same pot and still make sense. Nowadays books and movies (Clash, Babel, Friends with money) choose to dart from one short story to another on relationships which are supposed to be subtly related. Not all come off with a success though. At least this movie can be given the benefit of the doubt of being original and it displayed sincerity as well as good directing. Yes, the movie can be slow at some point but it had its gripping moments. It had thus gained enough momentum to drive the story to a more than satisfying ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This is one unique film and a fine piece of work, but it is not for the easily bored. You don't even realize what an awesome film it is until you've all but finished watching it.<p>So many seemingly unconnected things  and people turn out to be connected in the strangest ways. The film is  reminiscent of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and Robert Altman's  &quot;Shortcuts,&quot; but it's even more subtle in how each character is  unknowingly connected to one another.  Makes you mentally take a  double-take with the whole &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;  thing.<p>One incredible performance after another. Nearly every unpleasant  human experience happens in this film... racism, suicide, murder, incest,  drug abuse, murder, jealousy, death bed confessions and more... yet the  experiences bring the best out of these characters.  Some characters you  end up hating and others you end up liking in spite of yourself.<p>There is  nudity, one graphic (albeit extremely brief... about 1 second) sex scene  and about the worst language you have ever heard in film, so this is not  suitable for kids.  If you're into good film, deep thoughts and appreciate  the art of fine storytelling, this is a film you should see. Having it on  DVD is another plus as you can jump chapter to chapter after you have  watched the movie through the first time. After you see the whole film and  it finally all makes sense, you'll want to watch it again to catch all the  subtle clues and references (I can't tell you what references w/o spoiling  the film) through out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  P.T. Anderson<br /><br />Cast:  Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Phillip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards Jr., Melora Walters.<br /><br />Running Time:  188 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for strong language, drug use, simulated sex, and brief violence.<br /><br />An incredible spectacle of a film, opening with the notion that there are no coincidences and that events transpire not by chance, but for a purpose and closes after over three hours with a brilliant underlying message paved by symbolism.  Unfortunately for P.T. Anderson's epic one-day dissertation into the lives of a dozen individuals living in the Fernando Valley, "Magnolia" is just too long and not quite enthralling or beguiling enough to sustain absolute interest.  Tom Cruise (who won the 1999 Golden Globe Award for his supporting performance and got snubbed of an Oscar) steals the show as male-chauvinist eccentric celebrity Frank T.J. Mackey, who promotes his theories about how to acquire sex from beautiful women.<br /><br />Rich TV tycoon Earl Partridge (Jason Robards Jr.) lies on his deathbed with his estranged, drugged up wife (in a brilliant role by Julianne Moore) and sincere male nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) by his side.  Desperately wanting to get in touch with his long lost son (who just so happens to be Mackey), Partridge awaits his demise with despair and lament.  Phillip Baker Hall stars as the popular What Do Kids Know? game-show host Jimmy Gator, who is desperately in search of reconciliation with his druggie daughter Claudia Gator (played beautifully by Melora Walters) due to his sudden diagnosis of cancer.  John C. Reilly is exceptional as the soft, yet stern police officer who wants nothing more than to find someone to grow old with and stumbles upon the misguided Claudia along his daily cop route.  As Gator attempts to continue the game-show despite his condition, the audience learns of two outrageously intelligent child products:  Stanley (Blackman) and Donnie Smith (William H. Macy in a consistently solid performance).  Stanley is the heir-apparent to whiz kid Donnie Smith, who is now a superstar afterthought, left behind by his parents and his boss.<br /><br />Director P.T. Anderson manages to juggle all of these characters very well throughout the film, intertwining the plot points with ease and sincerity.  Along with spectacular performances from Cruise, Moore, and Reilly, "Magnolia" possesses two incredibly memorable moments:  1) the unison sing-along to Aimee Mann's "Wise Up" is superbly hilarious and melancholy all-in-one, sending reverberates of spine-tingles of hope and gloom in harmony and 2) the most unforgettable scene of precipitation in cinema history (it makes The Birds look like child's play).  A genuine effort to show the desolation that engulfs when expectations are not met and mistakes are made, "Magnolia cultivates into a film that glorifies the courage, calamity, and love that transpires throughout life.  While certainly not perfect, this film is unique and complex enough to hold its own, but ultimately does not possess enough unified direction and cohesion to keep the restless viewer involved.  A great idea, a grand ensemble cast, and an amazing musical contribution from Aimee Mann; however, only adequate execution.  A very good film, just no "American Beauty".</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Magnolia quickly jumped onto my list of all time favorite films.  PT Anderson pulled of an amazing bit of magic with this dark, intense, maddening but oh-so-human collection of souls.  It's length didn't bother me, it's risky plot turns didn't bother me, it profoundly sad scenes did not bother me.  Instead, I felt so full of hope after I saw this film; so convinced in the randomness of life and what you do or don't with it - I was simply blown away.  The performances - all of them - are amazing: Hoffman, J. Moore, Walters, John C., and William H. Macy who is simply astounding.  Really - today there are not many actors better than the troup in this film and each has a chance to strut his/her stuff. I know some people find it tough going or are intimidated by the long running time, but patience here provides an amazing reward.  Just beautiful.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>&quot;Magnolia&quot; is one of the best films ever made, period. I haven't enjoyed a movie so thoroughly the first time through, thought about it for months afterward, watched it again, and was even more astounded by it, ever. Given that it's three-hour running time may turn off the audience members with cases of ADD, but for those of us who stick around, it's a filmmaking experience like no other, driven by the kinetic energy of a director whose sheer joy for the art gives every moment on the screen poignant meaning and visual grace. &quot;Magnolia&quot; was written, produced, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who uses the music of the under-appreciated Aimee Mann as a temp-track that underlines the entire movie, beginning with the opening to her song &quot;Deathly,&quot; and working backwards. Mann's music is always at the soul of the movie, starting with her jazzed up remake of &quot;One,&quot; getting under our skin during a brilliant montage of all the main characters singing &quot;Wise Up,&quot; and finally knocking us flat on our collective rears with her inspired &quot;Save Me.&quot; (She was robbed by Phil Collins at the Oscars) Yet, amongst all of the music from one of the world's most gifted musical artists, there are some of the finest screen performances of 1999. These performances, along with some fabulously bizarre cinematography from Robert Elswit, are what truly push the movie from its oddly engaging opening monologue to its final heartwarming smile. To describe all of the characters in &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take forever, and considering all of that has been kindly outlined by the folks here at Amazon, I won't repeat it. I'll just say that &quot;Magnolia&quot; contains some of the most originally written characters in the history of cinema. Tom Cruise is electrifying as Frank TJ Mackey, Julianne Moore is terrific as usual, Melora Walters (written with a hint of Aimee Mann insanity) is as jumpy as a grasshopper hopped up on meta-amphetamines, but she pulls it all off nicely, and Philip Seymour Hoffman always wins us over with his heartfelt performance as the nurse to the sickly Earl Partridge, played with devastating authenticity by the late great Jason Robards. And those are just my personal favorite characters. ... I'll say it again, this is one of the very best films I've ever seen, and working in a video store, I've seen a lot of movies. It's endlessly inventive, engaging, wonderful, heartwarming and breaking at the same time, with an endless supply of life being fed into it by one of the best directors since Scorsese. ...</p></br></body></html>

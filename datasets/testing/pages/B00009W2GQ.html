Along with "Star Wars" and the "Jurassic Park" films, it will go down in film-making history for its originality and unique, special effects. Part III pulls together the mystery, intrigue, romance, and tensions developed in the first two films. The mysticism and religious allusions are effectively balanced with the "war" that is inevitable ...<p>It begins with both Neo and the other guy lying on two stretchers - out cold, trapped in the cyberspace of "the Matrix". Trinity, Morpheus and the others are trying to revive them, to return them intact to Zion. The next scene is Neo at a train station ... talking to an Indian couple and a little girl of about 4 years old. They are waiting for the 'trainmaster' who will help them return to the 'real world', for them it is the one created by machines. Neo learns, the little girl, is Seti, their daughter, whom they love ... but she is a program, who can be deleted. Neo discovers how "love" transcends *even* the programming of machines. Neo finds out the trainman works for the Frenchman, the Frenchman controls their fate ... the trains is due, but it is late ... How does Neo escape this trap, of being caught in a purgatorial existence, not really belonging to either the world of Zion or the one created by the machines? The scenes are phenomenal. Naturally, he makes it out, with the help of his friends ...<p>Zion plans for the inevitable invasion by the machines. The humans prepare a few surprises of their own ... indescribable combat scenes, indescribable special effects. I sat with clenched teeth and tense muscles, as swarms of insect-like and squid-like machines zoomed and descended into Zion. The fighting scenes are some of the best I have ever viewed ... When the Oracle is consulted we learn the simple but hard truth, that she does not predict anything, she provides information and those who summon her help "make a choice" based on their "belief" in themselves. Neo and Trinity leave in a ship -- with a stow-away on board ... Neo "believes" in his abilities after a tragic occurrence. Neo does what must be done ... you have to see the film to know what that is and how the film ends. This film is *highly* recommended. Of the three films, this is my favorite. One must view all three to fully appreciate and understand why the Matrix series is so popular and appealing.

After watching this it's easy to see that the seams dividing the three films are primarily there to provide logical breaks between the movies, not because they are needed.  This is really one very long film and several of the themes only come to fruition here.  It is time for the rebels to hunker down for the last defense of Zion and for Neo to quest for a solution that doesn't involve ending life entirely.<br /><br />Simple things first.  This film is a masterpiece of CGI, choreography, and stagecraft.  Not simply because there are a lot of detailed evil critters running around waving tentacles, but because the animators have taken great care to make sure that the critters work together flawlessly.  Battle scenes such as the defense of Zion are remarkable because of their vastness and the cruel beauty of the conflict.  And the fight work, especially the final grand conflict between Neo and Smith is equally compelling.  In the previous episode, I found the fighting a bit repetitious, but here everything is so under control that it appears effortless and natural.<br /><br />Another thing the Wachowski's do very well here is shift between realities so well that by the end one isn't quite sure which events are happening in what layer of perception.  Our only hints are when Neo starts talking to Trinity about The Light.  This affirms there is something beneath the surface, even if we aren't sure what it is.  It isn't really the machines on the other side of this struggle, it's Agent Smith who has become Neo's alter ego as bringer of the dark.  All of this forces the viewer to accept everything as real, which is exactly the right state for viewing.<br /><br />One of the layers of symbolism I found lurking in this film, unlike the pseudo-symbolism built up by the choices of names, is the steady, low-key series of Arthurian references.  Much like the story of the Once and Future King this the story of hope broken and then rebuilt on the bones of failure and tragedy.  It isn't until the ending sequences that Wachowski's take their gloves of and hit you over the head with Arthur/Neo, but it works quite well in context.<br /><br />Obviously I liked this film much better than Matrix Reloaded.  I'm not going to pretend that the film is a literary masterpiece, but it does a great job of demonstrating that action/adventure can be a lot more than brain numbing hack, kick, and slash.  Two hours of total escapism.  Yippee!</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Matrix started off a trilogy that could have and should have been awesome. The original was a classic and shall always be remembered. It's a one of a kind movie. On the other hand, the sequel lost me at certain plot points and had some unnecessary and boring parts but the compelling and absolutely awesome fighting scenes and "the chase" make it a very solid and good movie. And then, we go to the Matrix Revolutions. I was really excited to see the last installment of this trilogy but I was very dissapointed at the end.<br /><br />First off, I don't understand why certain characters are introduced and then that's it. They just dissapear. The frenchman reappeared in this one, but nothing really happened with him. The trainmaster was introduced and fought Neo and then he just dissapeared. The movie does have one awesome scene where the sentinels fight humans and giant robots that they pilot with big guns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. But, this scene did seem to last forever, a little too long than it should have. But, it still was very neat and awesome. And then, there's the ending which was a letdown to me. I won't go into details but this movie was even more of a letdown because the awesome precedessors were ended by a strange, and dissapointed conclusion. If you're a big fan, or just want to watch the REALLY LONG BATTLE SCENE, it's worth a buy, or else, buy the original which is a good movie while the sequels only have really cool and neat moments but are boring and confusing. The Matrix Reloaded is better than this one though because it has way more cool and awesome scenes. Well, there it is, my views on the final installment of a trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film picks up from where The Matrix Reloaded left off and continues to shed light on Neo and his quest to save humanity.  The "mother of all battles" awaits and this time it all comes to an end...<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the SPECIAL EFFECTS, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  The Matrix Revolutions is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />In conclusion, the Matrix Trilogy, as a whole, is one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>True inspiration can be spoiled by forcing ideas too hard and too fast.  Inspiration can also be destroyed when it&#65533;s forced at the wrong time. Sometimes ideas need to be sat on, culled over, and perfected before they are foisted on the general public. True art takes time.  <p>In the case of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, it has one really huge mark against it.  That is that it was shot back to back with RELOADED.  So while the brothers Wachowski were able to up the ante that they set with the original MATRIX RELOADED, REVOLUTIONS has nowhere left to go.  While this film is creative and visually stunning, it feels like a lot of the same thing.  George Lucas did one thing correctly with his STAR WARS films being spaced three years apart. He was able to create new and stunning visual effects with technology that he only dreamed of with the previous films.<p>In REVOULTIONS Neo (Keanu Reeves, The Replacements) and his &#65533;Superfriends&#65533; are back where we left them.  Fighting the endless war with the robots.  You see where we last left the human race the robots were drilling into the last human city, and the dark suited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Babe) was running amok inside and in this installment outside of the Matrix.  As the war to save the human race commences, it&#65533;s up to Neo to prove he&#65533;s &#65533;THE ONE&#65533;.<p>REVOLUTIONS can be summed in one word: UNDERWHELMING.  There is nothing new, nothing exceptionally cool, or anything of consequence going on.  In fact except for the tail end of one really neat action sequence, (that&#65533;s too difficult to explain without ruining some vital plot points) the film has no suprises.  <p>In fact the first hour of the film renders the last hour of RELOADED utterly pointless, it merely ties up some loose ends and you begin to wonder why they were introduced in the first place.<p>It also squanders Lambert Wilson&#65533;s funny and sadistic Merovigian, and Monica Bellucci&#65533;s Persphone.  They are in the film for mere moments.  I can only surmise that its because the Wachowski&#65533;s thought it would be cool to visit them again.  This entire scene proves is how unnecessary they were in RELOADED and I liked them in that one. (As a side note this scene also includes a moment that earns this film it&#65533;s R-rating.  Yes this is a PG-13 film with a moment in which a male extra grabs and tweaks a female extra&#65533;s breast.  Why?  I&#65533;m not quite sure I wanna to know.)<p> As with the other two films REVOLUTIONS has a backbone of stunning special effects.  While they look really good, they lack the creative spark that made the first MATRIX groundbreaking and it&#65533;s sequel a joy to watch.  REVOLUTIONS spends it time tying up the story and forgetting the tradition of not only stunning but also magical special effects.  The race to Zion sequence is the only segment that half works, and even the final showdown just kind of ends.  It should be awesome and it elicits only half the awe of the amazing final battle in the first Matrix or the breathtaking final shots of the Highway chase in RELOADED.<p>I just wonder how much better this film could be had it been made on its own two or three years down the road.  What amazing visuals could have been created? What interesting philosophies could have been dreamed up?  What new and unusual characters could have been conjured?  We&#65533;ll probably never know, and I guess I can deal with that, but I do want to.<p>To be fair THE MATRIX REVOULTIONS is still leaps and bounds above typical action movies.  It&#65533;s full of enough eye candy to keep and action junky busy for a while.  I still intend to see this film on the IMAX screen, an experience that greatly improved the last film as well.  As it stands I probably wouldn&#65533;t recommend this film to a casual moviegoer, or a sci-fi enthusiast.  But for fanboys and action buffs you just might like it. <p>*** Out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>The final entry in the Matrix trilogy will disappoint some - probably many of those who weren't hardcore Matrix fans.  Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching "Revolutions"), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the "Machine Army".  <p>(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as "The Matrix"; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; "Reloaded" added an interesting spin - rather than just an Us (humans) against them (Machines outside the Matrix and AI programs on the inside) AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret.  We met the Merovingian - an almost god-like program who reconstructed himself as a Francophiliac philosopher of free choice; the "Keymaker" an obsolete program who doesn't let his impending destruction keep him from making keys for doors meant to remain locked, and pointing the way for those lost; we also found out that the enigmatic "Oracle" was herself a high-level program; and we finally met the architect himself.  Rather then merely single-mindedly enslave and exploit us, these bits of heavyweight AI waxed with surprising intelligence on free choice.<p>At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) learned from the Architect that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines to fulfill his role in their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog in the Matrix whom we thought destroyed by Neo in "The Matrix", we learnt in "Reloaded" that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of "Reloaded", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In "Revolutions", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.<p>"Revolutions" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of "Reloaded" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?  So Trinity and Neo have their romantic moment while Morpheus &amp; Niobe are nearly drowned by clouds of CGI-rendered Sentinels).  That aside, "Revolutions" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last "Star Wars" movies (it's sort of a mix between "Starship Troopers" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, "Revolutions" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the "real" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch "Star Trek".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>The third and final installment of "The Matrix" trilogy finds Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in possession of a human body, and Zion counting the hours to total annihilation at the hands of the machines. After some action-packed efforts on the part of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Seraph (Collin Chou) bring Neo back to consciousness, all attention is turned to saving Zion from impending doom. Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith), Morpheus, and the remaining captain and crew set off in one ship in hopes of reaching Zion in time to help fight the onslaught of the machines. Neo and Trinity set off in another ship for the machine city, where Neo believes he will find humanity's salvation and the purpose of his existence. <p>If you are expecting "Revolutions" to make sense of the many bizarre plot elements that were introduced in "Reloaded", you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a sound resolution to the problematic relationship between humans and machines that we first learned of in "The Matrix", you won't get that either. Oddly, the fate of greater humanity, the humans living in the Matrix, has been abandoned entirely. <p>"Revolutions" is heavier on action than "Reloaded". -Literally heavy. This is a movie about heavy artillery. And it works better than "Reloaded" on that level. "Revolutions" suffers from the same mediocrity in cinematography, costumes, and music as "Reloaded" did. And I think the makeup is actually bad. We notice these things because the first movie excelled in these areas, as well as in many others. The film is sometimes bogged down by annoyingly verbose computer programs. (Why is it that whenever artificial life forms are featured in science fiction they have diarrhea of the mouth?) And the Wachowski Brothers  have now officially joined George Lucas and James Cameron as big budget action directors who can't write dialogue but insist on doing it anyway. The dialogue is insufferable. But I don't detect as much sloppy editing or plain poor judgment in "Revolutions" as there was in "Reloaded". And where "Reloaded" suffered from having no real villain, "Revolutions" has happily restored Agent Smith to nemesis status. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, "Revolutions" elicits laughs in all the wrong places. Once again, the fight sequences fall flat. But they are better integrated into the plot than they were in "Reloaded". (To see in a nutshell the vast difference in quality between this movie and the original, compare the gun battle at the entrance to the Frenchman's club to the lobby scene in "The Matrix". The latter was energetic and beautiful. "Revolutions" version is dismal, grotesque, and over-produced.) But  overall "Revolutions" is a slightly better film than "Reloaded" was. It is better constructed and, although all semblance of thoughtfulness has been abandoned, it works better as a straight action film than "Reloaded". The extended battle for Zion has some exciting moments, and I wasn't actually bored at any point during the film.<p>After seeing "Reloaded", I got the impression that "The Matrix" trilogy had been conceived in two parts, but the second part had been stretched into two movies with the addition of a lot of filler material. Having seen "Revolutions", I  still have this impression. But go see how the story ends. "The Matrix: Revolutions" is an entertaining shoot 'em up, but just isn't much beyond that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>With the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, the Wachowski Brothers have found Spirituality: Redemption, Catharsis, Family bonding and most of all Love.<br />This is the most personal film of the trilogy and for that it will probably get slammed by those who feel that The Matrix should only be about balletic fights, blowing up machines or buildings or killing people.  But there has always been a strong undercurrent of Spirituality in all of the Matrix films: it's just that here, it is in the forefront. The battle scenes act as a respite from the scenes of Love and bonding between the cast members: Sati and the Oracle, Sati and her father and mother, Neo and Trinity, Morpheus and Niobe to name a few.<br />One of the nice things about all of the Matrix films is that the Wachowski's have made sure to populate their movies with all races. Their future world embraces all people and in particular Women as Warriors. Niobe, Trinity and Zee all have an agenda and do not hesitate to physically act upon it and in this Matrix this means they save their men from death and Zion from destruction.<br />"Matrix Revolutions" is a beautiful film, filled with glorious images, do not hate it because it wears its heart on its sleeve: Love is All We Need, after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>I don't understand why some goofs are rushing to pan this film. Is it now cool to hate these movies? That must be the reason. It's not because this film is bad because it was great.<p>I loved this film: it's philosophy, the cinematography and the great action scenes. I went to see this movie with two other people, when it was over they both agreed that the movie was great and the critics are crazy!<p>The fight scene at the end was phenomenal, well worth the price of the ticket and the battle for Zion scene was exceptionally good. This film kicked major a$$!!<p>So why all the bad reviews? Who knows.. The Wachowski brothers have managed to turn The Matrix from a pure action film series into a credible work of science fiction, and I guess that made things too complicated for some people. <p>Anyway, follow the philosophy of the movie: think for yourself. if you want to go see the movie, then go see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"The Matrix Revolutions" seems to me to be a little better than "The Matrix Reloaded". Maybe this is because I resigned myself to believing that the third [and hopefully final installment] would be, like "Reloaded", all whiz-bang special effects and little substance. This turned out to be a correct assumption. But not expecting much in the story department allowed me to appreciate the visuals, which are awesome. Ironically, what rules the making of both "Matrix" sequels seems to be modern machinery; in this case, digital computers. Did the filmmakers see the irony? Modern machines dictate that special effects render plot and good scripting obsolete in movies about mankind's defeat by machines? <p>This episode continues the attack of the computers/machines on the human population, which has taken refuge underground. As the machines bore through the earth relentlessly in their attack on what's left of mankind. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the others continue to do their best to salvage the human race. Neo, after finally meeting the ultimate machine and proposing a truce, takes on the nefarious Agent Smith in a battle that goes on and on and on. <p>I think the `problem' with the sequels is rather simple. Commerce dictated that, since the original "Matrix" was so successful, sequels should be made. In any art form, often the original product is whole within itself. How could anyone paint a sequel to The Mona Lisa? The classic movie "Casablanca" ended with a question mark, but could a "Part 2" truly have gone any further? My conclusion is that, if commerce dictates sequels, so be it, but it is foolish of us to expect them to equal, much less to exceed, the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>The acting/emotion/originality of the matrix is dead. This whole movie relies on special effects and questions rather than entertainment. Honestly, ask anyone at your school and they will tell you that this movie was retarded. <p>The problem is that the Matrix Revolutions decided on the movie path of, &quot;Confusing = Brilliance&quot;. This system which I will abbreviate as C=B is a common system that fails. Evangelion had to have a whole movie called &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; to please viewers who were conned into the C=B system. Matrix relies on confusing the viewer with a barrage of questions and such. Also, Reloaded had the architect. Did anyone take anything out of that? Was that the most unrelenting mumbo-jumbo crap you have ever heard? Be prepared for more as Revolutions serves up some of the most confusing crap that fails to be brilliant.<p>Let me go over this again. The effects are good. The action is somewhat okay at times because of this. The acting is crap though and the dialogue is cheesy. On top of that we have use of the C=B system. Avoid this movie as it will just insult you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>By the time this superannuated, bloated overproduction finally groans to the finish line, one is left wondering what everyone was so excited about it the first place.  When you can't find a plot, resort to the next best thing --- lots of explosions, special effects, and violence.  I remember when devotees to this &quot;epic&quot; anticipated &quot;Reloaded&quot; like it was the 2nd Coming.  Once &quot;Revolutions&quot; finally was released, the prevailing attitude was, &quot;well we wasted our time with the first two --- we might as well see the damned thing to the end.&quot;  It almost seemed as though the viewers were reluctantly performing a chore, like cleaning out the refrigerator of all of the old scary experiments nestled on the back shelf.<p>Now the marketers try and tell us this is the &quot;greatest cinematic trilogy of all time.&quot;  Uh-huh.  Sorry folks, that honor would go to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; even with the relatively weak 3rd installment of that series.  I can only hope that the Geekowski brothers keep their word and do not release a 4th Matrix movie, because this was more than enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>This review contains spoilers... However, if they prevent you from watching the film, consider that a good thing. You'd be better off if I just told you how it ended and saved you two hours of your life.<p>A horrible sense of disillusion dawned on me as I watched this third installment in the oversized Matrix trilogy. Suddenly I realized how trite and unoriginal the pseudo-philosophical concepts that guided the story were. These are the same concepts that the first two movies in the series followed, but this time it's much more obvious than ever before. The first film in the series, while not as original in conception as it seemed to me back then, had sparks of uniqueness and originality like few other movies - perhaps not in its concept but certainly in its writing, styling, and cinematography. The second one, while it didn't have that same spark, still managed to be satisfactory by incorporating several action scenes of immense originality and uniqueness in their styling and visualization. This third film doesn't even have that. I won't go against sequels and trilogies in general, because classics like Star Wars and The Godfather, not to mention more modern examples like Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill, could have never reached their full depth in only one film, but a filmmaker shouldn't have to do three films when he said all he had to say in the first one.<p>First, we have an impressive but rather pointless fight sequence in the Merovingian's bar. It might have been fitting for an opener if the rest of the film was more impressive. The mythological and theological hints in that scene are so obvious and overwhelming (the club is hell, the Merovingian is Hades, the Trainman is the Ferryman), yet they lead nowhere. Much more coherent were the creepy sadism-masochism not-so-subtle hints; but whether that was meant to have some meaning, or just to satisfy Larry Wachowski's odd passions, I don't know. The character of Seraph - `The Wingless Angel' - seems to be building towards something, but reaches no conclusion. This is one of many openings the trilogy leaves that make me fear a spin-off, an animated series or perhaps awful second-rate books written by fanboys like the ones Star Trek got. The scene in the train station is probably the best part of the movie, and I liked the low-key, minimal production feel of it. It got dwarfed, however, next to the laughs I got from the scene in which Trinity and Morpheus meet the Oracle - Mary Alice. The Wachowskis were at a loss as to how deal with the death of actress Gloria Foster, and did less than well in the ridiculous solution they came up with. I think I would have liked it better if the Oracle became a thin, young, blonde woman; that would at least show some guts.<p>The battle for Zion was of course impressive, but to me it seemed like little more than a big screen computer game. The whole thing was badly unconvincing, especially those MACH style Starship Troopers rip-off robots the rebels use. And since the directors created in me absolutely zero emotional connection to either Zion or any of the people in it (were we supposed to become emotionally attached to Zion after that horrible orgy/rave scene in the second movie? If so, badly done) I simply didn't care about the outcome. An important part of good sci-fi writing is, since the viewer obviously has no empathy for the characters or places beforehand, to make him care about them. Matrix Revolutions didn't do that. Zee, Link, Lock and all of these half-baked characters introduced to us in the second film are uninteresting and unimportant. That entire battle was too long and very dull.<p>As for the other big showdown - the battle between Neo and Smith... Neo already battled with Smith in the first and second movie, and both of these scenes were original and impressive. The duel in the first movie was wonderfully directed and choreographed, while the battle between Neo and the multiple Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded was original and exciting. This final battle is none of the above; it's dull, predictable and unimpressive, using every clich&eacute; imaginable. It consists mainly of Smith knocking Neo down and Neo getting up again, over and over. And let's not even discuss Trinity's horrible, oversized, melodramatic and pathetic death scene which would have made Wagner blush.<p>Another thing I realized watching this movie is that the only character in the entire trilogy that I really cared for, that really had a personality and characterization, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is, I now realize, a fantastic actor, and he created a truly timeless and unique character. I also loved his real-world incarnation as Bane; I could see it was Smith long before he gave himself away with that `Mr. Anderson' remark. Could you possibly have recognized Neo or Trinity had they stumbled into another body? Smith is the only major creation which made the expansion of the series somewhat worthwhile. Morpheus was an interesting character in the first movie, but I could never forgive him after that horrible, hilarious speech he gave in Zion in the beginning of part 2. As for Neo, he was never very interesting since he became the One - I liked him better when he was a confused, clueless hacker. Despite any enjoyment I got from the second movie, the series would probably have been better off ending there.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>"Everything that has a beginning ... Has an end. I see the end coming ... I see the darkness spreading ... I see death ... And you are all that stands in his way."<p>And all that is standing in your way of the most highly anticipated film in years is the massive swarm of people ahead of you. Who would have thought a relatively small film called The Matrix in 1999 would eventually spawn one of the greatest film series in movie history? When the original film grossed $171 million at the domestic box office and became a huge cult favorite on DVD, Warner Brothers quickly jumped at the opportunity to role the (supposedly) final two sequels. It took the Wachowski brothers nearly four years and $300 million but the journey is almost over. There are many questions to ask before seeing Revolutions that one must ask himself: How will it end? Will I understand it? Will everything be answered? Can this truly be the final Matrix film? But the most important question to ask may be the most irrelevant: Do we really want it to end? Surely the Warner Brothers executives know their answer.<br />The story centers once again on the journey of The One (Neo) as he tries to end the war between man and machine after years of conflict. Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left off earlier this year but here is a recap: <p>Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus lead the human resistance against the machine world for control of the world. For years, the machines have kept human kind plugged into The Matrix, a simulated dream world, and threatened to destroy the last human city known as Zion. Morpheus believes that their journey is almost at an end but there are some that stand in the way of providence. Namely Agent Smith, who was once destroyed by Neo but now has come back to destroy him and everything else. In the final scene of the film, both Neo and Smith (in human form) have been knocked unconscious just as the machines prepare to invade Zion.<p>Got it? If you don't then too bad because here we go. Without giving too much away, let's just say everything seems to come full circle. As the humans within Zion prepare to duke it out for control of the world against the machines, Neo goes to the machine city to work out a compromise and stop Smith before it is too late for both man and machine. Did you get confused during Reloaded and hate it for that? Then you're not going to like Revolutions. There is a lot to divulge within the course of the two hour feature and Revolutions will require multiple viewings to unlock all the secrets of The Matrix franchise. Outside of the confusing interlocking concepts, does Revolutions deliver a good plot? Though the beginning starts off a little too slow, the rest of the film smoothes out any rough edges and ends the series with a bang.<p>Most of the cast (outside of a relative few additional members) is the same as it was with The Matrix Reloaded. But in Revolutions, some perform better then others. Keanu Reeves delivers the goods with his role as The One (Neo). Reeves may seem relatively stiff in the film but that is the point. As Smith becomes more and more human, so Neo becomes more and more machine like and acts that way. Reeves does a fabulous job in dragging that point out though many will probably not pick up on that fact. Carrie-Ann Moss takes on the role of Trinity for the final time but isn't as featured as she was in Reloaded, which is both good and bad. The good? The focus of Revolutions is suppose to be on Neo and that is the point. The bad? She has some scenes but not the way many will want her to go out on. The biggest highlight of Revolutions is not the special effects (though they come in a close second) but rather is the performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is so over the top with this role that it is just absolutely amazing to watch especially in the final battle sequence between Smith and Neo in the rain. So what is bad? Monica Belluci's Persephone has no point in this film, let alone the entire Matrix series. What does her character do that is of any real importance? Nothing other then bring them the Keymaker in Reloaded but still, what is her purpose? And the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of Morpheus. He is barely shown in the film and deserved more screen time then he got.<p>Overall, Revolutions may not end the franchise in the way everybody would want but the final confrontation between Smith and Neo at the end is worth the price of admission alone. Does the final film answer all the questions? Thankfully, No. Would anybody really be satisfied if all the answers were given to them on a silver platter with no thought put into divulging the film series' secrets for themselves? No. Will multiple viewing be required to fully understand it? Yes but if you don't feel like paying the price of admission then you will only have to wait till at least May for the DVD. Many will leave the theater disappointed and, in certain aspects, they should. Granted, you had to expect that the film would not end with a picture perfect happy ending like you would want but the ending that is given just doesn't serve the film justice. Some fans will feel cheated, some will feel empty, while others will be too blown away from the battle sequences to fully comprehend or care about the real ending. The final scene of the film is one of those either you love or hate kind of things with no area in between. Bottom line is that Revolutions performs better then Reloaded but doesn't end the franchise the way it should have. How will you feel? That is up to you but like the Oracle says in the film, "We can't see past the choices we don't understand". So grasp the concept of the film before making your final evaluation.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>"The Matrix" films were a lot of fun, and this triology will be remembered for a long time. Our kids will be watching these three movies! Each film has something differant about it that will make it cherished forever. The first movie in the series, "The Matrix", had a fantastic plot and origional comcepts with compelling drama and action! The second film, "The Matrix Reloaded", was in my opinion more fun than the first, even though you could not fully understand the plot with out seeing the third film, but the action was fantastic and plentiful. Now for the third film, "The Matrix Revolutions". Some people complain that this was a bad movie and I really hate it when thy do, because it is not! They did not like the battle, well hello what did you expect a negoations between humans and machines! There had to be a battle because they said it ever since the first movie! You can also tell by the title! Revolutions! The second and third films in this series were very missunderstood and I have no idea why, they fit like puzzle peices with the first! This is a great series and I recomend it to everyone!  <p>"The Matrix" is available now on DVD.<br />"The Matrix Reloaded" is available now on DVD.<br />"The Matrix Revolutions" is available APRIL 6TH on DVD<br />(And I love the cover art, someone said they thought is lazy, whatever!)</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>I honestly have to admit: I don't understand what all the critical panning of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is about.  I'll concede that the first hour almost plays like a "Last time we last saw Neo" introduction, and the Wachowskis might've gone back to the drawing board to "revolutionize" a stronger opening.  However, at the time of working on the picture(s), perhaps they didn't have a clear-cut breaking point between the two storylines, and, thus, the opening of REVOLUTIONS suffers from too much exposition.  Some of it is has the feel of a manufactured recap, hinting that reshoots might've been performed after they agreed on the two films' midpoint.<p>Still, once the action begins, the action begins, and the non-stop blow-out (and blow-ups!) are technically as sophisticated as anything revealed in the first MATRIX film.  While not quite capturing lightning in a bottle the way they did with the first outing, the Wachowskis manage to pull out all of the stops to give serious 'Matrixiles' a grand send-off to this slightly uneven trilogy.<p>The theology slant was, in my humble opinion, an obvious set-up to the conclusion.  When fanboys and fangals everywhere were expecting the probable "ship in a bottle" virtual reality tie-up (myself included, to a point), the Wachowskis managed to veer off toward the "other" logical plotline to tie up the loose ends.  Little did we know that, at the end of the stellar first film, we were actually being shown an allegory for Christ's struggle on behalf on mankind.  Sure, the foundation was there, but it played out winningly through REVOLUTIONS.<p>If REVOLUTIONS has any great strength, then it would have to be creating a hunger to go back and rewatch the first and second installments for hints, clues, and foreshadowing that will inevitably appear on subsequent viewings.  While that isn't the kind of brick to build a franchise around, it certainly didn't hurt this cyber-driven action trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>If Revolutions isn't what you expected, perhaps its time time to scale down your expectations. The film returns to its roots, sort of, by refocusing on the struggle between Zion and the machine world and Neo's role in bringing down The Matrix. Not everything is what it seems, though, in this complex, loud action thriller.<p>When we last saw Neo he was in a coma. Some of his abilities from the Matrix had intruded upon the real world. As a result, he was able to stop the squids from killing him and his crewmates. Evidently he's stuck between the machine world and the human one. He's stranded in a program that manifests itself as a subway station. His only way out is to get on the train that runs through it but the trainmaster is in the employ of the evil French character from the second film. That's not going to happen without some intervention from Trinity and Morpheus (which does eventually occur though to say how would spoil it).<p>Agent Smith has occupied the body of a human survivor of an attack by the Matrix. He's now able to battle Neo in the real world. He's also multipling in the Matrix taking over programs without end and reshaping the Matrix's interactive human landscape in the process. <p>The main weak point of the film is dividing up the trio of characters at the heart of the film; Trinity and Neo end up on a journey to Machine city where the ultimate confrontation may or may not occur. While Morpheus is shunted to the side as he tries to get back in time to help save Zion. The performances are, as usual, stellar. The point of the Matrix films, though, isn't the acting as much as the visuals, stunts and psuedo intellectual discusses the characters have. So it's a good thing that the Wachowski brothers have four (including Hugo Weaving in his marvelous performance as Agent Smith)strong actors in the lead roles.<p>The visuals are much more convincing here than in Reloaded. Although the sequence on the freeway in Reloaded was great looking, there were many substandard effects shots in that film. While there are times (such as a few of the scenes during the assualt on Zion City)the CGI effects aren't completely convincing, that's not too great a sin; consider what they would have looked like with matte paintings, miniatures and stop motion models by comparison. <p>The film isn't quite the classic that the first Matrix was but is an improvement over Reloaded. Revolutions manages is closer to the spirit of the first film in many respects and the parts of the film that echo the quality of the first film are the strongest as well. The conclusion is both bold and idiotic. I was really surprised by the choices the Wachowski brothers made. I said idiotic because they aren't the most commerical and that's a credit to them; they felt that the story had gone as far as it could go. <p>This film, like Reloaded, is about twenty minutes too long. It seems that the Wachowski's and their editor felt it was necessary to give as much screen time as possible to the battle in Zion City because of all the expensive CGI effects (or perhaps they just didn't know how to cut the sequence). Revolutions meanders just a bit but is still enjoyable entertainment. If you're expecting enlightenment, you'll be sadly disappointed as not all the &quot;answers&quot; are provided. It's just as well as Revolutions had the potential to spiral out of control into a mess (much like Lucas' latest Star Wars installments).<p>Revolutions is an action packed film with many surprises. If you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the film. While it runs about twenty minutes too long, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After being so disappointed/confused with "The Matrix Reloaded" after seeing it in the theater in 2003, I didn't even see this film on the big screen when it came out, instead renting it once it came out on home video.  After viewing, I realized that I missed the wrong Matrix film to skip for a long period of time.<br /><br />Whereas "Revolutions" does not come close to the first film in duplicating the originality of the idea, it superbly triumphs the sub-par second film by eliminating much of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo and instead focus on a plot that the average viewer has a chance to understand.<br /><br />Essentially, two things happen during the course of this film (I liken it to the Lord of the Rings series, where Frodo/Sam do their thing while the rest of Middle Earth fights Sauron): First, the city of Zion braces for (and eventually does engage) the approach machine army.  The special effects in the war scenes are pretty incredible...not anything we haven't seen before, but not even as close to as faky as those in "Reloaded".  The other plotline sees Neo and Trinity traveling deep into the heart of Machine City, where Neo ultimately has his final confrontation with the seemingly unstoppably Agent Smith.  That final showdown is so intense (and so awaited) that it will raise the hairs on the back of your neck!<br /><br />Overall, then, this film falls somewhere in between the originality of the first installment of the trilogy and the over-the-top sequel.  Upon the conclusion of "Revolutions", I (and I consider myself to be an above-average viewer of science fiction) was still a bit confused as to what had exactly transpired, but not the utter sense of confusion I felt after viewing "Reloaded".  Instead, "Revolutions" prompted me to check out what people were saying on the Internet, and eventually I did grasp the fundamental concept of what had happened.<br /><br />So, if you were extremely disappointed by "Reloaded" and vowed to never view another Matrix film ever again, I strongly suggest that you give this one a try, as it completes the story of Neo in way that you can understand (even if it MAY take a little extra help from Internet scribes!).</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>I have no idea what the critics are griping about. This is a _great_ movie.<p>And I do _not_ mean that you should refrain from looking for anything 'deep' and just enjoy the action and special effects. Oh, the special effects are fantastic, all right. But the 'deep' ideas _are_ there, and you can find them if you know what to look for.<p>I think the problem is that so many viewers misunderstood the main theme of the first _Matrix_ film, taking it to be a movie about the question 'What is real?' Then they were disappointed when the next two films had little new to say on that question.<p>But that's not the main theme of this trilogy, or even of the first film. The theme is: 'What is the nature of the relationship between humans and machines?' And the resolution of _that_ question in the third film has every bit as much mind-blowing power as anything in the original _Matrix_.<p>The question does get answered, and the answer does make sense. All the tension in the plot comes down to whether Neo is really the 'One' and what it means to be the 'One'. Well, what _is_ the One? I won't tell you, but I _will_ tell you to pay very close attention to the relationship between Neo and Smith.<p>In this final film of the _Matrix_ trilogy, humans and machines achieve the next level in their symbiotic evolution. The Wachowskis have done it right; the critics have it wrong. Don't miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Let's get one thing straight:  &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has none of the reality-bending plot twists nor the eye-opening originality of the first.  The final chapter in the trilogy is an altogether different type of movie.  Although it cannot compete against the original, it competes strongly against other entries in the action/adventure genre.  With the requisite battle scenes that pit the underdog against a superpower, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; is a fast-paced, adrenalin-packed movie that owes its entertainment to action and special effects.  Despite this, the viewer must listen and watch carefully, as in the other two, to understand why events unfold as they do.<p>The plot is difficult to detail without spoilers since many of the most shocking revelations come at the beginning, before the high-stakes battle scenes begin.  Let it suffice to say that Neo has become something more than we thought, and as a result, he is much more of a threat to the nefarious virus Agent Smith.  When the Oracle indicates (or does she?) that Neo is Zion's only hope, he and Trinity break off from the others who are hunkering down for an all-out assault of Zion.  This is the strongest indicator that the third of the trilogy has stepped away from philosophical sci-fi and into pure action, as Neo and Trinity disappear from the screen for long stretches.  Their onscreen time is limited, as is their plot; this will disappoint many diehard fans.  Still, the action sequences are breathless (although eventually overdone) and the special effects are first-rate.  The resolution of the trilogy is both surprising and inevitable, the hallmark of a well-prepared story.  If you've been paying attention, it will make complete sense.  <p>I recommend you approach this film without high expectations.  Comparing it to the first will only disappoint you.  Expect instead something along the lines of the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies, and you'll enjoy every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I am dumbfounded at how many people actually gave this film five stars. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where all given bit part roles to play in the final movie of the trilogy and Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok where made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does!<p>Okay so Terminator 3 was no Terminator 1 or 2, but it was satisfactory! Return of the Jedi was the weakest of the series but that too was satisfactory. Star Wars Ep.1 was nothing like the originals but again at least it was satisfactory.<p>Revolutions is nothing like the above. It is more akin to the kind of sabotage that we see in movie remakes!<p>The filmmakers obviously have absolutely no idea what made the first film so good. Reloaded and Revolutions have gone down the road of Disney cartoons instead of staying on the patch of action comic book type appeal. It was a tremendously bad call by the filmmakers to focus too much on Zion and bring bit-part characters to the forefront of the movie. Morpheus is forgotten about and does little more than sit in a co-pilot seat next to Niobe throughout the movie. It was Morpheus who made the metaphysical statements cool. When the same things are spoken by some bit part characters... (who are given a leading roles!... oh what a crisis!... you simply DO NOT DO THAT.)... it just sounds plain stupid and dumb. NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here.<p>The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded and it certainly is at the opposite end of the spectrum when compared to the original Matrix.<p>Questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Seriously it is a SIN to do what they have done to the Matrix series. Watch the climatic scene between Neo and Trinity which lasts for ages. Listen to what they are saying! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh..... <p>The filmmakers have stamped all over this film as if they are out to harm the entire series - or maybe - is it just possible ..... that the first Matrix movie was just made a FANTASTIC MOVIE by accident? Everything on display in Revolutions seems to point to that conclusion.<p>There are only two key action sequences in this film. One which revolves around warriors controlling "Aliens" type robots with guns and the machines crashing around the place with lots of gun-fire and explosions. It is excellent stuff for the first few minutes but far too much time is spent on it. We WANT to see NEO getting it on with Agent Smith!... and finally ... (and it is a long time coming) when it appears, it is nothing compared to the Alleyway Brawl we saw in Reloaded.<p>This film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type movie. The filmmakers should never have given our principle characters a back seat to other bit part actors. They should have reduced the Zion fight sequence by at least three-quarters of the running time and put that space into Neo and Smith getting it on in some way shape or form. The screenplay should have been revised from the start instead of plowing so much money into the Zion action sequence. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made. Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a prime example of a marketing confidence trick marred with bad acting, bad writing and bad direction. The special effects are on top form but this DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE.<p>Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole. Fans should voice their disapproval so that this sort of humiliation does not happen again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>After the cliffhanger ending of the "Matrix Reloaded", this third and final entry in the Wachowski Brothers' movie trilogy is a fantastic but controversial closer to this stunning movie series. The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to "The Terminator" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies. <p>The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of "Event Horizon" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur. <p>I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well. <p>As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, "Revolutions" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed. <p> I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the "Reloaded" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years. <p>The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with "Lord of the Rings", I don't know but I felt that "Matrix Revolutions" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, "Matrix Revolutions" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.<p>It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in "Reloaded". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than<br />the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one<br />was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as<br />many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is<br />actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion<br />and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily<br />from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical<br />parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things<br />that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to<br />me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix<br />Revolutions is a 3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Conclusion is what Revolutions is, bringing and ended to the explosive Matrix Trilogy.  A direct continuation from Reloaded, Revolutions is once again more eye candy than anything else, with the actual Matrix getting less screen time than the first 2 films.  The focus is on the great war in Zion city, against the machines.  Its true, the best action and story in this movie all take place in the real world.  But there is still plenty of Matrix involved, but only in the beginning and end of the film.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, but the journey to reach the conclusion has smaller twists and turns along the way that are unexpected.  The movie is very intense, in terms of action and cgi.  It is truly a thrill ride and we finally get to see an army of mechs unleash their firepower upon the sentinels in Zion city.  Neo and Smith face off in their final battle.  Unlike the first Matrix, which incorporated a nice blend of realistic martial arts and wirework, this battle is more cgi and expands to the 2 barely fighting on any ground, thus limiting the true martial arts.  Not a bad fight, but its ridiculously overdone and not very pretty.<br /><br />Some say this movie is just plain bad, but I don't believe that is true.  Most people want to compare it to the first Matrix, but independently its not a bad movie.  While it is not nearly as good as the first Matrix, it is still a great movie, but just like Reloaded, the story effort is not as strong as the first Matrix, and the focus seems to be on the action.  You'll want to see Reloaded before Revolutions, simply because Reloaded is part 1 and Revolutions is pt2.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>First off, don't put this DVD in expecting The Matrix, or anything equal to "Reloaded." It is a little bland compared with it's prequels. It is much more violent, sad, and dark.<br /><br />The fight scene at the end is pretty neat, but it really failed to pack in the physcilogical blast the first two had in great measure.<br /><br />See it, but don't expect the first two. Maybe you should rent it edited, it had some content problems as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>This movie has its strengths and weaknesses. My opinion of it has declined since I saw it, and I do think it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's definitley still worth seeing.<p>Pros - Some really excellent scenes, from the murky fight in the club to the more intense battle inside the craft between Neo and Smith, and of course the final battle, which may be a bit overwrought but is still visually impressive. Also I don't think Reeves' performance is as bad as some people say; it wouldn't make sense for him to express emotion strongly when the plot of the series has gradually been turning him into a superhuman, detached, Christ-like figure; I think a lot of his blankness may be intentional.<p>Cons - There is a lot of bad acting, admittedly, and a lot of moments which are embarassing in their sentimentality or simply their lack of sense. The movie's worst flaw, though, is its inabilty to give the series a satisfying conclusion; a message, or a definite feeling, just basically a reason for its existence. You really feel like the second two movies were pointless; competent, maybe, but pointless.<p>In the end, three stars seems fair.

Keanu Reeves (upcoming Constantine, The Watcher) once again returns as Neo who is stuck in a train station...kinda the Wachowski brothers version of limbo I guess in which he is trapped and cant get out. Trinity, Carrie Ann-Moss (Red Planet, Chocolat) and Laurence Fishburne (Assault Of Precinct 13, Mystic River) return as Trinity and Morpheus as they race to rescue Neo. They accomplish their missing but Neo must go on his own to machine city where he must fight his final battle with Agent Smith, Hugh Weaving (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Priscilla Queen Of The Desert), so he wont take over the matrix and get out into zion. Trinity goes along for the ride but things soon happen as someone is already on the ship and he is possessed by Agent Smith...so Neo gets his eyes burnt off but he kills the intruder. Meanwhile, Morpheus and his crew....includes Link, played by Harold Perrineau Jr (Tv's OZ, Tv's Lost) and Niaobi, Jada Pinkett Smith (Collateral, Demon Knight) who  race back to zion because the sentinels have breached and are inside while the inside are trying to fight them off as best as they can. Action galore with a weak story following the grande of what Reloaded was. it seriously could of been a lot better. the climatic fight battle with Neo and Agent Smith would be the highlight. Marcy Alice plays the oracle replacing Gloria Foster who passed away while these films were in project. Also starring Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (RAY, The Human Stain, Since You've Been Gone) and Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Tv's Firefly).</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>The Matrix was an AWESOME movie!  It had a great plot, amazing special effects, great characters, and sufficient acting ability.  The Matrix Reloaded was okay.  Many of the interesting characters who had died in the first movie were replaced by one-dimensional characters that most people didn't give a darn about.  The effects were better, but they were unable to make up for the lack of overall story and acting.  The Matrix Revolutions suffers from the exact same problem.  The characters are still annoying, there is even less plot (this whole movie takes place in the span of about a day), and it seems that Keanu Reeves' acting ability actually decreased.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie picks up exactly where Reloaded ended; Neo (Reeves) is in a coma (sort of) along with Bane/Smith (Ian Bliss).  Smith, after taking over Bane's body, exited the matrix.  Now, his consciousness (or soul) is inhabiting the body of freedom fighter Bane.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) is still in shock after learning that the prophecy isn't true, or it isn't in the way he had believed it to be.  Finally, the army of sentinals is minutes away from breaching Zion, the last human city.  After Neo awakens, he and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) take a ship to the Machine City to end the war while Morpheus, Niobe (Jada Pincket Smith) et. al. return to Zion to help fight.  Neo makes a deal with the machines: Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become a virus that the matrix can't even control anymore.  Smith is a self-replicating program that is causing a lot of problems for the machines.  If Neo destroys Smith, the war will end.<br /><br />The only truly good thing about this movie is the final fight between Smith and Neo.  The APU's (which resemble Mech Warriors) are cool, but that scene is way too long.  The acting is terrible, save Ian Bliss who had to portray the Agent Smith character, and he did it very well.  This movie was also very confusing.  In the first Matrix, there were lines that were cryptic, but they made sense.  In this one and Reloaded, I think that the writers just threw stuff in because it either sounded cool or they had no idea either, so they hoped that viewers would just "go with it".  One thing they handled terribly was the Oracle's (Mary Alice) change in appearance.  Gloria Foster, the woman who played the oracle in the two previous movies, died before this movie was filmed, so she had to be replaced.  All they had to say was that there was a change in the matrix, but instead, they came up with a really confusing and hokey explanation.<br /><br />Also, in the first movie, the allusions to the fact that Neo was a Christ-like character were subtle.  In Reloaded and especially this movie, they really lay it on thick.  After a while, it got a little old.  I mean, when Neo was jacked in by the machines, his body formed a cross, Smith was literally the Anti-Neo, he converted people's souls (in a sense), and, well I can't reveal the really big allusion.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will say this: if you really, really like the Matrix movies, you should see this one only to see how everything ends.  If not, don't waste your time.  Also, don't let this review stop you from seeing the first Matrix.  It is a great movie, and, in my opinion, can stand pretty well on its own.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Did anyone else notice that, during the final battle, after Smith and Neo collided mid-air and created that huge water sphere, Smith looked like Ganondorf in Legend of Zelda: Occarina of Time?  After Link and Zelda escape the castle, Ganondorf rises up and floats in the air (like Smith) and becomes Ganon.  Their facial expressions and positions of limbs are nearly identical.  Also, Link and Ganondorf were also opposites in the same way Neo and Smith are.  Just wondering.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>"The Matrix Revolutions" is a celabration on how far we've gotten with CGI, but there's nothing in the film that I can like. Their's bad acting, bad script, the film doesn't give us any ideas or an answer. We get the fact that every one will be free, but free from what, the matrix, or the real world. To be honest with you, I was expecting to be a child in the film, the son of Neo. I thought that was the reason of the dance/love scene in "Reloaded", but no. We get mindless,Mindless action, and you don't even want to know the ending.<br /><br />There's just no point to this story anymore, I don't even want to see the prequals, unless we get to know more about the characters, but I definetly don't want to see the fourth one, if it happens. The Oracle Quotes: "Neo is trapped somewhere between this world and the machine world." This is a sign that the Wachowski's are truly bored of this saga, cause they don't tell us anything about this world between the Matrix and the machine world. But this is a okay film, because of the ending and the visual effects, and the last fight between Agent Smith and Neo is spectacular, but thats all,kinda dissapointing.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a worthy ending to this series.  While I tired somewhat of the cowboy stuff that naturally accompanies a climax, the dark vision and ambiguous ending of the film mark it as truly outstanding sci-fi.  Sure, the ending was happy, but troubles for the future are very clearly in the making.  The greatest surprize of all is the maintenance of the cryptic - and logically consistent - references that were so much fun in the 2nd part.  Moreover, it is never fully explained, but left to the imaginative to puzzle out, if they so wish.  Indeed, there are added delicious mysteries, like the little Indian girl and the transforamtion of the oracle.  <p>REcommended for serious fans of sci-fi.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'The Matrix' was truly a unique film.  It presented a unique way of looking at the world and questioning reality.  The special effects were tweaked to just the right point--extraordinary but not too far over the top--to inspire the right amount of awe in the audience.  'Reloaded' was in about the same vain, but the story dragged.  The third movie completely loses it.<p>I guess what bothered me the most about &quot;Reloaded&quot; is that the matrix itself really became secondary to everything else.  The movie is really about the defense of Zion from the Sentinels.  This brings up two discussions:  the matrix, and the battle of zion.<p>As for the Matrix scenes, I was left asking myself what was the point?  Trinity and Morpheus engage in a bizarre journey to rescue Neo from a limbo like train station used by programs to enter and leave the Matrix.  One battle scene had Morpheus and Trinity's enemies on the ceiling while they battled from the floor.  There was no apparent point to this, and it did nothing to liven up the scene.<p>The final battle between Neo and Smith also took place in the Matrix.  For the most part, it was unimpressive.  Unlike the battles in previous movies, this was too far over the top, and largely consisted of the two combatants landing punches that would knock the other a thousand feet away, and then they would charge each other again to repeat the sequence.  It didn't appear that any complicated coreography was needed.<p>While the work done to create the battle of Zion was impressive, the battle itself was not.  With all the action we have seen in the Matrix series, we know the creators are capable of making something much more exciting and tense.  However, the greatest part of the battle was the humans suited up in APU's, which are a knock off of the load lifters in Aliens, standing in one place, shooting at the endless stream of sentinels flying into Zion.  The only real excitement came when it was time for them to reload, and that was not exactly breath-taking.<p>The most redeeming part of this movie was the actor that impersonated Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.  His impersonation was dead on to the point of being creepy.  It was the most impressive bit of acting in the entire series, followed up by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Agent Smith.<p>While there are some things to think about (the meaning of love and emotions, religion, Neo as a Christ figure, etc.) I feel like the movie really changed the path established by the prior two movies.  There was a mystery surrounding the Matrix created in the first two movies, and it was largely blown off in the third.  If you plotted where things were going in the first two movies, you wouldn't conclude this is the logical result.  Sure, its a twist, but its way to forced.<p>Overall, the story was okay, the special effects were visually impressive, but not awe inspiring like those in the predecessor films.  I give it a three stars based on the quality of the cgi effects, the acting of the aforementioned actor, and leaving open the possibility of another movie that actually gets us back to the Matrix.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>The third and --ye gods!-- most boring of the "Matrix" movies. I wasn't wild about the first "Matrix" film, but was pretty much on board after seeing #2, considering it a fine, fast-paced, pleasantly pseudo-profound, comicbooky action film. And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself.  Oh, well.  By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen.  Big flaw in the casting there, which helps drag the series down on a number of occasions.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>MOTS from the invisible Wachowski brothers.  'Matrix Revolutions' is really two movies: 1) The boring, gibberish-laden love, philosophy, and technospeak sequences, and 2) the exciting, spectacular effects action portions, mostly contained in the last hour of the film.<p>The plot is pretty much the same muddled gunk that we saw in the first two films, rife with long treatises that really don't seem to mean much of anything. A notable example is the meandering speech by the Frenchman (aka 'The Merovingian') in the dance club - what the heck was that?  I dare say that the writing quality diminished with each sequel...<p>Thankfully, there is notably less grandiose posturing by the Morpheus character in this 3rd episode (Laurence Fishburne); he actually seems to have an inferiority complex sitting next to Jada Pinkett's ship pilot.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) seems less confident in his 'The One' capabilities.  Of course, he summons up the strength he needs by the big finale.<p>The action sequences were simply spectacular.  When the giant boring machines pierce Zion's walls, hordes of Sentinels pour in, to be met by a hail of fire from the phalanx of APUs awaiting below (the Sentinel 'clouds' appear to be based on massive schools of fish, flowing in unison).  It is truly a huge battle, taking up nearly 20 minutes of screen time.  When Neo meets Smith for the final battle, it is truly cataclysmic, with explosions of water, rock, and buildings that approach nuclear in scale.<p>Overall, this film deserves to be rated right in the middle: 2 1/2 stars.  The shallowness of the characters, babbling dialogue, and stereotypical love story are balanced by awesome effects work.  What is lacking here is a great story to work with.  In my mind, this trilogy is a long way from what is now the consensus definitive example of the genre: Lord of the Rings.  The Matrix series seemed to get worse with each episode from a plot standpoint, while 'LOTR' built up to a crescendo with 'Return of the King'.  The Matrix filmakers did not have the luxury (or difficulty) of having a true classic piece of literature to base their work on.  Because of this, 'Matrix Revolutions' is pretty easy to forget after watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Despite what many fans think and what you may have heard, The Matrix Revolutions; the third and final (?) film in the Matrix trilogy sends the series off with a bang as opposed to the whimper that many expected.  First off, Revolutions is much better and more satisfying than Matrix Reloaded, and the CGI effects are better as well.  Picking up right where Reloaded left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped between the real world and the artificial world of the Matrix while the war between man and machine rages on both fronts as the people of Zion defend the city against the endless swarms of sentinels and the multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) grows more powerful in the world of the Matrix.  There aren't as many jaw dropping action scenes (until the film's climax) that populated the previous two films, but the battle for Zion and the ultra epic Super Burly Brawl in which Neo and Smith fight for the final time are marvels of modern movie magic.  As a whole however, just like Reloaded, Revolutions just can't live up to the awe of the original film.  And as much as I like the two later entries of the series, I can't help but think that there never should have been a Matrix trilogy.  When we saw Neo fly towards the sky at the end of the first film, that should have been it, but naturally Warner Bros. knows how to milk a good thing dry.  The DVD itself is much better on features than the disappointing Reloaded two disc set; with featurettes that are actually worth watching.  However, there is yet again no commentary at all.  I guess co-directors/writers Andy and Larry Wachowski are too busy counting their money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I rewatched &quot;The Matrix&quot; before I watched &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; on DVD, so that when I went to the theater and saw &quot;The Matrix Revolutions,&quot; I would have a fighting chance of being able to follow along and possibly appreciate the climax.  I would not say that the ending was predictable per se, but given the pair of problems afflicting Neo's world (the sentinels are coming to Zion City to kill all the humans while Smith is taking over every being in the Matrix) the solution has the virtue of logic (albeit Hollywood rather than cybernetic).  Anyway, I am not all that sure that thinking too much about this film is necessary for enjoying it, although I did take small pleasure in being ahead of Neo a couple of times in the film.  I do not thing there really could be any other ending, given the set up, but if you were expecting something spectacularly new and more substance than style in the conclusions of the trilogy, you are going to be disappointed.<p>&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; comes down to two gigantic battles.  The first is the defense of the dock in Zion City when the sentinels break through.  What we have at that point is basically the biggest shootout video game you have ever seen.  The second is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which manages to combine the contradictory principles of bigger and better with less is more.  While each is going on you are two busy enjoying the spectacle to be overly concerned with what it all means in the end.  I mean, sometimes a EMP is a good thing and who cares if kicking a computer virus is really not going to do it much harm?  <p>For me this was the biggest kitchen sink movie I have ever seen.  The whole &quot;Matrix&quot; idea got props for being cutting edge, but for the finale I was repeatedly struck by bits and pieces of dozens of other films and had to fight down an urge to yell, &quot;Use the Force, Neo!&quot;  But there is a vessell fighting off attackers like &quot;Star Wars,&quot; big guns like in &quot;Aliens,&quot; millions of attacking creatures like in &quot;Star Ship Troopers,&quot; several scenes lifted from World War II movies, Neo fights Smith in a driving rain like the climax of &quot;The Seven Samurai,&quot; and dozens of other cinematic references.  This is not to say that these references are intentional homages, but neither are they intrusive (cf. &quot;The Rock&quot;).  <p>I was also struck by how &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has the same basic structure as &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; the upcoming conclusion of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; in that you have a giant pivotal battle (the Battle of the Pelinor Fields) and then the whole thing comes down to a mano e mano confrontation (Frodo and Gollum).  It also occurs to me with both of those movies and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; earlier this year, actor Hugo Weaving (Smith and Elrond), has the opportunity to be the first actor to ever appear in movies that came out in a single year that could end up earning $1 billion in the United States.  At the end of the first week of release of this film he has already broken the $400 million mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This was easily the most action packed 3 hours ever! This is where they answer all the questions, they explain what Neo's purpose is, and then they fill in the time buy showing off some truly amazing special effects, and the greatest fight scene since Yoda's fight from Star Wars: Episode 2. Wow this was what I was hoping for, a big showdown. They were also realistic on how the machines and humans made peace, because there was no way that the small army of humans could have defeated the sentinel army. NONE WHAT SO EVER! So the first Matrix film introduced the characters and the situation, and the goal of the humans, the second one added more plot and more questions and was much more fast paced and allowed us to see samples of "the one's" power, and the third one gives us the biggest and coolest battle, possible in the hystory of cinema. I personally didn't think any of the matrix films were hard to follow or mentally stimulating, but I found them awesome! Yes there's opening for a Matrix 4, and I'm sure, even though they said they wouldn't, will make another to cash in and capitalize in the sucess, but then again who wouldn't?</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Even though I found Matrix Reloaded a major disappointment, I still knew without doubt I would have to see Revolutions when it came out.  There was too much potential that just might yet be fulfilled, too many loose ends just begging to be tied.  While hardly a cinematic masterpiece, Revolutions is indeed a fulfilling climax to the Matrix series.  There are the usual bugaboos:  mediocre acting (except for the outstanding Hugo Weaving), a slew of rather unlikeable protagonists (I can't bring myself to like any of the characters except the big three of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus) and an often ameaturish script, but one recurring problem with the Matrix--all the overblown psychobabble posing as philosophy--actually makes some sense this time around.  Some die-hard Matrix fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of action in this entry, but don't be fooled by a few negative reviews into thinking the Matrix has gone soft.  Revolutions packs some devastating punches, they're just more concentrated this time.  The robotic invasion of Zion is spectacular (if a bit unimaginative), Neo's encounter with a "real-world" Agent Smith is intense and provocative, and of course the ultimate showdown is a mindblowing exhibition that does NOT end as you'd expect.  As a Christian, by far the most powerful element for me in Revolutions is the strong Christ-imagery, which comes full circle in the moving finale.  Perhaps this is one turn-off for Matrix devotees who like to see the series as a repudiation of any orthodoxy.  Funny how so many "open-minded" people refuse to be at all open to any concept of an absolute truth.  Of course, Revolutions incorporates themes from several philosophies, but in the end it is the Christian element that shines most strongly.  In any event, there's something here for anyone who's come this far into the saga. As a slick package of modern spirituality, pop psychology, killer action, conspiracy theory, and high-octane FX, the Matrix Series is a winner that is ultimately more than the sum of its parts. And Revolutions is the story's climactic exclamation point.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Few things have shocked me more than the incredible amount of bad reviews for &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and the overwhelming amount of negative voting on positive reviews of this astonishing film.  In my opinion, many a fan of the original &quot;The Matrix&quot; film have taken the same tack that fans of the first three Star Wars did with Episodes I and II, in so much that it wasn't what &quot;they&quot; expected it to be so it wasn't any good in their &quot;opinions.&quot;  Just as Episodes I and II of Star Wars are the results of George Lucas's vision for those films, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and this; &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; are the sum of what the Wachowski brothers envisioned them to be.  That being said, I found their vision of where the films should go to be enormously entertaining on all levels, from bringing the story to its ultimate conclusion to its breathtaking action sequences.<p>I've never been a great fan of Keanu Reeves and his acting abilities but with this and the first two movies he clearly found a role that is well suited to his talents and this will most likely be the role he is most remembered for.  Carrie-Ann Moss's performances in all three films is incredible as well and, like Keanu Reeves, this will probably be the role she is most remembered for.  What can one say about Laurence Fishburne's performance in these films other than that it was incredible; of course, in most films I've seen him in he's been nothing less than an outstanding actor.  Although I think Hugo Weaving was erroneously given the role he was given in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, here in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies he has left an indelible mark as one of the ultimate bad guys.<p>With the Matrix series of films, the Wachowski brothers as both writers and directors have clearly made a mark on the industry and any future films by them will definitely fall into the category of &quot;must see.&quot;<p>The Premise:<p>As &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...<p>What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it...<p>Overall, I highly recommend &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and of course the first two films as they can be described as nothing less than an incredible cinematic experience and that these films will most certainly go into the history books as classics in the genre.  To those who have viewed this last film in the series negatively, I would definitely recommend another viewing with a more open mind, letting the movie maker's vision of the films direction through as opposed to your own.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Revolutions Recalibrated<br />-CG Revolution<br />-Super Burly Brawl<br />-Future Gamer:  The Matrix Online<br />-Before the Revolution<br />-3-D Evolution</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>The Matrix was a brilliant movie. The sequels were not. After watching Matrix Revolutions I really wished that the Wachowski<br /><br />brothers had just stopped with the first one. This is ghastly. The audience cares about Neo, Morpheus and Smith so what did we get? Morpheus being weak and unsure (and pretty out of shape. Larry Fishbourne obviously hadn't been to the gym) endless scenes with annoying side characters, and horrible cliches. Was the crusty old military man scolding and then having to rely on the plucky kid scene necessary? Were the endless scenes of the commander talking slowly to the counsel needed? And as for the slow talking did anyone notice what a bad actress Jada Pinkett Smtih is? She spends the entire movie scowling and speaking her laughable lines very slowly. While I'm on the subject of laughable was I the only one who laughed at Trinity's death scene? Considering her injuries she shouldn't have been able to talk much less give Neo a pep talk. The battle scenes went on too long and weren't original in the least. This whole thing was just a lumpy mess.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>The incredible phenomenon of "The Matrix" that hit theaters in 1999 was a landmark film that defined and redefined what we know about science-fiction/action movies and the special effects that can be employed.  The minds behind the madness, the Wachowski brothers, decided to capitalize on the first film's enormous popularity by creating two sequels ("The Matrix: Reloaded" and this one, "The Matrix: Revolutions") to complete a spectacular trilogy.  To avoid the pitfalls of making fans waits ridiculous amounts of time between each sequel (like the "Star Wars" prequels), the Wachowskis decided to film "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" at the same time with the intention of releasing them about a half a year apart ("Lord of the Rings" director, Peter Jackson, employed this same strategy).  Unfortunately, due to onset tragedies and unforeseen delays, the sequels didn't appear until four years after the original, at least a year and a half later than was intended.  Still, the first sequel, "The Matrix: Reloaded", did a credible job of continuing and expanding the story begun in the original.  The meta-philosophical gobble-de-gook didn't bog down that film due to its awe-inspiring and relevant action sequences.  With a bit of a cliffhanger, the table was set for the final part of the trilogy, "The Matrix: Revolutions" to end this saga with a spectacular flourish.  Alas, "Revolutions" turns out to be a mixed bag.  It still provides some awe-inspiring battles, but the discussions get more arcane than in the previous film, and there are some plot developments late in the film that seem to go against everything that has led to this point and create a decidedly unsatisfying and incomplete conclusion.<br /><br />"The Matrix: Reloaded" ended with Neo (Keanu Reaves) trapped somewhere in between the Matrix and human world as the result of using some newfound human powers.  While Neo tries to find his way back to the real world, the humans must still contend with the deadly armada of sentinels still drilling towards Zion in an attempt to exterminate the humans.  After some garbled philosophical discussions, including wasted appearances by Merovingian and Persephone, Neo returns to the real world and a decision is made on what must be done.  After much discussion and arguing, Neo and his lover, Trinity, take one of the human ships to go towards the machines' main city and try and defeat them there, while the remaining humans (such of Morpheus, et al) take the remaining ship and rush back to Zion in an attempt to provide some help during the inevitable battle with the sentinels.  The stage has been set for some truly dramatic developments and, indeed, much of what happens over the next hour is quite compelling and dramatic.  Neo and Trinity's approach to the machine city is a technological marvel.  Much is revealed about the structure and extent of the surface of Earth.  Many miles below the surface the tension of waiting for the sentinel armada is palpable.  Once the battle starts, it becomes a mind-bending sensory assault of images that at once seem to clutter the screen, but never become so indistinct that you cannot tell what is happening.  In terms of technical achievement, the Battle for Zion may be second only to the freeway battle in "Reloaded".<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is more to the movie than this, and the last 30-45 minutes is both ponderous and frustrating.  It is very tempting to reveal the final plot twists so that you can understand the confounding left-turn this film takes, but in the interests of not playing spoiler, I won't.  I will put forth that this does create a decidedly unsatisfying ending, though.  This is truly disappointing, because the "Matrix" trilogy had the potential to completely redefine the definitions of existence and, perhaps, even spawn a new school of philosophical thought.  It just seems as though the Wachowskis got too clever for their own good and the trilogy ends up being less than the some of its parts.  "The Matrix: Revolutions" is not a bad movie.  Its actions sequences are enough to grant it three stars.  However, it is my belief that, in time, the original "Matrix" will be viewed on its own as a truly great film, with two sequels being thought of as frustrating and necessary additions.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>I pretty much had my own idea of how this movie was going to be when I finished watching 'The Matrix: Reloaded' this past Spring. 'Reloaded' was somewhat of a disappointment for me, but it was neccessary. Since May I had it stuck in my head that 'Reloaded' was meant to bridge the gap between the first movie and the last movie, and that is was. Just as the first was a perfect, mysterious and fantasic beginning, 'Revolutions' is a no-holds barred, rollercoaster of action and emotion that closes out the trilogy with a bang. There is an entire action sequence that involves the machines penetrating Zion (the last living city, for those of you not in the know) where we are taken away from the main characters for about 40 minutes -- and you don't even notice! It is so easy to be engrossed in the action in this movie. All I ever heard was the hype about that darn freeway chase in 'Reloaded' that didn't seem to amount to anything. The action sequences in this movie are completely wild and over-the-top. And if action isn't what you are looking for, everything else is still here. The love story between Neo and Trinity is at it's strongest by this point, and of course with the way things work out, it would have to be. This movie also isn't as confusing as some would have you believe. As someone who hasn't submerged himself in all of the 'Matrix' multimedia that are said to be vital (video-games, cartoons, books, magazines, underwear, shot-glasses, vitamins...maybe I'm getting caried away), I walked away from this movie with a perfect understanding of the series as a whole and overall, I loved every minute of this movie. As said before, 'Reloaded' may have been a bore, but it made this movie possible. Don't let that disappointment (I know a lot of people were) damper your mood for seeing this movie. 'Revolutions' is a cinematic milestone. A must-see for anyone with even a casual interest in the 'Matrix' world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  The Wachowski Brothers.<br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett, Hugo Weaving.<br />Running Time: 128 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>While the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; films revolved around the splendid special effects and exceptional kung-fu action that could be presented on a visual screen, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; is much more plot driven and metaphorically focused.  As far as if it is a fitting end to the trilogy, it depends on what the audience is looking for.  If the audience wants some sort of resolution as far as whether Zion survives the attack of the machines and if the Matrix is destroyed, then perhaps the trilogy is complete; however, if the audience is looking for a concise, clear-cut ending...not so fast.<p>The story takes place approximately moments after &quot;Reloaded&quot; ended.  Neo, played by Keanu Reeves in perhaps his best performance of the three films, finds himself in an in-between world in which he has to return in order to save Zion from destruction.  Morpheus and Trinity (Fishburne and Moss, respectively) come to the rescue, but there are bigger problems.  Mr. Smith (Weaving) has used the Matrix as his playing field to create thousands of Smith Agents, all of which are going to be used to destory not only Zion, but all of mankind as well.  Thus, the much expected colassal clash between Neo and Smith--and they certainly do not disappoint.<p>Without the incredible kung-fu scenes and amazing chase sequences, &quot;Revolutions&quot; seems more like &quot;Aliens&quot; in a coma.  There is a pivotal thirty minute segement of the film in which Zion battles the machines, but the Wachowski brothers fail to cut back to Neo and his mates during the whole period.  These battles scenes are entertaining, but they are not what made the first two films enjoyable.  Obviously, the story is essential--but the script is so torn between either portraying this powerful, faithful metaphor of the Bible or emphasizing crazy, out-of-your-seats, karate-fighting, plane exploding, human flying, building-destroying outrageousness.<p>Overall, &quot;Revolutions&quot; is the weakest of the trilogy because of the Wachowski brothers' attempt to sneak in symbolism into a film series that was certainly entertaining enough without it.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; was filled with wonder and special effects, &quot;Reloaded&quot; had perhaps the best action sequence ever recorded on film, yet there is nothing that special or memorable about &quot;Revolutions&quot;.  It is not a film that is going to change a person's life or faith--it will satisfy those who are fans of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Just like so many third acts in film trilogies, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS loses the plot. Squandering a great opportunity for a satisfying conclusion while simultaneously destroying the original idea by nullifying the importance of the first. That's quite an accomplishment. Suffering from a lousy script, acting that threatens to redefine the term 'wooden' and so many frustrating Freudian overtones that it boggles the mind, one seriously now wonders if this whole idea was actually conceived as a three-part actioner rather than commercially-based money grabbing sequels tacked on to the first. RELOADED was a lame attempt at pretending it was a film on its own. We all knew it was merely two-hour exposition paving the way for REVOLUTIONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in. And it stank worse than Batman And Robin. However, with all that talk leading up to something, you would be right in assuming that the third film, like Lord Of The Rings was the ultimate payoff. Nope. Peter Jackson can actually direct and get good performances from his actors. Keanau Reeves' Neo gets more and more stilted and morose every minute, and the new supporting cast that were introduced in the second film are wasted in thankless roles here. There is less Oracle/Architect gibberish this time around, but that doesn't help much.<br />Regardless. the action should've made up its flaws. Note really; the battle of Zion is initially impressive and the CG is good, but it loses impact after some annoying overkill and suffers VERY badly from the oft-rumored 'battle fatigues' problem that is absent from STAR WARS and LOTR. All adding up to a distinctly naff trilogy that also tarnishes the first film. Shame on you Wazowskis. Booo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Ever since coming out of the movie theatre after seeing The Matrix: Reloaded, my mind had been thinking over and over about the possible great endings to such a phenomenon. I was thinking perhaps that the Wachowski brothers had purposely left us very on edge for a mind-blowing conclusion to this sci-fi epic. Well, very sadly, I was wrong. Friends of mine and I had increasing anticipation for Revolutions, expecting so much from it, which only made the end result even more depressing.<p>After both The Matrix and Reloaded, you thought that the brothers could not go wrong, they were able to create the story in 1999, sustain its mystique and action in May 2003, but have no idea how to end such a complex saga. Everything was perfect, even down to the soundtracks - you knew that they couldn't go wrong at this point. And it's such a shame that it all ended the way it did, I sat in my seat of the theatre just thinking &quot;that cannot be the end?!?! It can't be!&quot;, expecting there to be another scene of dialogue to explain absolutely everything, to give all the answers... but it never came. Instead, you got a very cliched ending, which would annoy every one of the hardcore Matrix fans out there - the philosophy had vanished, the amazing kung-fu sequences, and coolness of the all black look and sunglasses - all for a cold Zion and a dull feeling while watching the film. I regret for what I will write, I hate criticising this film because of the greatness of the first two but certain things have to be said. I had no idea that such an ending was coming.<p>Continuing exactly where Reloaded left off, you find both Neo and Agent Smith (in human form as Bane) in a coma, and the humans preparing for battle against the machines who are drilling their way through to Zion. Then you find Neo in a world between worlds - between the real world and the matrix, with you having no idea how he got there. The story then speaks for itself. With some poor pieces of dialogue, used ideas and too many special effects - Revolutions was nothing special compared to its predecessors. <p>The Matrix - all about those beautifully choreographed fight scenes, interesting philosophical conversation and the cool all black costumes: this was not to be in the third instalment. There are two, very brief hand-to-hand combat scenes (including the final showdown with Neo Vs Smith) and an overlong CGI sentinel battle, which was not what Matrix action sequences were about. Yes, have some gunfire and explosions, but you know it was really all about how much arse could be kicked by Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Impressive yes, but Revolutions did not really look, or even feel, like a Matrix movie. It didn't have any would-be favourite lines, memorable, yet inspirational lines by Morpheus, like the previous two films had. To put it simply, it just wasn't as enjoyable nor as gripping as the first or as action packed as the second. And the ending fight scene, the one we all had really been looking forward to, was a huge let down, especially coming from the Wachowski brothers - you get tired of too much flying and not enough actual fighting between the two men, it gets very confusing indeed. And Neo being &quot;The One&quot; certainly doesn't act it because he is made to look weak against Smith in the end. You were maybe thinking, &quot;Ok, this is what we have all been waiting for at last&quot; but, to put it simply, no. <p>Character development was another big factor in this film - there was none! The Merovigian, the comical French program, had only enough screen time to eat just three olives. You would have thought that this guy had a lot to do with the Matrix, as Reloaded had made him out to be an important, dangerous person, but his character is cut short in a very blunt way, you don't even find out who he is or what he does. And for his wife? In short - she has one line. Plus, too many new characters were introduced here, and took up way too much screen time and were insignificant to the story. Keanu Reeves was off screen for the majority of the film... and he's &quot;The One&quot;, the main character. And Morpheus? The producers had not only put a knife in Laurence Fisburne's back, but a bullet as well, as he had no real part in this film. His scenes were too short and he did not have enough lines to say.<p>I suppose visual effects really saved this film, as the plot spiralled out of control, becoming way too complex, even for the Wachowski's to comprehend - they either lost interest, ran out of special effects, or most likely ran out of ideas. They spent three months just designing the rain drops in the battle between Neo and Smith! That three months could have been spent on the ending at least, let alone the whole film itself. Which makes you wonder - why release both films in such a rush? It seems in the four years the spent making the two, all efforts were concentrated on trying to make Reloaded the great follow up success that it is, then only leaving just enough time to fit in two fight scenes and a sentinel attack for the third instalment. To be honest, I would have rather waited an extra year, perhaps even more, for a really good ending rather then a quickly put together climax, because I had favoured the strategy of leaving so many unanswered questions, a mystery - then for them to explain it all, end it completely in Revolutions. It never happened.<p>But now, as I and many others have witnessed, there will be an eternal disappointment and resentfulness to Revolutions and how great it could have been, I hope the Wachowski's realise this as much as we do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>it doesn't live up to the stunts that were performed in 1&2.

In this final installment of the "Neo Mythos" the war in Zion between man and machine is underway. As the resistance makes a last gallant stand against the mechanized onslaught, Neo attempts a perilous journey to the City of Machines in an effort to stop the violence once and for all.<br /><br />While the special effects continued to soar to higher and more complex levels of accomplishment, the dialogue clearly shows signs of weakness, lacking the terse, polished syntax of the first two films. However having said that it is still a worthy conclusion to the Neo saga.<br /><br />Thanks Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Agent Smith and the Wachowski brothers. It's been a fantastic adventure!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Let me tell you, I was in a grand funk after suffering through "The Matrix: Reloaded." I couldn't believe the Wachowski brothers took such a great idea and turned it into a lead balloon. The first Matrix entry was an ultraslick, hyperkinetic actioner that had me teetering on the edge of my seat for nearly its entire runtime. Everything clicked in "The Matrix," from the intriguing and well-developed characters to the underlying story to the shock and awe special effects. The film even managed to use the action scenes sparingly so as not to overshadow the other elements, something science fiction and thrillers rarely accomplish. Then came "Reloaded," and the gleaming gold of "The Matrix" rapidly turned into rusty iron. Turgid dialogue larded with enough philosophical mumbo jumbo to confound Plato reared its ugly head in nearly every scene. Lord Larry Fishburne, we quickly notice, is turning into this generation's Marlon Brando if the weight gain is any indication. And then there's the action sequences ramped up to insanely high levels. It's like the Wachowskis tried to outdo their own creation and instead created a film that should have bolts in its neck and green paint splashed on its face.<br /><br />It was with some trepidation that I hit the play button on "Revolutions."  I quickly realized I shouldn't have worried. While the film still boasts enough muttered hokum to make your eyes spin around in your head, it is actually quite suspenseful and entertaining. Even professional boat anchor Keanu Reeves can't completely sink this effort. We come into "Revolutions" with the impending attack of the machines on Zion looming like a dark cloud on the horizon. Neo's in trouble again, of course, and is trapped in some subway station between the world and the matrix. Fortunately, he has a cute Indian family and some sinister chap named the Trainman (Bruce Spence) to keep him company. Obviously he won't stay there long thanks to his buddies Trinity and Morpheus, who kick some serious you know what to get their boy back in the game. It's nice to see the sleek and sexy Carrie-Anne Moss return to her character's roots, that of a hard charging warrior who just happens to look great in black leather, even if it lasts for only a few minutes. Needless to say they manage to spring Neo from his subway platform prison, and not a moment to soon: Zion is gearing up to fend off the machines and they are going to need, as Tom Berenger's character in Platoon so nobly opined, "Every swinging d!ck out in the field."<br /><br />What follows when the machines punch through the domed ceiling of the city is my favorite part of the film. It's mindless action here, folks, as the CGI effects fly fast and furious. The defenders in the city climb into these giant robotic machines armed to the teeth with massive machine guns and await the attack. Zion doesn't wait long. Giant drills punch humongous holes in the ceiling, followed by trillions of those familiar probes from the first film. Every citizen lends a hand, especially the women. They run around in the pipes and ductwork armed with homemade rocket launchers picking off the sentinels. Meanwhile, Morpheus and Niobe race back to Zion in their ship in a desperate attempt to save the faltering city. Neo and Trinity accept a more difficult mission: flying one of the ships to Machine City in order to strike a most unusual deal. To say anymore about this top secret and desperate mission would spoil the surprise for the two people in the world who haven't seen the film yet. I can say that it involves yet another battle between the Smith clones and Neo. This time around, however, the effects in the showdown look much better than the laughable burly fight in "Reloaded." I cried at the film's conclusion--not because of anything that happened onscreen but because I realized Keanu Reeves would probably continue making movies.<br /><br />Seriously though, "Revolutions" was an all around better effort than the second installment. I was better able to weather the bouts of philosophical bunkum here than in "Reloaded." Too, the incredible, over the top CGI war effects helped make up for the huge plot holes--almost. For example, I complained about how the second film removed any sense of danger surrounding the Agent Smith character. In the first film no one dared to stand up to the agents, yet everyone takes a crack at them in "Reloaded." The same thing happens to the sentinels in "Revolutions." Weren't they supposed to be these fearsome, nearly indestructible machines? Then how come mere bullets and homemade rockets can knock them out of the air? For that matter, if humans can build giant robots that move around and respond to the movements of the soldier sitting inside, couldn't they find a way to automatically load the guns instead of having kids tote boxes of ammo around on giant carts? Seems awfully inefficient to me. Anyway, you probably won't think about these conundrums as you watch the combat sequences; you'll be far too busy trying to take in all the amazing effects. I should have gone to see this one at the theater.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that the Matrix trilogy is a failure. The first movie will stand for years as a masterful epic, much the way Lucas's original "Star Wars" remains an epochal film, but "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" cannot keep up the pace. Considering the diminishing relevancy of the Star Wars franchise, perhaps the Matrix series is in better company than I thought. I wonder if the Wachowskis will revisit this idea ten or twenty years down the road just as Lucas did?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Not as good or as mind blowing as the original, but way better than Reloaded. There is more action in this film than the first two combined. The ceiling shootout at the Club Hell, the 20 minute epic battle against the machines, and of course Neo's final rain-soaked confrontation with Agent Smith are great and worth admission price alone. If you were dissappointed with Reloaded, don't give up hope just yet.

Keanu Reeves, returns, of course, as Neo, The One and possible savior of Zion. Neo is in a coma, which, strangely, doesn't look like a coma because his brain patterns are different than a person in a coma, unfortunately. Laurence Fishburne, is, back as, Morpheus, the man with all the ideas. He believes in Neo, because of what he can do. Carrie-Anne Moss is, of course, back as, Trinity, who would give her life to save Neo. Neo is trapped between the machine world and the real world, unfortunately, by the Merovingian, played again, by Lambert Wilson. The Oracle, this time, played by Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster, is back, too. As is, Agent Smith, played, with sheer brilliance, by Hugo Weaving, who has never looked better in a performance like this, unfortunately. Niobe, played again, by Jada Pinkett Smith, is back, as well. This is also an appearance by the Architect, played again by, Helmut Bakaitis. The rest of the cast from "The Matrix Reloaded" returns as well, too. This is an brilliant movie with brilliant ideas and thoughts in its brain, a little more than "The Matrix Reloaded". It doesn't have that many fight scenes as its first two processors did, unfortunately, it is brilliant, nonetheless. The score by Don Davis, is a triumph in itself and it is one of the best scores heard this year so far. The directing by The Wachowski Brothers, is superb and dynamic, but it is also brilliant, too. The Costume Design by Kym Barrett is excellent. The Production Design by Owen Patterson is wonderful without compromise. The Cinematography by Bill Pope is superb. The Film Editing by Zach Staenberg is dynamic. The Screenplay, also by, the Wachowski Brothers, is excellent and superb, without compromise. The Visual Effects is brilliant as its first two processors, and it shapes the filmmaking of tomorrow's newest talents as "The Matrix Reloaded" did. Go see this movie now and try to see it again, if possible. It is a visionary achievement that shall be remembered for all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>For one thing, see this movie now while it is in theatres. I am pretty sure all the mind-numbing action will not have half the effect when played off a DVD. For another, no point reading too many of the partisan reviews, The Matrix franchise never had the unanimous universal appeal badge after its first film. <p>But since this is a review, I need to offer my personal take. <p>The first Matrix, a fab concept executed with unprecedented  pizzazz, was a colossal hit because of its novel concept -- it let your mind ponder the extent of the concept. "Reloaded" dug into the story and complicated things further, which was a mixed bag as far as I am concerned, but still left me anticipating an ending I was sure would blow me away.<p>Having seen this third installment, I just feel gyped. I guess anyone who anxiously awaited this release will know exactly what I mean. It's almost like the Wachowskis sat down to review the first two movies and said, "Hey, too much character development and story. Now let's get down to the nitty gritty, and start shooting". There's more bazooka-toting characters here than you'd find in a crude Japanese anime, and the whole ambience is very hasty as if time was running out to rake in the dollars from the movie making. <p>So, personally, I am a bit disappointed and seek consolation in the knowledge that when the DVDs do become available as a Criterion trilogy or something, the first movie alone will carry the entire Matrix family.<p>Nevertheless, if you manage your expectations, this third part makes for some fast-action weekend popcorn if that's your thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>Like many fans of &quot;The Matrix&quot; saga, I was disappointed the first time I saw &quot;Revolutions&quot; and I only gave it 3 stars in my first review here. But after seeing it again in the theaters and yet again now on DVD my opinion has changed. I think this final installment is in fact a satisfying conclusion. I'm not saying that it's perfect; there are still some thing which I think could have been done differently and I still think the ending could have been more than what it was. But on the other hand, did we really expect it to end in a much different way than it did? Many complaints about the ending here say that it's too &quot;Hollywood.&quot; Well, have we forgotten that this IS a Hollywood production? I think many people were expecting &quot;Revolutions&quot; to be a lot better than &quot;Reloaded&quot; and maybe this is another reason for the large percentage of those who didn't like it. But remember that &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot; are actually only one movie, literally cut in half. So those who were disappointed with &quot;Reloaded&quot; in actuality shouldn't have thought that they would like &quot;Revolutions&quot; any better. It's things like these which have caused me to rethink my opinion of &quot;Revolutions.&quot; <p>Now to the DVD itself. It pretty much follows the same layout as &quot;Reloaded&quot; in terms of the interactive menus, etc. But the actual bonus content is MUCH better than what &quot;Reloaded&quot; offered, at least in my opinion. The bonus materials of &quot;Reloaded&quot; were adequate but seemed a little rushed and disjointed. But &quot;Revolutions&quot; offers some excellent goodies to the ones who want to see what happens behind the scenes. Although I have some idea of how a movie is made, I was completely blown away with the behind-the-scenes footage on the making of the special effects (not only the CGI) and the painstaking work that was involved in making this movie (again, not only in terms of CGI). For example, it shows how they created all the Agent Smith clones using dummies and a rubber mold taken from Hugo Weaving's head. Seeing all this behind-the-scenes features has given me an even greater respect for the special effects (which you must admit are in fact spectacular, whether you liked or disliked the movie). Another great bonus feature is an in-depth look at the Super Burly Brawl. It lets you view it from 3 different perspectives in order to see exactly how it was filmed.<p>All in all, this is definitely a DVD worth buying. Yes, I know about the inevitable box set trilogy that will have tons more bonus material, deleted scenes, etc. But for now these individual releases offer more than enough to satisfy the everyday fan.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>NOT ONLY IS THIS 3RD AND FINAL (?)

One thing Joel Silver did right is the decision about the release date, for without that, people would be informed how awful this 'Revolutions' was.<br /><br />The story starts again where the 'Reloaded' ended.  And what comes then after that first sequel, which suggested many mysteries and plots going on?  Nothing memorable.  Keanu's Neo is trapped somewhere, a certain place like a subway station, where 'The Trainman' appears.  What does HE do?  Nothing.  What does Neo do to escape from there?  Nothing.  What does Monica Bellucci do in this new sequel?  Nothing (except for saying a line or two, I guess). The fate of Trinity and Neo?  Well, both look as if they lost interest in the film itself.  And someone please tell me, who was that guy with French accent?<br /><br />Well, I am not exaggerating, and the things go on and on in this way.  Yes, the city of Zion, the key element which should be one of the culminating points of the film, is in danger, threatened by the armies of lethal machines.  OK, but most of the main characters are removed from the scene, so we experience less emotions about the fatal battle, which should be more 'life-or-death' matter to the characters.<br /><br />The battle between Neo and Agent Smith is tedious, not because of the CGIs, but exactly because those CGIs.  In the original, we are impressed with the fact that Keanu Reeves could do the kung-hu fighting; here, we are supposed to be impressed with Neo flying in the air, or lots (yes, lots) of sneering Agent Smiths.  The ho-hum effects end up with the repetitious fights that seems to refuse to end.<br /><br />Not everything is bad, I admit.  The battle of the City of Zion is certainly gripping (though too long).  Jada Pinkett Smith gives terrific acting.  But what I could remember is only this -- the tame, cop-out ending, which suggests more sequels to come.<br /><br />'The Matrix Revolutions' is a good proof that there are limits for creative energy for any humans, even if you spent as much money as possible.  Sorry if I sound cruel, but that's the truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>The biggest mistake the Wachowski brothers made with The Matrix Revolutions was assuming the audience had emotionally latched onto the characters after the first two films, when in fact they had not. True Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are interesting, but the heart of Matrix fandom lies with the intricate philosphical constructs the films created. Matrix Reloaded had philosphical elements, which kept audience interest despite the film's weak plot line. Revolutions, on the other hand, is a pure sci-fi action flick. It asks us to care about the supporting characters in Zion, when we really don't know them that well. As a result the film is a visual feast of impressive special effects, but it feels very empty in the middle.<br /><br />What also hurt is that Revolutions splits up the lead characters, with Morpheus given little to do than play co-pilot for the finale. Potentially interesting characters like Persephone and the Merovingian disappear early on in the first act. And Agent Smith becomes the end boss for the movie because movies like these need end bosses.<br /><br />There are two dvd editions available; this 2-disc set, and a huge Matrix collection that contains all the films and bucketloads of bonus material. The bonus material on this set is already pretty decent. If you're not a huge fan but still want to own the movies, this set will fit your collection well.<br /><br />Not exactly how the Matrix should've ended, but still a good popcorn flick when you're bored.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The original Matrix very nearly defined a whole new visual style in moviemaking. Its successor, Reloaded, seemed perfunctory after that - the same again, with the volume turned up. This third Matrix rises nearly to the level of the first Matrix's novelty.<br /><br />Novelty, by definition, can't be a repetition. This time, it comes from a pervasive combination of live action with computer animation. The animation is outstanding - hugely complex scenes, with hundreds or thousands of separate robotic characters. The dim-lit, robotic cityscapes create a grim sense of scale and majesty. Best, though, was what the director chose not to animate, the human figures. Animation can't yet produce the subtlety and expression of human actors, so no attempt was made to synthesize them. Instead, elaborate compositing combined real actors with computer-graphic sets and props. It's the best, and certainly the most complex example to date of the merged techniques. Enjoyable extras on the second disk show how the actors played their parts in this movie - showing that acting is a whole different craft than it used to be.<br /><br />This is a definite end to the Matrix franchise, a satisfying resolution of the basic conflict that's driven the series. I guess there's still room for prequels and such. Any sequels would have to have such different premises from this trilogy that they'd hardly be recognizable. I'm very glad to see the series end on such a high note.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>We know from our indoctrination into the philosophy of the Matrix movies that there are two worlds: one is the waking dream that is the "Matrix", a world generated by the Machines to keep us shackled in illusion while we're used as living batteries. Tne second world is that of the Desert of the Real: you have no job. You have no cubicle. You have no rent-controlled apartment with a nosy landlord.<br /><br />Everything you see before you, all the "evidence" of your senses, is an ambitious fraud: you are kept in a cocoon, envatted in a snare of pink fluid and dreams, convinced you live and walk and talk and breathe the air of a free man in a free society.<br /><br />In other words: the Real, and the Illusory. The Wachowski Brothers have made a great flick technically (ie: the realm of the illusory): they have stormed the ramparts of what great cinema should look like, and---who knows?---stormed the ramparts of how movies should be made.<br /><br />They have also churned out a flick that betrays the rich ideas of the first film. In the same spirit, and because it is unfair to "Matrix Revolutions" to judge it according to either its technical flair or its philosophical limitations, I shall provide a rare dual review, also in keeping with the dual realities of the Matrix.<br /><br />MATRIX REVIEW(The World of Illusion): 5 stars out of 5. My God this movie looks great! This flick cost 150 million smackers to make, and every penny---every red cent---of that budget is up on the screen! Look at the dual, perhaps triplicate, realities the Wachowskis have conjured up: the slick, techno, ephemeral, ghost-green world of the Matrix, green-hued, lorded over by the fast-talking Merovingian, the consummate Rabbit hole-within-Rabbit-hole. So gorgeous it makes you wish you'd taken the Blue Pill. Maybe there's still time?<br /><br />Anyway, the flick looks amazing. Even if you're disgusted with it, pop it back into the hopper, and look at the thing! Look at the ropy steel-and-red-burning-laser-eye contraptions of the Sentinels, or the gigantic drill that burrows through the rooftop to Zion and then plummets to the floor of the cavern below! This is simply one of the greatest, most hyper-kinetic action flicks ever filmed; the fear in the Great Hall when the battle mechas confront the swarming sentinel reeks of war and sweat and death and fear. I love it!<br /><br />Classic. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith (the great Hugo Weaving in his generation-defining, massively quoted role) is one for the ages: the rain, the generic cityscape, the rows and rows and rows of Agent Smiths watching from the streets, from the windows of the otherwise vacant office buildings. Brrrr.<br /><br />ZION REVIEW(The Desert of the Real): 1 out of 5 Stars. Blah! Desert of the Real is right: great characters from "The Matrix" go through the motions: Neo (Keanu Reeves)sleepwalks through his role, Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) looks like he's about ready to call out for a pizza---someone should have budgeted for Fishburne a personal trainer, or at the least put the big guy on the Atkins diet.<br /><br />Trinity (the nimble Carrie Anne Moss) provides earnest eye candy. Neo (Keanu Reeves) does his Neo-thang. Nothing is resolved. Heretical yet intriguing theories provoked by "Matrix Reloaded" (the "Matrix-within-a-Matrix" theory suggested by Neo's ability to stop the sentinels in the "real" world) are nodded to and then ignored. Yes, the trailer promised us great things---"It all ends tonight"---but we get zero delivery. The huge questions---does any of this matter? Is Zion Real?---are ignored.<br /><br />Alright. Real World: 1 Star. Matrix World: (all the CGI goodies and cinematic wizardry): 5 Stars. Listen to Hugo Weaving's dialogue; Weaving, as Agent Smith/Bane, completely owns this movie and gives it its black wicked heart. Bully to him! Sample the raw sheer audacious techno style of the Merovingian (the incomparable Lambert Wilson), who found French to be the superlative language of the Insult.<br /><br />Ogle Monica Belluci (the luscious Persephone), who just looks ripe. Wonder how Harvard law prof and Ivy League resident crackpot ever bribed the Wachowskis to be in this movie. Just don't expect any answers, deep meaning, or conclusions. What, you thought you'd find the meaning of Life in a blockbuster flick? Sheesh.<br /><br />It's stylish, it's wicked black, it bumps and grinds, it's pretty cool. Ultimately it answers none of the questions. Do you care? Take the Blue Pill! Take the Red Pill! You'll find that with "Matrix Revolutions" it makes no difference.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; continues the story begun in the original &quot;Matrix&quot; film.  Once again Keanu Reeves plays cybermessiah Neo, who fights to defend humanity against an enslaving machine collective.<p>&quot;Revolutions&quot; effectively expands upon the compelling mythology established in the original film, as the freedom fighters continue to move between the gritty real world and a complex virtual reality construct.  Much of the film is a relentless orgy of violence and explosions--at times it's just too much and becomes exhausting.  Nevertheless, there are a number of genuinely thrilling and inventive action/fight scenes.  There are also some memorable visual images.<p>At its worst &quot;Revolutions&quot; can be bombastic, obscure, pretentious, and even corny.  The film is at its best when it remains in touch with the essential humanity of its characters.  Reeves anchors the eclectic, multiethnic ensemble cast with his earnest, understated performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Matrix: *****<br />Matrix Reloaded: ***<br />Matrix Revolutions: **<p>Before I address this review we must see the trilogy as a whole. The difference between Reloaded and the original is that the original had more of an indie film feel with a novel premise. Reloaded cashed in by giving us better special effects with less story. Revolutions gives us less special effects, less story and some sort of a justification finale.<p>Revolutions has its problems from the onset. The story is derived directly from Reloaded with little emphasis on the original movie. There are too many characters from Reloaded given a way too much screen time in Revolutions and other characters from Reloaded are simply omitted (The Twins), dealt with too briefly (Morpheus, The Architect) or forgotten about in the course of the movie (The Trainman). Some characters are even changed (the oracle is replaced because of the original actresses death.) New characters are introduced but they have very little bearing on the story. So what is it all about? <p>The truth is that Revolutions is just plain crap. It is served along with Reloaded as an "enjoy the special effects... but that is all there is to it." type of film. The effects in Reloaded are better. The center action piece in Revolutions revolves around the machines attacking Zion with "Aliens" type robot units manned by soldiers fighting them off. The other action sequence is the fight between Neo and Agent Smith which is not nearly as good as the one in the original movie.<p>The film does not end too badly but it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. Bottom line is that you should go to see it but it really is not a very good blockbuster movie by a long shot. (...)<p>Fans will not be too happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?  As with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS one can be decently satisfied with the one aspect, which is decent enough to like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The third film finally gives the secret. For one, it is probably slightly better as for the fights because they are more in the air and that makes them look like surreal comic strip fights. The technique is superb and the cameras are sublime. There is not one strange and normally never used shooting angle that is not used at a moment or other in the shooting of these fights. For two, the machines are brilliant. Of course we all think of Aliens because some of the fighting equipment looks a lot like what we had in Aliens. But the beings, the machines, the mechanical fighters are absolutely unique and they look both very elegant like some giant sea creatures Octopuses maybe but with so many more legs. Machinecity is also great with the allusion to these machines not being able to live in the sunshine. Follow my eyes and read my lips. H. G. Wells is not very far with his time-traveller. The will to show schools of them flying or floating through the air makes these creatures more computer animated and governed because they get involved in some pretty heavy mass movement. But that's great. The master machine is given some kind of a human face and voice, why not since machines are born slaves and slaves imitate their masters. But this meeting with the master machine finally leads us to the real meaning of this saga. But before getting to that it is important to speak of the characterization of the main characters : they look human, they are very expressive in their faces and gestures. They do have the face and body language they need to make us believe we are in real danger. But of course, the main point of them all is the meaning the way it comes up. The machines not more than the humans want to go on with the war that is supposed to destroy the human race. It becomes very clear that the matrix was planned and produced by some human minds in order to make human life ever better than what it had ever been by giving all the dirty and heavy work to machines all maintained and locked up in Machineville. This idea is typically western in thinking, even though it is implied that humans being what they are doomsday is possible everyday of the week. It is a rewriting of H.G. Wells' Time Machine. Actual working and producing was the task of an underground race living in darkness. The change is that these producers are here machines and nothing but machines. The human race then can have it easy at enjoying life. That's a change from H.G. Wells again because for him daytime humans had become unable to do anything except enjoy living and being hunted by the underground species like wild animals or rather submissive cattle. What went wrong is that a special species of men have taken over the control of both human and machine worlds for their own interest and somewhere pleasure. They have highjacket the computer program that is behind the Matrix. The fight then takes place between Neil, aka Mr Andersen, and Agent Smith. Agent Smith has the power to clone himself into any other human being. So he has become an army and he controls the world and he has decided to get rid of the human race. Against him an Oracle, a black human woman who knows more or less what is going to happen, and Neil who has special powers too and can stop Agent Smith, but no more than stop. So he has to trap him into a common ending, a common death because he has to destroy himself if he wants to destroy the fascist. The rest is for you to discover. Very effective. So the world can survive for an unspecified period of time. Peace has been concluded through this final sacrifice. Here we have some good old Christian allusions. First of all the long cassock looking robes he is wearing, our Neil. Second his sacrifice for the survival of humanity. But there will be no resurrection, no rebirth of the world because his girl friend dies before him. No Mary Madgalene secret. And then there will be no surviving procreating couple to reinvent humanity. Humanity has been saved for a while. No Apocalypse. But a victory in the war against the machine like in Frank Herbert, but the machines are not destroyed, the equilibrium of this mechanized world is not changed, there is no promise of a saviour one day. The Christian allusion is thus reduced to a dire minimum. The meaning is also reduced to a dire minimum : for humanity to go on enjoying life we have to get rid of all machines, productive work and pollution far away from us and we have to have a few courageous and inspired warriors that are ready to sacrifice their lives for humanity to go on living. In other words good old traditional patriotic courage. That does not make this trilogy the piece of imagination that will revolutionize the world, but it is an entertaining film. And if you really get into it try to identify all the allusions to Stephen King's novels. I can tell you there are many.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"The Matrix" burst on the scene with mind-boggling special effects and a witty reality-versus-perception theme that justified those amazing special effects.  A top-notch cast worked with a script that had just enough spirituality associated wtih it that viewers didn't consider "The Matrix" just another dumb action movie.  At the end, the possibilities of "The Matrix" seemed limitless -- and the conjectures regarding where this storyline could lead were almost as entertaining as the movie itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequels bogged down, both in the attempt to top the action scenes of the original, and by the simple truth that by advancing the storyline, the sequels eliminated our ability to speculate where "The Matrix" was headed.  Just like "The Blair Witch Project" was so scary because we didn't really know or see what was going on, the possibilities of Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity battling against Agent Smith and the machines were more exciting in their unknown state than they could ever be in an actual story.<br /><br />The creative forces behind "The Matrix" cannot be accused of failing to delve deeper into the storyline.  By the time "The Matrix Revolutions" came around, we had gone so far beyond the first movie as to make it almost unrecognizable.  Indeed, I had a hard time even figuring out who the villains of "Revolutions" are -- is Neo most concerned about the machines, or the Merovingian, or the Trainman, or the assassin going after him in Zion . . . and what the hell is Agent Smith doing anyway?  And what about the Architect?  Just who is the Oracle, anyway?<br /><br />I'm sure there are those who have explored every website, fan fiction storyline, and utterance of those who created the Matrix mythology who understand this complicated storyline.  But I merely watched the movies, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of the story after a while.<br /><br />Fortunately, "The Matrix Revolutions" is one of the most enjoyable movies to watch I have ever seen (based on purely visual terms).  The machines eventually breach the human stronghold of Zion, and what unfolds is a battle of machine versus man (who, to be fair, uses machines) that astounds the eye and also strikes a few notes of pathos.  We see sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds, and while we may not entirely understand what that sacrifice is for in precise terms, it is clear that these people are sacrificing their own lives for the greater humanity.  And that is enough.<br /><br />After the climax of this battle, Neo and Agent Smith have their much-ballyhooed mano-y-machino fisticuffs.  Please don't ask me to explain why this is the climactic fight, or even who really wins, but the visuals are undeniably amazing.<br /><br />The movie ends on an optimistic yet ambiguous note . . . will the War between man and machine continue?  Well, the problem is that since we're dealing with a storyline about futuristic computers and perception-versus-reality, there is nothing stopping the creators of "The Matrix" to spit out innumerable sequels that continually reexamine the same illogical themes.<br /><br />Well, the only speedbump is probably movie studio finances.  It's a troubling trilogy that concludes with a sense of, "We'll be right back here, provided the accountants can do a favorable cost-benefit analysis."<br /><br />"The Matrix Revolutions" ultimately goes out with a whimper rather than a bang . . . a spectacular, dizzying whimper, to be sure, but a whimper nevertheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>THIS TIME, NEO AND HIS FRIENDS MUST STOP THE MACHINES FROM POSSIBLY INVADING AND DESTROYING ZION BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

There ain't none!  It would be like comparing apples to potatoes.  It just doesn't work.  What we have in the Matrix Trilogy is a new benchmark in the scifi world.  There has never been anything like it.  As with an artichoke, one must peel back each layer because there are many.  It requires the viewer to watch it more than once or even twice.  The Matrix requires some actual thought unlike other films that do the thinking for you.  Everything is on the screen.  No need to think.  The average moviegoer has become lazy.  When a picture like this comes along we don't understand it.  It appears not to make sense, hence we don't understand what we're seeing.  Hence the bad reviews that many folks have dished out.  We don't want to work for our entertainment.  We just want to take the "blue pill" and be told that we are being entertained.<br /><br />It is for this reason that I emplore you not only to view the Matrix Trilogy for the first time but many times after that.  As I have stated in my reviews of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, I too have had to watch it more than twice because I didn't think much of them at first viewing.  But having seen them all many times over now I have turned into the biggest Matrix fan I know.  There are those of you who know nothing about computers and you may surely become confused but not to worry.  Just find the nearest computer geek and he/she will explain all.<br /><br />There are those out there that have practically turned this trilogy into a religion all on it's own.  I dare say, you need not go that far.  There are elements in the film that correlate with the story of Jesus and the Wachowski brothers state that this was intentional.  I don't know what the rationale was behind that decision but whatever it was, it clicks with the audiences.  Pastors are breaking the film down and showing pieces of it to their congregations, philosophers debate it and the great thinkers of our time are expressing their views about meaning behind The Matrix.<br /><br />(Beware of Spoilers below)<br /><br />This movie concludes the trilogy with the death of Trinity and Neo and the end of the war between man and machine.  The Oracle told Neo that he or Morpheus would die in the first film.  And so it came to pass.  Neo so loved Trinity that he could not imagine life without her.  That is one of the reasons  why he fought so hard against the machine world.  He could not be separated from her.  With her death however, he was now able to sacrifice himself for Zion.  Perhaps he did not even want to live without her.  It just so happened that the plan he and the oracle had would benefit Zion so perhaps his death was not as self-sacrificing as it appeared to be.  What would he have done if  Trinity had lived?<br /><br />While this film does mimic the story of Jesus it also (I'm sorry to say) mocks Him at the same time.  His name is constantly used in vain as a swear word.  Unfortunately, it does bother those of us who worship the Lord.  It could send mixed messages to those who are not spiritually educated in these matters but that's why Christians should view this film.  It's our job to point out certain items and educate.  It's very important to use the vehicles that we can use to minister.  Many people will not see the Jesus story here because they don't know it.<br /><br />The basic concept of The Matrix is so new that it boggles the mind.  Humans being cultivated and used as an alternative source of power for a machine world.  Some humans want freedom and others are content to remain in the matrix.  Those who fight the matrix await the coming of a savior (foretold by Morpheus-a John the Baptist sort of character) who has the ability to save them.  Imagine that your life and all that you knew was only a dreamworld that the matrix cooked up for you.  In reality you are being kept in a vat of liquid, connected to cables, unable to speak or see, suppling the machine world with the power it needs to exist.  Humans are no longer born but grown by the machines.  Brilliant concept!  I'm surprised that no one thought of it sooner in this age of the computer. The Matrix is almost like a living super hero comic for adults.<br /><br />Please give this trilogy a chance.  This is the movie that all future scifi will be measured against.  If you miss it then you'll wonder where all the new scifi came from.  Just as Star Wars broke ground in it's day, now we have The Matrix which has broken new ground.  No matter what comes next in the Star Wars saga, Star Wars is dead.  Long live The Matrix!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2 "The Matrix Revolutions" is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were "The Matrix" and "The Matrix Reloaded."  In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.<br /><br />Of the three films, "Revolutions" is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting.  What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities.  The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for "Revolutions," which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme.  In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled "Finding Neo").  The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence  After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by.  Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from "Revolutions" - which we did from the two previous "Matrix" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which "Revolutions" very nearly is.  Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.<br /><br />Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.</p></br></body></html>

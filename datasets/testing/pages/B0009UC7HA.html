But if you do that, you should be cool with it. Despite the enviro-theme and dastardly, greedy corporations polluting the African continent (or part thereof), this isn't a political thriller. It has the save-the-planet message for good measure and to add a layer of the less-than-trivial, but ultimately it's a from-here-to-there-and-back-again action flick. My entire family, consisting of all grown-ups, enjoyed it. What more can you ask for, really?<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>"Sahara" is the film adaptation of Cussler's mildly-successful book "Sahara," based on the adventures of Dirk Pitt, a poor man's James Bond who goes through life one adventure at a time and always seems to find some long lost treasure at the end of the book.  As a stand-alone film, "Sahara" is a lot like "National Treasure" and "The Mummy." It can be very cheesy and there are way to many coincidences (Pitt wanders through the Saharan Desert and just happens to come up on Eva getting attacked a second time), but if you can suspend your disbelief, you will probably enjoy it as an entertaining popcorn-flick.<br /><br />If you're a Clive Cussler fan you may have problems though. I can understand why Cussler did not want to be associated with this film.  It is only loosely based on his book.  Of course films always have to change books when doing film adaptations, but only a few of the main ideas were kept for the film, and the biggest flaw is that the characters of Pitt and Giordino were horribly mis-cast.  Pitt is supposed to be an "ordinary-looking" man, not People Magazine's Sexiest Man of the Year.  McConaughey comes across too much like a stereotypical surfer-Keanu Reeves type.  Al Giordino appears to be changed into the bumbling idiot sidekick, a role very similar to the sidekicks in "National Treasure" and "The Mummy."  The only other major flaw with the film is the soundtrack, which sounds like it was thrown together by the staff of the Today Show and is a weird mix of classic rock songs that don't seem to make much sense (eg, Pitt and Giordino are driving down the Niger river in their boat and the movie blasts into Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" for no reason.)<br /><br />Overall, if you're a big Cussler fan and you're approaching this film as your chance to see one of your favorite protagonists realized on screen, you will be disappointed.  However if you're watching Sahara as a mindless way to kill two hours, it's not too bad of a film, and will likely keep you entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I have not yet read any of Clive Cussler's novels, but given how vehemently his fans are insisting that his books are so much better than this movie I will have to check them out because this movie is pretty good (and Cussler signed off on the script and the casting, which certainly undercuts complaints about the same).  Of course, any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie).  Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up.  Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.<br /><br />"Sahara" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy.  It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask "how," because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score).  Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes.  Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region.  However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson).  Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent.  Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.<br /><br />These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner ("Thoughtcrimes").  The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the "Panama," which comes relatively early in the film.  I want to ask, "Whatever happened to saving the best for last?" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in "Raiders of the Lost Arc," so why should that happen here?  Granted, "Sahara" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than "National Treasure," probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).<br /><br />Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film.  I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film.  For me the end result is that "Sahara" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety.  But if you want more, then look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>SAHARA is one of those films to view when escapism is the goal of the evening.  Made along the same lines as the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' genre, mixing adventure with comedy, a smattering of love interest, a dollop of social comment, and some pretty fine scenery that creates a stage for likeable actors such as  Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy, Delroy Lindo, and Lambert Wilson, SAHARA succeeds in pulling off an interesting caper film.<br /><br />Not having read the apparently sacrosanct novel by Clive Cussler upon which the film is based, this 2 hour plus film seemed to putt along without any great shakes, without much in the way of character development, without any hint of screen chemistry between Cruz and McConaughey, but with the surprise pleasure of watching Steve Zahn steal the scenes with his comic talent. It is that kind of film - not to be taken seriously or valued higher than its intent.  It is just entertainment - and there is nothing wrong with that!  Grady Harp, August 05</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Matthew McConaughey (Dazed and Confused, Reign Of Fire, EDTV) and Steve Zahn (Suburbia, HappyTexas, JoyRide) play Dirk and Al, two treasure seeking guys who set out a journey to find a ancient civil war ship with a treasure of gold coins and Penelope Cruz (Woman On Top, Vanilla Sky, Blow) plays a doctor sent to Mali in which people are being poisoned. Some pretty good action sequences boosted by the 2 male leads' lively performances. William H. Macy (Cellular, Boogie Nights,Focus), Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, Timeline), Patrick Malahide and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty, The One, Broken Arrow) also star. Much funner and better then National Treasure, though in this one they should of trimmed the time down a bit...the time kept on dragging but still its a good action/adventure movie chock full but not the best. Based on the bestselling book by author Clive Clussler.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Dirk Pitt. Adventure has a new name? - so reads the tagline, and to be honest it's about time something new came along to replace the likes of Indiana Jones, and James Bond (against whom it is difficult not to draw comparisons). Matthew McConaughy is suitably charming and buffed as the handsome adventurer / treasure hunter alongside Steve Zahn's able but bewildered sidekick Al, in this global trek to find a phantom Iron Clad ship from the civil war that has somehow ended up in Africa. This obssession of Pitt's of course enrages his sponsor and employer Admiral Sandecker (superb casting William H Macy)who outwardly only tolerates his best asset but cares with a veiled admiration. The crew happen to be in Africa of course on another salvage operation, when they get a whiff of the Iron Clads possible location, but things take a turn however, when they must intervene to save Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is on the run from the local warring factions after discovering illegal toxic dumping. The threeway escapade takes off with plenty of high jinks, action and adventure in a wholesome but believable way which is both refreshing and entertaining. Clive Cusslers novel may not have been represented to the satisfaction of the puritan fans, but the sober undertones of the story and one or two serious moments, do much to help keep this light romp on the ground. More than a buddy movie (although many cliches are apparent) this is a good contemporary story, and McConnaughy represents an ideal Action Icon for a modern audience. The reasonable success of the picture will undoubtedly pave the way for a myriad of sequels, but for now sit down, grab the popcorn and enjoy some old fashioned action and fun brought bang up to date. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I had seen national treasure, and was not about to be mislead by the critics again. This movie was awesome, "hear that LEONARD?" It had a great story, great acting, great special effects. It also had a love story, humor, and non stop, in you face action.<br /><br />Two Thumbs, all the way up.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Sahara is a movie about finding a treasure ship in the middle of the Sahara desert. Once you get over that implausible sounding premise, you have a fine and very fun movie.<br /><br />The stars are personable and humorous in their roles, the action is exciting, and you lose yourself in the story very quickly. Of course, the book is another chip off the ol' Indiana Jones block, and therefore most of what you see is pretty derivative. Considering that the majority of movies are derivative though, what is important is if you enjoy it. If you like most McConaughey movies, you'll like this one. If you don't particularly like the average McConaughey vehicle, give this a pass.<br /><br />The DVD presentation is solid. Both picture and sound are good.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The producers of Sahara might have done well to have considered how well the previous attempt to bring one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels to the screen went before pouring a hundred or so million dollars into it even before Cussler launched an ill-fated lawsuit against the end product. While it's not as dull as Raise the Titanic, it didn't exactly set the box-office on fire let alone kickstart a new Indiana Jones-style franchise about the maritime treasure hunter that the studio so desperately wanted. It's not that hard to figure out why. Matthew "Naked Bongos" McConaughey and Penelope Cruz make for an unsurprisingly bland pair of leads, not helped by a plodding script that, after a terrific prologue in the American Civil War, pretty much traipses along with only a single boat chase to hold your attention until an action-packed last half hour finally wakes the film up. The outlandish premise - McConaughey's hunting a Civil War ironclad ship in the Sahara desert while Cruz is tracking the source of a new disease that threatens to poison the continent and beyond - works rather better than it should and the film's other MaGuffin, a solar-powered toxic waste disposal plant, must have had the Bond people kicking themselves that they didn't think of it first, but not well enough to make up for the lack of any chemical reactions among the cast. Perfectly watchable but also perfectly forgettable stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Yes, Sahara does take place in the same universe as the monumental flop Raise the Titanic, a universe where the Titanic sunk in one piece. Keep your eyes open during the opening credits and you'll see a newspaper clipping of the ship being towed into New York.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey takes over the role of Dirk Pitt from Richard Jordan (whoever he is) and teams up with Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruise for a film that should offer much more action and excitement than Raise the Titanic offered. It's doesn't really succeed.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordino are professional divers/explorers who sneak off from their ordinary salvage duties to find a legendary ship packed full of treasure in a warn-torn part of Africa. Penelope Cruz is a W.H.O. doctor (I could have made a joke there) investigating a series of mysterious deaths and ends up on the wrong side of a local dictator/warlord. Naturally Pitt saves her and is rewarded with loads of foot-soldiers out to kill him.<br /><br />The treasure hunt/ecology plot could have been entertaining but nothing really amazing happens. It could have worked as an Indiana Jones-lite but it's completely free of any of the iconic or classic scenes that make that franchise so famous. What we get is a lightweight James Bond kind of film with no real edge or excitement. The anonymous direction doesn't help either and the whole thing seems to drag along rather than being a breathless ride.<br /><br />None of this is the fault of the actors. McConaughey and Zahn are watchable as always, though I would have liked to have seen William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo given more to do. Since, I've never read any of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I cannot compare but whoever adapted the novel of Sahara into the screenplay forgot to put anything resembling spectacle or epic into it.<br /><br />Sahara is good for a single viewing only. There's nowt in here that make you come back for more. Which is rather worrying since Paramount bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. They ought to make them better than this, but it's still superior to the similarly plotted National Treasure.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with not-too-spectacular Dolby 5.1 sound design.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>It is always dissapointing to see what COULD have been a great film go down in flames....<br /><br />I have never read the Cussler novel so can only view the film on its own merit.<br /><br />The opening scenes in Richmond looked like this would be a great film........ then........UGHHHHHH  it got real bad real fast.<br /><br />3 major problems....<br /><br />1) Penelope Cruz<br /><br />She is simply horrible and annoying in anything she does.<br /><br />2) Too much stupid humor<br /><br />Will Hollywood EVER make a straight adventure film again without it seeming like a big comedy romp ?<br /><br />It is so old seeing the straight guy and the goofy sidekick overdone once again.<br /><br />3) A soundtrack of classic songs which unfortunatley did not match the film at all !<br /><br />As a serious adventure this would have been a great 4-5 stars.... as it is, it was a bad waste of effort, ruined mostly do to it's overdone silliness and casting of the terrible Penelope Cruz.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>Not fully engaging, but pleasant to watch. Alot of sunshine in this film. Great locations, passable but not inspiring direction, likeable but watered-down characters, action is OK, not particularly thrilling. Thought this film would suck, got it on a whim at Megalo-Mart for $[...]. Light-weight, but still enjoyed it, will watch again someday.

Matthew does a great job of playing the lead character, all of the actors really did a good job with their characters.  You connected and had fun with them as they went.<br /><br />Some of the action was just too much of a stretch, but that is part of watching a action movie, to suspend reality to have fun.  I'm still plagued with the question, why was the iron_clad in Africa in the first place?</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Ok, so, admitedly, I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan boy. I've been reading his novels for several years, and love each one more than the last. So... I can tell you that this film is NOT exactly like a Cussler novel (it moves a little differently, the tone of the story is different, and Giordino and Rudi are totally different from their roles in the books.) I will tell you though, Matthew is PERFECT as Dirk and Steve (while totally different than Al Giordino) embodies the role in great spirit.<br />So, in short, if you love Cussler's characters (and the style of his action/adventure plots) but won't kill yourself over quite a few differences, you'll love this film to pieces.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I loved this movie!<br /><br />The opening sequence is so incredible. An absolutely wonderful contribution to film!<br /><br />The rest of this film is also great. This is what an action movie should be like. It takes you to places you don't see and captures them beautifully.<br /><br />Great villains, great heroes, great supporting roles - the whole mix makes for an interesting viewing experience. Total fun...oh and that poor beautiful boat! You'll see.<br /><br />I'm sure somebody might disagree, but if you ask me, as someone who takes a film for what it is, I'd say this one's a definite keeper!<br /><br />The HD DVD picture is astonishing (of course the camera crew has their role in that too) and the aduio is engaging (although among the many choices Dolby True HD is not one of them - the DD+ is still great), well edited film all the way around!<br /><br />Lots of unique creative situations. Lots of action. I've just got to say it again - I love this film!<br /><br />I so highly recommend "Sahara"!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>The plot of this movie is pretty far-fetched: a guy and his friend are in search of a Confederate ironclad which supposedly left Richmond carrying a fortune in gold coins. A clue found by chance seems to point to west Africa, then northwards into the Sahara desert. But there is more than a shipload of gold involved... an environmental disaster threatens the entire Earth, seemingly from the same area.<br /><br />This movie has it all: spies, corporate bad guys, tinpot dictators, high-tech gizmos, romance and even a medical mystery. In fact, it may have just a little TOO much. At times it's hard to catch your breath during this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>This movie wasn't that bad even with 3 stars.  I like Matthew (especially in TIME TO KILL) and Penelope is ok, attractive but her acting wasn't the best (kinda like her in Gothika even though it was a short role), but then again overall it was a comedy action movie.  William H Macy, i like his funny parts in other movies as well.  I bought this on HD and can't wait to watch it!!  The bad guy wasn't convincing, and the storyline was not bad, but as for an overall movie, I would recommend it if say they like Indiana Jones, or some thrill ride. . . .  It's a good movie, and I'm glad to purchase it for my HD DVD COLLECTIONS!  Atleast RENT THIS for a relaxing night!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>What happens when you take a negative of a negative?  As an example, the novel Sahara was absolutely awful, a one-star effort that failed on almost every level of plotting and characterization.  Clive Cussler, the book's author, however, disowned the movie version of his novel.  Did this mean that the film would be good?  The answer is "sort of."  Sahara the motion picture is a vast improvement over the source material but is essentially just an okay movie, neither bad nor good.<br /><br />The movie version of the story follows Dirk Pitt (played by Matthew McConaughey) who is basically a marine version of Indiana Jones who seeks underwater treasure for a semi-private organization called NUMA.  He and his friend Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) go up the Niger River in search of a Confederate ironclad that apparently crossed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa.  Meanwhile Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is in search of the source of a mysterious ailment that is apparently coming out of war-torn Mali.  The dictator there is intent on eliminating all outsiders, and soon Dirk and Al are assisting Eva as they find the source of the plague and do a little treasure hunting on the side.<br /><br />On the plus side, most of the truly awful parts of the book have been eliminated, most particularly a supposed plot twist involving Abraham Lincoln.  The movie's writers have just taken the book's core plot and characters and reworked it into a light action movie.  On the minus side, none of the lead actors are all that great.  McConaughey and Zahn are reasonably amiable and Cruz is nice to look at, but none are really good actors.  The best in the cast would be William Macy, but he is underutilized.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is not the sort of movie that requires talented thespians, just some decent action and effects, and there is enough of that to keep most viewers entertained.  Overall, this is a three-star film, not particularly good or bad, a routine action movie that allows you to turn off your brain for a couple hours.  I cannot really recommend this movie, but I wouldn't warn people away either.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>I've never been a big fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, so I went into this movie with not very high expectation.  Considering the whithering criticism the film received I didn't think that would be the wrong idea.  However, this move turned out to be quite good and really a lot of fun.  Granted, this film is not high art, but then neither are Cussler's novels.  Moreover, since when does a movie have to be high art in order to be good?  Matthew McConaughey is great as the adventurous Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn is hilarious as the comic relief, and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz holds her own with a bunch butt-kicking guys.  The story does stretch the imagination, but that's also part of the fun.  For anyone looking for a great time and fun movie, Sahara is the choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Character actor Steve Zahn is the main attraction in this adventure flick about junk hunters that inadvertently get turned onto -- and get involved in a big way with -- a multinational chemical effuent problem generated by a manufacturer in Africa that is causing a continetal disease.<br /><br />Zahn is part of a group that searches for expensive old junk and ends up traversing African countries running into and away from bad guys. Zahn, who is always a pleasure to watch, outduels the bigger name stars in the flick  (Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz among them) and has a great scene near the end where he unloads about 20 guns from his person.<br /><br />This is a fun movie with a lot of great African scenery shot aboard boats and in sand dunes. There's a lot of action that helps you forget this is about the dumbest conglomeration of ideas you've ever seen put together in a movie. The flick starts out during the Civil War and ends up in modern day Africa, and somehow strings together all this nonsense for a feel good ending.<br /><br />Never mind that but pay attention to Zahn. He's a blast and is by far the best thing going in this flick. Fans of high adventure, action and mayhem will like this inventive if somewhat stupid movie. It is exceptionally well shot and lively in almost every frame. Pick it up today if you like these elements but don't hold your breath waiting for any Academy Award nominations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This was pretty good for a rental; Action like Indiana Jones...funny and entertaining.

The books have been phenomenal bestsellers, and it's odd that this is only the second to be filmed.  (One tends to forget the disastrous attempt at RAISE THE TITANIC back in the 70s).  Director Breck Eisner plays it safe in this adventurous and entertaining entry.  Matthew McConaughey makes a dashing Pitt, using his buff bod and charmingly boyish looks to make Pitt an accessible hero, far from the womanizer in the novels.  Steve Zahn is remarkably restrained as his sidekick, Al, one wishes Zahn was allowed to be a little more ostentatious in his role, though.  Penelope Cruz is nice to look at, but her doctor character could have been played equally as well by countless other actresses.  William H. Macy is underused in his role as the admiral, the commander in chief at NUMA who dishes out Pitt's assignments.  The sometime labyrinthine plot slows down the action at times and one wishes more focus would have been placed on the fascinating ironclad that mysteriously appears in the Sahara desert.  But SAHARA is reminiscent of early James Bond films and even though it didn't storm the box office, a franchise might be welcome.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I would not say this is a good movie or a bad movie it's in the middle so it's an ok film. The movie is an adventure film so it's farfetched throughout the movie. Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey is looking for a Confederate ironclad ship that impossibly might have ended up in the desert. Soon he and his faithful sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are lost in another adventure, discovering a deadly contaminate being tracked by a beautiful doctor (Penelope Cruz). The story about the confederate ship is good and entertainign it's the story about the poison in the water that is boring. If they would of sticked with finding the ship it would of been a really good movie. The movie is so predictable and funny at times for example they find Penelope Cruz in a well out of the whole desert as if but it's a movie. The movie is entertaining and it's pretty good at times for me to recomand.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Seeing as how I have never read Clive Cussler - I will admit that I enjoyed Sahara.  It is great entertainment.<br /><br />I got a better understanding of the movie after watching the commentaries and makings thereof.<br /><br />I enjoyed the humor - the action - and the gorgeous color - so who is Dirk?  I didn't find too much wrong with him.  The voyage of the Ironclad was a bit far fetched but enjoyable as a hunt - I surely would like to have seen some of that gold.<br /><br />And no book ever gets translated perfectly into a movie.  Ah, well, we live to be entertained.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is worth - It was a lot better than some of the far-fetched trash that the movie makers offer us.<br /><br />Definitely recommended -</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Saraha is a fun filled action packed movie for the whole family. This movie is realy good. For one thing i have to be truthfull the begining kind of sucks but it gets better twords the end. I personaly like these types of movies. Action and adventure. And some of the other reviewers are right you really can't compare this with Indiana Jones. This movie has it's one unique style of desert fun. Matthew McConahghey Does a really good job at his part as Dirk & Steven Zahn is hillarious. There is this one scene that will make you laugh your socks off. It is entertaining, When there is nothing else one. I recomend that you rent it first before you bye it. Just in case.<br /><br />Plot: Scouring The ocean Depths for treasure Dirk Pitt and his buddy al are having a time of thier lives hunting and searching for rare objects. Then one day dirk was snorkling for something and he came upon a woman who was in trouble. So he saved her and she was a doctor working for this company called W.H.O. who are trying to cure the african people from this deasie that is going around. But when this Man named Zahim found out what they are doing he wants the doctor and her partner killed. So Dirk and al end up helping the doctor with her search about finding this deaise. can they find out what is going on and save the day. You'll have to rent the movie and find out.<br /><br />If you liked the movie check out the book and soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In "Sahara," Matthew McConaughey plays an archaeologist/adventurist with a bit of a quixotic streak (he even has his own Sancho Panza-type comic relief sidekick to accompany him on his adventures) and a full-on action-hero name (Dirk Pitt).  Dirk's impossible dream - get this - involves finding and salvaging an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that he believes somehow made its way across the entire Atlantic Ocean before it sank in a river in Africa!  In his search for the unlikely relic, Dirk soon finds himself knee deep in trouble, trying to make his way through a country ruled by a vicious, bloodthirsty warlord and torn asunder by chaos.  Penelope Cruz plays a World Health Organization official determined to enter the country to help stave off a plague that seems to be taking hold there.  The two of them, both with markedly different motives, wind up joining forces as they take on the murderous thugs and corrupt officials who are determined to stop them from reaching their goals.<br /><br />"Sahara" is one of those movies in which a bunch of beautiful people wisecrack their way through one death-defying adventure after another - with an occasional time out for platonic romance and a moment or two of social conscience.  The problem here, though, is that the humor is pretty wan overall and the action sequences strictly standard-issue in nature.  The acting, too, is pretty shallow, with McConaughey spending most of his time flexing his muscles, and Cruz making the most glamorous and least convincing ambassador of goodwill to a third world country since Angelina Jolie tried the same stunt a few years back.  And, of course, as is the case with so many of these films, "Sahara" reduces complex geopolitical realities to little more than simpleminded melodramatic cliches.<br /><br />As the movie drags on, the plot becomes more and more ridiculous at every turn and the stunts more and more over-the-top, with the whole shebang culminating in one of those hail-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous.  Chances are, though, that you'll have dusted off the sands of "Sahara" long before that point.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This film cost $130 million to make, but only earned $120 million in worldwide gross plus $10 million for TV rights.  You might think that means it broke even, but in movie math that means it only got half of its money back.  It was released almost two years after it was completed, so the studio knew it had problems.  What are the problems?<br /><br />Well, it isn't a bad movie in the sense that while you are watching it you want to throw something at the screen.  Yes, it has a preposterous underlying idea - that a civil war ironclad from the confederate states, laden with CSA gold, somehow traveled across the ocean and maybe ended up trapped in the Sahara desert.  But so what?  A lot of movies have more preposterous ideas than that and make hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br />All the actors do a good job and play the movie straight.  There is some action, danger, fighting, and even some not too gory dying.  You would expect that with Penelope Cruz there would be some real sensuality, but not in this movie.  She is Dr. Eva Rojas from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) risking life and limb to track down the source of a plague before it becomes an epidemic, so she can worry about love later.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are childhood buddies who have gone through school, the Navy Seals, and life afterwards together.  They work for "The Admiral" Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy) under whom they served in the Navy.  In their current job they bring up sunken historical artifacts for various countries around the world.  This also gives Dirk occasional time to indulge his speculations about what happened to the Civil War Ironclad with all that gold that no one else believes exists.<br /><br />Fate brings Dirk and Eva together and drives them both north of Niger into Mali for different purposes.  They both end up finding something very different than they expected, all the while Giordino provides the sidekick relief (and is often the most fun and energetic character on the screen).  In the end, well ... you have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />I think the problem is simply one of chemistry and lift.  Dirk and Eva are the love story, but Dirk shows more interest in the gold than in Eva, although he knows which is more important and does his duty.  He does fall for her, but always seems more comfortable with Giordino.  It is a movie worth seeing once, but to be a big blockbuster you need a large portion of the audience to say, "Wow!" and come back several times.<br /><br />So, rent it, enjoy it as a good family adventure action film.  It is fun, just don't expect to be knocked off your feet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I never saw this film in the theatre, but watching on the DVD player with a very good sound system is a blast.<br /><br />The whole scenario is scripted for fun, and probably thats where the issue lays  for some critics... but they never seem to like the family fun movies anyway :-)<br /><br />As for the hard to believe  parts... this is a film, its meant to be fun and a nice way to escape day to day things. However, one thing that makes the action sequences more believable is that the plot point that the guys are ex-Navy Seals is established virtually  immediately; thus the amazing physical action is easily justified.<br /><br />Anyways, Just like the wonderful NATIONAL TREASURE, its a nice way to while away some time, and have some fun. It's an 'A' Grade ( or B Grade, depending on your view) piece of fun and action. It has just about every conceivable set piece in the action Lexicon without the gross out factor that some action films have. So if you have issues about what the Family can watch, well this is both very Family friendly, and enough to satisfy any action fiend. If McCounaghy[sp?] is trying to establish a Dirk franchise, well I hope he succeeds because this is a gem.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I don't know the reaction of Clive Cussler fans to this film -- I don't know why the author is so angry about it -- but as an ordinary film fan, 'Sahara' is mostly enjoyable, if not outstanding action adventure film.  Matthew McCoaughey is a likable treasure hunting hero Dirk Pitt from 'NUMA'; Steve Zahn is a scene-stealing sidekick (and he is always so) Al Giordino; and Penelope Cruz as a doctor Eva Rojas from WHO, who gets involved with Dirk's adventures.  These premises, together with the hidden gold coins made during the time of the Civil War, sound much like 'National Treasure,' and the comparison is interesting because director of 'Sahara' is Breck Eisner ('Taken') also known as son of Michael Eisner.<br /><br />But 'Sahara' is different from that Nicholas Cage film, and that is the location mostly set in the hot desert of Africa.  Dirk, Al, and another NUMA agent Rudi (Rainn Wilson) borrowing a small boat from Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy), cruise on the river into the desert of Mali, Africa, where he believes a huge US iron-clad ship disappered with gold coins.<br /><br />At the same time, the film shows us that a deadly plague is killing the people of Mali.  So, on the way to the country, Dirk and Al travel with a beautiful doctor Eva, who seeks for the cause of the disease with her senior Dr. Frank (Glynn Turman).  Don't call it a contrived story yet, for 'Sahara' is going to get more contrived as the team is attacked by the machine-guns, rockets, tanks, and helicopters of the country's troops, and their incredible adventures begin.<br /><br />That's it, and that's all I have to say.  The film is made with a familiar set-pieces, none of which are particularly imaginative or innovative, but techinically speaking they are fine.  Action film fans like me might say we have seen the same kind of scenes -- like, peeping into the 'secret' of one company owner (Lambert Wilson); blowing dynamites without using fuse, or foolishly giving our heroes chances to escape from the villains who just don't think of killing them instantly.  You can spot bits from James Bond, bits from Indiana Jones, or bits from any actioners shot in Morocco, the land which provides the wonderful landscapes for the film.<br /><br />However, in spite of its impossible story and lack of chemistry between McConaughey and Cruz (who is miscast, I am afraid), the whole film goes plesantly enough, with competently done action sequences and authentic images of Africa.  Totally unoriginal, but 'Sahara' is still fun to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>I've never read Clive Cussler so I can't compare the movie to his novel, but I enjoyed the film. It's not a classic and it won't win any awards but it will entertain you. Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordano are treasure hunters looking for an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that may have somehow ended up in Africa. Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the WHO investigating a new illness spreading from an African country. They cross paths and together find the source of the disease and eventually find the Civil War ship. The plot is preposterous and you never believe Cruz as a WHO physician but the movie is action packed from beginning to end and Steven Zahn as sidekick Al provides some genuinely funny moments. Sahara delivers exactly what it sets out to, a few hours of mindless entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>By accident, I caught an advance screening of this movie last night in DC. I'd heard negative reviews, but thankfully did not let that cloud my judgment. The chemistry between Matthew McConaughey & Steve Zahn is palpable. I didn't think the chemistry between Penelope & Matthew sizzled, till the end. But since we all know now that they're together...I find it amusing. Good for them! The location shots for this movie are phenomenal, esp Morocco. I'm bringing ALL my Moroccan friends to the movie when it release. It's similar to "National Treasure", but not as slick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>The plot was more twisted and looping than a bowl of spaghetti - and not in a good way. I swear that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz could not make up her mind on what accent to try and fake.  Am I ghetto French?  Perhaps I'll try an African/English hint.  Ooh - lets go for .....<br /><br />Dirk - well, he resembled the Dirk we know from the novels in one way - the name.  That's it.<br /><br />Al - Could they have picked a worse person to play him?  Instead of being a wise-cracking rock-solid individual, he's a blithering idiot that looks like a surfer-bar reject. Look at the CD cover - see the dimwit on the right? What do you think?<br /><br />Sandecker was passable, but 50 lbs too light and a little too swishy.<br /><br />The entire film is an exercise in miscsasting.  Sore, if you've never read the books, you'll think this is an OK move.  Weak plot, poorly executed, badly acted, but passable. The opening scene was well done with believable SFX.  Unfortunately the rest on the movie did not even come close.  I found myself using the >> control many, many times to get past the weakest moments, so at least I was able to enjoy this as a 40 minute movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>At first the movie really feels promising but just after ten minutes through the movie you can see how it's copied past movies so much it's just becomes boring and monotonous lacking anything to keep you from watching the end of the movie.  I felt we would see a new character treasure hunting adventurer seeking a lost treasure,  divining mythical historical puzzles,  or at least having decent historical knowledge but this character has almost next to nothing on any of this.  Another subplot put into the movie is the humanitarian female lead trying to save something or someone played by Penelope Cruz whose own lack luster acting made a boring movie even worse to watch,  I mean for all the hype that was given to her while the movie was made her emotional acting in it was atrocious.  Also how can we have a movie like this without the humorous sidekick Steve Zahn which again the actor picked just made you turn the movie off instead of having to watch this garbage through to the end.  If you're looking for a good treasure hunting action movie try out the Indiana Jones or National Treasures movies those at least give you the characters you will enjoy and a storyplot that will keep you entertained unlike this sad mistake that was made and which I truly wish I had not force myself to watch and can hopefully forget about soon...</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>A mildly entertaining romp LOOSELY based on a Clive Cussler novel.  It plays more like an action comedy than the grandoise plots that Cussler devises for Dirk Pitt.  A pity it's only the second adaption (the first being the Lew Grade production of RAISE THE TITANIC w/ the late Richard Jordan -- Francis in LOGAN'S RUN -- as Pitt, Jason Robards as Admiral Sandecker).  Actually, I preferred Jordan as Pitt.  He was an actor who can be truly menacing and was damned good looking. McCounaghy looks to much like a southern California surfer than a deadly agent.  His shtick with Steve Zahn is amusing but in the end forgettable.  If you have time to kill it's entertaining enough.  Nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It started with a bang and ended with a thud. The majority of the scenery and the action scenes are jaw dropping. However the movie goes from bad to worse after 30 minutes. It's because of the plot and the directing I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Clive Cussler's popular series of novels featuring the character of Dirk Pitt have been around for many years but never turned into movies because the author has always maintained tight control over them. He somehow let his guard down (reportedly promised that the film would be a faithful adaptation of his book) and allowed Hollywood to adapt Sahara into a big budget action/adventure film starring Matthew McConaughey as Pitt in 2005.<br /><br />Sahara trots out the usual archetypes: Pitt is the dashing hero; Al is his comic relief sidekick with the Eva as the plucky love interest. The chemistry between McConaughy and Zahn is good and feels authentic. They play well off each other even if their characters never transcend their stereotypes. McConaughy proves to be a credible action hero firmly in the Indiana Jones tradition while Zahn is spot-on with his comic timing and is as watchable as ever. Alas, there is zero chemistry between McConaughy and Cruz who looks lost in this movie. To her credit, she has little to work with.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner. Lines like, "our methodology for shooting this scene..." are typical of this technically-oriented track. Eisner comes off as a little dry but his comments are worth a listen if you want the nitty gritty details of how this film was put together.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary with Eisner and actor/executive producer Matthew McConaughy. There is a nice, conversational tone to this track as the two men tell many anecdotes of filming.<br /><br />"Across the Sands of Sahara" is a featurette on the long journey to get this movie made.<br /><br />"Visualizing Sahara" examines how every scene was extensively storyboarded but was sometimes changed once on location or when someone would come up with a good idea. The look of the film, like costumes and visual effects, are explored in this featurette.<br /><br />"Cast and Crew Wrap Film" is a montage that establishes the scale of the production: hundreds of crew members, all kinds of vehicles and several exotic locales. It's a quick snapshot of how tough this shoot must have been but also the fun that these people had making the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Eisner and McConaughy. Most significantly, is a second historical opening that sets up the plane that Pitt and Al find later on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Surely a movie starring the delectable Penelope Cruz and William H. Macy can't be all that bad. Well, when you have Penelope cast as a doctor from the World Health Organization, and Matthew McConaughey as a surfer-like deep see expert and treasure hunter, it's pretty much downhill from there.<br /><br />Sahara involves the adventures of Dirk Pitt (McConaughey) and his intrepid faithful sidekick Al Giordino (a rather forced Steve Zahn).  Dirk has been searching for a Civil War Ironclad battleship that he and he alone believes somehow drifted from Virginia to Africa 140 years ago.<br /><br />While he plies the water of the coast of Niger, Dr. Rojas (Cruz) is determined to locate the cause of a baffling new plague in Mali. Her search has no real connection to Dirk and Al's quest, yet they keep running into one another in the vast wilderness so that they can keep rescuing each other from gun-toting African militia.<br /><br />The trio's escapades come to the attention of evil French entrepreneur Massarde (Lambert Wilson) and Mali strongman General Kazim (Lennie James) who send the entire Mali army after them to cover up the source of the rapidly spreading illness.<br /><br />First-time feature director Breck Eisner does a respectable job in maintaining forward momentum and he enlivens the proceedings with some quirky moments, especially the banter between the actors. The film's action set pieces come off quite effectively, including a battle between boats on a river, breaking into a mysterious power plant in the middle of the desert, and various skirmishes between our heroes and the general's faceless soldiers.<br /><br />But the movie is ultimately hampered by story is totally preposterous and unrealistic - a civil war ship ending up in a river in Africa! Please! There's absolutely no sense of plausibility to the plot and there's just to many leaps in logic as our heroes wisecrack their way through fights without a scratch. They also seem to have a remarkable immunity to bullets.<br /><br />Perhaps Sahara would have been considered a good action film thirty years ago when movie going tastes for this kind of fair where not as sophisticated, but these days a movie like this comes across as rather stale and formulaic. There's nothing much to Sahara that we though we haven't all seen before: glamorous girl, evil megalomaniac, swashbuckling hero, comic sidekick etc.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether Sahara's sloppily interconnected storyline comes from a blind fidelity to Clive Cussler's adventure novel or severe deviation from it. Whatever the case, you know that all is not right, when during the opening credits, you see an army of scriptwriters. I also can't quite fathom the inclusion of loud, clangy rock music into the soundtrack - surely African tribal music would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />On the plus side, the film's otherworldly locations and sets neatly blend into the startling vistas and spruce up the otherwise generic and standard happenings. But generally, Sahara is as flat as the desert on which most of the action takes place. Mike Leonard September 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I would have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's book of the same title. Being a big fan of Crussler, I have to say that Matthew McConaughy doesn't fit the profile of Dirk Pitt, not even close. Having said that, I can't say this casting chocie was a mismatch since McConaughy actually does a pretty decent job here. Simply put, he's not Dirk Pitt of the Clive Crussler novels but Dirk Pitt created by Hollywood.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining and fast pace action film. Most people would called this a great "popcorn flick". The plot is far-fetched as humanly possible so there really nothing on film to take seriously. William H. Macy plays Admiral Sandecker, a surprised but pleasant choice and he does a good job playing a "boss" figure for once. Steve Zahn provides the comic relief and poor Penelope Cruz was totally miscast in her role. Its also embarassing that her limitation as an actress was totally revealed in a "popcorn flick" of all things. But she was nice to look at and in a movie like this, that is what most people really care about. (That may sound bit chauvinist but its the sad Hollywood truth. After all, they could have easily hire Emma Thompson instead but for obvious reason, they did not.)<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie and if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's novel and characters, it would have received an another star.

Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says "The hunt for the gold begins here" and "The search for the mysterious ship" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment.

They're handcuffed to the flatbed of a truck that they unscrewed, shoved out of their captors' vehicle, and now have been hauling up and down dunes all day - without any water, mind you - until they've stumbled upon this wrecked plane. The goofy guy looks at the hunky guy, the goofy guy makes a joke, cue up Steppenwolf's "Magic Carpet Ride", and, well these guys have unlocked the handcuffs and rigged the wrecked plane into a windsurfer.<br /><br />That's "Sahara" - the worst of "MacGuyver" mixed with the worst of "Indiana Jones" in a plot that was handled better in the "Tomb Raider" series. I'm comparing "Tomb Raider" favorably here. You get the idea.<br /><br />Long, ridiculously convoluted story short: Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and Al (Steve Zahn, getting a career bump from his Texas buddy) are old treasure hunters, and Dirk believes an Civil War freighter sailed across Africa near the end of that war, ran aground in a then-fertile Sahara Desert (it was?) and remains lodged there under sand.<br /><br />Their quest becomes intertwined with the mission of a UN health worker (Penelope Cruz) investigating the mysterious, toxic deaths of hundreds of nomads and rebel fighters. There's a military dictator, a chemical waste plant, a wicked corporate type disguised as a humanitarian, and Dirk and Al's boss, the Admiral, played by William H. Macy, a talented professional who'll act in just about any old rotten thing.<br /><br />Unlike the "Indiana Jones" trilogy, content to fit archaeology into a single plot engine, "Sahara" is based on a Clive Cussler novel, and it's a buffet of perspectives and characters stuffed into two hours for the movie to ever have coherence.<br /><br />Was it necessary that the mysterious deaths warn of a worldwide plague? Was it useful to supply an African Civil War subplot? The two action peaks - a motorboat duel and a brawl atop a solar tower - aren't original, and the jokey-dokey interplay between McConaughey and Zahn clang against the movie's detail overload and the presence of Cruz, a stunning woman still struggling with pronuciation and syllable emphasis in the English language. Cruz inches ever closer to achieving a sense of humor, but she's still dead serious in "Sahara," forgetting even to crack a smile in the movie's obligatory celebration scene.<br /><br />"Sahra" sits on McConaughey's shoulders as producer/star, and possibly the lead scapegoat in a lawsuit Cussler has threatened to file after disowning the picture. Well, Dirk Pitt's no Bond or Jones or even Croft. The appeal of McConaughey eludes me. He has the face of an underfed dog, is consistently tanned to the color of a burnt turkey and seems to given over most of his career to playing the gentleman doof in romantic comedies and gunk like this.<br /><br />It'd be one thing if he had Harrison Ford's sarcasm but he doesn't - he drawls and lumbers about, as capable of an overnight drunk as he is a day in the action movies. He's added a thin moustache for this role; let their not be a sequel, lest young women begin to pester their boyfriends for the sleazy, casino dealer look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>I've seen my share of stupid movies, I've seen zombies bite though people's skulls, a giant snake slither though LA without anyone seeing it, and people taking out giant rhinos with a spear, but this movie takes the cake. There are really only two things I have to tell you about to prove this movie stupid, I don't even have to talk about the awful acting or the crazy nonsense plot. one, they shoot down a helicopter with a Civil War cannon that's been buried under the sand in the SAHARA desert for 150 years, and an armored column surrenders to cavalry.<br /><br />Here's why that's so insanely stupid for all those who don't get it, and I'm going to use historical examples to prove it. During the battle of Gettysburg the army of Northern Virginia opened fire on the union army with their long ranged cannon, and MISSED! They couldn't even hit an army. now, fast forward to the modern day, give a cannon that's been buried under the sand since the end of the war to three Indiana Jones want to be's and give them the most impossible target to hit, a helicopter. What do you think happens? Well, they shoot it down, duh.<br /><br />Second, an entire armored column, I think there must have been more then a dozen tanks, surrenders to an enemy army on horse back. Now, does anyone remember when the Polish army fought German tanks during WWII? Anyone? Well I'll tell you, uh, they died. Yeah, they all got killed because there is no possible way for mounted cavalry to defeat armor, and yet the tankers in this movie didn't seem to know that. Pathetic.<br /><br />There's a lot more I could rant about, like how on earth could a Civil War battleship get to the Sahara desert, but I think I've made my point. This movie is simply one of the dumbest ever made, and I've seen some doozies. Stay away, for the love of god, stay away from this flick and just see Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Replay value; Very low.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I watched this over the weekend on my wife's recommendation -- something that I usually avoid because she has an unnerving penchant for chick-flicks.  Strangely enough, this one was pure adventure and action from beginning to end (which is more my taste in movies) and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />I've only seen a handful of Matthew McConaughy movies over the years, but this may well be my favorite -- just because the Dirk Pitt character is just so darned cool.  He's a true man's man -- ex Navy Seal, treasure hunter, and semi-credible action hero, complete with dashing good looks, a keen wit and a full head of wavy dark hair that is the envy of bald guys like me.  In short, he's the consummate studly guy.<br /><br />Pitt is cool, but he has some good support from guys like Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), Admiral Sandecker (well acted by William H. Macy), and the predictably babish Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz).  The story is fast-moving, the stakes high (saving the world, as is usual in movies like this), and the plot is only modestly cliche.  In short, as long as you don't intend to take this too seriously or seek a profound commentary on the meaning of life, the universe and everything, you're liable to have a lot of good clean fun with this movie.  Enjoy it.  I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>The movie SAHARA proves on indisputable fact. Most reviewers would not know entertainment if it came along and bonked them on the head. The movie, based on the novel of the same name, is high-standard entertainment that has enough drama, humor and good natured fun to fill a couple of movies. It also avoids being pretentious unlike some other big budget movies I could mention.<br /><br />This movie was unfairly targeted as an Indiana Jones clone. Sure the two have obvious comparisons - both searching for historic treasure - but the reviewers fail to comprehend that Cussler was writing Dirk Pitt novels over a decade before Harrison Ford donned the fedora and cracked the whip in 1981's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.<br /><br />Pitt (and sidekick) Al Giodino are modern-day adventurers whose quest to explore the deep oceans often lead them into high adventure against improbable villains. Here, the two search for a civil-era Confederate iron-clad that Pitt firmly believes is in Africa. Of course everyone around him scoffs at the notion, but Pitts belief is further reinforced when he discovers a coin from the ship.<br /><br />Joining Matthew Conaughey and Steve Zahn (as Pitt and Giordino respectively) is Penelope Cruz as a World Health Organization scientist out to investigate a mysterious plague - in a role which Cussler nominated Selma Hayek for. I have always found Cruz somewhat annoying in her other roles, but here she was actually a very appealing heroine.<br /><br />The three take on a multi-millionaire industrialist and a two-bit African dictator and I found the journey of getting to the climactic confrontation to be highly entertaining.<br /><br />I'm personally hoping to see one of Cussler's other novels (Night Probe) make it to the screen. That always seemed to me to be the most cinematic of the adventures and hopefully McConaughey and team get to film that one.<br /><br />There are a number of differences between the filmed version of SAHARA and the Cussler book:<br /><br />o In the movie Pitt is an ex-Navy Seal. In the novels, Pitt is a Major in the Air Force (technically, he is still on staff, but is "on loan" to Admiral Sandecker to work at NUMA).<br /><br />o Dirk and Al are no longer former Air Force officers, on loan to NUMA as marine engineers/scientists. They are now ex-Navy SEALs who work for NUMA as treasure hunters. Ruins their credibility a bit, I think.<br /><br />o NUMA is no longer a massive government agency dedicated to the preservation of lost nautical craft or concerned about the aquatic environment. It is a private-run organization dedicated to locating treasure and archeologic finds in aquatic areas. However there are hints at the end of the movie that NUMA may become more tied to the government.<br /><br />o In the novel, Sahara begins for our heroes when they are confronted with the threat of the accelerated red tide. Along the way, they find out about the legend of a lost Confederate ironclad. In the movie, Dirk is, right off the bat, dedicated to finding the ironclad, giving him more the image of a shallow treasure hunter. It is during his search for the ship that he helps Eva Rojas in her search for the cause of the poisoned water and the accelerated red tide.<br /><br />o The Rudi Gunn of the novels is Sandecker's enigmatic right-hand man. I say enigmatic because he is short, nerdy-looking, and appears rather unintimidating. However, he is a Naval officer who had served under Sandecker, and is EXTREMELY capable of handling himself in rough situations, holding his own with Dirk and Al. The film's Rudi is just a scientist, extremely nerdy, with no military experience.<br /><br />o The humor is a little more dumbed down, I thought. There were several instances where Al acted quite a bit like...well, Steve Zahn.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>The film lives up loyally to its title, it's as barren as the Sahara. But if you're not expecting a meticulous rendition of Cussler's novel this is certainly a fun weekend caper. You have seen these fierce explosions and wild deus ex machina twists before, but that's what disposable action thrillers are about, aren't they?<br /><br />The adult cast may trick you into thinking the script was done by grown-ups too. Names like Dirk Pitt and the overall premise should swiftly dispel those suspicions -- an ironclad ship from the Civil War is buried beneath the sands of the Sahara, having ventured there 150 years ago but must now be found.<br /><br />Two diametrically opposed male leads are called to the task, one a six-pack toting macho stud and the other a shrimpy blunderbuss, but that doesn't a film make so we roll out a red mat for a Ms. Hotpants played by Penelope Cruz, who, surprise surprise, indulges in some choice moments with the macho man while saving the planet from a deadly nuclear chemical.<br /><br />I'm not surprised reviewers are drawing analogies to the other doozy thriller from recent memory, National Treasure, which at least played its cards with lilting pace.<br /><br />Yet I must admit that for all its obvious flaws this desert adventure doesn't suck as much as it could have. The Saharan context could have used more African influence on the soundtrack (which as it stands is a forgettable jumble of 70s rock) but at least it doesn't star Jean Claud Van Damme.<br /><br />That alone makes it worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Here we go again.  "Sahara" is yet another example of empty-headed Hollywood entertainment.  Seemingly, studios continue to gamble millions upon millions of dollars that Americans will pay to go to see anything as long as there are explosions, chases, and one-liners.  Cohesive scripts, fleshed out characters, and logical motivations aren't necessary.  The sad part is--they aren't wrong most of the time.<br /><br />The inevitable comparisons of "Sahara" to "National Treasure" have been made abundantly.  They might as well be the same movie, enough said.  There are also similarities to any number of James Bond films, and those are legitimate too--Except James Bond is a highly trained superagent while the "Sahara" boys are flippant treasure hunters.  Nothing real is at stake for our boys, even with hundreds of people dying. After surviving a near massacre, losing their only transportation, being stranded in the desert, being chased by a military force, and having just killed dozens of people--the natural reaction is, of course, "I lost my hat."  Hard for us to get too excited if there is no real danger!<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey burst onto the scene over ten years ago now with charisma to spare.  He has done little, however, to stretch as an actor.  He capitalizes on his looks and charm over and over again in lightweight bubblegum pop and/or not-so-funny romantic comedies.  He even produced this epic--trying to cash in once more.  Steve Zahn, a talented actor, also seems content to play the same wisecracking sidekick repeatedly.  And Penelope Cruz--let's just be kind and say she is convincing neither as an action heroine or a doctor.<br /><br />I'm in a generous mood today, and I'll award "Sahara" 2 stars.  It has some pretty scenery to look at.  It knows it isn't very good, so at least it isn't pretentious.  Having a bit of self-awareness is always a good thing.  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"Sahara" is an Indiana Jones/James Bond hybrid that should be appreciated by fans of, say, "National Treasure" and "The Mummy" (1999), though it's not quite as good as either of those films.<br /><br />I was hoping it would be closer to the Clive Cussler novel, but the main elements of the story are there. Matthew McConaughey makes a decent enough Dirk Pitt (Cussler's hero in his book series), although I envisioned him with brouder shoulders and facial features more akin to Charles Bronson. Steve Zahn doesn't physically look like his sidekick Al Giordino (who is supposed to resemble a human bulldozer), but I enjoyed Zahn in the role. Penelope Cruz is also enjoyable as the W.H.O doctor.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for desert-adventure flicks (e.g. "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Flight of the Phoenix," "The Mummy," "Lawrence of Arabia," etc.) and so really enjoyed the great desert scenery (from locations in Morocco and Spain).<br /><br />So why only 3 Stars? Mainly because the flick doesn't match the greatness of the novel, but also because of the many implausibilities (e.g. the escape from the pick-up truck, the absurd entrance into the desert facility, the soccer ball incident, just to name a few). In other words, the film often has a highly unrealisitic tone. Still, I enjoyed the fun, upbeat spirit of "Sahara," similar to Indiana Jones or the 70's/early 80's James bond flicks.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book it would be more like a 3.5 or 4 Star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The mere premise of a Confederate ironclad ship somehow winding up buried underneath the desert of Africa was enough to make me want to see this film.  How the heck are they going to explain that one?  Sahara was a different film than I expected, however; I pictured these guys out there digging up this historical relic, but there's very little of an archaeological nature to what turned out to be a fast-paced, quick-witted thrill ride of an adventure.  The discovery of the ironclad ship sort of falls into the background as the story mixes in a deadly plague, a brutal African dictator, and a potential threat to life as we know it.  Don't expect things to get too serious, though, as "treasure hunters" Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and his hilarious sidekick Al (Steve Zahn) basically laugh their way through an incredible series of dangerous escapes and reckless acts of heroism.  These guys could show MacGyver a trick or two.<br /><br />Dirk works for NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and he manages to talk his boss into giving him a couple of days to follow up on an important clue to his pet obsession; not surprisingly, most folks think he's crazy to argue that the lost Confederate ironclad The Texas somehow crossed the Atlantic and now rests beneath the sands of Africa.  Along the way, though, Dirk and Al get a little sidetracked by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and her cohort Dr. Hopper (Glynn Turman), doctors with the World Health Organization trying to find the source of a deadly, spreading infection.  That source lies in Mali, a country ravaged by fighting between the forces of General Kazim (Lennie James) and rebels opposing his dictatorial ways.  Dr. Rojas does indeed run into trouble, but the personal danger she faces is nothing compared to the dangers she and Dirk eventually discover out in the wastelands of the desert.  Dirk and Al are a two-man wrecking crew, single-handedly taking out whatever comes their way - armed soldiers, tanks, helicopters, you name it.  A lot of it is ridiculously over the top - yet all the more entertaining for that very reason - you'll be rolling your eyes, but you'll be laughing as you do so.<br /><br />Sahara is really an action comedy.  A Confederate ironclad ship buried beneath the Sahara (carrying oodles of gold coins, to boot) is far from the most improbable plot element on display here.  McConaughey and Zahn are great in their roles, though, and that is the real secret to this movie's success.  The wrong actor in the role of either Dirk or Al would have been disaster, as the fanciful story could never have stood on its own two legs without the support of the right actors.  I can't say I truly bought Penelope Cruz as a doctor, but she more than held her own when it came to playing hardball with the big boys.  Of course, it helps when the bad guys are the worst shots in the world; it's actually rather ridiculous, as these guys almost surely broke the world's record for most missed shots in one movie.<br /><br />It's pretty simple, really - if you like action comedies, you should enjoy Sahara.  The comedic banter between the actors is consistently funny, there are plenty of action scenes chock full of gunfights, explosions, and fisticuffs, and you won't find any dull moments once things really get going.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>A couple years ago I interviewed Clive Cussler and asked him why it has taken so long for another one of his novels to be turned into a movie?  He told me that he was SO upset at how Hollywood butchered 'Raise the Titanic' (one of the greatest adventure novels EVER written, by the way) that he would NEVER again sell one of his novels...UNLESS he had script approval, actor approval and director approval.  Virtually every year someone came knocking on his door making another offer, and he said the same thing: "Sure...just give me what I want and you can pick and choose which book you want to put to film."  They kept saying there was no way that would happen, so he politely declined each year, even though they kept offering more and more money each time.  FINALLY somebody made the appropriate concession and suddenly 'Sahara' was turned into a viable screenplay.  However Clive became unimpressed at the adaptation and against the deal they had made, decided to go ahead with the script they had WITHOUT author approval...hence the lawsuit we keep hearing about.<br /><br />While 'Sahara' is not the Cussler novel I would have picked to put on the big screen, it IS a fun book (as are all of the Dirk Pitt stories) and I looked forward to it nevertheless.  I MUST admit as many others have noticed, the deviation of the written plot, especially leaving out the historical Abraham Lincoln storyline left me almost disgusted -- at first.  Cussler told me that of ALL the hundreds of fictional characters he has created over the years, only Al Giordino was based on a REAL person.  For personal reasons, he was VERY determined to make sure that Giordino was cast correctly...but unfortunately finding a short, muscle-bound, curly black haired Italian was easier said than done.  After months of searching, it became obvious that finding the RIGHT person to play the role as written in the Pitt novels just wasn't going to happen.  This certainly helped me to accept that blunder much better -- even though I REALLY enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance as Al.  It was well done and offered the biggest laughs of the entire movie bar-none.<br /><br />After seeing it on the big screen and again on DVD, I did my best to watch it without any expectations as a Cussler fan, and you know what?  It was pretty dang fun anyways.  Sure, a lot of details were dropped (quite a LOT actually) from the novel, but one thing I was VERY impressed at was how family-friendly the movie was as a whole.  Sure there was action and violence, but the sex and language was pretty much nil -- which goes against virtually ALL the Hollywood norms these days.<br /><br />In short: for the Dirk Pitt fans who are also the purists and expect no change from the written novels, you may want to pass on 'Sahara'.  For those who are looking for a fun, adventure-laced movie loosely based on a Cussler book, you are in for a fun time.  I think I fall somewhere in between.  I enjoyed the movie, but I am also disappointed that the storyline wasn't followed closer.  All in all I will eagerly await a follow-up Dirk Pitt movie (if Cussler even allows it...which is questionable at best at this point...) and I felt that the casting of Matthew as Dirk Pitt was right on.  I have wondered for YEARS who in Hollywood would do the character justice and I must admit, he did a great job.  I hope he gets another opportunity to do it again.  My choice for next book to be turned into movie: Atlantis Found or Dragon.  Just a thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>I don't get the comparisons with James Bond or Indiana Jones. Yeah, the filmmakers play James Bond type music during the boat chase sequence, trying to establish that connection; and, yeah, the hero, Dirk Pitt, is adventuresome and scruffy like Indiana Jones. But to me, the strongest comparison is with the Michael Douglas character in Romancing the Stone. As a matter of fact, I can't think of an actor that Matthew McConaughey resembles more than Michael Douglas.<br /><br />I hate the comparisons with the novel. On the one hand, if you're going to base a film on a well-known book, make it as close as possible to the original while still maintaining your own vision. But then, on the other hand, why did the author, Clive Cussler, feel it was necessary for McConaughey to look so much like his character, Dirk Pitt, that he made him dye his hair? Wouldn't it have made more sense if the script and McConaughey's acting had resembled the character? But then, nothing about the background of this film makes any sense, even though much of it is covered in the extra features.<br /><br />The one thing that does make sense is Matthew McConaughey's motivation for making this film: to be like Dirk Pitt - i.e., to save the day and get the girl. Now, that's not exactly a brainy, innovative motivation; but then, neither is McConaughey or this film. We've seen it all before: good-natured, typically selfish, treasure hunting male; beautiful, compassionate, socially minded female; handy, faithful, wisecracking sidekick; power-crazed, ruthless villain bent on ruling the world. It would have been nice if they had given this well-worn formula a new spin.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of Sahara is the art direction. Visually the film is stunning, especially the locations. The opening sequence in which we take a tour of Dirk's workroom while the credits roll is both interesting and informative.<br /><br />And the dialogue is often entertaining for some light and witty bantering. But then we go off on a plot that is thin and getting thinner; until finally, by the end of the film, everything hinges on keeping a stockpile of disease-causing waste out of an African river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean, thus preventing the entire world from becoming infected and dying. Please.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me is that, by the end of the film, no one has changed. That is the earmark of a good story: the hero goes through something that causes him to change, hopefully for the better - but not Dirk Pitt. Even though he faces superhuman challenges that would break a lesser man, none of them seem to affect him. He's the same person at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. Oh, he saves the day and gets the girl, but...shouldn't there be more? Based on the $69 million return on the $130 million invested, I'd say most movie goers believe there should.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Action-packed adventure from beginning to end  ... includes the swash-buckling modern super hero, Dirk Pitt, played by Matthew McConnaughy, his side kick, partner and friend from childhood, Al Giordino, and the intelligent and alluring, Dr. Eva Rojas, played by Penelope Cruz. They meet in Lagos, Nigeria and travel together to the Saharan desert country of Mali to solve a couple of mysteries: the disappearance of an iron ship from the Civil War and a mysterious plague which is killing many African citizens.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt had received a gold coin from an African antique collector which dates back to the Civil War leading him to negotiate to use a power boat for exactly 72 hours. It is owned by his boss who is head of an underwater search team,, NUMA, that looks for "lost treasure". He is alloted exactly 72 hours to use the boat. His goal is to discover the origin of the gold coin. Instead he finds himself in the midst of a major civil conflict in Mali ... where a local warlord Kazim, is allowing waste to be dumped into the Niger River which has underground tributaries. The contaminated river water seeps underground ... becomes available as drinking water in wells. One must view the film to discover how Dr. Eva Rojas and Dirk Pitt become partners in solving two separate mysteries ... and how they become romantic partners as well.<br /><br />This film captured my imagination from the start ... first, by showing a Civil War scene where the Iron ship is docked and makes its escape into the Atlantic Ocean in April 1865 ... never to be seen, heard from or discovered. And second, by the opening scenes where a camera scans the office of Dirk Pitt ... showing photos, newspaper clippings, and model ships from the past. This introduction was only the foretaste of the great cinematography which was so evident throughtout this film. The film lasted 2 and 1/2 hours and I loved every minute of it! The Sahara scenes of Dirk Pitt and Eva Rojas riding on camel's backs ... with the sun setting behind them ... the camels undulating as they walked on sand dunes ... superb creative photography. The scene where Dirk, Al, and Eva reach a mountain pass ... stop their jeep ... drop all their weapons one by one ... raise their hands ... in anticipation of being captured by desert tribes is very powerful and effective, again, among the best scenes in the film. When they arrive at the mountain village, where the homes are carved on the side of the mountain, like old style condominiums, unbelievably beautiful. The monumental discovery by Al in the cave ... The adventure/escape fighting scenes on the Niger River, as Kazim's soldiers try to stop Dirk and his pals ... hair raising, seat of the edge tense moments, took my breath away. Most appealing is the train-ride in the desert to get to Yves Mossard's waste factory in the desert ... the cinematography was over-whelmingly superb. Building a wind-driven dune buggy out of a downed airplane (hahaha, loved it!). There are other great scenes throughout the film but to describe them would ruin the plot ...<br /><br />This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have viewed with the action-hero Dirk Pitt on film. Matthew McConnaughy lives and breathes the part, his personality fits perfectly into the character. Penelope Cruz was another perfect cast for the role of Dr. Eva Rojas. My prediction is: this may be the first in a series of multi-million dollar making films, similar to the Indian Jones series. Make another film from a Clive Cussler book: I promise! I will be there! This is among the best (likley THE BEST) action/adventure/mystery film I have seen in recent memory (past 5 years).

Was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out, but once again. No director or screenwriter can make a good movie out of a clive cussler book, like Sahara.  A very good book, with an incredible twist at the end. But Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and well. Everybody else for that matter, were horribly miscast. Dirk Pitt is not a treasure hunter, and in the book he didn't believe that a civil war ironclad had ended up in the sahara. Rudy Gunn is a nerd, but not to this extent. Yeves massarde are portrayed horribly as well, I was looking forward to the escape from the boat, but this movie totally, and I mean totally changes the plot from the book. The only common denominator is the ironclad, and that's it. I do own this movie, and every now and then I get it out and watch it. And I'm just amazed how you can take an awsome book, and totally change it, there's no tabeza jail moment where Giordino kills the evil lady. They would have been better to not put Clive Cussler's name on this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Sahara brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, the spread of a deadly plague and its effect on the people in the region of northwest Africa, and on the other, the treasure hunt for the Civil War era CSS Texas and its legendary cargo of gold.<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz carry out their performances well, though by no means are they the performances of their lives) while the plot, the music, and the action/special effects are very good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Sahara (2005) is an action adventure that largely delivers what you expect from a big budget film of this type, a likeable hero, a beautiful damsel, exotic locations, epic scale, cool action sequences, a touch of humor, a little romance, an ancient mystery, and hidden treasure.  Except for a major bad guy, it's all there, packaged within a decently constructed story.<br /><br />The film is based on a Dirk Pitt novel, one of over a dozen written by Clive Clussler, whose first book featuring the character was published in 1973.  While the books featuring Pitt, an ex-Navy officer turned salvage expert, may be fertile material with cinematic possibilities, prior to Sahara, only Raise The Titanic (1976) had been made into a feature film in 1980.  Cussler had apparently been so dissatisfied with the way Raise the Titanic had turned out, that he refused to permit any of his other Pitt novels to be made into films for over 20 years.<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey had great interest in playing Dirk Pitt, and contacted Cussler to discuss the possibility.  Eventually Cussler agreed to McConaughey playing his beloved character, although the actor had to agree to dye his hair dark, and wear green contact lenses, to match Cussler's description of Pitt.  With script approval, Cussler greenlighted the production, however he later had major objections, and took legal action against the production company.<br /><br />The movie incorporates many of the major elements from the book, a winding tale centered on Pitt's search for the CSS Texas, a US Civil War ironclad, he believes is lost somewhere in the African desert.  As ironclads were not the most seaworthy of craft, the possibility that one travelled from the east coast of America to Nigeria, would seem to be quite remote, but that is the premise here.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt fans may have strong feelings about how the character is presented, and how well the novel is translated to the screen.  Those without preconceptions, may regard Sahara as just another adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, with some James Bond influences.  Dirk Pitt comes across as a rather generic, nice guy hero type, who while not seeming particularly nautical, is perhaps more affable than in the books.  The principal casting is solid, with Steve Zahn as Pitt's best buddy Al Giordino, William H. Macy as James Sandecker, the head of NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and Penelope Cruz as doctor Eva Rojas.<br /><br />After rescuing doctor Dr. Rojas in Lagos, Nigeria, Pitt convinces his boss Sandecker, to allow him to head up the Niger River in a NUMA boat, to follow an obscure clue.  Eva Rojas hitches a ride on Pitt's boat to Mali, before departing to find the source of a plague.  General Kazim (Lennie James) the ruler of Mali, is colluding with businessman Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson) who is running a secret solar power plant in the middle of the desert, that is poisoning the water supply.  Kazim attempts to eliminate both the medical team, and the NUMA expedition.  Pitt's boat is attacked, and sunk.  Proceeding through the desert via camel, Dirk and Al manage to find Eva, just after her medical team has been massacred by Kazim's men.  While travelling by Jeep, the group is taken in by natives, the Tuaregs, and taken to their city in the desert.  There they meet Madibo (Paulin Fodoup), the Tuareg leader, and Al discovers a clue to the location of an ironclad in the desert.  The stage is set for an eventful final act, where the heroes discover the secret plant, the remnants of a lost airplane, and buried below the desert sands, the long lost CSS Texas.  The buildup is nicely done, but with Kazim attacking in a helicopter, the end of the conclusive chase is a little lame.  While the reality factor is low, overall the film is a pretty lively and entertaining romp, with a lighthearted tone.<br /><br />Regarded as a box office bomb, Sahara had a massive budget reportedly topping $130 million, and has apparently yet to make a profit.  Also part of the baggage that has become attached to the film, is the falling out with author Clive Clusser, which resulted in a lawsuit being filed against the production company, who in turn countersued Cussler.  The cases have gone to trial and the appeals process.  Judgments have been rendered, but a final resolution has apparently yet to be reached.  Odds are, we won't be seeing any new Dirk Pitt films anytime soon.<br /><br />Among the many special features are two commentary tracks, one with director Breck Eisner, and a second with Eisner and Mathew McConaughy.  The first is more informative technically, while the second is more informal.  Besides being the star, McConaughy served as an executive producer, and was crucial in making the project a reality.  Clive Cussler's involvement is briefly discussed, but there is no mention of any legal matters.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie is actually quite a bit different from the book in several days. Usually, when this happens in a book-to-movie translation, the result is disappointing. However, 'Sahara' was a novel packed with a LOT of scenes, action, and the like, and it would have been impossible to get all of it into the movie.<br /><br />The producer and writers did a decent job of bringing and adapting the book to the screen. You don't have to read the book to like the movie. but I still recommend it because the book is very, very good. It would have been nice if they put in the whole story/plot with the mines (and Malenka), but oh well. The movie has quite a few awesome action scenes that are enjoyable to watch, so two thumbs up from me. And the actors did a nice job with their roles.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Sahara" is not a brilliant movie.  Its plot, to the extent there is one, is ridiculous and chock full of as many laughable and astounding coincidences as any Bond film.  Perplexingly popular Penelope pairs poorly with Matthew McConaghy.<br /><br />And yet, this movie works for what it is, and is an enjoyable and good-natured action picture.  If you turn off the logic part of your brain (and you will have to), the picture doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps moving at a good pace, and has a good sense of humor.  Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaghy are excellent, as is William H. Macy.  While not a top-tier actioner, this movie is entertaining, and is at least worth a rent.

Its bang, however, takes place in the twilight of the American Civil War as the Confederate ironclad, "Texas," escapes an attack.  We blitz forward to modern times and are quickly introduced to Eva Rojas(Penelope Cruz), Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino(Steve Zahn), in that order by way of swift-moving events.  The Zahn introduction segues into a slower atmosphere, as we meet William H. Macey, who plays Admiral Sandecker and the geeky Rudi(Rainn Wilson).  We also take a brief gander at the primary baddies and from there, the adventure takes off again.<br /><br />Pitt is in search of the ironclad "Texas," which he, and only he, believes has managed to end up somewhere in Africa.  He coaxes Sandecker into letting him take his private boat to hunt for the ship.  The only catch is that he must bring along Rojas and her companions from W.H.O. looking for a cause and cure for a plague that has stricken Africa.  From this point on, the viewer is fed a steady diet of explosions, old-school cannon fire, gunplay, tricked-out plane wreckage, and African tribesmen.<br /><br />McConaughey has hit a homerun with this flick.  It's the perfect beginning for a new action franchise.  He's almost too clean to play Dirk Pitt, but it's the fact that he IS too clean that makes him perfect for the role.  The character just oozes with the machismo of characters made legendary by the likes of James Cagney.  Even his name, Dirk Pitt, makes one think of a soap opera-like hero who always manages to get away by the skin of his teeth.  Zahn is a complete opposite, making his character the perfect foil to Pitt.  He doesn't look or act like Navy material, but somehow he works perfectly in the role.  His comedic timing throughout the flick is dead on.  Cruz and Macey fill out their respective roles perfectly, with Cruz supplying just enough sexuality and innocence to make Pitt fall for her and Macey sort of bumbling around as the leader of NUMA.  The rest of the cast does a wonderful job, though this is Dirk Pitt's story.<br /><br />As stated before, there are a ton of explosions and plenty of action for any fan of the action genre.  It's pretty much all surface here, but the story is just too fun to turn away.  The comedy relies heavily on the skills of Zahn, but McConaughey doesn't take his character too seriously, reminding us of good ol' Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with Clive Cussler's work, so I don't know how much this contrasts from the books, but as a stand-alone flick, "Sahara" is a breath of fresh air amid a ton of stereotypical action tales.  I highly recommend it to fans of action and comedy.  It's a definite purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Matthew McConaughey, sporting a new moustache and dark hair, plays a treasure hunter who is seeking an iron-clad, Civil-war era ship which he thinks ended up in Africa. (Don't even ask how this could happen!)  He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search.  Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat.  This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining.  If you're not in search of great art, but are looking for an action and adventure-filled evening of entertainment, this just might fit the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt finally comes back to the big screen in the form of Matthew McConaughey.  He is a treasure hunter of sorts, working for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, and aided by good friend Al Giordino (Zahn).  Dirk has been looking for a lost Civil War boat -- in Africa -- for a while.  His boss, Admiral Sandecker (Macy) and Al both think he is crazy, but still he presses on.<br /><br />Eva Rojas (Cruz) is a doctor for the World Health Organization, looking for the source of a new plague in Africa.  Pitt show up in time to save her life, and since they are working in the same area, they decide to team up.  Of course, things are more than they initially seem, and soon Pitt finds himself in the position of having to save the world.<br /><br />"Sahara" stretches the boundaries of believeability, but that is not the movie's fault so much as the source material's.  Clive Cussler novels have a tendency for over the top story lines, but that is part of their charm -- much like James Bond movies.  "Sahara" the movie is a little lighter in tone than the novel, and perhaps that is why the story seems far-fetched at times.<br /><br />McConaughey and Zahn convincingly portray life long friends and adventurers, even if they would not seem like the best choice to fill Cussler's characters.  Their relationship is the centerpiece of the movie, and it is very funny at times.  Cruz is bland as the love interest, and adds little to the movie.  Macy is his usual great self as the grumbling Sandecker.  "Sahara" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  I had some worries after seeing the trailers, given that I have read all the books, but director Breck Eisner pulls it off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chances for a sequel are slim to none despite the amount of material available from Clive Cussler.  During the production of the movie, the producers and Cussler had a falling out over the direction the film was heading and there are lawsuits pending.  My recommendation is to enjoy this Dirk Pitt adventure, because it might be the last for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I was really excited to see this movie because I had such a fun time seeing National Treasure, another good action/adventure type flick. This one isn't quite as good as National Treasure (so what if I like Nick Cage better??!!) but I still had a great time-- the action, the stupid sidekick, the foreign chick, this movie has it all.<br /><br />Dirk (McConaughey) works for NUMA (I forget what that stands for). Basically, he's a treaure hunter. His best friend is played by Steve Zahn-- these two have great chemistry. Dirk has been searching for a long lost ship, supposedly stranded somewhere in Africa. A girl is tossed into the mix, a worker for the World Health Organization played by Penelope Cruz. She's looking into some kind of outbreak that is killing hundreds. The three get tangled up together, Dirk still seeking his treasure while helping the girl figure out the source of this disease. It gets more complicated, though nothing that will hurt your brain, but it's all good fun.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty fun movie. Awesome on the big screen, one of the great reasons to see it at the theater. I love how everything is connected and is wrapped up in the end, even if it is a bit extreme and far-fetched. That's what movies are, after all. If you don't like action, see this movie for McConaughey's tan, buff body. Or Zahn's comic zaniness, which is just fantastic (he loses his hat three times in this movie, all of which are big deals, to him at least!!). RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.<br /><br />"Sahara" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask "how," because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.<br /><br />These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner ("Thoughtcrimes"). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the "Panama," which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, "Whatever happened to saving the best for last?" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in "Raiders of the Lost Arc," so why should that happen here? Granted, "Sahara" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than "National Treasure," probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).<br /><br />Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that "Sahara" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I gave it five stars because I would normally give it three or four, but some people were overally rude in their evaluation of the movie and their ratings uncalled for in this case. This is the kind of movie I grew up on at Matinees. It is about time they brought it back. Fans of the Indiana Jones movies or "National Treasure" will probably like it. The outstanding cast is the best thing. Penelope Cruz was the exception, because her performance was decent, not great. They could not have picked a better group to play the parts. They are all scene stealers that can ham it up with the best of them. Well written action drama with some comedy thrown in at the right moments.<br /><br />The premise is NUMA treasure hunters have been relatively successful and former SEAL Dirk Pitt, the hansom Matthew McConaughey, has his own back story of looking for a Confederate ironclad ship lost during the Civil War. He carries a gold coin that supposedly ties in with its disappearance. The action is almost non-stop when they meet an attractive lady doctor, Penelope Cruz, from the world health organization trying to track down a deadly illness. This is a fairly well made action movie that the whole family can enjoy. The ending hints that the government would pay for future help in similar events, and thus we have an opening for a sequel. I hope they do one, and improve on it. It is a pleasure to watch and I bought a copy for it's replayability. The quality of the DVD is excellent and it has several extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The ability to apply several different concepts into a film requires much skill, as Steven Spielberg does in his Raiders of the Lost Arc (1981), or as Sam Raimi does in his Spider-Man (2002).  Adventure, suspense, comedy, and drama combined into a mix where one single person carries out breathtaking tasks with ease which is a difficult tightrope-balancing act for a director.  The director must juggle several different cinematic elements precisely in order to please a tough audience.  If the director slips, a long fall awaits the director ending with a rough landing.  Sahara tries to deliver such an experience with heroic deeds that deliver action, drama, comedy, and suspense in order to entertain the audience.<br /><br />At the end of the Civil War when Richmond, Virginia, is under attack the ironclad ship Texas is about to embark.  Before the ship is leaving, some Confederate soldiers are loading it with heavy metal boxes, which suggestively contain gold.  The opening with the Texas presents a special effect spectacle where thundering cannons spew out flaming balls at the evading Texas, which also continues throughout the film.  Stealthy the Texas attempts to run the Union blockade by slipping into the night like a submarine on stealth mode eluding the enemy's grasp.  The Texas set up will lead the audience on a treasure hunt in modern times where the story's hero with the absurdly over the top name, Dirk Pitt, ventures into the Western Africa.<br /><br />The opening credits, which follow the Texas escape, provide a quick and intricate character development of Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and his best friend, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), through the mise-en-scene.  The mise-en-scene reveals that Dirk and Al have spent most of their existing lives together.  They have gone through childhood, Navy Seals training, and are currently working together for NUMA where they salvage shipwrecks.  The relationship between Dirk and Al is always tense; much like a relationship between a bickering married couple.  This of course adds a lot of heartwarming humor to the film.  Matthew McConaughey's performance as Dirk is actually very good and fits the spirit of the film, as Steve Zahn contrasts McConaughey's character very well.  Dirk is the hero who always sees the glass half full while his partner in crime is a clear opposite.<br /><br />Dirk and Al are on an assignment in Western Africa for NUMA when Dirk discovers an important clue to the whereabouts of the Texas, which he has been seeking for a very long time.  This notion of the obsessive seeking for a treasure is not a new concept, as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and National Treasure (2004) depict the same obsessive search.  These two goofs, Dirk and Al, also stumble across Dr. Eva Rojas (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) whom Dirk saves from a sure death.  Eva has discovered an epidemic outbreak of a deadly disease that seems to come from the same country where Dirk intends to seek for the Texas.  Together Dirk, Al, and Eva begin to travel upstream of a river with his boss Admiral Jim Sandecker's (William H. Macy) speedboat to find the treasure and the disease.<br /><br />The quest for the gold treasure and the lethal illness is not without trouble, as they will meet people on both quests willing to stop them at all costs.  Luckily, Sahara employs the Navy Seal mystique to a level of super heroic quality, which will miraculously deliver the heroes to their destination.  This is done with a large amount of humor and action, as the film tries very hard to continue in the traditional approach of how many adventure movies attempt to balance comedy with suspense.  The film will turn into a roller coaster that swiftly moves from scene to scene, but does so without risk and suspense.  In addition, the director Breck Eisner moves too swiftly from scene to scene, and in some instances leaves the audience behind in the previous scene without a coherent and visual bridge into the following scene. It makes some scenes feel awkward, which resembles a first draft of a turn paper.  Thus, when Eisner walks out on the tightrope that he only keeps it a couple of feet of the ground he makes the fall funny.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>I really am not into this type of movie at all, but it actually worked for me and I really enjoyed it.  "Sahara" has everything (action, romance, drama and adventure).  Matthew McConaughy plays a swarthy treasure hunter, and Steve Zahn is his delightfully goofy sidekick.  People are mysteriously dying of a disease nobody has been able to diagnose in Mali, and Dr. Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is the doctor out to get find the source.  The trio ends up brought together, running for their lives from the evil masterminds behind the infection.<br /><br />I love this film because it has the combination of droll humor, great action scenes (yes, if you love watching things being blown to smithereens, this is definitely for you!) and gorgeous cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>"Sahara" feels like a combination of "National Treasure" and "Hidalgo". It is a pretty decent film that will be well worth renting once it hits DVD, but I would pass seeing this one in theaters. The acting is good for the most part and the $130 million dollar budget was spent on some good special effects and stunts. I don't regret spending $7.00 on this movie, but it is really nothing memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>This adaptation of Clive Cussler's novel is quite interesting and entertaining. Right away you'll notice Clive's interest in antique cars, and of course his trademark knack for the marine life. To the movie itself it demonstrates excellent motion picture photography, meaning the camera crew was doing an excellent job with excitingly unique shots. Most of it plays in Africa - Sahara - duh ... A lot of action with comedic lines by Steve Zahn's character, but a rather unbelievable storyline which might not be the important issue in this flick. As one of the only - if not the only - female characters in this motion picture, Penelope Cruz doesn't really have a role and her role seems forced. Matt is doing alright as the hero Dirk Pitt trying to launch a career as an action star - and maybe it works ... I'm sure he had fun after he apparently went through a rigorous body workout program to put on some muscle -- and it shows.<br /><br />Why do I give this movie 4 stars? First of all I think this movie should get a PG rating instead of the PG-13 as there's no bad language and no sensual situations -- it's actually a very clean movie ... and this is refreshing and a reminder that Hollywood can produce a fun-filled action movie without foul language and without the usual stupid half-naked babe scenes. I think the concept was executed very well and it has been a while since a nice powerboat like a Donzi or SeaRay has been extensively featured and trashed in a movie and in this flick you get the pleasure of such action. It's well worth watching this movie and my wife said that this is one for our DVD collection whenever it's released on DVD in several months or so. I would say it's a cool motion picture adventure for the whole family, but also noting that a film like this is probably not everybody's cup of tea.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>Near the end of the U.S. Civil War, a Confederate gold-laden ironclad departs Richmond, Virginia under bombardment and steams into the fog of history.<br /><br />In the present, two oceanographers, named Dirk and Al, obsess about finding her.

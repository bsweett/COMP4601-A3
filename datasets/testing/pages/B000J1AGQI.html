After the watershed "Saving Private Ryan", there really may not be much new to say in a large scale war epic.<p>One might certainly gain this impression based upon the many negative reviews of both "Ryan" and this film. Those souls have attempted to brand these two films as cliched and retro-patriotically simplistic. Watching this film as well as listening to director/writer Randall Wallace's superb audio commentary, it becomes apparent that "Ryan" and "We Were Soldiers" can possibly be labeled as cliched because they are both honest and realistic.  We find an example of this in the dialouge uttered by the dying soldiers who often proclaim "Tell my wife I love her." Yes we have heard this time and time again, but that just happens to be frequently what soldiers say in their final moments. Unfortunately when we see the same truth shown too many times, it does become often cliched and redundant. <p>But what else does one want in an honest war film? Perhaps some folks deride this and "Ryan" in favor of the pretentious new agey pseudo Steinbeck-lite ramblings of Terrence Malick's beautifully photographed but muddled, cold and pompous piece of snobbish fluff that was "The Thin Red Line".<p>But I digress, "We Were Soldiers", missing becoming a classic because of its unfortunate timing in coming after "Ryan" still remains a very very good film.<p>I particulary appreciated Wallace's inclusion of footage that raises the humanity and the courage of the NVA regulars. These are not Hollywood stereotyped villians. These soldiers are equally as brave, pious and devoted as the American soldiers. Wallace achieves this balance without resorting to any political posturing. This becomes especially apparent in many scenes, including a remarkably touching quiet scene in which Gibson's (delivering a fine performance) Hal Moore aknowledges the fact that the enemy prays to Diety as well.<p>I also value this film's structure. "We Were Soldiers" shows the homefront as equally as the battlefield. It shows the pre war experience as well as the war and the post war time as well. Wallace, utilizing the real veterans of this battle, seeks to humanize the reality of the war. Again, some might find much of these sequences quaint and simplistic. But they remain true. <p>This film also avoids the cynical, nihilistic and ugly previous portaits of Vietnam soldiers that bombarded us in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. It seemed that the films of DePalma, Stone (except for his excellent "Born On The Forth Of July"- which might be his most balanced film) sought to tear apart and demonize America through the Vietnam soldier. This film seeks again to give them some dignity and honor and finds it in their devotion to their fellow men (and honor of enemy!).<p>What makes "We Were Soldiers" a must own as opposed to a simply must see, is Paramount's (usually incredibly stingy in their packaging) inclusion of a great many extras. As stated earlier, Wallace's commentary is most illuminative. Many of the deleted scenes flesh out the emotional and intellectual impact of the film and are worth watching as well.<p>Give this film a try. It is definately a film that honors the veterans of the war. From both sides of the battlefield.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>WE WERE SOLDIERS is based on the memoirs of then-Lt. Col.

It's the harrowing story of a vastly outnumbered and green 7th Cavalry unit choppered into the field on what quickly becomes a suicide mission.<br /><br />They engage an enemy with 20 years fighting experience that also has the geographical advantage of high ground entrenchment. Reporter/fotog Joe Galloway choppers in just before the worst fighting begins and ends up battling for his life.<br /><br />On 11/15/65, Col. Moore (Gibson) radios a "Broken Arrow" distress call when his troops are being overwhelmed by sheer numbers and it looks like they'll all get slaughtered just as French forces were a decade earlier. The American response is immediate and decisive. Machine gun fire from helicopter warships in co-ordination with accurate artillery barrages turn the tide of battle and decimate the NVA.<br /><br />This most graphic of all 'Nam films has a solid hour of horrendous battles that intercut occasionally with scenes of the pressures wives back home must cope with.

We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles.  It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably "victory" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.<br /><br />Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original).  However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.<br /><br />Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring "his boys" back to the mainland alive.  In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in.  The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.<br /><br />However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently.  Whether it is the physical  @#!*%  of the soldiers in the field, or the mental  @#!*%  of their wives/families back home, this movie really "gets" the emotions of that time period.  Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.<br /><br />Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Although I was initially hesitant to We Were Soldiers thanks to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson at the helm, I was pleasantly surprised at We Were Soldiers, which is an honest to god thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace butchered impressive ancient warfare with horrendous writing and directing, and I don't even want to think about the horrible abomination known as Pearl Harbor.  Luckily, Randal Wallace learned after all those misfires and created We Were Soldiers, which actually honors the soldiers of The Vietnam War, something no other war film has never really done.  The closest thing?  The Green Berets.  Ugh.  We Were Soldiers is graphic, yes, but as some of the other reviewers can attest, this is what it was really like.  This film succeeds because of this, as it does for Vietnam veterans what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 Veterans.<br /><br />We Were Soldiers is much different than other war films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.  While the aforementioned movies do more for me personally, We Were Soldiers is much different from those other films as it gives an honest and straight up thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  It strips away most of the the political and tension that went on during the Vietnam War and focuses squarely on the soldiers and the home front.  No other war film before really did an open letter to the soldiers, and for that reason We Were Soldiers is much more superior to say, Platoon.  Even better, it doesn't make the opposing soldiers seem like inhumane monsters either, but it also takes something's viewpoint to determine that, and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The film also reduces Mel Gibson to merely just acting (both Braveheart and Passion of the Christ seem they were made by a sadist, and one was silly and the other was a glorified snuff film), something that seemed to help The Patriot as well (though that had another problematic Director, Roland Emmerich).  Although I initially was reluctant to watch this movie thanks to Mel Gibson (reasons above), he gives a stoic and reserved performance, very in contrast to his wildly silly Braveheart performance.  I also do think after watching some Mel Gibson movies that South Park's charicture of Mel Gibson is juvenile and childish beyond belief, even though I can't argue with South Park's spot on observation of The Passion of the Christ (hated it as a Christian, hate it as an Agnostic).<br /><br />We Were Soldiers is a dramatization of the Battle of la Drang, based on Hal Moore's account of the battle as written by him.  For the most part, that's pretty much it.  However, We Were Soldiers works because of that, as it gives a sense of what Vietnam war veterans went through.  Another well made part is the home front, which shows what the people at home go through as well.  While I'm not married, I can really sense what it's like when young couples are seperated, and even more what their wives would feel when they learn of the death of their own husbands.  I also liked the feeling of what it is like to tell a young child what war is about, it's no easy feat to explain that to a child.<br /><br />The battle scenes are extremely well made, and while they have a soundtrack, it adds to the carnage.  They are set in winding fields that add extreme confusion, with high doses of napalm and muzzle attacks.  They sound brutal and amazing, and Wallace's direction adds tension and a sense of instinct that other war films don't have.  This film, like other war films of recent memory, are very violent, with people being burned, people's heads being ripped up by machine guns, and skin sliding off of a soldiers who was doused with napalm.  I do have one problem, and that would be the final charge, as the cheesy voice over ruins that battle.  Luckily.  I really can't find fault in the battle scenes, which are first rate.  I certainly think they did an excellent job at making Vietnam warfare seem very real.<br /><br />I'll give the last word to the Vietnam veterans who have spoken well about this film.  We Were Soldiers is quite underrated actually, and the critics who found it cheesy really need to have their tastes checked, in my opinion.  It may not quite stake out new grounds, but it's still an open letter to the Vietnam war and leaves out all of the crappy politics.  All that ____ really doesn't matter anyway, and no matter how it happened, people are killed either way.  Why the hell does it matter.  Ah, I'm ranting.  Just check We Were Soldiers out.  It likely won't soften up to the hardest cynics, but one who can understand the casualties of each side will surely enjoy it.  If anything, the battle scenes are great.  Either way, see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>We Were Soldiers is about a Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore(played by Mel Gibson), commanding officer of one of the infantry battalions, the 1st of the 7th, of the 1st Calvary Division, during a fight in the Fall of 1965,since the book was written by Colonel Moore, now Lieutenant General (retired).  Colonel Moore comes off looking pretty good.  Maybe he was, maybe that's why he made Lieutenant General.<br /><br />All I can say is Hollywood sure loves napalm (it isn't anywhere near as effective as shown in the movie; the Air Force must have paid to have the movie made.  All I can say is that I never had a Phantom stay on station longer than ten minutes and you had to cease firing all artillery and mortars before they'd come in.  All for one or two 500 pound bombs.  Just not worth it.<br /><br />Artillery on the other hand could crank out 60 105mm rounds per minute sustained fire with a battery of six howitzers. . That's with just with the direct support 105mm howitzers in direct support of the infantry battalion, not counting any 155mm or eight inchers.<br /><br />This movie is primarily about the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.  As far as I could tell it was fairly realistic, except that:<br /><br />I never saw the first tracer round fired and no one showed an illumination fire mission.  Useful when you're fighting at night.  They did show the infantry firing their 81mm mortars and their four deuces.  I used these primarily for illumination fire mission, of course I was in Viet Nam somewhat later, in 1969 and 1970, and had some twenty batteries of artillery that could shoot for me.<br /><br />As an artillery officer I'm appalled at how poorly they used their artillery fire support.  I would have relieved my forward observer if that had been mine.  Maybe artillery needs to hire a better PR firm.<br /><br />All-in-all an entertaining movie.<br /><br />The movie is rated R for a reason.  A lot of blood and guts.<br /><br />Gunner  June, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is the true story of the 7th Airborne Cavalry as they landed in Vietnam lowlands at only regiment size...and found themselves under attack by four North Vietnamese divisions! It was the first moment the American military went at the North Vietnamese, mono y mono. It is told as a good, exciting narrative.<p>The battle scenes are fairly well done and you get a glimpse of front line hell, especially for the &quot;lost platoon&quot; that was stranded early in the battle. Also, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said, you get a better side of the North Vietnamese than you do in some films. The book &quot;We Were Soldiers, Once and Young&quot; was written by the American colonel himself and he portrayed or spoke of the enemy in a well meaning tone, and while its hard to have compassion for the North Vietnamese (they are shooting at American soldiers, after all) you get a tiny glimpse at their lives and thoughts, centering around one particular soldier who writes love letters back home (Mel Gibson's character would later personally deliver his diary and letter to his wife after the war).<p>The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the scene with the military wives getting their letters back. Now...it wasn't the fact that they had the scenes at all, in fact I was perfectly fine with it - it showed what wives go through and what the time period then was like - however I guess the real problem I had was the pacing. It seemed to slow things down.<p>But it didn't really affect my thought for the movie too much. I still liked the battle scenes and the characters - in fact, Mel Gibson's character was almost a near mirror of my father. The scene where he explains war to his daughter was almost word for word how my father explained war to me when I was young. They also get military life down fairly well, and I think its good that at least ONE movie out there shows what life is like with a father in the military, and does it in a realistic manner. On a final, unrelated note, I believed &quot;Sgt. McKenzie&quot; was a fitting theme for this movie for its lyrics and meaning.<p>Overall, a good film about one of the most influential albeit underrated battles in American history.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>a powerful, believable film that captures what many consider the actual experience of the war.

The only problem I have with this movie is I can not figure out what he has to say even when he tells you. With the probable exception of "All Quiet on the Western front", most war movies just use war as a back drop to their main purpose as in "Apocalypse Now" (an updated "Hart of Darkness"). This movie has the look and feel of an updated "Green Berets" Pluck out John Wayne and plug in Mel.<br /><br />We know the base story is of the stand off of the NVA at Ia Drang November 1965 against overwhelming odds, with a little help of superior technology. The uniforms and equipment look pretty authentic. The terrain was well done also; it could be the real thing as much as California. Not all of Vietnam is swamp.<br /><br />Even though there is a lot of action (more phosphorus than C4) this is not just a shootemup movie. They also focused on the wives back home, showing how they had to cope with the situation. There were also some cursory sub stories as a combat photographer getting more than he expected.<br /><br />I have the same conundrum as others do that have not been there. The Vietnam I was in (67-68) had a few firefights; but most of the time it was our spies against their spies and there was no front. When we tangled both sides lost an even average of 15% but if you could find them and drop something on them you got your 15% from a safe distance. I was in the special reactionaries and trained for just the situation this movie depicts. I was the RTO and was supposed to fight out and retake the base to not let the NVA get a foot hold. However it never came.<br /><br />One thing you can say about this movie is that you will get involved and almost forget that it is a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>I think that they finally got it right!

In that respect, it's made exceedingly well.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson has been type-casted as the leading hero for movies such as "Braveheart" (which he directed, produced, acted), "The Patriot" & for "We Were Soldiers", he snugged in the role comfortably.  For this offering, he rejoined with Randall Wallace, who penned "Braveheart".  This time, Randall Wallace took the helm, & perhaps, he's been given more flexibility by Mel's film company, Icon Production, & therefore, "We Were Soldiers" was able to shine whereas "Pearl Harbour" wouldn't match.  One of Randall's forte was to give us a glimpse of humanity at work in the war that United States shouldn't be involved at the first place.  For the first time, Vietnamese was shown a matching fighter against US' military might.  We were also brought into the realm of the armies' families witnessing first-hand the wives' initial denial but eventual acceptance of the demise of their husbands (& fathers of their children).  Their greivance were heart-felt & for the first time, we were shown perspective of both Americans & Vietnamese.  I sincerely believe that this movie covered a lot of ground such as bringing to our attention that in a war, it's irrelevant what races they are.  The soldiers are brothers in arms, & they are fighting the war as Americans & therefore, in time of dire needs, it's their duty to look after one another.  The movie questioned the need of fighting someone else's war, & brought to surface the treatment of soldiers when they returned from Vietnam, friendly fire.  In the end, when we were shown the Memorial at Washington by Maya Lin then, we would start to appreciate the poignancy but continuing legacy of America's foreign policy.  Highly recommended but not for the faint-hearted.  It's good to see Madeline Stowe back to the silver screen again, & the leading lady from TV series, Felicity acting in a feature movie, & what a display of talent from Nina from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, & other supporting cast were simply splendid</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>As I watched the progression of the battle in this movie, I felt a true sense of anxiety.  This is one of those films that really take you in - and when it's over, you snap out of it and realize where you've been for the past hour and a half.  Wow!<br /><br />The acting, the story and the battles are all so stirring.  Mel Gibson plays this weighty role wonderfully.  Supporting roles by Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot and Chris Klein also help to express the amazing courage these soldiers possessed.  Very moving.<br /><br />Making a movie about such important and sensitive subject matter must be unbelievably daunting.  This movie both entertained me and disturbed me more than any war-themed movie I'd ever seen.  That is precisely why I know it was done successfully.  This film will take you as close as most of us will ever get to war, thank God.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal.  Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it.  I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films.  He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it.  And about one and all he says: "It wasn't like that."<p>He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought.  He said, "They finally got it.  That's what it was like.  All the details are right.  The actors were just like the men I knew.  They looked like that and they talked like that.  And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew."  The he was silent for a long time.  At last he said, "You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off?  Something like that happened to me once.  It was at a helicopter crash.  I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off.  It looked just like that, too.  I've never told any one about it."<p>In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground.  And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful.  Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film.  It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.<p>Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds.  Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield.  The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue.  The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a "you are there" quality that is very powerful.<p>Randy did have a criticism.  "I don't think there would be time for casualty telegrams to actually get home while the battle was going on," he said.  "After all, it only lasted three days."  I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place.  And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd.  But these are nit-picky quibbles.  WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie.  I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: "It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie.  I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie.  But they get everything right.  That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen."</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The title of the memoir that inspired this film, "We Were Soldiers Once...And Young," written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  "We Were Soldiers," adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.<p> It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.  The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things:  That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.  <p> With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, "Pearl Harbor" and "Black Hawk Down"-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, "Pearl Harbor" is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas "Black Hawk Down" put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it.  <p> The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the "whole story," that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.<p> Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.<p> Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.<p> The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed "Too Tall" Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like "We Were Soldiers," is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang : The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam" was written by Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway. A bestseller when first published it is the story of the first significant engagement between American troops and the Viet Cong, which took place between October 23 and November 26, 1965. Moore was the commander of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, and Galloway was the only reporter present throughout the 34 days of the battle. The Battle of Ia Drang in the central highlands of Vietnam is considered the first time and place where helicopter-based, air-mobile operations were used in combat. However the technological advancements of war become secondary to the story of over 400 U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 of the enemy. Heroism under relentless fire becomes the true story of the book and the main virtue of this 2002 film from director Randall Wallace ("The Man in the Iron Mask"). <p>"We Were Soldiers" assumes that the audience does not know about the book on which the film is based; it toys with the audience several times with setting up Moore (Mel Gibson) to be killed. Moore knows history and cannot help but wondering if he is also leading the 7th calvary into a massacre just like Custer in 1876; however, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) pointedly reminds Moore of that fact the colonel ain't Custer. The backbone of the story is Moore's promise to his men that he would be the first one on and the last one off the battlefield and not even orders from his superiors, who do not want to have an American lieutenant colonel killed during a massacre, are going to get him to break his word. But ultimately the entire purpose of this film is to provide a realistic portrait of ground combat during Vietnam and drive home the fact that these soldiers were not fighting and dying for their country but for each other. This particular firefight lasts three days and nights, 56 straight hours of nonstop battle, and time and time again you become convinced that none of these soldiers are going to get out of there alive. <p>The battle is juxtaposed with scenes of Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe), who is forced to deliver the telegrams announcing the death of their husbands to their widows because the Army was using taxi cabs drivers. Like a similar scene in "A League of Their Own," such scenes violate our scene of propriety, ingrained in countless other war movies from "The Fighting Sullivans" to "Saving Private Ryan," that the military has a moral imperative in sending officers out to deliver such shattering news in person. However, we end up getting the idea that these telegrams were being sent while the bodies of these men were still lying in body bags on the battlefield. <p>Hal Moore, who retired as a Lt. General, gave "We Were Soldiers" his stamp of approval as the first Hollywood film to get what fighting was like in Vietnam, which is good enough for me. Watching this film while American troops are again fighting and dying in a war on the other side of the globe makes it even more potent. The performances are uniformly good, with Barry Pepper as the reporter Galloway, who distinguishes himself both with his camera and an automatic rifle during the battle, Greg Kinnear as head chopper pilot Major Bruce Crandall, and Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan, the wife of a young 2nd Lt. who sees her husband go off to war right after she had given birth to their first child. My only major complaint about this film is that the score by Nick Glennie-Smith often overwhelms the scenes of battle with music that provides a discordant apotheosis. I can totally appreciate the idea of not providing heroic music, but what we have here goes too far in sanctifying the action. The blood and the guts being displayed by heroic actions and brutal deaths on screen do that without needing the music; just watch the "Broken Arrow" chapter for proof. <p>Before the final credits the film shows the names of the soldiers who died at L-Z X-Ray ; even more poignant is the fact that there names are inscribed on Panel 3 East of the Vietnam War Memorial, because there were so many panels that follow (70 in all inscribed with 58,000 names). Ultimately, "We Were Soldiers" avoids taking a political stance on the war beyond what is brought to the experience by the audience (the most political scene with Moore debriefed by McNamra & Westmoreland is one of those deleted). Moore's battlefield counterpart, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duong) is presented as a dedicated, competent leader (the scenes in his underground command post also provide us our clearest understanding of what is actually happening on the battlefield). When Moore looks at the diary of a Vietcong soldier who almost killed him, he finds a picture of a woman, who to my eye anyway looks like Moore's own wife. The symmetry makes it perfectly clear that the troops on the other side were soldiers too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Those of us who have seen war keep seeing it. In the silence of the night, we still hear the screams.&quot; <p>War is hell, and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; spends its entire relaying this brutal truth in a story that overflows with patriotic zeal, a convincing sense of chaos, and a harsh depiction of the physical reality of combat conditions. Like Ridley's Scott's &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; released in the holiday stretch of 2001, writer/director Randall Wallace, in his directorial debut, is careful to remind us of the emotional impact of war rather than sacrificing it for effects and thrills. <p>It seems that Wallace has learned from previous misfires: the story, adapted from the novel by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway, is everything that Wallace's previous script, &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; was not. Beginning with the introductions to military life as seen through the eyes of various soldiers and officers, we are given a unique opportunity to become involved in their family lives, bearing witness to happier times before President Johnson orders reinforcements into Vietnam. <p>Mel Gibson is cast as Harold Moore, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, arriving on base with his wife, Julie (Madeleine Stowe), and five young children. Among those singled out by the story to provide emotional connections are young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) and his expecting wife, Barbara (Keri Russell), Maj. Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear), who shows a great deal of devotion to duty, and Sgt-Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott), who exacts a brutish demeanor as a result of decades of wartime experience. <p>After a montage of tearful goodbyes that pull at the heartstrings with all their might, Wallace's film nosedives into the hellish combat of the Battle of Ia Drang, as Moore's soldiers are choppered in under heavy fire from the soldiers of the Viet Cong. After splitting into divisions, several men are surrounded, many of whom are seriously wounded, leading Moore to regroup and make attempts to rescue his entrapped soldiers, all the while battling forces surrounding his own. <p>These brilliantly photographed and acted scenes of battle are some of cinema's most memorable, charged with physical intensity that practically jolts the audience with each explosion and gunshot. Wallace brings the viewer into the experience rather than making him a sideline witness to it, wrapping us in a continuous onslaught of sensory perception, from startling images of bloodshed and mangled bodies, to the non-stop firing of machine guns and heavy artillery. <p>Accompanying such moments are a constant reminder of the emotional loss and grievances one goes through in times of war. We see young reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper) befriending a Japanese-American soldier in the middle of combat; ten minutes later, he's rushing towards a rescue chopper, his bloodied friend hanging loose in his arms. We see the tear-strained faces of wives informed of their lost husbands. We see these soldiers, once young, their innocence stripped from them as they stare into the eyes of the enemy, and instantly, the emotional magnitude of such an event becomes a stark reality.<p>But through it all, we see something richer, something well-defined, something forgotten in much of the modern war drivel that has graced the silver screen in years past. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; not only packs a physical and emotional punch, but brings to light an overwhelming aura of patriotism that is evident in the heroic acts of its characters, a sense of duty and devotion that makes the movie's dialogue ring true in every way, shape and form.  <p>In playing Harold Moore, Mel Gibson recalls the glory and presence of his performance in &quot;Braveheart;&quot; his ability to juxtapose a stern demeanor with true, heartfelt displays of emotion hasn't lost its luster. The under-used Madeleine Stowe portrays Julie as a strong-willed military wife, while Keri Russell makes good use of her onscreen time. Each of the cast members who make up Moore's cavalry give heartfelt performances, most notably Barry Pepper as Galloway, whose narration bookends the film. <p>Movies like &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; benefit from a connection to reality. The inclusion of characters Moore and Galloway serve to remind us of the factual basis for the stunning visual and emotional assault that conveys war and those affected by it. Wallace's film, while being a great tribute to those who fought for a war still misunderstood by many, is a patriotic display of courage, heroism, honor, and the knowledge that for those who have seen war, victory is bittersweet.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>"We Were Soldiers" is a Viet Nam War movie unlike any other. Other movies of this genre, exceptional films like "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" or even "The Green Beret" focus on a message of either anti or pro the Viet Nam war. This movie focus on the brave soldiers who fought and the families they left behind. It is the story of Lt. Col.Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson and his troops as they are among the first Americans to be in battle against North Viet Nam in the early stages of the war.<br />After the opening scenes of the men finding out they will be deployed and some very touching moments as they spend their last few days with their families, they leave for their target, the la Drang Valley. The encounters with the North Vietnamese are very violent and graphic, but depict the horror that these men went through. There is a poignant moment where a photographer (Barry Pepper) who has been put in the position of fighting, lays his gun down, picks up his camera and shoots the atrocities he see around him. (By the way this photographer, Joe Galloway co authored with Moore the book this film is based on.)<br />On the other side of the world, while these brave men fight, the wives have already started recieving the dreaded telegrams. You cannot help but feel for these grieving woman and their families.<br />This film is a real tribute to the Viet Nam Vets, and they should be remembered well.<br />The cast also includes Sam Elliot as the rough gruff Sgt Major, Madeline Stowe as Moore's wife, and with Greg Kinnear and Chris Klein. It was directed by Randall Wallace (writer of Braveheart)<br />The DVD (Paramount Widescreen Collection) is 5 stars in my book. Excellent cinematography, the 5.1 surround sound was perfect, I felt like the war was going on right in my living room,the widescreen picture was top rate, even the night time scenes were clear and bright. If you have already seen this movie and are wondering about the DVD go for it! There are lots of extra goodies too, including commentary,deleted scenes and behind the scenes. There are subtitles in English for those that may need them. If you havn't seen it and like war movies, (this one is very graphic, so it is not for the sensitive)you will be captivated by this one.<br />thanx laurie</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I haven't read the book that this movie is based on, so unlike reviewer Russell Ross, I have nothing to compare it to....<p> Judged on it's own, We Were Soldiers is a tremendous movie, telling the story of 400 Air Cavalry Soldiers who spent three days waging a horrific battle with over 4,000 Vietnamese Soldiers. The courage and heart that our Soldiers displayed is wonderfully portrayed, and Mel Gibson does his usual great job as their Commanding Officer. (Sam Elliott is also great as his second-in-command...) We also get to see another, seldom-seen side of the Vietnam War- The Home Front, where wives and families lived in fear of a telegram from The Army...<p> The movie's violence is VERY graphic, but war is hell, so....<p> We Were Soldiers gives us another view of America's most unpopular War, and in this time of increased patriotism, it's a welcome view at that. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>No matter what anyone says about Mel Gibson's real life, he knows how to make a movie that moves you. And is real. And holds no punches.<br /><br />Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, Apocalypto, all are REAL life, and he films them true, emotional, and as bloody as the times they portray.<br /><br />All the details can be found on other reviews...the dates, the names. I only want to review the emotions of this movie, and its quality. Because it is the emotions of Vietnam, that we carry to this day.<br /><br />When I was 17, I had already had my first two induction `interviews'. I was 2 weeks from being inducted. I had scored 99% on the tests and was told I was going to be a 2nd Lt., which meant an immediate detail to the front line as cannon fodder. My neighbor, Steve Buck, came home from Vietnam after 4 years. He was there as an adviser, and he was a Seal. Steve was involved some of the very first Viet/American confrontations. His stories were of blood and horror, and of futility. He lived across the street from my family, and we heard his nightmare screams in the middle of the night. His nightmares were horrible. As a young man who abhorred war, I tried to ask him what awaited me. The talks were usually accompanied by his bursting into tears for the friends he lost. His answers were about the closeness of his fellow grunts, the BOND between soldiers, that they were closer than family, and the ideal that they lived together or died together, at least in the beginning. Later, it became just the desire to survive.<br /><br />This film shows the first confrontations. When the idealism of One Unit to live or die existed.;..when commanders were the father to the grunts. It also shows the men as fathers, especially Gibson's scenes with his family before he is sent to fight.<br /><br />Gibson shows that early war dedication as Lt Hal Moore, in charge of troops surrounded by the enemy (a la `The 300'). He is repeatedly told to abandon his troops, but refuses. Instead of the usual Pretty Boy role, Gibson is hard and gritty, as he was in Braveheart. It is Lt. Moore's dedication to his men that is the whole point of this film.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear shows his acting skills as the helicopter pilot who refuses to abandon the trapped squad. Anyone who doubts Kinnear can carry a role must see this film. The empathy he shows for the ground troops is almost overwhelming,<br /><br />The soundtrack is moving. the cinematography is exact, and the brutality is not skirted. The color is artfully washed during the battle scenes to show the darkness of battle and death. But at the same time, the blood is  scarlet to highlight the pain and horror.<br /><br />If you are into war movies, I advice this film, as well as `Saving Private Ryan', and `Full Metal Jacket'. These films deal with the emotions of war.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I have to confess that I wasn't quite prepared for this film. I was expecting something at least decent, but instead saw what I believe to be one of the best war films that I have ever seen.<p>This is the latest in a string of films that attempts to make the combat sequences as accurate and as life like as possible. I have read a number of books about wars, warfare, and battle, and in them one constantly reads about the amount of smoke that there is on a battlefield. Most films take cinematic liberties, however, making the battlefield as clear as possible in order that the viewer can follow the action. In WE WERE SOLDIERS, however, much of the battle takes place is an artificial fog. <p>One of the best things about this film, as opposed to other battle films, is that you get to see how the battle looked from both sides. The Vietnamese are not presented as faceless, almost inhuman forces as in most films, but we get to see them as human beings, and their own strategy and tactics are displayed. One shot in particular stood out for me. A Vietnamese soldier pauses in the hollowed out part of a tree, breathing hard, changing the clip on his rifle, and then putting on the bayonet. Then, he stands for a second, battling his fear, before forcing himself to move from cover and attack. You can probably count the number of war films on one hand that would have portrayed the enemy in such a human light.<p>The film as a whole, despite containing some very intense battle sequences, is as concerned to focus on the human dimension as much as the military. This may be the most purely emotional war film that I have ever seen. It is also filled with many individuals acts of moral courage, such as when Col. Moore's wife demands that the cab company deliver all the telegram's from the war department to her instead of the individual wives, telegram's that informed them of their husbands' deaths. <p>The cast was, for the most part, excellent. Mel Gibson was as solid as usual. Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him. He has been thoroughly enjoyable in everything I have seen him in. Sam Eliott has always been on of my favorites, and he stood out in this one as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley. <p>A very good movie, and while I would caution that it is very, very violent, and graphically so, I would also urge anyone who has been putting this one off, to give it a try. I think they will be moved and astonished.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I "was" in the 60's, and knew the Vietnam war well, as well as, friends that went, and some that didn't come back.

The officers are not portrayed as glory seeking medal hunters (except for one).  The soldiers aren't high on dope.  The Vietnamese actually were portrayed as humans.

Director Randall Wallace tells the tale of the Seventh Cavalry (Custer's Cavalry) as it fought a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army in a battle that meant nothing in a tactical sense in the Vietnam of 1964.  There are two perspectives.  One is from an American colonel played by Mel Gibson while the other is from his adversary, a Vietcong colonel played straight by Don Duong, without the bucktoothed screechiness of a former generation's Asian army commander. Despite the different uniforms and political philosophies of both Duong and Gibson, they are more alike than each would probably care to admit.  Both are dedicated and experienced leaders of men and neither is willing to allow personal feelings to get in the way of the killing business that is war.  <p>WE WERE SOLDIERS is seemingly no more than the tale of a regiment of soldiers that covers first their training for battle, then later the battle itself.  But as in many war movies, the complexity of the war is only slowly brought into focus.  Director Wallace, in addition to showing the Vietnamese side through many vignettes that parallel the strategy sessions of the Americans also shows the wives and families of the soldiers.  Madeline Stowe is particularly effective as Gibson's wife who knows only all too well that the fortunes of war are sometimes reduced to the cliche of insensate luck as the determining factor in who comes home in one piece and who does not.  It is she who takes on the onerous burden of delivering the telegrams of death to the wives of her husband's soldiers.  The large cast includes a sterling performance by Sam Elliot, as an experienced sergeant-major who helps his men retain both life and sanity in the insanity of hand to hand combat. <p>What emerges as a subtext is the unsettling notion that in combat the enemy often differs more from us by the color of uniform worn than by anything else.  The extremely realistic scenes of bodies being ripped to pieces make the viewer care that some soldiers are being killed by some other soldiers, while not particularly caring about the colors of their uniforms.  The 'We' of WE WERE SOLDIERS is a sobering reminder that we should be glad that killing is so horrible, else we might grow overly fond of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie begins by depicting the family lives of Mel Gibson and the men he would lead into battle.  Gibson's character is depicted as a compassionate family man and an officer who vows to physically lead his men into battle.  When he arrives in Viet Nam, he and his inexperienced troops are sent on a mission which is almost doomed to failure because of the inequality of their numbers compared to the Vietnamese.  As the battle rages and men fall, scenes are shown of their wives receiving the telegrams which inform them of their husbands' deaths.  The viewer learns to care about these men and then sees many of them killed in combat.  This is a sad tribute to the heroes who died in that battle and those who survived to tell us the story.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This film represents a wonderful example of how well Hollywood can sometimes transform the truths and spirit of a book into a moving and inspiring experience. It is a terrific period piece in the sense that it captures the essence of a now long-gone spirit of concern and empathy that older and compassionate senior officers had for their soldiers. Mel Gibson seems to be aging very well as evidenced by his wonderful characterization of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, a career Army officer who lives both fully and well, but who is at the same time also totally devoted and committed to meet the responsibility he's entrusted with in terms of the welfare of his officers and men. <p>The movie, based on the historical fact of the first large scale engagement by American soldiers with the regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA), as opposed to the clashes with the guerilla-style Viet Cong later on, traces the extensive training and preparation of the regiment in the experimental use of helicopters to transport soldiers rapidly into enemy-held areas. The risks associated with this new style of tactical warfare quickly becomes apparent; eight to ten serial efforts are required to fully mobilize the unit, and the men first dropped find themselves dangerously exposed in the event a vastly superior enemy force engages. Of course, this is exactly what happens, and the brutal exchange that then ensues is the backdrop for the movie.<p>Over a period of some five days, the encircled American forces lose almost half their personnel, yet are able to kill more than 1,800 of the attacking Vietnamese soldiers. Seen in the cold light of day, this exchange becomes a de-facto documentary on the inherent risks of combat, and the quicksilver nature of modern warfare. The cast helps here, for veterans like Sam Elliot (as the Sgt. Rock-like Sergeant Major) and Barry Pepper (as the UPI reporter who forges a life-long friendship with Wallace and helps to write the book) add to the sense of gritty reality the film captures so well. Madeline Stowe is also very good as the enduring wife of the Colonel who also acts to lead the women of the organization in the men's absence. Like another recent movie, "Black Hawk Down", this film helps to de-mystify modern warfare without glorifying or judging it. This is a wonderful film, and one I heartily recommend. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is a U-turn for American films about Vietnam.  For years, the best flicks about the war highlighted the nation's disillusionment and cynicism about our involvement in Southeast Asia -- &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; leave the viewer bereft, wondering how to deal with that ball of ice in your stomach.  But each of these films looks back with regret, wtih &quot;if we only knew the truth at the beginning, we wouldn't have gotten involved over there in that hideous war.&quot;  <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers,&quot; on the other hand, captures the America at the beginning of the Vietnam conflict.  Most of the soldiers are the earnest, happy-go-lucky young guys we got in the John Wayne war films . . . before they go off to war, they sing and dance with their wives and girlfriends, and they show an innocent heroism under fire.  Only the senior officers, played by Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott, know the truth about war and how savage the Vietnam conflict will be. Mel, as the senior commander, gets a bit jingoistic at times, but that his depiction is apparently dead-on for those who know the real-life commander (who was a consultant on the film).  Sam Elliott, as the grizzled second-in-command, is a wonder -- he stalks the movie with a barely concealed fury, terrifying his own soldiers, but has a moment of exquisite tenderness and leadership with one of his boys.  <p>Like the young soldiers, the audience gets its education on how the conflict will be -- the Vietnamese, who are given a humanity rarely seen in Vietnam movies, still charge with near-suicidal determination.  We see napalm in its hideous applications.  We see the terror of a unit cut off from the main force overnight.  We are stunned by seeing what men can endure and we despair because no man should have to experience the hell of that battlefield.  <p>The movie truly shines with its parallel storyline of the wives and girlfriends back in Georgia who wait for news of their loved ones in combat . . . or, more accurately, pray that they do not receive news.  The movie's most touching scenes revolve around the delivery of the &quot;We regret to inform you . . . &quot; telegrams announcing the death of another soldier to their families.  Anyone who can watch these scenes without heartache has not heart.<p>The DVD also contains some nice extras, including deleted scenes with director's commentary.  It's always interesting to hear why certain scenes didn't make it into a good story, and while some of the deleted scenes were quite good, it's hard to quibble with the explanation.</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>As a son of a Vietnam Vet, I get the luxury of getting feedback on how realistic war movies really are.  When he took me to go see We Were Soldiers, his first comments was on the terrain.  He said it looked as though it was filmed in California.  But that was the only fault we found.  The combat sequences were excellent and truely realistic, you really had to make sure you own Hueys and planes did NOT shoot at you instead of the enemy.  <p>The helicopter crash was the most realistic one I've seen yet in a war movie where when they crash they don't erupt in a ball of flame but the emmit severl bursts or sparks and the props spin off, the Hueys don't just explode and this was something which the producers worked really hard on and we could tell. <p>And the NVA and the Viet Cong really did send their troops out as if they were nothing more then dust.  The mentality was there would always be more troops and that was another really good point the movie made.  All in all, a great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I expected something more, something akin to "Saving Private Ryan".....but it wasn't to be.....although this DVD wouldn't be part of my collection if I didn't like it. Also, I hear the Blu-Ray version is excellent so that's tempting to buy.<br /><br />"We Were Soldiers" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War.  Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer.<br /><br />It's  this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not "Saving Private Ryan."  The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an "excellent" film.<br /><br />Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is essentially a Vietnam War prequel.

Smart, brave and handsome without the baggage that typically goes with that.<p>Perhaps not as accurate as "Black Hawk Down" nor as emotional as "Saving Private Ryan".

In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.<p>Also, I'm positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.<p>Just a note: what's wrong with Madeleine Stowe's mouth here? Have someone noticed that? There's something werong with her lips!</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, "We Were Soldiers" recounts the first significant engagement between American and Vietnamese soldiers in 1965. In terms of realism and intensity, the battle scenes are truly state-of-the are and easily merit the same encomia as those in "Black Hawk Down" and "Saving Private Ryan." From a human interest perspective, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the anguish of military families who must face the fear and reality of their loved ones dying in battle. And to the film maker's credit they make a significant effort to portray the Vietnamese enemy as good guys who were just doing their thing. <p>Oddly enough, the part of this movie I object to the most is the one that is frequently showcased in trailers and talk shows. In this scene, the protagonist, played by Mel Gibson, is asked by his daughter why people fight wars. He responds that war is what happens when bad men try to hurt other men and men like her daddy try to stop them. With these words, Mel Gibson not only provides his young daughter with an understandably innocent description of warfare in general, he also distills the entire theme of "We Were Soldiers" into a single sound byte. Mel Gibson is telling us that the Vietnamese were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys who were trying to stop them.<p>These lines disturb me when I consider the context in which this film was made. "We Were Soldiers" is following the newly blazed trail of neo-war movies that began with films like "Saving Private Ryan". This film and the World War II films that followed reversed three decades of objective, analytical war films such as "Tora Tora Tora", "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon", and "Casualties of War" and instead replaced them with a sentimental, jingoistic view of American military action. This was acceptable enough with "World War II" because there really isn't too much trouble distinguishing between right and wrong in that event. With "We Were Soldiers", however, Hollywood has now attempted to reshape the public's understanding of the Vietnam War along similarly benign and simplistic guidelines. <p>At this point, many readers are probably thinking, "but this is a true story! How can you possibly state that it is misleading?" This is a perfectly valid question to which I would respond first that this film is based on a book which is itself misleading in many ways, and second, it is the EXCLUSION of facts that makes this film misleading. "We Were Soldiers" presents American troops as benign interventionists in a conflict they new little about. In doing this it excludes some ugly realities about what American presence in Vietnam meant for millions of Vietnamese. To begin, with the U.S. Congress estimates that in the course of the war the United States killed approximately 1,350,000 civilians, by all accounts a highly conservative estimate. In addition, there are numerous well documented instances crimes perpetrated by the American military against Vietnamese civilians including rape, murder, theft, unlawful imprisonment, the destruction of farmland, torture, contamination, and forced prostitution.<p>While "We Were Soldiers" is wonderful for all the reasons that an action packed, loosely historical film should be,  it is also problematic. If after seeing this film, you do not want to do some research in the library or online, at least see some films that offer different perspectives of the war. I know that for many of our veterans, unjustly blamed for something that was largely the fault of American politicians this film must seem like a welcome relief. Our veterans do deserve to be acknowledged, and its high time the nation apologized to them for the blame it heaped upon them for doing their duty. But distorting America's role in Vietnam by focusing exclusively on the heroics does not do them a favor. It does the entire country a great disservice.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>This is a truly exciting and emotional film that is full of outstanding acting and thrilling battle sequences! But be warned right now: the brutality of the battle scenes were the reason this film recieved the much-deserved R-rating. Definitely not for little kids! A very outstanding Vietnam war movie that is not an anti-war film. God knows we don't need an anti-war film at this time!

Overall, the story was good, and it was just passionate scene with Mel and Pepper at the end. I bought this for my HD Collection and I'm happy to say that it was worth the purchase!  Although, its not the best HD DVD Movie that I own, it is certainly a great movie about a war.  Keep me at the edge of my seat! Good war movies, and I hate war movies, but it drew me in every minute.  Atleast give it a watch to see if you would like it before you by the Standard or HD version.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be simply amazing. As a great fan of war movies, once again i saw the terrible tragedy that humans can account for. Mel Gibson is such a great hero, caring about his men, and the movie is sad, shocking, yet worst of all bassed on true events, that made me feel sad for those who died in the Vietnam war. Only those who's life it touched can really feel the tragedy but this  movie made me respect what peace is today.<br />I highly reccomined it to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; manages to show the brotherhood between soldiers, the horror of war, and the commaraderie between the soldier's wives. The film is set in 1965, when America was at war with Vietnam. The commander of the air calvary is Lt. Col. Hal Moore ( Mel Gibson). Moore is a natural born leader and treats all of his soldiers like they were his own family. He is assigned to take his troops into hostile territory, to gain the upper hand. However, things do not go as planned, and the casualties start to mount. Back at home, Moore's wife Julia (Madeline Stowe) takes on the responsibility of keeping morale high for the soldiers' wives and handing out the death letters that are sent. The film is shot brilliantly and takes us back and forth between the two, to let us truly experience what happened. <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is one of the best war films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore's book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once.. and Young&quot;. This provides for an amazingly accurate portrayal of the events that took place. The battle sequences are among the best that I have ever seen, and the camera work used was phenomenal(especially in the air). The musical score used was beautiful and one of the best that I have ever heard. But perhaps the best aspect of this film, was that it showed that there was more than one side to the war. Most war films only show American soldiers fighting and trying to win the war. This was the first war film, that took an in depth look at the Colonel of the Vietnamese army, and how he strategized. That was my favorite aspect of the film, because it put Colonel against Colonel. But it did not just show each sides strategies. The film also shows what both sides went through as well. We see that Vietnam was a country fighting to defend itself just like us, and like us, they also suffered. This gives the film a more well rounded feel to it. <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; offers tons of star power as well. Mel Gibson shows once again why he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore is sensational. He gives an extremely accurate portrayal of the man, with his overall intelligence, his courage under fire, and his unending loyalty towards his troops. &quot;I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.&quot; Definately one of Gibson's best roles since Braveheart. Madeline Stowe is outstanding as Moore's wife Julie. The way that she keeps morale high with the soldier's wives is amazing. Very convincing role. Sam Elliot is very good as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley. Plumley is Gibson's right hand man, and never leaves his side. He is also very tough, and corageous under fire. Other fine performances were given by Greg Kinnear, Chris Kline, Keri Russel, and Barry Pepper. <p>Overall, this is one of the best all around war films that I have ever seen. The film is extremely realistic, takes an in depth look at both sides of the war, and has outstanding acting all the way around. The DVD is outstanding. It offers extremely nice picture and sound quality, that only makes watching the film even better. The extras are incredible. You get 10 deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, and commentary by director Randall Wallace. You will not be dissapointed with this film, and I consider it a must own.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>Silence. Complete silence. As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French. The opening sequence is a massacre ten years prior to the Vietnam conflict involving the French. It establishes what the American's would have to face later. As the American soldier's begin to fall, telegram's arrive back on base notifying their wives of their death. The band that the women formed was also inspiring, and how unbelievably strong they must have been. Leaving the theater, I told myself never to forget We Were Soldier's, nor the sacrifice our men, like my own uncle. After watching the world seem to fall apart last year, it's good to remember that even at this moment our men are serving their country every day. Close friend's, and family. Sacrifice's were made in Vietnam for a reason that we are still searching for. If any of our brother veteran's happens to read this simple review, take a higher meaning and the most gracious thought's when I say thank you. They were Soldier's once, and Young. Their youth was lost in the valley's of war, and we owe it to them.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation "the last good war."  What this means is that the "heroes" and "villains" in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.<p>This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans came to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures.  Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like "The Deer Hunter," "Platoon," "Apocalypse Now" etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.<p>The new film, "We Were Soldiers" attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong - in November 1965 - one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word "heroism."  This is what separates "We Were Soldiers" from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In "We Were Soldiers," no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.  <p>Given this self-imposed myopia, "We Were Soldiers," nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  "We Were Soldiers" attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.<p>Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the "death telegrams" to the other wives on the base.  <p>Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.  <p>Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.<p>"We Were Soldiers," for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>The soldiers of Vietnam finally get the credit they deserve in this specatcular and moving portrayal that is free of Propoganda.

Mel Gibson is one of the few actors who could anchor this film with his star persona, but he can't save this film from its own false heart.  The scenes involving the wives of the soldiers, sitting around the coffee table and discussing racial equality, are borderline comic.  As an air force brat, I lived through these years and watched my father leave the house on many mornings -- and I watched my mother's galvanized terror and fear.  There is none of that here.  On the battlefield, the blood virtually never stops flowing, in ways that make you think that the director kept trying to find new, novel ways of making a body explode -- so much so that he actually lets blood drip onto the camera, which of course reminds you that you are watching a movie.  While I admire the man (Moore)behind Gibson's character, the simplistic way in which the Vietnam war and its participants are handled -- including an absurdly PC epilogue involving the Viet Cong leader and an American flag -- felt false at every turn.  It's a big, noisy war epic, signifying nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Randall Wallaces couragous at times haunting story about Lt.<br />Gen Al Moore who led his troops in 1965 in the first major battle<br />of Vietnam is probly the most honest portrayal of Veitnam it is<br />in no way as striking and as brillant as Saving Private Ryan the<br />father of the modern day war film, but it shows Vietnam in a way<br />that it has never been shown before.As a family man Moore is a<br />commited father of his children and a loving husband to his wife<br />,As a soldier he is a caring but gutsy soldier that is willing to<br />do what he is orderd even though it may cost him the lives of his<br />company or his own life.<p>  In 1955 when the French were massacred by the south Vietnamese<br />Lt, Moore knew that they would be calling him to war and he would<br />have to make that solem promise to his company that he would look<br />out for them and bring them back even if any of them fall in war<br />but he never knew that he would have to make them a promise that<br />would happen , In a scene that looks like that of Apocalypse Now<br />the outbound helicopters carry Moore and his men unto the grassy<br />feilds of Veitnam with only one thought in his head how many will<br />not come home to there familys and will he ever get to see his own family again.<p>  Starring into the face of the enimey his men blocked and I'll equiped and seeing them being cut to shreds by enimey fire<br />the promise that he made to his company all but vanished,The<br />soldiers wives unsure that they will see there husbands again<p>children waiting to see if they will ever be able to hug there<br />father again.This deep in Moore mind as he is in a desprate<br />battle that someone orderd him to do but he can't turn back,<br />Wallace also focuses on the enimeys side as we see how the<br />enimey experiences.When it's all said and done Moore wonders<br />why he did not fall insead of his soldiers for they did not<br />come there for honor or country they came there for each<br />other an inspirering and worth while honest portrayal<br />of the Veitnam war and how soldiers delt with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A7PBI5HADJYER.html">A7PBI5HADJYER</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson and company are soldiers surrounded by overwhelming odds in the Ia Drang Valley during the Vietnam War.

There is not one thing they "got right" with this movie.  When I see movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, I am reminded of what great filmmaking involving the Vietnam War can be.  For an author to outright say Hollywood has never produced one film about the Vietnam War with ultimate correctness, I am appalled by the accusation since those last three films I just mentioned have gone on to be some of the most powerful and gripping films of our time-not to mention of the Vietnam War!  After watching "We were soldiers," the directors and writers use every cliche in the book (including cliches innovated from those three films) to tell a story that has been told a million times before and with far better innovation than this tripe of a film!  <p>Let me say this without reservation;  I am in the US Navy and quite simply, watching something like this angers me because it tries too hard to convey a message without taking the really hard roads to tell it.  It's almost presented with too much ease and not enough grit and grime.  I will say, there is one scene where the grit and grime come really close-when Barry Peppers character tries to lift one of his buddies to safety only to accidently pull off charred legs from Nepalm-it's gripping and shocking and the look on Barry Peppers face is brilliant.  Barry Pepper is a really great actor and quite frankly he really holds up a really small and strong character throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I quickly ended up breaking in laughter watching bacon boy look ridiculous with all the obvious layers of make up that was supposed to look like a charred face.  <p>After watching the "making of" documentary on the DVD, my assumptions were correct when they show you a plethora of wardrobe for Mr. Gibson who wore dozens of different uniforms to show the wear and tear of the event.  C'MON!  Why not just have Mel Gibson in one uniform for the entire thing?  Do you see what Hollywood is trying to do here folks?  It's not reality and it's not realistic, it's just a bunch of guys in front of a camera playing war games only with a bunch of caterers standing by and slick and expensive production designl. Even worse, no heartfelt emotion anywhere!<p>The DVD itself poses almost no extras (not even a trailer) and is a letdown considering this movie was a major upset and only raked in a measly 60 million at the box office.  This movie cost almost twice that and I don't see them really making up the cost anywhere on this DVD version.  I am kinda glad this movie didn't go too far.  It doesn't deserve to.  After watching brilliant war films like Saving Private Ryan (depicting WW2) and Black Hawk Down (Gulf War), you know that the story of Vietnam has been appropriately done somewhere else after watching "We Were Soldiers."</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson does it again, moving well above and beyond the "typical" expectations of the war movie genre.  There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said about the story itself.  I would just say that the great strength of this film lies in its focus on the soldiers as real people, with real lives, real families, real personalities, etc.  Gibson did an excellent job of emphasizing the emotional and psychological trauma of war, both for those in the battle and those waiting at home for news.<br /><br />This production was gritty, realistic and hard-hitting, similar to the Private Ryan/Band of Brothers standard for graphic portrayal of war violence.  Actors like Gibson, Kinnear, and Moore gave extemely believable performances, with Harris Pepper's character only marginally less convincing.  Finally, I enjoyed the absence of political commentary or moralizing about the war overall.  The only criticism that came across was directed toward the military leaders who put the 7th Cav. in that position in the first place.  Beyond that, Gibson just told it like it was.  Very well done indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>'We Were Soldiers' is one of the most moving and meaningful war films ever made.  Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people.  You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them.  Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home.  Many films try to do this, not many succeed.  Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families.  While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.<p>Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore.  Gibson masters this role.  We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming.  He became Moore, right down to the way he walked!  Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore.  I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.<p>The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting.  I've never seen anything like it.  I must mention one particularly haunting scene;<br />The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them.  Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy?  "I can smell them, they're here" proclaims one.  They can't see anything.  It's pitch black.  The soldiers can barely breath.  One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at.  The flare come, the woods light up.  The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear.  They are only inches from where they lay.<p>This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'.  It took my breath away.<p>'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film!  I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling.  I wasn't the only one, either.  Grown men were crying as well.  We cried for the lost lives and the pain.  We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made.  This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it.  I honor them.</p></br></body></html>

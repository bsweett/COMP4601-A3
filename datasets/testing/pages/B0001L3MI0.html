Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I still remember very vividly when my mom yelled &quot;Oh My God!&quot; when we watched the preview trailers for this movie around the time it was released. <p>Upon seeing it, I have to say that &quot;Independence Day&quot; is one of the greatest sci-fi action movies that I have ever seen. Seven years later (At the time of this review), this movie still packs a big punch. The story is of when a large and vicious alien race invade the earth through city-sized spacecraft and wage war against Earth's humanity and now the humans all stop fighting each other and join forces to destroy the alien ships and the aliens themselves before they destroy every major city on earth, suck out all of it's resources and move on to the next planet. <p>This is a truly magnificent movie. One of the best of 1996.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>Oh, if only I had been able to see this on the big screen.  What  an experience that would be!  INDEPENDENCE DAY is one of the best movies I've ever seen; I can't think of one single flaw in the film.  Casting is perfect, music is spectacular, and special effects . . . . . . . they simply define the term &quot;special effect&quot;!  No matter how many times I see this movie, they're still just as mind-boggling.  It's no wonder they won an Oscar for them.<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY is nothing short of a miracle.  It takes a plot that had essentially been told countless times throughout the past fifty years, upgrades it with all that has been previously mentioned (along with nerve-wracking suspense and simple, wholesome humor), and turns it into a modern masterpiece of epic proportions.  In my opinion, it should've won Best Picture of 1996!<p>The two-disc Five Star Collection DVD is one of the best ever made.  The making-of documentaries are insightful and very interesting, the &quot;mocumentary&quot; is pretty entertaining, and the menus are just plain awesome!  But the best part of this DVD is the movie itself, as it includes nine minutes of footage not seen in theaters.  Every single new scene/addition brings more depth, characterization, and humor to the story.  The picture and sound quality is nothing short of flawless.<p>It's a real shame this DVD is out of stock on this website.  GET AHOLD OF IT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>ID4 set multiplexes on fire when it was released on July, 1996, mainly due to its irresistible trailer and word-of-mouth hype.  And while the majority of viewers dismissed it as a cliched alien-invasion film, I still stand as one of its defenders.  For sure, it doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Close Encounters...,&quot; but it's still a watchable, above-average flick despite its hokey touches.  The plot is simple: aliens come to earth and destroy major cities around the US (If you haven't seen the picture of the White House blown to bits, you clearly don't get out much).  The president (a Clinton-esque Bill Bullman) calls upon military services to fight these creatures.  That's when a bigshot Marine (Will Smith) comes in to save the day.  That's the plot in a nutshell.  The special effects are good but not great, and the suspense leading to the attack keeps the viewer glued to the story.  Trust me, I have seen far worse &quot;event&quot; summer movies that are doubly unoriginal and rely on cliches that are just as tired.  Yet, ID4 overall succeeds because it doesn't take itself all that seriously.  If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment, this will do.  It's far more interesting than anything Jerry Bruckheimer will ever produce.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>Do not let bad reviews stop you from seeing this movie on DVD. It is the best sci-fi since Alien. War Of The Worlds with a new twist. I do not understand what causes the overpaid reviewers to condemn so many of the sci-fi films of today and praise so many of the so called &quot;movies with a message&quot;. If entertainment is what you are looking for this is a great two hours of intense sci-fi action. Once again i have discovered what the reviews say is bad, i seem to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Okay I know that the title will get many devouted Star wars fans upset and angry and yell &quot;What do you mean this is better then Star Wars?!&quot;  Well Star Wars just didint capture me.  It was OK in my opinion but not that good.  Now Independence day is a fantastic movie that will hook you in the first minute of playing.  Let me say this right off the bat.  This movie has the BEST movie soundtrack I have EVER heard.  It is incredebly patriotic and moving.  It sets the mood perfectly and grips you the minute you hear it.  It is so good in fact, you might expect it to be blasted over big speakers during WWIII battles.  The special effects are spectacular.  The &quot;fire wall&quot; sequence will scare the bejebers out of you.  You will probably be terrified because you feel so sorry for all the people and annimals who face that thing.  The jet-to-alien fighter sequences are stunning.  They may be the best air attack seqeunces ever.  The story is good and moving and will keep you engrossed to the very end.  The last hour or so are by far the best.  The moments when Jeff Goldbloom and Will Smith zoom up into the alien head ship is just incredible.  The last jet battle is incredeble and extreamly well done.  The music also helps a lot here, with incedibly patrisam and heroic tunes.  Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.<p>The Good: The BEST soundtrack EVER made (In my opinion) Stunning attack sequences, awsome special effects<p>The Bad: Some moments are too heart grippingly sad and tragic.<p>And the Ugly: None!</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>This set of DVD's is good but not great as two disc sets go. The three documentaries are good; however, they have a great deal of shared material, so overall you get maybe an hour of new information. The commentary by the director and producer was interesting. Information like the US military did not support the film because Area 51 was mentioned, makes you wonder. Most of the added minutes in the special edition are just extended scenes already in the movie. In some cases this enhances the characters but not by much. Most interesting was the changed ending. I liked the never-seen ending better. The reason it was changed was apparently for believability, but the whole movie was not believable. The picture galleries aren't that good and very short. The special effects commentary could have been better. Most of the interesting information on the special effects was covered very well by the documentaries. Most of the special effects commentary is reduced to the commentators saying, "That's a model," and "That's CGI." Overall, a DVD I have in my collection because I love sci-fi and not for the features, effects or story for that matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>ID4 was a fun event movie.  A popcorn-muncher roller coaster kind of film.  Not one that anyone should bother with thinking about too deeply.  It is the cinematic equivalent of going on a ride at a carnival.  Lots of show,  but not too much else.  That being said, what is interesting is how many  people have had such strong differing responses to this movie.  I've read  several reviews condemning the film for Racial stereotypes, particularly  Will Smith &amp; Judd Hirsch.  And yet in Israel the movie was praised for  these exact same portrayals -- &quot;Here we have a movie in which a Black  man and a Jewish man save the world.&quot;  In other nations of the  Mid-East the film was condemned for that very same reason -- &quot;Only in  America would they dare to make a movie where a Black man and a Jewish man  save the world.&quot;  Several of those countries cut out as much of the  Judaism elements as possible. Another bit of irony is the pro-smoking  message in the movie.  Cigars are regarded as a &quot;victory dance.&quot;  This is ironic because in Dean Devlin &amp; Roland Emmerich's previous  feature, &quot;Stargate,&quot; cigarettes are equated with death. Other  bits of criticism seem unfair.  In one of the reviews above, for example,  the critic mentions how Will Smith just happened upon his girlfriend in the  ruins of L.A.  He missed the part where Smith told her he would meet her at  the Air Force Base.  The film shows her and a few other survivor going to  the base, which was also destroyed.  But Smith did know to go there &amp;  look. I still would like to know how Hirsch &amp; Jeff Goldblum managed to  drive from New York to D.C. in 5 hours, however. One great extra on the DVD  is the alternate ending footage where Randy Quaid flies his Bi-Plane into  battle against the Alien ship.  The directors cut it because, among other  reasons, they felt the sight of an old, outmoded plane flying among  sophisticated F-18s &amp; the alien fighters would be just too silly.  An  odd thought considering the rest of the film.  I did, however, agree with  the other reasons for changing it.  I just wish they could have come to a  decent compromise to keep that bi-plane in. I would also like to add, as  much as I enjoyed this movie on DVD, the one I am really looking forward to  is JAWS!  Now there is a great Popcorn movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>I know many films with stronger plots, better writing, more balance. However, for sheer spectacle and fun, it's hard to top this one. Many stars appear here, and several give top-notch performances. Judd Hirsch gives a great turn as Jeff Goldblum's dad, and Will Smith gives a star-making turn as the air corp pilot who heroically helps save the human race. Jeff Goldblum gives his usual intense performance as the lead scientist who happens upon the code the aliens are using and also helps save the human race. I know this sounds VERY hokey, but it's all part of the special charm of the film. All this is secondary to the special effects here. This film won the Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound, and believe me, it richly deserved them. The destruction of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are as awe-inspiring now as when the film came out in 1996. So many Sci-Fi movies seem to disappoint in one way or another, most of them take themselves way too seriously to be enjoyed. Believe me, this film is a fun ride from start to finish. Never mind the glaring ridiculousness of some of the plot lines, the movie just scoots along happily, and you just need some suspension of disbelief to thoroughly enjoy this. The tranfer to DVD is flawless, the picture is razer-sharp, and the sound is staggering. Several bonus features are here, and all are your basic bonus stuff. Check out the original biplane ending feature, it's so great to see that something so outrageous as an old biplane taking out a huge alien ship was actually considered at all! Anyway, this film is nonstop fun, and should make a great addition your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Huge alien ships descend on Earth, wiping out whole cities with their death-rays while themselves remaining safe behind their impenetrable energy screens. Those left by the death-rays are annihilated by swarms of enemy fighters that fly in huge, insect-like clouds (and are similarly shielded). Not even nukes can stop these guys. But one man has the brainstorm that may save the world.<br /><br />It's easy to say that this was THE popcorn flick to catch in 1996, but nearly 10 years later, it's easy to step back and see what else went right besides millions in CGI.  ID4 combined the right mix of FX, can-do ingenuity and patriotism missing from follow-ups like "Godzilla".  Bill Pullman plays the President, an ex-fighter jock who starts off telling his aides that "we have no cause to fear" until the alien baddies demolish the White House in the now classic money-shot. Jeff Golblume plays one of his stock characters - the brilliant-but-awkward type who despite his lowly tech job working for a cable TV service run by Harvey Fierstein, comes up with the idea that may defeat the aliens. Will Smith is the Marine who flies his F-18 like something out of Star Wars, and comes up with some of the flick's best lines and most of its sheer gusto.<br /><br />As a blockbuster, this flick grossed cash while naturally inflaming critics. In some ways, this alien-invasion epic deserves both the praise and criticism, though for reasons different than fans and panners would suggest. The special effects sometimes show their limits (especially at the end when the alien ships fly across the screen like mosquitoes, as opposed to those in "Star Wars" which alternate between being a dot in a huge on a frame of film in a complex background to filling the screen), and much of the visual impact is lost unless you've got the wide-screen version. The dialog won't win anybody any Oscars (the best lines sound conspicuously ad-libbed; the rest sounds no better than "you're father was a hero, you should be proud of him"), and some promising characters and ideas just get tossed out completely (especially those dealing with "Area-51" and the chief geeky scientist played by Trek alum Brent Spiner) before the script has any fun with them.<br /><br />WHY THIS MOVIE ROCKS (ANYWAY): The flick's imperfect FX are still spectacular and remain so nearly a (Star Wars-filled) decade later. Clearly the design team was inspired by SW, but had more than a creative nod than the hordes responsible for perpetrating the past 2 decades worth of SW rip-offs on us ("StarCrash" or "Message From Space" come to mind). Some of the characters rise above the sort of shallow cardboard you'd expect, or otherwise allow remnants of previous roles they've played to give more charm to their roles here (like Robert Loggia as a general, or Harry Connick Jr. in an inspired bit of miscasting as Will Smith's wing man). But above all, ID4 excels because its makers took an idea that was never really original but also took the bold step of handling it all - militant, locust like aliens, epic-scale dogfights, huge motherships, impenetrable force-fields - as if it had never been done before, and giving the whole premise an unmatched sense of depth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>This film paved the way for other world-obliterating movies such as Armageddon and Dante's Peak. OK, I know they're not technically all the same, but they are very similar. Armageddon is one of my favourite movies, and I can see a lot of similarities between that &amp; Independence Day. <p>I don't know why I've only decided to watch this movie nearly eight years after its original release. I will admit to reading the book based on the movie. That could have put me off seeing the movie, as it was mind-numbingly boring. But when I watched the movie, I found myself recognising characters and knowing what was going to happen to them, and recognising the lines too. So obviously the book had some impact on me, despite sending me to sleep most nights. <p>I was shocked to read that this was the biggest box office success of 1996 - you'd think something like that would tempt me to go and see it at the cinema! I saw Titanic twice at the cinema, and watched the video about a zillion more times. Independence Day grossed about $746m around the world, and a mere $306m alone in the USA. <p>There are some spectacular effects in this, including seeing The White House getting blown up, LA/New York etc being reduced to rubble (very Terminator-esque) and some very cute aliens appear in a lab (are they available to buy?)<p>Some great actors appear in this film - Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum being his usual eccentric self, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin and . . . Harry Connick Jnr?! There has to be some mistake there. Will Smith was great in this, although there was a big sigh of disappointment when he got out of the bed wearing boxers. Damn. <p>This must have been great to see at the cinema. The sound is fantastic watching it on DVD with a great sound system. I was fearing for the neighbours next door, as my chair was shuddering beneath me, and took a few minutes before the vibrations stopped! Of course, with a great sound system, whether in the cinema or at home, there were nearly a few accidents. I literally jumped out my skin a couple of times, and to persuade my heart to go back to its usual place in my body, rather than in my throat! <p>If you haven't seen this film, you have to go and see it. It's really fantastic, and I'll definitely consider getting it on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects.

Your not suppose to care about the plot, your so suppose to sit back and enjoy something that could never really happen.<p>In Independence Day are fears have come true. Alien spacecrafts have come to earth and are hostile. After a failed attack by our own military all hope looks to be gone. The aliens are slowly destroying all of our big cities and it continues to look bleak. It's all up to a crack team of misfits that include our president(Bill Pullman), Fighter Pilot Capt. Steve Hiller(Will Smith), a cable man David Levinson(Jeff Goldblum), and a even the dumb hick Russel Casse(Randy Quaid) to save the day and the world.<p>This is such a fun film to watch and is for many reasons. You have to love the special effects in the film. The alien weapons are cool and a lot of the explosions are on a big scale. It's not easy to flatten L.A, New York, and Washington. The movie won the Oscar for best special effects and rightfully so.<p>The movie has a lot of memorable performances that make it worth buying.<p>You have to love Will Smith in the film. His one liners and overall toughness really help make the film. They also helped make his carear and he wouldn't be where he's at today without this film.<p>The movie is stolen however with the performance of Jeff Goldblum. His character David is the main character in the movie and nobody could have played him like Jeff Goldblum. His one liners are great and you love to like his character.<p>This is another hit movie for Roland Emmerich. This guy has taken the Steven Spielberg mold for summer blockbuster hits and has made quite a carear for himself. If your a fan of Roland you have to pick up Independence Day.<p>The music is great in Independence Day. David Arnold has written a fantastic score. It has a great patriotic feel to it. The music is well worth the price of the movie. Fans of the movie should look at the soundtrack as well.<p>Independence Day is a great film. It grossed over 306 million at the Box Office in the U.S. alone and thats a testament statement. You don't make that much money on a bad film. Independence Day is a great summer blockbuster movie. It reminds us why we go to the movies and that to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>One of the best Alien invasion action movies, amazing effects, great acting and an awesome story, highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I've seen ID4 about six times.  I've got the DVD, and, you know, it's still an enjoyable film to watch.  Yep, when you've seen a film a half-dozen times, you know what's going to happen, but when you watch it that sixth time, you are interested to see how well you remember it.  And you get to enjoy the parts you liked before, again.  I'm waiting for the explosions, for the fighter vrs. alien dogfight (OK, it's hard to believe the aliens can conquer the galaxy, but can't hit the broad side of the barn with their advanced weapons), for President Pullman to fight back, and so on.  "Welcome to Earth" indeed!<br /><br />It's an entertaining flick that is enjoyable time and again.  I'm a big Jeff Goldblum fan, and he does his off-kilter bumbling genius schtick again, and really well.  Will Smith is a winning personality, though you wonder how his ego would fare in the modern military...And a positive nod to Randy Quaid, you turns a potentially hokey role into a pretty good performance.<br /><br />Yeah, it ain't Hamlet (big surprise) but compared with its action film cousins, ID4 comes off pretty darn well.<br /><br />Just remember, don't get on top of that skyscraper in LA and hold up a sign welcoming the aliens.  Might just irritate them!<br /><br />Recommended if you like action flicks that are a cut above average.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>While 4 stars is probably pretty generous for this film, it is entertaining, nonetheless.  It most certainly has some of the best special effects I have ever seen.  It's kind of like a remake of a 1950s movie with an updated SF package.<p>Will Smith is certainly not my favorite actor, but he turns in a suprisingly strong performance as a Marine fighter pilot ace.  Bill Pulman is a likeable, youthfull president who was a fighter pilot himself during Desert Storm.  [Now, class, 3 guesses as to why the writers put in the President of the United States as a former fighter pilot, please.  Could it be that they want the President himself to go ballistic on some aliens, maybe?].  <p>The one fatal flaw of this movie is that it is unbelievable to anyone who has ever been in the military, or knows anything at all about the military.  These huge, 5 mile long flying saucers come to earth, and apparently all the military has to use against them are air-to-air missiles and nuclear bombs.  Excuse me?  I would think that there would be stuff in-between sidewinders and Nuclear missiles that we could fire at these nasty aliens....I mean, trying to knock  a gargantuan alien mothership out of the sky with sidewinders is a bit like trying to knock out George Foreman using nothing but jabs.<p>Anyway, word has it that the military was excited about collaborating with this film project, just as they have done with movies such as "Crimson Tide," "The Rock" and many others.  However, a glitch came up when the military advisors learned that some of the movie was to concentrate on all of the mythology / hoopla behind the infamous "Area 51."  I'm sure everyone is aware of those rumours, so there is no reason to go into them.  Anyway, as soon as the Brass learned about this, the military washed its hands of the project.  So, what you end up with is basically what the original writers seemed to be looking for:  a cross between "Star Wars" and "Top Gun."  <p>That said, this movie does pass as good eye candy.  I just hope that, if there ever really is an alien invasion, we don't try & shoot down UFOs using the weakest weapons in our arsenal.  8-)</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Firstly, you're amazed by the alien ship that appears, curious about the contingency plan, and then completely blown away by the explosions and special effects. This is American patriotism at its very best, yet you forget all of that with the amount of action, comedy and typical plotlines. Ok, so the acting wasn't THAT great, but you can watch this film a hundred times and never get bored. There one liners always crack you up, and once again, America is always the one that saves the day! <p>A simple plot - aliens threaten the world's (more so America's) existence and someone (America) has to do something about it. With a cast led by Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and (at the time) an aspiring Will Smith, that were all very good to watch, not forgetting the rather nice looking Vivica A. Fox as Smith's fianc? I can't really put a flaw in this film since it was great fun to see. God bless America! <p>Done in true US Military style, 'Independence Day' is an entertaining, patriotic watch - one big dose of eye candy which can be seen again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>After the sucess of Stargate, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin did the old "bigger is better" modus operandi with Independence Day. Upon it's release, critcs bemoaned the film's over-the-top jingionism, cheesy heroic antics and disaster movie cliche staples- "Oh, quick, save the dog before the giant fireball destroys the city!" And to be fair, the film did deserve it's critisism, but as a cheesy, sentimental sci fi action blockbuster, it's one of the best.<p>For all Will Smith's jibes and Bill Pullman's heroics, it's Jeff Goldblum who comes off as the main man, pulling the same shtick as in Jurassic Park ("Must go faster!"). The film does get very silly at times, but never takes itself too seriously, creating a feel-good tone that works well within the caveats of the genre. Emmerich's ham-fisted direction gets tiresome at times, with so many sci fi cliches, you start to wish someone had thrown in an original idea or two. But the film gets four stars for action, visuals and some well-timed humour.<p>The SFX utilised are astounding, with some truly breathtaking visuals, and that now-famous shot of the white house getting blown to smithereens by aliens! It's good-natured, brainless fun, that while predictable and silly, is still one impressive movie that is a must-have on DVD. The extras are great, with commentaries on the first disc, and on disc 2 a wealth of extras including that famous Superbowl trailer "Enjoy the Superbowl, it may be your last", tons of "making of" docos and lots more production info.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>A massive alien spacecraft has fallen into orbit around the earth and communications channels are disrupted around the globe.

Suddenly dozens of large flying saucer shaped craft the size of a large city drop out of the mother ship and hover over the major cities of the world.<br /><br />Meanwhile Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on leave and gets up out of bed to see a flying Saucer as large as downtown Los Angeles hovering over the city.

You have to take some of the movie with a grain of salt as parts are really far stretched but what good Hollywood movie isn't these days. The special effects are pretty good and the story line is not bad if you take out the alcoholic crop duster that can fly an F 18 Hornet with no flight training since the Vietnam War.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, special effects and some decent plot lines within the movie. If you just look at it as 2 hours of entertainment you will enjoy it. It shows mankind rising up in the face of total destruction at the hands of aliens who want our planet. The collection of miscellaneous personalities overcomes a superior force and technology to win the day. It is worth watching and you will have fun enjoying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT.

Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are always good as were most of the well selected crew. This film featured a good story, great cast, and fine special effects. The creature design for the aliens was imaginative and very credible.<br /><br />I understand that the Air Force could not give this film its full support because of the UFO reference made to Area 51. They desired to, however, and were very happy with the patriotic plot and the positive light it placed the US Air Force in.</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Aliens coming to destroy earth. That's basically Independence Day in a nutshell. But there's A LOT more to it than that. Not only does Will Smith star in this one, but the special effects in it are just unbelievable! This is definately one of the top sci-fi movies I love watching again and again. The aliens bombing Washington D.C looks just unbelievably real!!! If you don't believe me, watch the movie for yourself. Not only does the alien spaceship look real, but the aliens themselves look great, too! For all you alien, Will Smith, or sci-fi fans out there, this is a must for you!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Actually, ID4 can only be judged (by me anyway) as a tribute film, dedicated to the great sci-fi movies that influenced and enthralled its creators. Having grown up on awesome stuff like WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, STAR WARS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, etc., I was grateful to Roland Emmerich for making this homage to all things sci-fi (c. 1950-1981)! Is ID4 heavy on cgi fx? Yes. Is there a series of unbelievable plot contrivances? You bet. Are the heroes too heroic? Yep. Still, it is the perfect tribute to an era of science fiction that I grew up watching. For that, I love it...</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>This movie has a really cool base plot, over-the-top special effects, and an ending that is nearly plausible.  The pacing of the movie is so fast that you tend to forget that the movie is full of far too convenient coincidences and more lucky breaks than any one race should deserve.  Regardless of how many times I have seen this movie, I am always up for one more.<br /><br />Our main characters see some strange things at the beginning of the movie.  It turns out that the strange things are aliens entering our atmosphere.  The generation that grew up with "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" decides that the best thing to do is to say hello to the new neighbors.  However, it appears that our alien visitors are more akin to the aliens of "Starship Troopers" than to E.T.  We eventually learn that the aliens have two things in mind; our extermination and the rape of our planet.<br /><br />However, because we have lots of macho, manly, men running about, we are not going to wait for the aliens to exterminate us.  We have President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman, who has had a number of experiences with a variety of creatures, such as reptiles in "Lake Placid," scary dead people in "The Grudge," ghosts in "Casper," and Sandra Bullock in "While You Were Sleeping"), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, who managed to hold dinosaurs at bay with biting wit in two "Jurassic Park" movies), Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith, who has more macho in his little finger than most guys in their whole body), General William Grey (Robert Loggia, who just exudes macho, in a grandfatherly sort of way) and Russell Casse (Randy Quaid, who has lots of macho, it's just hard to find), along with a cast of hundreds of other macho people (including some women) who gamely sacrifice themselves to beat off the alien attack.<br /><br />Things initially look pretty hopeless.  The aliens have a game play and they are sticking to it.  Everything looks like they are on a tight schedule, and the aliens smack our high tech equipment as though they were gnats, and ignore nuclear weapons as though they were nothing more than a brief puff of wind.  Ah, but we know something the aliens do not.  Well, a couple of somethings.  First, we have all the macho, manly, men.  Second, we have a spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, and it is kept in the place that does not really exist, Area 51.<br /><br />How can we combine the two things that we have and end up with an alien exterminating play?  Well, it helps to have wise Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch, who has little alien experience), David's father.  An amazingly simple statement by Julius suddenly triggers a brilliant thought in David, and bingo, a solution to the alien problem is created.  Of course, we need aspiring astronaut Captain Steve Hiller to fly the spacecraft to the alien mother ship so that David's computer (with homage to HAL-9000 on it) can talk to the alien computer.  They also are carrying a nuclear missile to attempt to wreak a little havoc on the alien mother ship.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is aerial battles and a huge self-sacrifice that makes you want to salute an American flag somewhere.<br /><br />This movie is full of corn and coincidence, and yet it is darn fun to watch.  The action is so fast that you rarely have a chance to think too much about the numerous coincidences, or that your emotions are being deliberately manipulated.  Unless you spend too much time analyzing movies, especially science fiction movies, and you like a lot of action, then I think you would absolutely love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Independence Day. Will Smith was riot and Bill Pullman as the President of the USA was a kick.<p>However, having just seen Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow, I was left wondering whether he has it in for DC, Los Angeles and NYC.  Actually, I was rather surprised at how many cheered when I watched this in the theater when the White House got it.....what were these people thinking.<p>Anyway, this movie takes you all around the world and of course a bit of luck is what causes the good guys to win.  I really got a kick out of how the Aliens on the mother ship say &quot;uh oh....&quot; when they realize their goose is cooked.  <p>Interesting the graphics of the larger buildings being the target of the aliens.  Sadly the implosion of the Library Tower and the Empire State Building looked all too much like that of the WTC.<p>I can still remember the look on the man's face while looking up in disbelief as the alien ship over Manhattan begins to ignite the Empire State Building.  This as a fascinating movie and fun for the most part.  The story did drag a bit at times.

You should find the extras just as interesting as the feature itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>A lot of people beforehand have slated this movie for lack of plot or over-reliance of special effects.  However, the joy of 'Independence Day' is precisely that - it never pretends to be anything else.  As pure escapist fun it's the top of its range.  The premise is childishly simple: have a group of alien ships hover over the world's great cities and watch how the humans react.  Not only is this an alien movie that takes advantage of the 'X-Files' phenomena but it's also a disaster movie, with there being a cross-section of America reacting to the events around them.<p>The acting is surprisingly good whilst remaining thankfully low-key.  Smith especially shows his star potential, and can obviously carry a movie by himself.  Around him are the more seasoned actors such as Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman as the president.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the creators obviously had a lot of fun making the movie, although at times melodrama does threaten to sink everything.  What's perhaps most cloying though is its blatant vision of a world crisis that only affects America and one that only America can combat.  However, the hoky message about human spirit is tongue-in-cheek and this is a cut above most blockbusters.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>Independence Day. Full of special effects, aliens, airplanes, UFOs, and big big explosions. All kinds of fun stuff! When earth is targeted by a clan of power-hungry aliens, the President and a group of unexpected people must help save the world. <p>  This has got to be one of the funnest movies out there. It's got everything needed in a movie. Action (That's what the movie is all about), drama (A couple of subplots that were dealt with very nicely and not left open), comedy (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Randy Quaid - what do you expect from these great actors?), horror (I count the &quot;jump&quot; moments given by the aliens as horror), and of course, science fiction (Er...the aliens). The extensive cast is full of A list actors and actresses, as well as some unknowns, and all pull through with great performances. And I must say, when Bill Pullman gives his own &quot;Independence Day&quot; speech, I was ready to fight the aliens with them. I also enjoyed how each group of characters were given their own subplots, and those subplots were closed and didn't leave the viewers wondering how what would have happened. The special effects in ID4 were amazing. It was pretty fun to see Washington DC, Paris, and other big cities get blown to pieces. The aerial fights were also pretty awesome.<p>  The DVD lives up to its &quot;5 Star Collection&quot; title. We get the original theatrical release on one disc, and the uncut version on another. The chapter list even tells us when things are added and extended. Although there's only a 9 minute difference, it was still interesting to see it. The alternate ending is also very interesting. The &quot;fake-amentaries&quot; and news reports are fun to watch. There's plenty of stuff here to keep you busy for at least a couple of hours. There's even 2 easter eggs. I'll let you find them. <p> Independence Day is a fun action romp, and is fun every time you watch it. I'm glad it was given a worthy DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>C'mon get real!  It's eye candy and melodramatic!

This is a very fun movie, especially with the 5.1 sound. You will not believe how much better this movie is with digital sound! It feels like you are in the cockpit with will smith!

And then the wheels come off big style. Lots to like in this film, V-Style giant dustbin lid flying saucers, lots of action, but the gung-ho lameness of the "USA, USA" patriotism is the sort of stuff that has the 5 and three quarter billion people in the world who are not American covering their eyes with embarrassment. It is somehow fitting that the climax to the film involves Randy Quaid flying up the bottom of one of the giant binlids..still, as a man, we need a fix of explosions and aliens and jets and stuff like that, and there is plenty of that going on. And just in case you think I'm a big meany, I quite liked Battlefield Earth apart from the hideously lame end (and insult to all Harrier Jump-Jet Pilots everywhere), and "War of the Worlds" which also had a totally lame end, although I'm sure a positive impact on real-estate prices in downtown Boston (handy for the shops and alien proof!). I'm sure that if an ill tempered alien race had the technology to send a fleet of giant binlids interstellar distances, they could crush us like ants without even taking their alien sausage sandwiches out of their mouths.<br /><br />Mind you, if they did arrive, I expect that the Number One quisling collaborator in their alien conquest would be Tom Cruise. Why, he is probably talking to them already, by e-mail.

It's worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The existence of life outside of our planet is an idea that has long captured the minds of many people. The thought that maybe their might be some other forms of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a concept that is both alluring and somewhat frightening at the same time, mostly because no one knows what the aliens (if they exist, which I don't believe they do) would be like. In the movies there are a few instances where aliens are depicted in a benevolent manner; examples would be films like, "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial", "Men in Black" (the good aliens), and even the 'Star Trek' series at times. However, the majority of the time when aliens are featured in movies they are malevolent creatures bent on our destruction, such as; "Men in Black" (the bad aliens), "War of the Worlds", and "Mars Attacks". One of the most successful entries into the alien invasion sub-genre of science fiction would be the visual effects blockbuster "Independence Day" starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum.<br /><br />"Independence Day" begins on a day when all seemed to be normal in the world and another run-of-the-mill 4th of July weekend was upon us. However, when giant saucers begin to fill the skies above numerous big cities across the globe, everything quickly shifts from average to extraordinary. As humanity attempts to contact what is believed to be aliens residing in these giant ships, one former scientist turned cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that these aliens are anything but peaceful, and as he warns the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), the aliens strike with deadly force. Now, with the attempted annihilation of the human race in full swing, our last hope rests upon humanity's ability to work together in the face of adversity, and on a daring mission led by a cocky pilot (Will Smith).<br /><br />Here is a movie that beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely lives up to the term 'summer blockbuster'. What makes "Independence Day" such a great movie is not the fact that it is one of the best alien invasion movies ever made, of course that helps, but the mass appeal it has to such a wide audience. The film contains something for everyone; there's action, drama, romance, comedy, and of course, what would an alien invasion movie be without the prerequisite element of science fiction. All of those components when mixed together leaves audiences with an out of this world movie experience that they will undoubtedly want to enjoy time and again.<br /><br />The acting for "Independence Day" was completely solid throughout, which was a pleasant surprise given the material of the movie and the fact that some of the actors aren't exactly known for their high-quality skills. Two actors that really surprised me by how good they were here were Bill Pullman as the President and Randy Quaid as a former alien abductee who's a little off in the head. Pullman surprised me because I hadn't really seen him do a whole lot of dramatic work, which was primarily his job in this film. All I'd seen of him were comedies, one was the Mel Brooks spoof "Spaceballs" and the other was "Casper", neither really tested him as an actor though, so I was surprised with how good he was in the role. And Randy Quaid, well he's done plenty of screwball comedies as wacky characters, so I knew that he could handle that aspect easily enough, but my fear was that he would ruin the movie by taking it too far into the stupid direction. Surprisingly, Randy played things with just the right amount of crazy without going overboard, and he even handled the dramatic aspects of his character, that appear later into the movie, with an earnest sincerity that was refreshing to see. Probably the biggest surprise in the movie was Will Smith's performance, though he was but one part of an ensemble cast, whenever he was on screen he made the movie his own with relative ease. I wasn't convinced that Will could truly handle a somewhat lead actor role for a big blockbuster film, since his previous movie was the highly successful actioner "Bad Boys" with Martin Lawrence carrying half the load. But once things got going, Will proved that he definitely had what it took to solidify his place among Hollywood's A-list stars, and his continuing success within the film industry is evidence of that.<br /><br />Now on to the one thing that all reviews of science fiction movies require, the critique on the special effects work within the film. Top-notch special effects work is a key component to making any good science fiction movie, if you don't get the effects right and just wow the crowd, the audiences will turn on you in an instant. But for the folks that worked on "Independence Day" this turned out to not be a concern for them. The effects in this film were so top-of-the-line at the time the film was made, that most hold up very well to this day, a little over 10 years later. There are a couple of scenes that don't look so hot though, one would be the scene in which Vivica A. Fox's dog must jump into the hallway to avoid being burned alive, when the fire passes behind the dog it's a really obvious green-screen effect, of course there was no other way to do the scene, but I've seen better work done in plenty of other movies. Secondly, the scene where the alien attacks the doctors that are examining it within Area 51, the alien's movements look a little too hokey. Too much like stop-motion animation with all the tendrils whipping around, the movements felt choppy, kind of like when you watch some of the old Christmas TV shows that use stop-motion animation, the movements are fluid for the most part, but there's a slight choppiness that makes them feel somewhat awkward. But, other than those two times, I really can't come up with much else that hasn't held up from the special effects department, which is why this movie is still a favorite for many movie fans, and continues to hold its place as one of the best alien invasion movies ever made.<br /><br />"Independence Day" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects.

I mean, I always figured I'd get around to this film at some point, so I'm not a TOTAL cinema snob and distainer of all things commercial. Those clips of the White House getting zapped were pretty attention grabbing back when I first saw the previews back in the day.  Or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city in the world was pretty darn ominous.  So deep down, I always wanted to check it out.  But I guess I just was never in that much of a rush to.<br /><br />Now critical analysis is sorta my game, and as the Amazon reviewer notes above, INDEPENDENCE DAY is mostly a pure fun movie--and not one many people are going to subject to intense critical scrutiny.  So why bother to review it all? At this point, it's available in so many different formats that probably all most consumers want to know is which is the right one for them and for their player. They already know whether they want to purchase it or not.  Reviewing the film as film may be virtually pointless when most consumers likely only are looking for a product review at this point.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? I'm a critical analysis kind of guy, so I really can't tell you about the merits of the Digipak over the double or single disk anniversary versions.  To tell you the truth, I watched the thing on plain ol' VHS--that I picked up on sale, no less.  But I still liked it, even without all the DVD bells and whistles.  And, yes, the visuals were stunning even in this antiquated format.<br /><br />But just an apercu or two.  Watching any film in which iconic American buildings get zapped from the sky is no longer the innocent escapism it was in 1995.  I even winced at seeing the twin towers standing tall (and unharmed) in some of the early, pre-catastrophe scenes.  We watch such things with more of a jaded eye these days.  Or is it more of a horrified stare?<br /><br />Escapist fare is usually centered around a big "What If."  These days, we pretty much KNOW "what if."<br /><br />Before seeing this movie, I had always wondered how well Bill Pullman (an actor I genuinely like) would pull off being presidential.  Was he a little TOO young? A little too callow? Cleverly enough, the screenwriters have made him a struggling, almost failing Commander In Chief, whose prior life as a hero pilot in the first Gulf War may have gotten him electec but left him ill prepared for hardball politics.  He's presidential in that youthful John F. Kennedy/Bill Clinton kind of way.  Unlike them, however, he's not much of political pro at all.  But also unlike Kennedy, he's still young and able enough to enter into actual battle once again himself--and  (many would opine)unlike Clinton, he has the guts to do so.<br /><br />And that's something blockbuster films like to play on, isn't it--our almost innate, primitive desire to have our leaders be actual heroes?  Of course, we're just (post-)modern enough to want those heroes a little bit flawed, to say nothing of a bit conflicted.  Pullman is all that and more.  But there is never any doubt that he won't pull off his counter-offensive.  He's got that cute and newly motherless little tyke (the one who later showed up on CHICAGO HOPE) to take care of, so he cannot allow himself to fail.<br /><br />And neither can the crazy crop-dusting pilot Randy Quaid, whose very family has pretty much written him off as a loco loser.  Somehow Quaid is able to inject some humanity and some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role.  But still, there are times when you find yourself mouthing his lines along with him and wondering just how he pulled this off with a straight face.<br /><br />Which you could also say about the rest of the cast as well.  These mostly very good, widely respected actors have their work cut out for them if they want to move their characters at all beyond the level of the stereotype.  Funny thing is, most of them do.  Mary McDonnell suffers and dies admirably.  Margaret Colin is stunning and sassy as a Presidential Aide.  Her performance is good enough that you have to wonder why she never became "Then Next Big Thing" after all, and I say this with utter conviction, even though I must admit that at the same time, I still keep mixing her up with Elizabeth Perkins.<br /><br />And in the face of almost certain annihilation, she decides to put aside her feud with (still devoted) ex-hubby Jeff Goldblum.  Good thing too, since it is Goldblum's character who has figured out the alien invaders weak spot.  Now all he needs is the ear of the president...But how? But how?  Wait a minute, I know...!<br /><br />Ok, so it's a bit cliched.  But in a tongue in cheek way, you understand.  The beauty of latter-day Sci-fi flicks is that their dazzling special effects are so overwhelming that you really don't want to be bothered with much else.  INDEPENDENCE DAY, like so many other S-F films, wants to come across as 50s flick with killer effects AND enough of a sly self-awareness so as not to appear hopelessly cornball.<br /><br />And yeah, it's just cornball enough.  And yeah, danged if it doesn't all work somehow.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...this is far from being a favorite of mine it still has its' moments. I've bought it, the sound and picture (still today) is very good indeed, and the effects -well, some still stunning, some not! Like one of the many explotions, the one in that tunnel with the dog managing to save its' own life in the nick of time, that was not so good.<br /><br />Actually the biggest problem is the man supposed to be the star of "Independence day". Yes, Will Smith! I wonder if he maybe thinks he is a "bit" cooler than the rest of the planet thinks. He has fans of course, but I remember being embarrased by him overacting already in the "Fresh Prince"-series. He is painful to watch in "I.d". I know of course he didn't write the script nor his own lines, but Will Smith becomes a parody on himself in the movie. And I don't know how many times during the movie I wanted to tell him to "Shut up!". I mean hitting the alien on its' way out of the spaceship; "Welcome to earth! Now that's what I'd call a close encounter!" There are plenty of those.<br /><br />Other than that, and the "America save us all!"-patriotism, well as mentioned -"Independence day" has its' moments and highlights, and some remembarable scenes. What I'm trying to say is that some of the story here also functions, it's not all effects.<br /><br />They say that the biggest Sci-fi-movie ever is the classic "War of the Worlds", not that I agree on that, but that movie probably was what "Independence day" was when it was released in the theatres back in the mid-90's. Because despite the critics, "I.d" was a big hit when it came -so all in all, a sci-fi-fan might enjoy this even though I find no excuse for Will Smiths' overcool-part!</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I've always loved alien invasion stories, and Independence Day is the best I've ever seen!  From the first scene to the last, this alien invasion story is a veritable feast for the senses, with flying saucers, "kewl" explosions, and aliens that make even the classic movies' aliens look like pussycats by comparison.<p>What makes Independence Day so wonderful for me is the fact that there is also a genuine story to it that gives it dimension and depth.  It tells the tale of President Thomas Whitmore (the always charming Bill Pullman), a man who is suddenly forced to confront something he'd always thought was a figment of science fiction writers' imaginations--an alien invasion force that could possibly wipe out the entire human race.  He finds himself forced to enlist the aid of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), his former nemesis and the estranged husband of his White House aide, Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), and David's father, Julius (Judd Hirsch).  As the survivors drift toward Groom Lake and the mysterious Area 51, Whitmore meets up with Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith), a young Marine who lost his best friend Jimmy (Harry Connick Jr.) in the initial attack, and Hiller's girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her son; Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a Vietnam vet and alien abductee; and Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner), the crackpot head scientist of Area 51.  He is also reunited with his wife and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell) in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film.<p>One of the things I liked most about this DVD was the fact that it allowed me to choose between both the theatrical release and the director's cut, which has some scenes cut from the theatrical release.  There is also a second DVD that is chock-full of extras, including a Russell Casse scene that was ultimately left out of even the director's cut, but which was pretty cool nonetheless.  Ultimately, I have to say that this is a DVD that was worth every penny I paid for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>A charismatic Will Smith and a boring, bland Bill Pullman take on world-destroying aliens in this crowd-pleasing, brain-draining disaster flick from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who'd go on to make the even worse "Godzilla."  More subtle than "Armageddon," and twice as funny as "Mars Attacks," this baby features the largest collection of stereotyped characters since Irwin Allen released "Earthquake" in Sensurround.<br /><p>Honestly, Smith is the best thing about this movie; he proves he has the big-screen presence to carry a film.  Or maybe he comes off so well because all the other characters are papier-mache, or something like that.  Jeff Goldblum plays... well, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch despoils his formerly decent film career as Goldblum's Jewish Dad (he wouldn't be out of place in a 1930's radio show).  Then there's Harvey Fierstein as the Funny Gay Guy, and Harry Connick, Jr. as the Doomed Best Friend, and Mary McDonnell as the Saintly First Lady.  Factor in Randy Quaid as the comic-relief Crazy Guy and couple of Cute Kids with mooncalf eyes.  Somewhere in there we get strippers, a marital reconciliation, a wedding and a computer virus, plus a lot of heartfelt moments carefully lifted from better movies.  And explosions, explosions, explosions.<br /><p>This is one of those movies where unheralded billions die in spectacular SFX fireballs and CGI imagery, but a dog gets a slow motion leap to safety.  Granted, the effects are sharp and the battle scenes are truly massive.  But as long as the dog survives, why should we care about any of the people?<br /><p>This DVD release features a pristine widescreen print and tons of extras so you can get the full, empty "ID4" experience.  Actually, you might have more fun playing with the special features and just avoiding the movie altogether.  It's big, loud and silly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Randy Quaid star<br />in this 1996 sci-fi film.

The aliens themselves are almost inconsequential.<br /><br />The film has plot inaccuracies and just plain silliness: uploading a computer virus to an alien craft that has Windows -- how cool is that? Or an unknown force field technology that somehow shows up on Earth's radar screens.<br /><br />But despite the quibbles on the hackneyed dialogue and inaccurate science, there is a lot to say about Bill Pullman's acting. He is an ineffective president who not only rises to the occasion, but takes command and even goes into battle himself.<br /><br />The drunk test pilot who sacrifices himself and regains his children's respect.<br /><br />The old Black & White Day the Earth Stood Still plays momentarily on a TV screen in homage.<br /><br />It's quite the action fest.<br /><br />Recommended to all Americans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>I saw this film long before war of the worlds, and I loved it! The acting is good, the charecters believable, and the special f/x are excellent! Alot of critics despised this film, my question is, why?<br />Because the charecters were too stereotypical, nonsense! The three main charecters-Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Will Smith do the best job, and Margaret Colin, Vivica A. Fox, and Judd Hirsh are pretty good too, this film was 10 times better than Mars Attacks!-that was good the first time, then it got stupid. Director Roland Emmerich may have used alot of cliches with this film, but is there an unwritten rule that all cliches are bad? I'm getting pretty fed up with critics expecting absolute plausibility in movies, movies are supposed to be entertainment, not a confirmation of reality, unless they say, `based on a true story.' To make a long story short, too late!) Critics get over it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Independence Day&quot; could have been a great film.  It's got the huge explosions that draw in big summer crowds, it's loaded with fodder for popcorn popping, but after that...<p>Honestly, this isn't a terrible movie.  It will hold your attention for the entire duration of the film.  The visuals, especially the opening sequence showing you just how tiny the moon and our little neck of the universe can be, are fantastic.  The special effects are top-notch and the acting is over-the-top, loud-mouthed and fun.  The aliens are believeable enough and I liked the touch of Roswell thrown in to give the story a little substance.<p>However, things went downhill from there.  Now if you've read my review of Emmerich's &quot;Godzilla,&quot; you already know that I liked that movie.  But the reasons I liked it are the same reasons that I'm not overly fond of &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  Like the large lizard flick, the story has no originality to it whatsoever.  It's a blatant rip-off of all those old Sunday matinee sci-fi movies.  At least &quot;Godzilla&quot; had the decency to impregnate the title character.  Tons of buildings are destroyed in both films, but &quot;Godzilla&quot; more or less just toppled things over trying to hide from the baddies.  Only Madison Square Garden received any extra special attention.  In &quot;ID4,&quot; buildings were destroyed to show people just how nifty the special effects were.  The two biggest disappointments in &quot;ID4&quot; had to be the virus implanting ending(just too unbelieveable) and Will Smith.  Normally I like Mr. Smith, but he's just too annoying in this movie.  I found myself hoping that one of the aliens would have whacked him just to shut him up.<p>In closing, I have to say that this is a fun movie to watch if you like explosions, but for some reason, this movie doesn't click with me like &quot;Godzilla&quot; did.  I know they are different films, but they were created on the same larger-than-life scale.  &quot;ID4&quot; takes itself too seriously.  It's nothing more than a glorified cheesy sci-fi movie that's fun to watch, but just not fun enough.  For a better time, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has explosions galore, including some cool bug guts.  If that's not your speed, check out &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  It has that whole &quot;end of the world&quot; thing going for it.  Both of these movies don't take themselves too serously, and they are a lot more enjoyable to watch.  If that still doesn't fit your bill, break out the old Atari and play &quot;Space Invaders.&quot;  Now that's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>Evil aliens invade our planet & destroy every major city so they claim our planet as their own.

There is so much packed into 2 discs its crazy. First off, I really love this movie to begin with, so this  set is for any ID4 fan. On disc one there is a special edition of this  movie with about 9 minutes of additional footage, although it actually  seems like a lot less. Nothing major added, just some addition to add to  the scene development. It also has the original theatrical release on disc  one if you want to watch that. The second disc is packed with suppliments.  My favorite was seeing an alternate ending using the biplane, it was quite  funny and i'm a little surprised they didnt stick with that one. There is  also a neat hidden easter egg on this disc which most people will likely  miss. Goto the Data Console, then highlight main menu, then press the right  arrow key to highlight the red LED on the computer and press enter. The  spaceship in the background will start to move, once it lets you, quickly  go back to the main menu and press 7 then 4 and enter and it will kick you  inside the ship where it has a lot of cool extra features.<p>All in all  this is a great dvd, the 3d menus are very similar to The Abyss SE Dvd,  which i also loved. If you own a dvd player, get this now! :)</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by "Twister", which in many ways was equally cheesy. I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.<br />The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you CAN suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a cropduster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. NEVER would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident 3 years ago...oops...my bad.<br />The reason I am even giving this film two stars is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the "buddy" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, "Men in Black".</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>The plot for this film was invented by H.G.Wells in 1898. It was followed up by Orson Welles in 1938. It has been repeated several times since: sometimes the aliens are destroyed by a virus, sometimes by Slim Whitman, but it's such a good plot that it's difficult to improve upon, and it's always been popular. So much for the plot. In this version the acting was good, and the dialogue was perfectly OK. The story moves along at a great pace, and there's always something interesting to gawp at. This is exactly what I like to see: heroes saving the world, baddies coming to bad ends, leaders leading from the front, family values and true love conquering. Just the stuff to fill in some time with a bit of escapist fantasy, humour and entertainment. Fortunately I'm not gifted with the genius of all those one-star reviewers, with their giant intellects, who are able to explain all the technical faults so excellently, but sometimes I think it's a bit funy that thy knt seme to spel to wel. I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't quite as good as Robin Hood, which was much more realistic and credible. But better than Saving Private Ryan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>An utterly frivolous film that has more bad lines than good special effects.  A completely predictable plot of an alien invasion where the good old U.S. Cavalry saves the day:  Uaaaah!  I'm yawning of boredom just thinking about this film!<br /><br />More time seems to have been spent on these cheap patriotic one-liners than anything else. Even the special effects weren't that great.  Repetitive scenes of U.S. fighter jets flying in a straight line occasionally shooting some missiles: wow! how creative!  Lucas did a better job in Star Wars with plastic models over 20 years before and these guys can't do better with CGI? The aliens don't fool anyone as one can clearly see that they're humans who dressed up in costumes pulled out of a 1950's sci-fi movie prop storage.<br /><br />As for the plot: horrible! Hot shot pilot learns how to fly alien space craft in a jiff. Fighter jets and conventional missiles can outspeed and outmaneuver alien craft that obviously have the technology of traveling much faster.  Will Smith finds his wife, child, and dog after the entire city of L.A. has been incinerated: yeepie!  All it takes to bring down the aliens is to infect their unknown technology with a conventional computer virus (who came up with these stupid scenarios anyway?!  A five-year old can conjure better stories than this!)<br /><br />In short, this film is essentially as patriotic and shallow as a Rambo sequel. If you like this genre then you'll probaly like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich reminds me of Michael Bay: they don't make action films that have character and heart like Spielberg or Cameron, they just make popcorn films. Emmerich did a great job when he did Stargate and Universal Soldier but then made this and I have seen it 11 times already but each time I hate parts of it yet I always go back, go figure.<br /><br />A massive ship(550 KM) appears in Earth's atmosphere and the US is scrambling to figure out what's going on. The ship then splits into about 15 smaller crafts but smaller's the wrong word since each one is 15 miles long anyway. Cities slowly start to evacuate until one scientist figures out(was that signal in morse code? Pretty smart aliens) that they're gonna fire on Earth. And boy do they. The cities literally get engulfed in building-high flames and destroys the city.<br /><br />The president has to land at Area 51 and finds out that the aliens(in probably the dumbest plot contrivance ever) are going to destroy every city on Earth and move on. The aforementioned scientist figures out a way to beat them and to destroy the ships, they just have to go to Big Mama's ship first.<br /><br />In terms of character development and a simple plot, there isn't one. Simple meaning that everything makes sense without you going "but how did?". Like when that scientist is able to hook up to the mothership with his laptop. My floppy disc can't even read Mac programs but his can link up with alien computers? BAH. What you do get though instead is big flashing and boomy stuff. Explosions, explosions and effects galore. It's certainly cool to watch but it just hurts your brain.<br /><br />The acting pretty much sucks, bad dialogue, convenient plot turns but it sure does look neat.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>Hey.

The plot is essentially the same as most "alien invasion" movies of those Red-scare 1950s: flying saucers appear literally out of the blue, we try to make contact, they invade, we resist.  Chaos ensues, there are big battles with the Bug Eyed Monsters (BEMs), cities are destroyed, and the war goes the BEMs' way until some scientist or brave military hero comes up with either a wonder weapon or last-minute desperation tactic and saves the day.  (And often in these movies the male lead ended up smooching with the female lead....)<p>And it is exactly this back-to-the-future "retro" feel that is the heart of Independence Day's appeal.  It takes all these clich&eacute;s and makes them work in such a way that audiences familiar with "invaders from space" can recognize the tongue-in-cheek tone of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's screenplay and smile, and there are lots of visual and dialogue tips of the hats to films such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other science fiction series.  Still, the strongest influence is War of the Worlds, not only thematically but structurally as well.<p>For instance, in both the original 1890s novel and the modernized George Pal version of War of the Worlds, a trio of emissaries waving a white flag approach the Martians' landing cylinder, only to be vaporized by the invaders' heat ray.  In Independence Day there is a similar scene, when a trio of especially fitted helicopters attempts to communicate with the aliens' ship over Washington.  The aliens respond to this Close Encounters-style light show with a violent show of force.<p>In another echo of Pal's 1950s movie, President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) reluctantly orders a B-2 Spirit to attack one of the alien vessels with nuclear weapons.  Not only does the attack fail miserably as in War of the Worlds, but the B-2A itself is based on the Northrop "flying wing" which appeared in the older film (making use of stock film of test flight footage, since the flying wing was never in U.S. Air Force service).<p>Even the ending is derived from H.G. Wells' novel, though the twist that Devlin and Emmerich used was not only clever but very 1990s.  Instead of being infected by Earth germs as the Martians were in War of the Worlds, in this film the creepy BEMs are done in by....a computer virus created by David Levinson (Goldblum).  (And if you have not seen the sequence when Levinson and Marine pilot Steven Hiller [Smith] plant the virus aboard the alien ship, keep your eyes open for a reference to another classic science fiction film!)<p>Independence Day comes in two versions of the DVD: a barebones one-disc edition which has both the theatrical and Special Editions of the movie, commentary by Emmerich and Devlin, commentary by the visual effects supervisors, plus the usual language and subtitles options.  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment also released a pricier 2-disc Five Star Collection edition which has this disc plus another extra features disc.  I have the one-disc edition, and though I miss the theatrical trailers and other goodies, I am satisfied with the DVD I own.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Independence Day" is one of those movies that I can watch anytime, even if we had recently seen it. This is just a fun movie that has a very likeable cast, great special effects, exciting action scenes, a lot of humor, and more scientific flaws and plot holes than just about any movie other than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AKCKM">The Core (Widescreen Edition)</a> (which was not a fun movie to watch, even the first time).<br /><br />The plot is fairly straight forward, aliens are here and they do not come in peace. With their overwhelming technology (remember, they brought their entire civilization light-years across the vastness of space in ships 1/6 the mass of the moon), they should be able to easily wipe out mankind and just take what they want, but they obviously didn't count on Will Smith (a very self confident fighter pilot) and Jeff Goldblum (an under achieving technical genius) to team up against them. There are a lot of plot devices to move the show along, mostly in the form of a string of improbable coincidences, stereotypical characters, and unlikely technical wizardry.<br /><br />All that taken into consideration, this is still an incredibly watchable and enjoyable movie (we own it on DVD, Blu-Ray, and have even used "On-Demand" to watch it on my PC when stranded in an airport).<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality is great, except for just a few scenes, which had some grain.

In an effort to communicate with the alien spacecraft the millitary send helicopters out to them to try and gain some type of positive reaction, but the reaction they got wasn't planned or wanted. They attacked and destroyed the helicopters and then initiated their initial plan, the center of the crafte opened and revealed a weapon that could destroy miles of the city. Within minutes New York, Washington, Moscow, London, Berlin and other major cities where wiped out in a matter of minutes, this sparked the millitary to launch a counter attack whith no effect whatsoever because they have a shield that cannot be penetrated.<br /><br />That is all i am going to tell you about the movie as i feel i may have ruined the best part of it for you but i must say this that this is an incredible movie and for it's time had some of the best special effects.

However, I do have one problem with it. There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother. It didn't seem to me like she loved him at all, whereas in "Mrs. Doubtfire," she deeply cared about her siblings. But that was sorely missing in this movie. Scenes showing her care and concern for her brother should have been filmed. Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed. Same thing with the President's daughter and his wife. Good action, but more sentimentality was needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>It's too bad the creators/producers did not use the same type of grand scale destruction when they made GODZILLA two years later.  INDEPENDENCE DAY was a culmination of sci-fi movies up to that point taking parts of 1950's classic sci-fi, most notably WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then taking some inspiration from the 1980's television mini-series "V". Finally, using the modern special effects of STAR WARS. Also, the film used bits of modern conspiracy theories about alien abductions, close encounters, and government UFO cover-ups  (i.e. AREA 51 and ROSWELL) and aspects of modern technology (i.e. computer viruses and cable/satellite television).  The film is therefore, a little derivative in the overall plot of an alien threat from outer space bent on destroying the human race and taking over the Earth. However, what makes the movie work and memorable was the human element of the film with engaging and well-defined characters to care about.  From Will Smith's "Capt Steve Hiller", Jeff Goldbloom's "David Levinson", Bill Pullman's believable  "U.S. President Whitmore", Judd Hirsch's curmudgeon father to Goldboom's David "Julius Levinson" and finally Randy Quaid's crop dusting pilot "Russell Casse".  The list goes on as even the small support roles were handled great on the human level.  Lastly, the military and political characters were handled intelligently.  This is a crowd pleaser film and had the film been released after 9/11, it probably would have been more successful because of its sense of pride and patriotism themes.  There are some lapses in terms of resolving the alien threat in a mere few days.  When in terms of real human conflict, it takes months and years to resolve anything.  But, hey! This is Hollywood and it's only a movie...but what a movie!  Great production values, great casting and decent script makes I.D.4 one of the few modern sci-fi movies that would be considered a modern classic on an epic scale. The creators took on something old and made it new again. A film which demands repeat viewings for its overall feel-good aura.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Independence Day" is one of Hollywood's best action/disaster films of all-time. Filled with remarkable special effects and a good script, "Independence Day" has gone on to be not only a beloved thrill-ride movie, but one of the biggest blockbusters in movie-making history making over $800,000,000 on a $75,000,000 budget.<br /><br /> The film is about a group of aliens who wreck havoc on mankind, killing people and destroying buildings, as humans fight desperately to save themselves from being destroyed by these evil forces. "Independence Day" is a combination of the movies "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "The Day After Tomorrow", and many of the neat disaster epics from the seventies, but produced on a much more high-scaled level where money was obviously no object for the studio: the producers wanted to make an extraordinary "disaster" film, and they succeeded. Both terrifying and jaw-dropping, "Independence Day" leaves the viewer wondering "could this really happen someday?".<br /><br /> The bonuses in this edition include 9 minutes of restored features, commentary by director Roland Emmerich, a 30-minute documentary on the making of "Independence Day", an HBO feature entitled "First Look: Independence Day" a 33 minute feature hosted by Jeff Goldblum, plus much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered.

A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was.

It has no story, no plot, no acting, and no script.  The special effects are average at best, it looks really fake on TV.  The aliens use Macintosh software to run their spaceship no wonder they lost.  This movie released in 1996 made 306 million dollars and was the first in many to just base a movie on special effects. Please don't buy this because they will just keep making more movies like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>They have put ships in the sky to kill people.

We were bombarded with an upsurd advertisement campaign.  Every single cast member was invited onto at least one of the talk shows at least once a piece before the movie even hit theatres.  Fast food.  Action figures.  Magazines.  It was everywhere.  It was supposed to be the movie of the century!!! ... at least that was what we were being told.  And it looked like it probably would be.<p>Then I went to see it ... with eyes-wide and excited; hand buried in popcorn.  Then... I realized, about forty minutes in ... I'd been conned.  Never in my life did I feel so stupid ... I had fallen for it.  I had fallen foolishly for the most hyped movie of all time.<p>This wasn't the movie of the century... it was a two-hour commercial.  It was a scatter-brained, poorly-written, poorly-directed fiasco.  Other than the incredible special effects that went to waste on INDEPENDENCE DAY, the movie only deserved to be shown on the DISNEY CHANNEL... once.<p>A movie that was written so poorly that it went from joking around one second, to nuking Houston the next (anyone know anybody in Houston? ... apparently no one who made this movie did, because they sure didn't care).  <p>An alien movie that was about as scary as your local christian church's haunted house.  A movie that couldn't figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy, a thriller, or a UPN movie of the week.  <p>And then came the ... finale ... "I'M BACK!!!"  And they all came tumbling down.<p>Well, I won't be back.  And I learned a valuable lesson: Any movie who has to promote as heavily as INDEPENDENCE DAY had to, probably isn't worth the paper they used to write the script.

No such luck.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>1996, a presidential election year with a very much criticized President, Bill Clinton, and a strong conservative movement building up in the wings to impose later on a republican president that would sell a vision  of the world drawn from the apocryphal gospel of some christian born again that is no saint at all. But you have to put this vision on the market, peddle it to innocent customers and prepare the public to the total war it would justify and bring upon Americans, with eventually thousands of dead totally collateral victims. This film is part of this ? cultural ? strategy to make us believe the US are under attack and has to go to war and pay the sacrificial price of this war and its victory. In other words it was paving the way to the election, by the Supreme Court first and later with a minority of the popular vote, of George W. Bush and his war on terrorism, on Afghanistan and on Iraq. Luckily the infernal mechanism seems to have come to a gripped halt, to a citizen-inspired grasp of reason, in time to avoid two or three more wars on who knows what and whom. The result is a schmaltzy waltz with invading extra-terrestrials. Nothing is orginal. The basic idea comes from Ronald Lafayette Hubbard and his Battle Earth, without the basic idea that human beings are slaves and must not be destroyed because they can be exploited, without the long and fundamental initiative coming from the deepest depth of the human species to build up a counter-offensive and the reconquest of liberty. The Extra-terrestrials are copied from so many other productions that it is nearly an icon of visual and pictorial plagiarism. And the victory is borrowed from H.G. Wells and his War of the Worlds in the form of a virus, this time a computer virus. That's a creative twist, isn't it, in other words spam ? The actors try to do what they can but it is so incredible that they seem to be acting with a tongue, or maybe two or three tongues, in their cheeks. When Hollywood goes to war in the political field, it can be pretty bad and unbearably unethical. Every producer and director is not Charlie Chaplin, not even Jeff Goldblum, thanks God for it, otherwise we would effectively, efficaciously and effectfully be sold any kind of adventurous caper on the international stage. Though in this case this campaign succeeded quite well, even if it seems to have come to an end.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>I don't know how to explain to somebody that likes this why this movie sucks. Here's a few random things that come to mind in no particular order: 1) Will Smith is an uninteresting actor except for when he was in MEN IN BLACK and some other movie I can't remember the title of. 2) Bill Pullman is the president. 3) The president is one of the heros of the movie. LAME. Presidents are cowards and frauds that would hide in a bunker somewhere. 4) The plot is dumb and sucks; particularly the silly backstory between the president and Jeff Goldblum. 5) The name of the movie is lame. INDEPENDENCE DAY. Right. First we kicked British --- and now the aliens. America Rules!!! USA! USA! USA! America is saves the planet. The way the aliens are defeated- Lol! OK, "it's just a movie". It was a virus that destroyed them like in some other story about an alien invasion, but this time one for the alien's computers. "Star Wars" for the next generation I spot a reviewer claim?! SAY WHAT?? Sorry, that reviewer doesn't got a clue. And comparing it to STARSHIP TROOPERS? No, that is completely wrong. Saying this movie is better than STARSHIP TROOPERS is a complete misunderstanding of what STARSHIP TROOPERS was about. They didn't get it. STARSHIP TROOPERS is both a brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick in certain aspects masquerading as a B movie as well as perfect parody of WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive "bugs" to make the point. Stuff that works: I like seeing the White House explode and other stuff. The alien ships look pretty cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>The release of &quot;Independence Day&quot; on DVD proved to be a huge  success, and I must say that the treatment this movie has received on this  high-definition video transfer is all that it deserved and more. A  wonderworks of special effects and elements from 50's sci-fi films that  captured people of that generation, Independence Day moved up into the list  of top ten money grossers of all time after its release. While the  storyline remains overall trivial, it does have a certain rush to it in  many cases, especially when things begin to pick up with the invasion. A  typical day in American cities turns into a nightmare when spacecraft the  size of each city begin to blast the cities to nothing but ruin in an  attempt to exterminate the human race. Soon, it's up to a small band of  survivors, including a scientifically-gifted cable repairman (Jeff  Goldblum), an Air Force pilot (Will Smith), a drunken crop duster (Randy  Quaid), and the President (Bill Pullman), to try and figure out a way to  stop the invasion before earth is completely taken over. One thing about  this film: it never stops moving. No matter what scene you're watching, it  is either driven by emotional force or adrenaline action sequences. The  rumors are true as to the special effects as well: they ARE seamless. Using  models and computer effects, Volker Engle and Douglass Smith create images  that fool audiences moreso than any other movie in history. Performances by  all lead and supporting actors make the movie very enjoyable as well as  believable, played out with force, emotion and effort. The DVD release of  the film is superbly crafted: the video resolution displays brilliant  colors and sharp, crisp images that will be very pleasing to the eye. Sound  design immerses the viewer in a non-stop surround environment, utilizing  the rear surrounds as well as the .1 LFE in action scenes and musical  score. A hit in every way, &quot;Independence Day&quot; is an enjoyable  popcorn movie that can be watched with emotion and laughter.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Independence Day is a true summer blockbuster in the traditional sense. Released on July 4, 1996, the film enjoyed a long run in theaters across America, and the larger than life plot line made this sci-fi thriller one of the biggest commercial draws of its time. From an entertainment standpoint, it deserved every bit of attention. Because Independence Day is an epic that a wide-ranging number of movie-goers will find fun and enjoyable...<br /><br />When Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) looks forward to his acceptance by NASA in the astronaut training program, he experiences a rude awakening when strange movements of clouds hover into the area and reveal themselves to be alien spaceships. As the world's leading governments and militaries go on high alert, the world holds its breath waiting to see what will happen next. Against the backdrop of this worldwide event, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) notices a peculiar pattern in the spaceship deployment. Along with his father Julius (Judd Hirsch), he urgently travels from New York to Washington DC in order to warn the president of impending danger (his ex-wife is an aide to the president, thus providing him with a means of access).<br /><br />Despite their past differences, David manages to convince President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) that the true intent of the alien spacecraft is invasion, and no olive branch of peace will appease them. When David's assertion proves to be right, most of the world's major cities are utterly destroyed by a super laser emanating from the undersides of the monstrous, city-sized alien structures. As all-out war ensues, earthlings quickly discover that the alien craft are protected by an impenetrable force field, thus rendering their desperate attacks useless.<br /><br />As refugees crowd into the rural areas of America, Capt. Hiller is brought to Area 51 and introduced to the president. The once mysterious location is revealed to house an alien spacecraft identical to the ones which now threaten earth, and plans are put in place to make this craft operational once again. But, still, the problem remains of how to go about defeating the alien invaders... The answer comes to David when his father tells him not to catch cold.<br /><br />With a new plan, David and Hiller fly the alien spacecraft right into the bowels of enemy territory. Captured inside the mothership, Smith and Goldblum act out one of the more memorable scenes of the movie when they enjoy a pair of cigars while held in captivity. Goldblum's character, who earlier derided cigars as deathtraps, can now appreciate some of the finer aspects of a life he now realizes could end at any time. In fact, it makes me want to go light up a fine Arturo Fuente right now!<br /><br />Overall, I didn't expect to like this film, and I did. Surprisingly similar in its plot devices to the George Lucas hit The Return Of The Jedi, Independence Day is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable film. The storyline of human versus alien tends to evoke a subconscious adrenaline in even the most casual of viewers, leading to an emotionally involved audience anxious to discover the outcome of this modern day war of the worlds. Although by no means is this to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, it ranks as a definite must-see as a result of its overall entertainment value. Take a chance and go see it if you haven't done so already...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Roland Emmerich<br />Cast:  Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein.<br />Running Time:  145 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for some violence, a particularly scary alien scene, and brief language.<p>A quintessential example of the "summer blockbuster", "Independence Day" is a full-filled science-fiction epic with a likable cast, astonishing special effects, and a unique style of direction from Roland Emmerich.  It is a film that emphasizes the American dream, patriotism, and perhaps is a stab at communism, in which the war against the all-mighty alien terror is actually symbolizing the decades of struggle that the United States dealt with against socialist countries such as Nazi Germany and the U.S.S.R.<p>Will Smith is excellent as a rogue fighter pilot who finds himself preparing for an unusual enemy--a species of extra-terrestrials that first hovered over the planet Earth, but then struck mightily with beams of destructive fire that ripped apart all of the world's major cities.  Bill Pullman gives an adequate role as the gung ho president who must trust his heart and not let political issues determine the fate of the world as he knows it.  Jeff Goldblum play his usual scientist role, but is wittier than usual and is a grand compliment to the Fresh Prince.  The three main stars engage in an all-out battle against the aliens, eventually coming face to face with the mothership and its inhabitants.<p>"ID4" is certainly not an emotional film, but more of a visual effects spectacle that show-boats the arriving technology at the time.  Director Roland Emmerich basically states "screw your cool-looking dinosaurs Spielberg, check this out!" and lets loose with a barrage of intense explosions and catastrophe, making the first half of the film similar to that of an old 1970's national disaster flick.  The second half of "Independence Day" is truly enjoyable as the audience gets to konw the characters better and they are intertwined in a battle for mankind.  Cheesy, outlandish, and sometimes down-right stupid; however, it not taken too seroiusly, "ID4" is a rock-em, sock-em adventure that will delight the whole family.  Still probably has the coolest looking spaceship ever created on film--it is amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>I saw this piece of work in the theaters, and at the time I thought it was okay. Seeing it for the second time here made me reconsider. This movie blows. Sure, there's plenty of action, and little else. Will Smith plays a fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum a computer expert, and Bill Pullman plays the President in this film. This movie, in which aliens invade the Earth, cannot be called science fiction. Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers. This movie does do exactly what it set out to do. The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien. On the other hand, the aliens themselves are laughable, as is the &quot;plot&quot;, which should make comic-book writers shudder. Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this.

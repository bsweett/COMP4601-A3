I'm glad he came back  to his roots after his semi-serious stint in Peter Jackson's "King Kong".  Physical comedy is what he does best because he throws his all into it fearlessly.<br /><br />Nacho Libre is a Mexican Friar serving as the bored orphanage cook longing to be a famous wrestler.  He teams up with a homeless man who serves as his hapless yet loyal sidekick.  Nacho strives to be the best wrestler, even with the misgivings and caution of the lovely Sister Encarnacion whom he harbors feelings for.  She eventually supports his endeavor.<br /><br />While the movie is predominately geared towards Jack Black's physical comedy, the directorial style is vey much Jared Hess's.  Occasional one-liners come out like in "Napolean Dynamite".  Either way, the blend was spot on and made for a very funny film without being over campy and completely ridiculous.  The musical accompaniment is comically heroic as well as heart-warming.  Worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Jack Black makes the movie.

Whether that is good or bad will be up to you, but this is not an average comedy.  First, you'll see as the movie begins, it is presented by Nickelodian.  While there is a little bit of "bathroom humor", there is no bad language or sex in the film, and the movie is even somewhat respectful to the Catholic church and its traditions.<br /><br />Jack Black is Nacho and since he was little, he dreamed of being a wrestler.  Now, grown, he serves all the meals and a Catholic orphanage in Mexico.  Nacho runs off and, while wearing a costume, begins to enter local wrestling matches.  Nacho has dreams of fame and fortune and fighting the champion Ramses.  Ultimately, Nacho must decide what truly matters in life as his wrestling career continues.  The movie is full of quirky characters and understated comedy.  If you've seen Napolean Dynomite, you'll see the style of that film continued here.  And that is one of my major complaints of the film.  The style of the movie almost seems more important that the characters or the plot.  While I enjoyed the movie, I never really felt connected to the characters or worried about the stakes presented to Nacho, the beautiful Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n or his emaciated wrestling partner Esqueleto.<br /><br />Overall, a humorous movie that can be watched with the entire family.  A must see for Napolean Dynomite fans, but general audiences may only be mildly amused.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I'm am one of the few probably who never liked Napoleon Dynamite, done by Jared Hess. It didn't even had a plot so much as one series of mishaps after another that eventually led to something, which is okay if the film was actually funny. For the "hugely anticipated follow-up", Hess enlisted Jack Black, set it in Mexico and centered it around wrestling. While it does feel at times a step-up, it's ultimately one of those films where the bright spots than get completely overshadowed by something totally ridiculous.<br /><br />Ignacio is a monk/chef working in a Catholic orphanage. He secretly longs for the career of a Mexican wrestler. It can work since prize money, even if he loses, can afford the children better food than the hard-to-determine stuff he has to feed them. Only thing is is that the church frowns upon it, as well as his crush, nun Encarnacion (are they serious with this name? Don't know if it's an actual cultural name but eek). He decides to go ahead with it anyway, even having to fight professional wrestler Ramses.<br /><br />While I'm not bragging, I always prided myself on being very open-minded about music or film, not once considering something "beneath me". Sure I watch films like Seven or Terminator 2 but then you'd see in my DVD collection several romantic comedies or some animated children's films. Why bother mentioning it? Well it ties into some of the film's gags: reliance on scatological, or "potty humor". On more than one occasion, Ignacio does some flatulence almost as if that's so basic that anyone will laugh at it. Star Jack Black's portly belly is on display several times throughout the film and there's the stock joke of somebody ready to hit somebody with something only missing and hitting a friend/girlfriend/relative instead (in this case, it's a big woman with a crush on Ignacio's friend Steve only to have her disappear from the story).<br /><br />Ultimately though how's the casting? Well one reviewer pointed out once about Tom Cruise that it seemed like he was playing himself who was playing a character. Jack Black is slightly similar in that we can't seem to separate the actor from the character, as if their star power is too noticeable. So of course we have certain Jack Black-isms throughout the film and even a moment where he sings, as if the script writer thought there should be something for Tenacious D fans. Oddly I rented Spanglish as well which has a bit of a similar tone but it also had a particular cast member who shined above the rest. In that case it was Paz Vega, or even Shelbie Bruce, and here it's Ana de la Reguera. While not exactly the biggest outlet for talent, she does have that sincerity and likability that you'd wanna fight for her too (not to mention absolutely gorgeous of course).<br /><br />Luckily I don't judge directors on previous films (if that were the case, Spielberg would get a huge rant from me because of 1941 and Always) but Napoleon Dynamite was one of the most overrated films I've seen but Nacho Libre on its own shows there's something brewing underneath but ultimately still feels limited by its old jokes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Jared Hess, the man behind 2004's sleeper hit Napolean Dynamite, returns with the explosively hilarious comedy, Nacho Libre.<br /><br />Jack Black (King Kong, School of Rock) plays Ignacio, known as Nacho, an orphan raised at a Mexican monestary, and assigned to serve the orphanage by cooking the food for the children. However, Nacho has other ambitions in life, and that is to become a successful wrestler, and win the heart of the new nun, the beautiful Encarnacion, played by Ana de la Reguera. He picks out a wrestling partner, a skinny homeless bum named Esqueleto, played by Hector Jimenez, dons a suit and mask and goes out secretly at night to the rings, fights it out, loses, and makes some serious money. He eyes the greatest fighter Ramses, played by Cesar Gonzalez, as his next opponent because if he wins he'll make enough money to buy the monestary a bus for the children to go on trips, and prove to Encarnacion and everybody else that wrestling is not a sin.<br /><br />Jack Black is hilarious as Nacho Libre. However, the best thing about the movie is Jared Hess's unconventional directing, made famous in Napolean Dynamite, the film's quirky dialogue and punch lines, and the one-dimensional character's personalities and body languages.<br /><br />Like Napolean, Nacho Libre is definitely a winner!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>Foremost, what I failed to recognize (and what many of the other reviewers who shredded the film failed to recognize) is that this is a Nickelodeon production (and appropriately so, rated for children). So if you are expecting another "Saving Silverman," "Orange County," or even "High Fidelity," forget about it!! There is nothing nuanced about this work. This was made for kids . . . and on some very basic level, it succeeds in being entertaining (to children). But there is very little to sustain an adult viewer.<br /><br />The larger-than-life, thoroughly garish soundtrack will have the kids dancing around the coffee table (though you might find yourself praying for ear-plugs!) Jack Black is totally committed to his role as Nacho (which is oddly endearing) . . . his insanely "bad" accent is either insulting or funny (I cannot tell which). Darius Rose is charming as Chancho . . . an impressive display of youthful talent; hopefully he will move-on to greater roles! Likewise for H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez!!<br /><br />The cinematography is surprisingly "dazzling" (to distract the viewer from the lack of story, of course). The kids will love the high-contrast (lots of very bright colors) and the slick presentation. You have to give credit to Hess for shooting a "good looking" film!! Still, (I cannot write this enough) . . . there is no substance here . . . AT ALL.<br /><br />Yep, the movie stinks on SO MANY levels. But I have little doubt that the target demographic for this film (pre-teens) enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Nacho Libre is a ridiculously funny movie. All of my favorite comedies are completely silly, and Nacho Libre is no exception. There is plenty of stuff that makes no sense, as you can pretty much tell from the first "training" scene. But the chemistry is there with the cast and the script is so off-the-wall that you have to be completely lacking a sense of humor to not crack up while watching Nacho Libre. Director Hess does a great job in giving Black freedom to steal the show. The movie depicts a Mexican Priest who has a secret fantasy to be a Luchador (Wrestler). Nacho Libre (Black) attempts the difficult task of living the life of the Luchador as well as the Priest of the orphanage.<br /><br />You have to appreciate the subtleties! Jack Black uses a lot of physical nuances as punch lines, so you must pay attention or you'll miss the jokes. I don't know much about Mexican wrestling, so I am not aware of how this movie will be accepted by fans of the sport. But it is funny. Do not look to the script or story for any judgment regarding this movie's merit, because the charm lies solely in the acting. Many of the greatest moments were created by a combination of manner and timing, as well as editing of course. My only slight complaint about the film is that sometimes Jack Black is a little too Jack Black and not enough Ignacio. He lays his normal schtick on a bit thick now and then and puts the character and the lucha libre storyline on the backburner. But as a fan of lucha libre I really loved the way it's portrayed in this film. There are some nice action sequences and the last fight scene is really unique and well done. Plus the Human Tornado cameo will have PWG fans marking out.<br /><br />This movie is obviously a product of Nickelodeon Studios, and the humor will be appreciated by fans of Jimmy Neutron, Sponge bob, and other Nicktoons. If you're a fan of Jack Black and Tenacious D you'll enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>What can I say?  I have looked through the other reviews and can hardly disagree with the consensus.  Therefore I will unnecessarily write yet another review that will simply repeat everything that's already been said.<br /><br />Yes, what a slog.  Though a fan of Jack Black, I was both shocked and saddened to see him in this tedious tripe.<br /><br />I suppose the script's premise must have seemed a lot more hilarious on paper than it turned out to be once they hitched Black up in those turquoise tights.<br /><br />There are very few laughs.  I think in large part this is because Black is harnessed:  forced to deliver all his lines through his clenched and rigid Mexican accent.<br /><br />But whatever your theory is, you gotta agree:  there are very few laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>What a classic film. Who would have thought that a movie about a fat monk in a mexican orphanage who aspires to become a fighter would be such a great film!? Helmed by director Jared Hess, this film packs a great number of laughs and tons of classic one liners. Really, if you like terribly corny humor, done right, this is your movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Jack Black plays Nacho in "Nacho Libre", a monk who works at a Mexican orphanage. He's the cook, and sometimes he just has gruel for the children, which doesn't please anyone. He gets into wrestling, with a disguise and a tag partner, and starts making some more money for salads for the children. Even though he often loses, he's very entertaining, and because of this he still gets paid. He's also in love with a nun...<br /><br />I think Jared Hess, the director, has a really exciting and unique style. Trouble is, the script isn't the best one he's had to work with. It hold's together fairly good, but there are some pretty hammy and cheesy moments about. Looks like they had a lot of fun though.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>When I first heard of it the plot of a fryer wrestler sounded different to the other things being released lately, but I'm glad I waited till it was available to rent rather then have gone to see it at the theaters.<br /><br />Jack Black stars as a Fryer who is pretty much useless to the other priests of a small village somewhere in Mexico. He yearns to hear people chant his name in vanity and learns about a wrestling tournament where the winners receive 200 bucks. He finds himself a sidekick and enters the tournament and loses, but receives enough money top help support the orfens he takes care of at the monastery. Any way a plot develops, he can't let his brothers know he's a wrestler cause its a sin blah blah blah<br /><br />he starts a battle with some golden masked guy that wasn't done right, I just did not care less if he beat him or not. The poor attempt at a love story between a fryer and a nun was pathetic. The wrestling itself is pretty poor, the opening match is not bad, but the rest of it is CGI and wire work, pretty sad when comparing it to what luchiodooirs really can do... only about two decent scene's of wrestling in the start, and then next to nothing later on. It's pretty obvious Jack Black didn't do any of the wrestling stunts, hence the use of a mask.<br /><br />In the end, i thought, "man that was s###" you didn't believe in the character, you didn't care if he won, the love story was not needed or needed to be extended more, the whole "do it for them" thing didn't make you feel a thing. And worst of all... where is the comedy? I saw a few pathetic attempts, but come on, what can you remember that was funny in this? There was no comedy and they tried to add fart sounds in here and there to make it funnier, but, they failed, a fart can be hilarious if done right, but this movie failed at it, it was just sounds thrown in for the hell of it.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-2 BD-25<br />Running time: 1:32:08<br />Movie size: 18,97 GB<br />Disc size: 24,80 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.87 Mbps<br />Subtitles: English SDH / English / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 22<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />#Audio commentary<br />#5 featurettes:<br />--Detras De Le Camara (28m:32s)<br />--Jack Black Unmasked!

Most of the physical humor works nicely.  Some of the situational humor is very weak and often does not work.  But there are several moments in this movie where I laughed loudly and long.<br /><br />This movie is a relatively lightweight effort.  I suspect some people may be offended by how religion is portrayed in this movie.  Some people may find the physical humor, which is a pale shadow of that performed by the Three Stooges, to be somewhat weak.  However, there are enough laughs that this movie is worth a one-time watch.<br /><br />Good luck!</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Jack Black remains the great actor he is. The storyline is an absolute joke. I quite liked the kids which quite surprised me cause I hate kids otherwise. There were 2 funny scenes in the movie but overall the movie lacks that "good movie" feel. This is not a must watch and if you don't watch it, don't be too upset about it. A lot of humor in the movie resigns before being delivered and that makes it rather flat. I won't be surprised if you switch this movie off ten minutes into it. Saving grace in the film was the brother-sister relationship. Or was it?<br /><br />Watch if you are a Jack Black fan and MUST watch this film. Otherwise, avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>This has got to be the best friar-turned-wrestler film I've ever seen.  Of course, it may be the only friar-turned-wrestler movie ever made, but that doesn't matter.  What does matter is the fact that Jack Black is funny enough to make a dumb story like this one quite entertaining.  I don't see Nacho Libre being made without Jack Black.  Imagine pitching the story to a studio.  The setting is a Mexican orphanage, and there's this friar named Ignacio (Jack Black) - well, he's not really a friar, okay he's sort of a friar, and he cooks for the children - but he has always wanted to be a wrestler (whom we'll call Nacho for fairly obvious reasons).  I know what you're thinking - the church tends to frown on violence - and that's why he wears a disguise.  But here's the best part - he's doing it for the children, so he can afford to feed them something better than nasty beans and nachos, etc.  Um, we also, in Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Requera), have this really hot nun for our friar/wrestler to take a fancy to.  Granted, that's getting dangerously into taboo territory, but it can't be helped.  Let's face it, no man is going to get in a ring with a bunch of killers unless he's trying to impress a woman.<br /><br />Don't be expecting all of the inane antics of American professional wrestling.  This story takes place (and was filmed) in Mexico, where luchadors actually earn a lot of respect for their dangerous work.  You also have a plethora of guys getting in the ring - short guys, skinny guys, overweight guys, you name it, they all mix it up with chiseled athletes such as the champ, Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez).  Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), Nacho's tag-team partner (whom he met fighting over a bag of nachos) is 6'2" and maybe 105 pounds soaking wet.  Not surprisingly, this new tag-team struggles coming out of the gate, but Nacho is determined to be a champion and maybe even impress Sister Encarnacion in the process with his manliness.  He tries learning the ways of the eagle, prayer, and even a commitment to turn over all prize money to the orphanage, but even still he can't get over the hump and actually win a match.  The local crowd loves the masked Nacho and his skinny sidekick, though, so they get to fight every week and take home some money to help the kids.<br /><br />Ignacio can only keep his secret for so long, of course, which puts him at odds with the other friars who always treat him shabbily, anyway.  When his big chance to win a fight against the local champion, Ramses, doesn't pan out, he really hits the proverbial bottom.  Banished from the monastery, alienated from the orphans he cares about so much, having blown his chance at wrestling stardom, and completely nacho-free, what will become of him?  Who's going to teach Ramses all about the deadly sin of vanity?  And what will become of Sister Encarnacion and all of the orphans?<br /><br />Apart from addressing the question of whether fighting is always sinful, and addressing the plight of the orphans and their need of a hero, there's really no substance to this movie at all.  Who cares, though?  Jack Black's antics in the monastery as well as in the ring are consistently funny, the whole underdog theme works as well as it always does, and you even have a gorgeous woman adorning the somber halls of the austere monastery.  Nacho Libre is everything you could want in a wrestling friar comedy.  And, yes, I thought the accent was pretty darn funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>It's good to know that farce is alive and well in the world. Since the mid 90's it feels like film makers have lost their grip on truly great weird comedy. Movies that speak to the few and turn off the rest. It seems that even as the tools to unlock our imaginations get flashier and flashier, and special effect budgets grow and grown, American film grow static and stale. Then when it seems like all hope is lost, a film like NACHO LIBRE comes along.<br /><br />Somewhere in Mexico, a young priest named Nacho (Jack Black) longs to be recognized. He's tired of serving the same bland food to the young boys in his charge. He's tired of being disrespected by the other priests. He longs to be a luchadore (a Mexican wrestler), and to gain the affections of the stunning Sister Encarnacion (Ana del la Regura). Then when all hope is lost he teams up with a new friend named Esquelta, and takes the Mexican wrestling world by storm. Will the orphan boys get better food? Will Nacho win the heart of Sister Encarnacion? Will he lose everything he has, on a quest to become a great warrior? Giving this movie its due will provide those answers and more. The movie not perfect. It's a little overly long and some of the jokes fall flat on their face. But there is an earnestness and a sweet gentility in the film that will win you over. You cannot enter this movie with the wrong attitude and if you don't like weird movies its not for you. But if you let it entertain you and if you give into the fact that it really bizarre, it will work. You have to take every scene with grain of salt and logic must be thrown out the window. But if you turn off that part of your brain that strives for everything to be plausible, than this film will entertain.<br /><br />Then for no apparent reason the movie does something I didn't quite expect, it begins to tackle a serious subject. Behind all the silliness is a story about how legalism traps us in a place of boredom and predictability. Whether it be religious legalism or secular legalism, NACHO LIBRE is about a misfit who succeeds because he goes out on a limb. He doesn't give up his religious fervor when the chips are down, when his atheist friend tells him to give into science and logic, and he doesn't give up on God because men of cloth treat him badly. He stays true to his faith and not his religion. This message is not beaten over the audiences head. This is not a religious picture. But it gives the film a dimension that I didn't expect.<br /><br />Director Jared Hess doesn't stray to far from his Napoleon Dynamite roots. But that's okay. It works here and he hits the right comic tones. I can't wait to get the DVD because I'm convinced that the film really needs to be viewed a second time.  (I'm reviewing this based off the movie, not the actual DVD; I have yet to get that.)  Knowing what to expect allows the audience to settle into Hess' skewed comedy. The film is very dry and if you don't know what to expect its easy to dismiss the comedy and think the film is horrible. You have to work at it a little bit and let it sink in. But when you get it you'll love it.<br /><br />If you're looking for an hour and half of silliness you can't go wrong with NACHO LIBRE. It's cute, sweet, and you get to stare at Jack Black's upper torso for far too long. Trust me- if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies, this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Like Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre is going to have people on both sides of the fence, leaving few sitting on it.  Count me on the "for" side - in fact, this is the funniest, and one of the most heart warming movies of 2006.  After a number of disappointments, it was an absolute pleasure to sit through a movie with a script that sings, characters that one wants to root for from the beginning and a soundtrack that can't help but keep a smile on  your face.<br /><br />Jack Black is in Shallow Hal mode here, alternating  between disgusting and endearing, and cracking the audience up at every turn.  A lot of reviews have mentioned this is not much more than Black running around half naked and sporting a faux Mexican personnage.  It is so much more than that.  Black's "Nacho" is a classic tortured spirit, caught up in the ordinariness of his mundane life as a Friar at an orphanage but dreams of stardom as a luchadore . . . and, of course, love.<br /><br />The love interest here is a little complicated as it's a nun Nacho's in love with;  Sister Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n, portrayed by the stunning Ana de la Reguera (who strongly resembles a younger Penelope Cruz).<br /><br />Nacho's sidekick features an amazingly hilarious physical actor, the rubbery faced, thin-as-a-noodle, Hector Jimenez as Esqueleto.  His screams alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />There are sight gags throughout of the highest - and lowest - order, touches of the bizarre that echo Mr. Hess's first major effort; combined with an at times almost childlike sense of wonderment and look at life.<br /><br />This is a major American filmmaker's sophmore effort and it is a glorious, wonderful, big smelly valentine of a movie.  You couldn't ask for more from a summer flick than Nacho has to offer.  See it!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Nacho Libre' was referred to us by some friends and so, despite not caring to much for seeing it, my wife and I decided to give it a try.  Immediately I saw comparisons to `Napoleon Dynamite' and realized that this may just be funny.  Gladly I can say that the money was well spent.  `Nacho Libre' succeeds in making me laugh, and I'm sure it will bring quite a few laughs to each and every viewer.  It's far from perfect and will not be remembered as comic genius, but then again it's a small Nickelodeon film with dry humor and fart jokes so it's not to be expected to reign supreme.  It delivers what it sets out to deliver, easy laughs.  Jack Black is not the funniest guy around, but he knows how to poke fun at himself in order to rouse a laugh, and here he has plenty of playing field with his pudgy physic and boyishly immature charm.<br /><br />The film focuses on Ignacio, a cook in a monastery who dreams of being a pro wrestler.  He desires to help the orphans whom he feeds and all in all is a decent kind hearted man.  When the beautiful nun Sister Encaracion moves into the monastery he begins to try and woo her but he runs into opposition and inside competition.  After being attacked by a street urchin by the name of Esqueleto he decides to team up with this man in order to tag-team wrestle for money.  This way he can purchase fresh and tasty food for the orphans and hopefully win the heart of Sister Encaracion.<br /><br />The acting is decent, what's to be expected from a film of this caliber.  It's not supposed to be brilliant acting so do be disappointed when you realize it's not.  Jack Black is his usual funny self, if you find him usually funny, but to me it was Hector Jimenez who proved to be best in show.  His Esqueleto has the best one liners and he has the physic of a thirteen year old corpse so the physical comedy is golden.  Ana de la Reguera is pretty much a prop here, she's pretty and that's all they really need her to be, someone we believe Black's character would fall for, but also someone we believe could fall for Black.  She works just fine.<br /><br />The real heart of the laughs here comes from the outrageous wrestling matches.  The fighters get crazier and crazier and the moves are as outlandish as they are painful to watch.  Black and Jimenez really shine here with their physical comedy and they provide some of the only `laugh out loud' scenes in the film.  That's not to say that the film is a waste if not for a few fight scenes, but these scenes are the only scenes, at least for me, that excite a vocal reaction.  There are other funny scenes but they are laughs I can keep to myself.  The script could have been a little tighter maybe, but when you sit back and see the style of comedy they were going for it actually works well.  If you're a fan of the humor used in `Napoleon Dynamite' then you'll enjoy `Nacho Libre' and if you're a fan of Jack Black then I'm sure you've already added this family comedy to your DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed School of Rock and several other Black movies.  This one I wasn't too crazy about.  The story sounds perfect for Jack.  A good hearted friar wants to earn some money to better feed the children in the orphanage in Mexico, so he secretly becomes a wrestler to earn the money and earn respect.  I thought the first time I saw him in the tights was hysterical.  Also the fact that he farts every time he jumps was funny in a stupid way.  By the end of the movie though, the joke of his flabby body has run thin.  I didn't find much else in the movie to laugh at.  Black is a good personality and very likeable.  His comedy is best when it is physical.  There just wasn't enough to sustain this movie.  It felt like a SNL skit that is expanded into a feature length film.  It is a funny concept for a few minutes, but after that it starts to falter.  I would rent this one first to make sure it is to your taste.  I know several people that love this money and a few more that hated it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Jack Black is Brother Ignacio, a lowly "friar" toiling mostly as a cook for a dilapidated Mexican monastery that doubles as an orphanage. He harbors a love for the beautiful nun Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) while struggling daily to provide meals for his young charges. One day, after witnessing the adoration heaped on a famous luchador (wrestler), Ignacio hits on the idea of becoming a masked wrestler himself, to gain fame and make ends meet. He elicits the help of a strange street person who has a tendency to scrounge and steal donated tortilla chips (Nacho Libre, get it?) meant for the orphans. Soon, both Ignacio and Esqueleto (as the street person later becomes known in his luchador persona) are "training" to be tag-team wrestlers - if training means pasting cow poo on your face as a luchador mask, leaping into a fenced meadow and being gored by a rampaging bull, being struck by arrows, and having a beehive flung at you. Eventually, Ignacio and Esqueleto compete in the ring, where Ignacio becomes Nacho Libre. They end up doing very poorly but still getting paid, and this becomes a continuing pattern. Nacho Libre soon tires of losing (especially to midgets and women) and wants to go pro. He gets his chance when he finally faces the intimidating Ramses, a champion luchador. Will Nacho realize his dream? And what of his romance with Sister Encarnacion? And will the kids get fed?<br /><br />Omigod, I laughed my head off throughout this film, as did the whole theatre audience. Jack Black sometimes is too much for me to take but in the proper vehicle, the man definitely can shine. Like The School of Rock, Nacho Libre must've been created with Jack Black in mind. He certainly is allowed a huge amount of leeway here. It needed a storyline as physical and outrageous as this one for Jack's ever flamboyant persona to convincingly mesh. Jack's arched eyebrows, Grinch-like expressions, exaggerated poses, and just plain nutty over-the-topness are all put to good use in this rowdy but good-natured film. He even manages to sing two songs, the one about Encarnacion being rendered in particularly Jack Black style.<br /><br />Hector Jimenez as the emaciated Esqueleto, with his girly shriek and just plain-out weird act, is hilarious. Makes me think Esqueleto is what we would've gotten from Johnny Depp if he'd experimented just a bit further with his Cap'n Sparrow role. Black and Jimenez make a potent comedic team.<br /><br />There are some holes in the plot, some wrong choices the director makes. I felt, for instance, that the cliff-climbing for the eagle's egg scene didn't pay off. And also, the unfunny bit where Ignacio and Encarnacion go out on a date, with Ignacio expecting to be waylaid by a "gang." But the constant humor (mostly supplied by Black, and abetted by Jimenez) more or less carries the movie over such minor hiccups. I will say that Jack Black in the wrestling ring isn't as funny as Jack Black out of it.<br /><br />There are specific scenes of goofy hilarity I wish I could mention here but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Just go see the thing already.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Watching the trailers for this film, I really didn't think it was going to be very good. I finally watched it and I was very surprised! I laughed out loud often! This is a silly movie,but Black and his sidekick keep this film from being a disaster.

But he is more of a liability than an asset in his recent movies including King Kong and now Nacho Libre.  I popped this into the player and sat back wondering what the hell was going on.  Besides the pointless plot, the movie is just not funny.  Watching Black run around shirtless, occansionally farting, and getting beat up is only funny for so long.  The HD DVD picture quality was decent, but it certainly did not make this movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>It's good to know that farce is alive and well in the world.  Since the mid 90's it feels like film makers have lost their grip on truly great weird comedy.  Movies that speak to the few and turn off the rest.  It seems that even as the tools to unlock our imaginations get flashier and flashier, and special effect budgets grow and grown, American film grow static and stale.  Then when it seems like all hope is lost, a film like NACHO LIBRE comes along.<br /><br />Somewhere in Mexico, a young priest named Nacho (Jack Black) longs to be recognized.  He's tired of serving the same bland food to the young boys in his charge.  He's tired of being disrespected by the other priests.  He longs to be a luchadore (a Mexican wrestler), and to gain the affections of the stunning Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n (Ana del la Regura).

But then, I knew that going in. On the other hand, it isn't as bad as I was afraid it was going to be. It's not awful. Instead, it's a harmless little comedy that won't change your life, but will give you a smile or two.<br /><br />Nacho Libre concerns the adventures of Mexican monk Ignacio (Jack Black) who has always dreamed of the fame and fortune of being a luchador (the Spanish term for a professional wrestler). The intense poverty of the orphanage he works at eventually inspires him to pursue that dream, but he must maintain a double life to do it as wrestling is considered ungodly by the monastary and, more importantly, by the nun Ignacio has a crush on. Along the way, Ignacio befriends a tag-team partner named Esquelito and runs into a fearsome rival, the gargantuan luchador Ramses.<br /><br />It's fun. The jokes run from good to very lame, and some of the scenes will leave you scratching your head. The direction isn't brilliant, and might disappoint fans of Jared Hess' earlier work, the cultishly-popular Napoleon Dynamite. There are some sequences that seem to be missing from the film. For instance, it would've been nice if Hess had included a scene that would introduce lucha libre (Mexican pro wrestling) to the general crowd, and establish some of the rules, etc. Myself being a professional wrestling fan, I was already very familiar with lucha libre, but I was uncertain as to whether a non-fan would understand what was going on.<br /><br />Jack Black is his normal, comedic self, and that's a good thing. His energy keeps the movie going through some of the stranger bits and lame dialogue. Jack Black fans will probably not consider this one of his best films, but they won't be ashamed of it, either.<br /><br />All in all, this is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. The comedy is harmless and fine for children, as the violence is all cartoonish and there's really no sexual situations or heavy language to speak of. A decent comedy that pretty much lives up to realistic expectations. Three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Jack Black (School of Rock, King Kong) stars as the title character Nacho. He's a friar who since he was little loved the game of Luchadore (Did I spell that right? I hope) wrestling. He cant love anything that is forbidden she he is a man of God but all he wants to do is get recognized and accomplish his dream. He becomes a friend with Esqueleto played by Hector Jimenez as the train to compete in different tag team Luchadore wrestling matches. They get paid for losing but it gives Nacho money to give the Orphan kids better quality food then the other stuff he serves them. Nacho falls in love with Sister Encarnacion played by the lovely Ana de la Reguero (Gitanas, Ladies Night) as he tries to impress her and all that stuff. Cesar Gonzalez plays Ramses, a great champion Luchadore wrestler who is powerful and famous and who Nacho has to fight down the line. Directed by Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess who also wrote it too. Jack Black is down right hilarious as Nacho. The accent fades in and out sometimes but I was cracking up and Jack Black pulled it off nicely. Especially when he sang that song he wrote for the Sister. It has some crude moments being it PG but I enjoyed it. Peter Stormare (Armageddon, Constantine) has a small small part as Emperor in the scene where Nacho has to climb up to drink the yoke from the bird egg. I was disapponted he was only in that scene and not in others. I would of loved a cameo by Napoleon or Pedro. Especially Pedro! A villager should of had a "Vote for Pedro" t-shirt on.

Did I mention I was huge?  I mean a huge fan?  I am even a fan of the movies where he plays very small roles, such as:  The Jackel, and Anchorman.  He always makes a big impression to me, no matter how small the role.<br /><br />I thought I would love this movie. I rented it sight unseen, not even looking at the reviews here, in Amazon.com.  I sure wish I had.  This movie was so boring.  Borrrrring.<br /><br />It was so bad, I didn't even view it without the commentary.  I watched about 15 minutes of it, with the normal audio track, and almost fell asleep.  I then chose to watch the whole movie with the commentary with Jack Black and the director, and this was much more interesting than the actual movie.<br /><br />l think this movie was mis-marketed as well.  I can't believe that Jack Black was supposed to be Mexican.  Come on.  I think the story-line would have been much more believable, if he was some sort of loser foreign worker, who came in as a "ringer" for a Mexican wrestling organization.  I understand that they don't want to have the whole movie in Spanish with subtitles, but having Jack speak with no accent, and all of his co-actors speaking with Mexican accents?  Na ahh.  MC White ain't buying it.<br /><br />This one sucked out my will to watch.<br /><br />MC White said:  It sucked!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>What can I say about Nacho Libre....

I think he's hilarious in flicks like "Shallow Hal" and "School of Rock," but in "Nacho Libre," he tries hard, very hard, to be funny but just falls flat.  Granted, it is funny to watch Black bound around a ring as Nacho Libre trying to raise money for the orphans at his monastery.  It's also funny watching him try to seduce a nun.  But for some odd reason, his comic stylings and those of Jared and Jerusha Hess' writing skills clash at every turn.  Mike White co-wrote the script, but the Hess imprint is solid on this film as they use mundane moments for comic relief.  You probably notice a few similarities between this film and "Napoleon Dynamite."  You should, since both Jared and Jerusha were deeply rooted in that film as director and writers.  "Napoleon Dynamite" was hilarious.  I consider it to be one of the funniest films of the last ten years.  But the humor doesn't translate well in a Mexican setting.<br /><br />As previously stated, Black portrays Nacho Libre, or Ignacio, an orphan raised at the local monastery in Oaxaca, Mexico.  Now an adult, he is in charge of the kitchen and tries his best with the groceries he is allowed to buy in town.  Unfortunately this means that the orphans usually eat beans and chips.  Hoping to gain more funds for food, Nacho teams up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) and the duo become a very popular tag team in the world of Mexican Luchadors.  His idol is Ramses (a real luchador known as Silver King).  Unfortunately Nacho realizes that he's boyhood hero is also a big jerk.  Things come to a climax when Nacho squares off in the ring with his former idol in order to get a huge payoff that will help buy a bus to haul the orphans on educational trips.  Along the way, Nacho tries unsuccessfully to seduce Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera).<br /><br />As with "Napoleon Dynamite," there is really a lot of heart buried in the primary characters.  It's nice to see such things on the screen these days.  Nacho is very aware of the fact that the orphans look up to him, and when he gets tied up in the glitz and glamour of Lucha, it nearly destroys him inside.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is a terrible film, it's just not as funny as it could have been.  It's worthy of at least a rental, and many may want to purchase it.  However, I have no plans on putting "Nacho Libre" on my shelf as of right now.  Perhaps when it gets bargain priced, I'll give it another look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>I like Jack Black as a actor.

Esqueleto then reveals to Nacho the amazing power that Eagle eggs contain, he tells the gullible Nacho that if he eats an Eagle egg that he would posess the power of the Eagle, never lose a wrestling match and become the best wrestler in the world, even greater than the infamous Ramses. Nacho soon gets the oppertunity to use his eagle powers in the 2nd tag team loss, as I am sure you guessed, Nachos "Eagle Powers" were not aparent in the match and Nacho finnaly concludes after several more matches (all losses), that the "Eagle Egg Powers" were a complete joke as well as a scam.<br /><br />Soon Nacho gets the oppertunity to fight against 6 or so other men, all 6 of the men will fight against eachother at the same time, the last man standing will have the chance to fight Ramses for the wrestling title. Nacho fairs rather well but comes in 2nd place in the runner-up position. Extremely dissapointed in himself and his 2nd place finish, Nacho runs off to live in the wilderness and vanish from his home at the Orphanage/church forever. We soon find out that the wilderness for Nacho is actually just about 50-75 feet up on a hill away from the town, Esquelito easily finds him and reveals to Nacho the the Winner of the last match was hurt and would not be able to fight and that Nacho, coming in the runner-up position would now have the oppertunity to play against the Great Ramses. Nacho tells the Orphans and his girl-crush @ the Convent that he will fight and beat Ramses and use all of the money that he wins fighting, on the Orphans (feild trips, presents ect:). Though Nacho does not start off the fight against Ramses well he soon changes as he sees that his crush and the orphans have come to see him fight and cheer him on, he obviously finds a new strength within him and to finish Ramses off, he uses a sort of eagle jump which I cannot rightfully explain. Of course he wins and uses the money as he said he would and they all live happily ever after.<br /><br />You can easily tell that "Nacho Libre" was made by the same people that made "Napolean Dynamite", the colors & Visuals are quite a bit alike, they both haave the same kind of pitiful yet laugh out loud humor and all around they both have that pointless feel about them, but unlike "Dynamite", "Libre" does not have that same kind of ridiculously funny humor. All around the screenplay for the movie is just not as funny as "Napolean Dynamite", the only thing that really keeps the film afloat is the hysterical and well done acting of Jack Black playing Nacho as well as Hector Jiminez's performance as Esquelito who delivers that same kind of performance that the guy that played Pedro had in "Dynamite".<br /><br />Nacho Libre's first 15 minutes were actually very bad but as time goes by the film's pace qickens bit by bit and manages to be decent. Even though this movie was made on a 25 million dollar budget AND advertising it couldnt be a scab on "Napolean Dynamites" butt.<br /><br />If you didnt like "Napolean Dynamite" than you most definatly will not like this and if you liked or loved "Napolean Dynamite" like I do then trust me when I say that going into this movie, dont have expectations to high or you will certainly be dissapointed because it really is a big step down from "Dynamite"<br /><br />Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>One thing becomes abundantly clear after watching "Nacho Libre", the new film starring Jack Black. Black seems to have no inhibitions about what he will do for a laugh. He seems willing to do anything and everything for a laugh. This works for and against him, often at the same time.<br /><br />"Nacho Libre" is a supremely silly movie, and it is also a disappointment. Directed by Jared Hess and co-written by Hess, his wife, Jerusha (the team behind the great "Napoleon Dynamite") and Mike White (one of the people behind "School of Rock), I was expecting a lot more.<br /><br />Ignacio (Black), or Nacho as he is known, is a cook at a very poor Mexican monastery. Every day, he wakes up early, makes a disgusting soup topped with donated stale tortilla chips and serves it to the many orphaned children and the bitter priests, all of whom complain about Nacho's skills as a cook. Nacho isn't very good at anything he tries. He asks the priests to let him have more responsibilities, so they let him visit a sick man and Nacho instantly begins giving the man Last Rites, waking him up in the process. One evening, he spots Ramses, the most famous Lucheador (wrestler) in all of Oaxaca, exiting the ring, wearing nice clothes, walking to his expensive car. Nacho decides he can do that and enlists the aid of a local vagrant, Esqueleto (Hector Jiminez) to be his wrestling partner. Soon, they begin training. The first match does not go well, but Nacho and Esqueleto are surprised to learn they get paid anyway. Nacho is also very interested in a new nun who has transferred to their monastery, Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera, a dead look-a-like for Penelope Cruz), and decides he wants to become a wrestler for the money, to help the children and win the heart of the new nun.<br /><br />As I watched "Libre", I was instantly struck by the attention to detail in the film which appears to have been shot on location in Oaxaca, Mexico. If it wasn't, they did a remarkable job of making everything look very authentic. Everything has a slightly dusty, aged appearance. Posters hang on the walls and appear tattered. The monastery has clearly seen better days, a couple of hundred years ago. These people are poor and it shows. Even the scenes at Ramses house, during a big party, show that even though he may be well off, he isn't really rich. He is simply well-off. It all looks real.<br /><br />Jack Black is fearless as far as the lengths he will go to get a laugh. He struts around in tight sweatpants and no shirt through a significant portion of the film; not a pretty sight, but initially very funny. This is the key to "Libre", many things are `initially' funny, but the third, tenth or twentieth time we see them, they begin to lose their freshness and it becomes a tiresome joke. As soon as he able to raise enough money wrestling, he uses some of the prize money to buy vegetables for the monastery and make salads for everyone. He theatrically crushes a large handful of chips and blows into them, trying to woo Sister Encarnacion, by blowing the chips across her salad. It is a funny scene, over the top and amusing, but it is not the first time he has done something like this and it feels less fresh every time. Immediately after this, he opens a bottle of dressing and pours it on her salad in a way he means to be seductive.<br /><br />The only original offbeat moment happens when Nacho invites the Sister to his room... for toast. In the next shot, we see them sitting across from one another, eating big pieces of dry toast. This scene is the one moment which delivers on the premise of the director's first film. It is an oddball moment. I just wish there had been more.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Black shows wild abandon and proves willing to do anything for a laugh. When he starts training to be a wrestler, he borrows sweat pants from a chubby boy at the orphanage and then he and Esqueleto start running down a dirty road, wearing the tight sweats and little else. On Jack Black, this brings to mind the image of Homer Simpson jiggling the fat around his belly and watching as it takes on a life of its own. His stomach heaves and moves, his legs flex and virtually every part of his body moves in a different direction, as we watch all of the parts move. Considering what he is wearing, we can see just about everything, causing a symphony of laughter. But these types of jokes are repeated; later, he tries to attract Sister Encarnacion by wearing tight slacks and a shirt. Later still, he is wearing his wrestling outfit and everyone walks in. He tries to stand up tall, and appear heroic, but his belly sticks out like a sack of potatoes.<br /><br />Throughout, Black comes up with some interesting facial expressions and weaves together an interesting accent, but even this seems a little tired after a while. Every time Black spoke, I kept thinking of an old Saturday Night Live skit when Jimmy Smits was the guest host. Smits walks into a board meeting as various board members try to decide what to order for lunch. Every time someone says "Enchilada" or "Taco" they exaggerate the pronunciation and Smits had to explain no one says "Encheeladddaaaa". It was a funny skit, but it only lasted five minutes. Black does a pretty good job of trying to make his accent believable, while also making it funny, but over the course of 100 minutes, it wears thin.<br /><br />As the film moves towards the inevitable wrestling scenes, the film also switches gears and these become the main thrust of the narrative. They just aren't funny. Nacho and his co-hort don't appear to be good wrestlers, so their opponents have to be funny or interesting to make it worth while to watch Black get smacked around the ring. They aren't. We never really learn who any of them are, beyond their looks. Also, it isn't really clear why Nacho would be allowed to wrestle Ramses, the big star. Nacho never seems to win a match, so how does he get the chance?<br /><br />None of the other characters are interesting or add anything to the film, contributing nothing to the narrative. Yet another letdown from the creator of "Napoleon Dynamite". In his first film, Hess created a rich cast of characters, all of whom were interesting, funny and unusual. Not a single character in the new film can compete with Jack Black.<br /><br />At one point, an overweight woman begins making eyes at Esquelito. This seems to be designed to be an ongoing joke, but after chasing him through the house for a few minutes, the character disappears.<br /><br />When the jokes about flatulence begin, you realize the director has run out of ideas. "Dynamite" is a great comedy with a lot of offbeat humor and a great, subtle sensibility. "Nacho Libre" has some subtle touches, but they are instantly devoured by Black as he runs from one point to the other, attempting to do anything to make the audience laugh.<br /><br />Worse yet, the film attempts, at times, to introduce dramatic elements; these seem to be from a completely different film. Nacho forms a friendship with the orphans, the new nun thinks wrestling is a bad thing. Because these elements aren't played for laughs, they act like red lights. As soon as any comedy momentum begins to build, these moments appear forcing us to completely reconsider what is happening. Green light. Red light. Yellow light. Red light. Crash.<br /><br />"Nacho Libre" has a number of laughs in it, but all of the other elements are at odds with the comedy, detracting from it and making it an experience worthy of a DVD viewing, if that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>After his terrific turn in "The School of Rock," I was sold on the film persona of Jack Black: he's an everyman with big dreams, a little talent to achieve them and he's in possession of a big, juicy humanity that encompasses and validates everyone with whom he comes in contact. Though this basic human-ness is dimmed in "King Kong," Black's charm shines through nonetheless.<br />In the ersatz "Nacho Libre," Black plays a cook in a Mexican Monastery with dreams of becoming a big-time professional wrestler not for personal gain but to earn money to help the orphans that live in the Monastery.<br />Director Jared Hess (the horrific "Napoleon Dynamite") pretty much points the camera and allows Black to be Black: and this is a good thing because there are several hilarious moments particularly when Nacho (Black) is in the wrestling ring with his mondo-bizarro partner, Esquelito (Skeleton played by Hector Jimenez) who steals most of the scenes that he is in by just being one of the stranger acting creations of recent years.<br />Though directed haphazardly by Hess and lacking cohesion,Black and Jimenez seem to be acting in one movie and Hess directing another, "Nacho Libre" is fun, better than average Summer fare and Black and Jimenez are often very, very funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`Nacho Libre' released in '06 is an uncomplicated physical comedy starring the very popular Jack Black doing what he does best.<br /><br />Synopsis: Nacho (Jack Black) is a poor monk living in a south of the border monastery.

Fortunately, it veers closer to the latter. Black, a monk at a Mexican monastery, has a secret obsession with wrestling. He sneaks out to wrestle, but constantly loses. As the cover suggests, the film's comedy is pretty outrageous and odd, such when Black gets defeated by the midget "Satan's Cavemen" tag-team. It's hard to say why exactly the movie is funny, but it's probably just a mix of Jack Black's energy and zaniness, combined with clownish costumes and bizarre settings. Fortunately, unlike most comedies nowadays, it never stoops into the gutter - all of the humor is appropriate for kids.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie has been out for 3 years, and today was the first time that I watched it, and I thought it was pretty good and funny. Jack Black stars as Ignacio who works at an orphanage. He soon decides to become a masked luchador in order to make money for the orphans. I'd probably recommend NACHO LIBRE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Nacho Libre' stars Jack Black, but you shouldn't expect the typical Jack Black comedy from this film, That means if you like him in `High Fidelity' or `School of Rock,' you may not find his character and the movie itself to your taste. `Nacho Libre' is so-called love or hate movie, and surely it has weirdly funny (so I found) moments.<br /><br />[JACK BLACK IN MEXICO] Jack Black plays a Mexican priest named Ignacio. What he does mainly is cooking in the orphanage, but his true dream has been to become a professional wrestler. So one day after teaming up with a skinny and agile Mexican street urchin Esqueleto (H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez), he dons a red cape and puts on a blue mask, and calls himself Nacho Libre.<br /><br />There are suggested love interest, Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n (beautiful Ana de la Reguera, who uncannily resembles Winona Ryder), and friendship with the orphaned kids. The story itself is not surprising, and it leads us very fast to the conclusion that could be predicted from miles away. But that will not bother you. What is remarkable is the way Nacho's life is presented, with the laidback pace and low-key direction from Jared Hess, whose comic timing has a very original touch. The unique characters including JB's often stand quietly before the camera before doing or saying something extraordinary.<br /><br />Actually most of the (Mexican) actors play eccentric people, and their eccentricity is expressed in the details about them. Look at the two little wrestlers flying like monkeys; see how Nacho's friend Esqueleto is wooed by a fat lady at a party; or read the words of Nacho Libre's  funny letter to Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n. Speaking of whom, unsuspecting and pure-hearted Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n may be the strangest person in the film, who does not seem to notice the weird situations surrounding her.<br /><br />But Nacho Libre, Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n and other characters are doing what they do earnestly, taking themselves very seriously. They are all honest, and the film does not judge anyone, and accepts these strange characters as they are. The comic taste is not for everyone, to be sure, but you know the film's heart is in the right place.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Even if you loved "Napoleon Dynamite" you might not love this movie even though it is by the same director, Jared Hess.  Personally, I found a lot to love in this movie.  The long stretches without much dialogue or narration might bother some, but the bits involving toast are quite wonderful as are the bits with the powered cart.<br /><br />There is no question that this film relies on Jack Black in a way that "Napoleon Dynamite" never relied on Jon Heder.  We get "Jack Black" brand stylings with the way he treats the powered cart as his motorcycle, his singing about Ramses at the party and about his true feelings for Sister Encarnacion.  He is also terrific about the food and around the orphans.  And he pulls off facial expressions like no one else.  Then there are the glorious wrestling scenes that are the whole point and purpose of the film.  The movie doesn't explain the Mexican style of wrestling or the importance of the masks to the wrestlers and the shame of being de-masked in the ring, however, you can learn all that from the web if you don't pick it up while watching the movie.  And you will never think of stretchy pants in the same way ever again.  But enough said, I don't want to take anything away from your enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />Just be warned that quite a number of people have expressed boredom, dislike, and even hatred of this movie.  I am not one of them.  For me, it was a delight from beginning to end, even though it is not the miracle that "Napoleon Dynamite" pulled off.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Mexican professional wrestling (or Lucha libre as it is known) is the subject of Jared Hess' (of Napoleon Dynamite fame) new film, Nacho Libre. The sport started in the early 1900s and was mainly a regional phenomenon until wrestlers were brought in from the United States in the 1930s which catapulted it to the national stage. It currently enjoys a cult following in the rest of North America with the El Santos films (a series of movies featuring a masked wrestler turned superhero) and is even referenced in mainstream television shows like Angel.<br /><br />After the cult film success of Napoleon Dynamite, writer/director Jared Hess could have easily followed it up with a blatantly commercial picture. I'm sure he was given the offers and had the magical carrot dangled in front of his face. Instead, he decided to stay true to his muse and make a movie about a devoutly religious Mexican wrestler. To be fair, the film does star Jack Black which does broaden its mainstream appeal, and Hess is working with a significantly larger budget, but it still has all the idiosyncratic appeal of his first film complete with an eclectic soundtrack (that features the likes of Mister Loco, Ismael Garcia Ruiz Y Su Trio and Caetano Veleso) and hand-crafted opening credits.<br /><br />This film is certainly Hess' most ambitious effort with a big budget and a larger scale but still retains his personal touch that the trailers failed to convey. Like with Napoleon Dynamite, some might accuse him of making fun of these people or their culture but on the contrary, he is celebrating it. If anything, Hess is making fun of Jack Black's character who is the butt of most of the film's jokes. Nacho Libre has a warm, whimsical approach of Wes Anderson film to it, a sweetness that is fun to watch.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by actor Jack Black, director Jared Hess and co-screenwriter Mike White. It starts off pretty boring as they munch on their food (hence the "dinner and a commentary" moniker) and offer the occasional banal comment like how one location was so beautiful that they were moved to tears (oh, hipster irony). At about 24 minutes in they finally pick up the pace and talk more frequently - too bad it is just more inane comments on this very disappointing track. Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />"Detras de la Camara" is a slightly irreverent behind the scenes look at the movie with footage of Black rehearsing with a mariachi band and more footage of him goofing around between takes.<br /><br />"Jack Black Unmasked!" is a promotional special that Black did for Nickelodeon (who backed the movie). A camera crew follows him around and watches as he gets his chest waxed mixed with clips from the movie and a highly entertaining thumbnail sketch history of masked Mexican wrestling.<br /><br />"Hecho en Mexico" takes a look at the decision to shoot the movie in Mexico with mostly Mexican actors and crew members. We see Hess charm the local press by speaking flawless Spanish and how much the locals seem to enjoy themselves working on the movie.<br /><br />"Moviefone Unscripted with Jack Black and Hector Jimenez" sees the two actors interview each other and ask such probing questions such as what is it like to work with each other, how they trained to be Mexican wrestlers, the merits of cricket pot pie and so on.<br /><br />"Jack Sings" features more footage of Black writing and rehearsing two songs that he sings in the movie juxtaposed with footage of the filming of the songs that gives a bit of insight into their evolution.<br /><br />Also included are three deleted scenes with more of Ignacio's quest to find the Gypsy Emperor (Stormare) in order to stop losing matches. We get to see more of Stormare's trademark offbeat acting in this lengthy subplot that was probably considered too bizarre for mainstream audiences.<br /><br />There are three promotional spots including a funny ad for Nacho Libre action figures!<br /><br />There is an "El Tigre Promo Spot" for an animated Mexican superhero show on Nickelodeon in 2007 that actually looks pretty cool.<br /><br />Finally, there is a photo gallery with on the set, Luchadores portraits and promotional stills.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>I didn't even bother to read reviews for Nacho Libre but seeing it with anything below three stars to me is unfair. I seriously don't understand why some people even attempt to watch a film like this knowing it is out of their field of funny. I actually enjoyed Nacho and it hit dead on to my expectations. Plain and simple the film is about a man Named Ignacio who is the cook for a Mexican monastery orphanage that doesn't have money for good food and spices. Ignacio gets up every morning to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it's always the same exact meal, cabbage and mayonnaise soup or mud. Already you feel sorry for the poor kids but one day a new nun shows up, the beautiful sister Encarnaci&oacute;n played by Ana de la Reguera. Ignacio becomes inspired immediately but doesn't get the courage to live his dream to be a luchador, if you know anything about the history of the luchador you know how respected they are and in here well paid win or lose. When Ignacio finally gets the courage to enter a match with his crazy unexpected partner he enters under the Nacho Libre<br /><br />Though Nacho treated himself to a few luxuries it is always about the kids for him and he made sure they had good food. One major thing I loved about Nacho Libre is that it was very funny but it showed no disrespect to the Mexican or luchador culture. It tells a story and though I'm almost sure Jack Black doesn't have a Mexican background he played his role very well. The funny stuff in Nacho libre comes from a lot of things and I think the funniest were the wrestling matches. Nacho and his partner lost every match and their girlish screams were too much. Then you have Jack Black's accent which is just too much or when he's about to fight someone and shows them his skills and jumps in the air and meows like a mad cat.<br /><br />Though Nacho didn't win any matches for a good period of time and somehow got a chance to fight the champion is understandable because some of his matches were close and you could see him progressing. I seriously saw little problems with Nacho Libre and I really enjoyed it. I don't know what people look for when they watch this movie because it is very different from the same old same comedies. The cast was great, not only Jack was the funny one; his partner really did a nice job supporting him. Great movie and I would recommend it for anyone that needs a movie for the entire family to watch and I give it four stars for the slow beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Microphone {tap, tap, tap}: Ladies and gentlemen! For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord's Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre!<br /><br />Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life.<br /><br />Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho ("I want to win!"). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs.<br /><br />Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his "inner" strength to make his way to the top.<br /><br />Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion!<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess' latest film, and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well-known actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I believe Jack Black could sit in a room and make faces and have me in hysterics!

McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: When I heard that Jack Black would be playing a Mexican Friar who moonlighted as a wrestler in Jared Hess' next project I got very happy, because I knew this would be a funny movie. The trailers for the film advertised exactly what this movie was, and that was pure physical comedy. The story is about Nacho, a Friar who wants the fame and fortune that is associated with being a luchadore after living the same old life over and over each day. He then realizes that this journey to become a professional wrestler is not for himself but for the orphans whom he looks after and cooks for at the orphanage. The movie is basically Jack Black running around with his shirt off for an hour and a half while sporting a fake mustache and a funny Mexican accent. While the majority of the comedy in the film is physical, there are some hilarious lines in the film that are delivered with the right spunk by Black. There are also some great physical scenes in and outside the ring that shows just how great of a physical comedian Black is. The movie is incredibly stupid, but it's also so very funny. If you enjoy pure silly comedy executed perfectly then this movie is just the thing you need. Don't expect another Napoleon Dynamite because this is not a reincarnation of Hess' previous cult hit. He uses the same style of shooting the movie though by using a lot of wide symmetrically balanced shots. Personally, I laughed harder at this then I did with Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon Dynamite had some great one-liners, but Nacho Libre overall is just plain silly fun. Don't take the film seriously at all, just sit back and laugh.<br /><br />ACTING: This is clearly a one man show, and it's been advertised like that. Jack Black is in every scene of the movie, and he's funny pretty much in every scene. His facial expressions and ability to jump around remind me a lot of Chris Farley. He is incredibly hilarious as Nacho and he gets some great support from Hector Jimenez who plays his sidekick, Esqueleto (directly translates to Skeleton). In fact there are few names in the film that directly translate to funny names in English. I recall one boy's name as Chancho, which means filthy. So, you can basically get the tone of the movie just by the characters' names.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Lots of fun and lots of physical comedy that takes the right tone so that it is in fact funny in a stupid way. Usually movies like this fall flat and just end up stupid, but the ingrediants were right on this one and I found Nacho Libre pleasently entertaining. I also found the funniest line of the movie to be "get that corn outta my face!"</p></br></body></html>

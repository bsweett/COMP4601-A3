He was successful, to a degree at least, in that aesthetically and stylistically the film does, indeed, have a distinct 1970s "feel."  But in most other respects, the film falters.  Most obviously, the plot is derivative and therefore stale, and some of the characters are so outrageously drawn (and performed) that they become mere caricatures of those they are intended to pay homage to.<br /><br />In his sequel THE DEVIL'S REJECTS (2005), however, it is apparent that auteur Zombie has learned from his previous mistakes.  To be sure, the same 1970s-era grind-house aesthetic is there--grainy-looking film stock, filthy sets and locales, disturbing characters, and Grand Guignol gore and violence are all stylistically central.  But Zombie has raised the overall quality several notches above the previous flick with a plot that is fresh, multi-faceted, and well paced, and his characters--even the returning ones--are drastically more complex and three-dimensional.  Also, Zombie's directorial style is more confident and more fluid.  He's not reluctant to utilize new camera techniques, editing tactics, and modern digital technology, though he does so in such a way that enhances but never detracts from the classic visual "feel" that he seeks to evoke.  (For example, nearly one hundred digital FX appear in the film, mostly within scenes of violence involving objects that come into direct contact with bare skin. Such realistic-looking imagery would've been nearly impossible to create in the era of the films to which Zombie is paying homage.)<br /><br />The performances that Zombie draws from his actors in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS are uniformly outstanding, this in spite of the fact that the central characters are carryovers from the lesser HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.  Obviously more confident as a director, he gets the returning actors to ratchet down their performances and deliver a level of realism that is more affecting, and in turn more frightening, than before.  Portraying the charismatic murderer and necrophiliac Otis Driftwood, actor Bill Moseley almost seems to be psychically channeling 1960's sociopathic killer Charles Manson.  Sid Haig's surrealistic reprisal of killer clown Captain Spaulding is a coulrophobe's worst nightmare, and Sheri Moon Zombie's portrayal of the flirtatious but psychopathic Baby Firefly chills to the bone.  Also notable is William Forsythe, who portrays new character Sheriff Wydell.  In a role that could have easily digressed into cliche or parody, Forsythe plays it intense and believable, even when his character crosses the line and becomes morally indistinguishable from the homicidal titular trio.<br /><br />Lions Gate's 2-disc director's-cut DVD edition of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is well worth the price of admission.  Not only does it feature a beautiful digital transfer of Rob Zombie's unrated director's cut in the film's theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs), it is also chock-full of cool bonus features.  There are two feature commentaries--one with Zombie and another with the principal cast--as well as deleted scenes, outtakes, two complete Captain Spaulding TV commercials, and a documentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />In short, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is an excellent second effort from writer/director Rob Zombie that just may well go down in cinematic history as his magnum opus.  True, it may not suit everyone's taste, but for fans of Grand Guignol cinema and 1970s grind-house flicks, this film is a must-own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Coming off of the insane visual experience that was HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, Rob Zombie performs a complete reversal in style and tone with his companion piece, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. Picking up shortly after the events of the previous film, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS finds the Firefly family on the run from the law, and leaving a trail of bodies in the wake of their escape.<br /><br />Here, Zombie is able to take a group of truly despicable monsters and somehow bring out their humanity in a way that makes them accessible and likable despite their horrifying acts. Many critics have argued that Zombie has unfairly forced the audience to align themselves with the killers through his kind portrayals of the characters, but he would be unable to do so without getting beneath their trashy exteriors and drawing out their twisted sense of family and friendship. Likewise, Rob demonizes the character of Sheriff Wydell, and transforms him from the altruistic "Hand of God" into the same breed of ruthless killer which he despises. It is only natural that the audience grows to hate him in the process. While each of the performances are provocative in their own right, it is Bill Moseley's depiction of the foul-mouthed Otis that stands out above all others. He commands the screen with a terrifying display of power and unmatched evil. Only William Forsythe stands to top him as the bulldog Sheriff that decides to take the law into his own hands.<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS removes the safety of the extravagant coloring and comic book characters from HOUSE in place of a washed-out color palette and gritty realism that is  reminiscent of the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. The film does maintain the humor from before, but it does so in a darker and more unsettling way. Otis, Baby, and Cutter make sharp but crude remarks that momentarily cut the tension during the disgusting torture scenes. They force guilty laughs out of audiences, who are then left feeling as sick and depraved as the villains as a result. Rob Zombie has not only dramatically improved his writing skills, but his directing and editing as well. The film's closing scene best epitomizes these changes, as the Reject's last standoff offers the same devastating impact as the climax of Ridley Scott's THELMA AND LOUISE. Yes, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS has just been compared to THELMA AND LOUISE.<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is truly Exploitation at its very best. It is dirty, filthy smut, in all the right ways. No audience member can walk away unscathed from its horrifying depictions of blood and violence. Rob Zombie has created one of the defining films of the 2000's, and one that he may never be able to top.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>Over the years Sid has heard a lot about Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and decided to finally check it out. Watching leads you to one motley crew of freaks with Captain Spaulding being the most offensive and vile, if we had to pick one. He's played by Sid Haig, not of elf descent, who is one of the strangest looking human walking the earth. This guy would be just as creepy cashing a check at the bank as he would dressed up as his murderous clown character. Now we're full aware that this was the sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, but decided to watch this one first anyway since it appeared to be the better flick.<br /><br />The film takes place in Ruggsville Texas as Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) and a crew of police show up at the serial killing Reject's house. Opening fire they manage to catch mother Firefly as the rest of the crew gets away. Now on the lamb Otis and his sister Baby (played by Rob Zombie's wife who just happens to be really hot) meet up with daddy Captain Spaulding and keep reeking havoc on some innocent folks at a run down motel. However Sheriff John Wydell is bent on revenge for his brother's death and catched up to the Rejects for quite a great scene.<br /><br />Surprisingly The Devils Rejects was a really good horror flick. Yes it was very gory, which we never look for, but it fit the film since these were very deranged people. As far as the reviews go it's either people love it or hate it. If you hate it then you probably went in expecting too much, which is never a good idea for a horror film. Usually if you don't set the bar too high you'll have yourself a fun watch. So to sum it up yes Sid enjoyed this and would have years ago especially for Sheri Moon Zombie, who Sid wouldn't mind chasing around the room with a pink turkey baster.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I wasn't a big fan of HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, so I figured that THE DEVIL'S REJECTS would be another 3-star movie at best. Well, I was wrong. TDR is a nice improvement over Rob Zombie's first effort. The Firefly family returns, just as vile, reprehensible, and disgusting as ever. Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), and Captain Spaulding (Sid "Spider Baby" Haig) hit the road after the police raid the family compound. The rest is a murder spree, w/ a few unfortunate victims being humiliated, mutilated, and killed. What makes this one interesting is the character of Sheriff Wydell, who is out to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of this sadistic family of loons. Is this movie uplifting? No. Is it deep or socially redeeming? Nah, but it is what it's supposed to be, an exploitation / shock movie w/ a vicious sense of humor! This time, instead of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Zombie draws from movies like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, IN COLD BLOOD, THE SADIST, etc. in order to bash our heads in w/ the wickedness of this trio! Should mentally unstable people watch such a film as this? I don't know, but for the rest of us, it's a harmless enough diversion. Like some have mentioned already, the most frightening thing about the Fireflys is that they could really be out there somewhere! The news is full of humanoids that do not care one bit about anyone / anything but their own survival. Any one of us could wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. THAT is why movies like this work! There's always the possibility of meeting up w/ a monster and not being able to yell, "Cut!"...</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Living up to the savage high mark set by "The House Of 1,000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects" is like "Death Wish" meets "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  It's relentless vigilante-style justice vs. merciless insane horror, set against a backdrop of searing-hot deserts, barren roads and isolated motels and dwellings.  It starts shortly after "House Of 1,000 Corpses" ended, picking up most but not all of the plot threads, but turning in a quite different, though no less intense, movie.  The Firefly family's farmhouse is raided by a heavy contingent of the local law enforcement, starting the movie off with a massive firefight like something out of a western's climax, but put through a blast furnace and emerging darker, meaner and more vicious.  With the Fireflies on the run - dubbed the Devil's Rejects by the media after people see what's inside that house - Sheriff Wydell (the brother of one of the Rejects's victims from the first movie) leads the forces of cops and bounty hunters on the Rejects's trail.  The Rejects, meanwhile, both the hunted and the hunters, burn a swath of horror through the southwestern U.S.<br /><br />  It's extreme, disturbing, believable, and oddly cathartic in places.  The Firefly family contains some of the most sadistic and violent villains in horror movie history, and it's odd to see the 'other side' -  Wydell and company - on the offensive much of the time, bringing in a different kind of savagery to the show.  The acting is brilliant, the direction excellent, and the use of music almost unprecedented: the way songs from the 70s (the era the movie takes place in) aren't just playing on a stereo but are worked into the score in perfect synchronicity with the onscreen flow (at times taking place in slow-motion that speeds up to normal as the song's tempo increases; incidentally this is one of the only movies I've ever seen that made me conciously think of what a great job the film editor did) enhances the movie to tremendous effect.<br /><br />  A masterpiece of extreme horror; few movies this ferocious and deranged have ever been put together so perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Once again, this, probably one of the sickest, most twisted and unpleasant films I've ever seen. From both a graphic and subliminal point of view it's a bit of a wonder how it got a rating actually. From the off-set the title lets you know what kind of film it's going to be (Rob Zombie probably thought it sounded cool). I thought that this movie had some good cinematography and a dusty washed out feel that has been done before but still lends the right atmosphere for this kind of violent horror.<br /><br />I don't mind violence if it is integral to the plot or if it is even scary such as in Hitchcock's Psycho. This film is neither thrilling nor scary and feels like the director had a bunch of ideas that he wanted in the movie and everything else must fit around it. The plot basically has a tense stand-off involving a Louisianan sheriff (William Forsythe) and his deputies outside a run-down, ram-shackle home where a clan of murderers dubbed 'the devil's rejects' are staking out. Following a tense stand-off and the death of a few officers, one is killed and the mother is captured. But the daughter and son continue to roam free, dodging the long arm of the law whilst also getting the chance to carry out their depraved, deadly activities on some poorer, unsuspecting victims along with the help of a twisted, ogre-some clown called Captain Spaulding.<br /><br />Weirdly, it's only when the end of the film draws near that you realize just what a nasty, unpleasant experience it's all been. I was left with a feeling similar to that of other films I've seen along the lines of Running Scared and the Kill Bill movies, only it didn't feel as though the excessiveness of the unpleasantness was being piled on so heavily that it became a laugh like with those films. But this goes a bit deeper than that, and it's nasty side is enjoyed so much that blood and gore isn't all it pumps on, we also have to endure some very disturbing, upsetting, even distressing scenes of human degradation, humiliation, callousness and the twisting of the loving nature of the female species that it's a struggle to think who'd find it enjoyable. It all ends up rubbing off on you the viewer in the end when the bad guys appear to be getting their comeuppance and you're loving watching the sheriff inflicting some of the torture on them that they inflicted on their victims, awakening your baser instincts and actually giving you the mind-set of the characters you hated so much in the first place.<br /><br />It is a nasty, blood-soaked film, just not in the way I expected it to be. But that's all it seems to be, just a non-stop bombardment of missed up unpleasantness with no real artistic value. It's not a film I'd feel comfortable watching again and it certainly didn't make me want to catch up with its predecessor, House of 1000 Corpses.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie has filled a pop-culture horror void with The Devils' Rejects. Zombie presents horror with a message -- Captain Spaulding's psychotic, cannibalistic brood hearkens back to Tobe Hooper's maniacal Brady Bunch from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Beneath the unremitting violence and gore are serious questions about society, family and justice. Stylistically The Devil's Rejects also hearkens back to cult films like Electra Glide in Blue. The Devil's Rejects is recommended with one caveat: NOT for children or sensitive adults. The violence is off the chart and the humor is definitely sick.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I have to say that I seriously respect rob zombie now.  This movie kicked ass.  They kind of pick up where the last movie left off and they are like wearing armor in a shootout with the cops.  That was a nice touch.  But the thing that really sets this movie apart is the level of detail that went into every scene and every shot for that matter.  There is a scene where a girl gets hit by a semi.  So we go to the next shot and see like 10 feet of blood and intestines.  They could have gone overboard on this, but it does actually give you a realism of what this might look like.  But don't worry, they don't dwell on it.  And there is a scene where they are in a room, hostages and bad guys together.  I will only say that this scene is not for the faint of heart.  Youwill cringe if you don't like these intense, killer, psycho type scenes.  But I was really on the edfge of my seat.  And mother fujer that is what a movie is supposed to do!  And I also have to say that being a kung fu fan I thought the fight scenes were really good.  They don't go like mantis against tiger claw but it does give you a sense of what a real fight would be like and what it would come down to.  Survival.<br /><br />The sound is pretty  good.  The music is good too.  i didn't exactly like the movie too much to watch a documentary that is like twice ass long as the movie but did listen to the director's commentary and thought that was very enjoyable.  Rob does a good job of pointing out a stunt that I think he says the real actor did that would rival pretty much anything in hong kong I have ever seen.  So don't get me wrong casue i'm a fu fan, there isn't really too much fighting in this, but a very intense movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I love horror movies and no I don't mean The Grudge. I mean bloody , funny , and yes original movies. Rob Zombie made a step up from the original. This is the continuing saga of the Firefly family. Otis , Captain Spaulding , and Baby are back and ready for a rumble. R.I.P. Matthew Mc Grory. Mother was in this for a few scenes in the beginning and middle. Are the charectors as annoying this time? No.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie knows how to make a movie! That's all there is to it.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but then what do I give someone like Akira Kurosawa, or Bloody Sam, or the late, great John Huston?<br /><br />The actors are amazing across the board. The score by Tyler Bates is one of the best ever! Mind-blowing. Here's a guy who knows how to score  this type of motion picture--at last.<br /><br />The thing I didn't care for, however, no disrespect meant, Mr. Zombie, were all those terrible 70s songs. Oh man, that was painful to listen to, especially towards the end, during the grand finale. Damn near ruined the ending, but not quite, because the film itself is so powerful it overcame the lame<br /><br />tunes. But, as I said, the Tyler Bates score is incredible. The DP Phil Parmet also did an amazing job.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about this powerful horror flick.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I had no idea Pricilla Barnes had any acting ability until I saw her here. She should have been nominated for an academy award; she is that good in this.<br /><br />The scene she is in will knock the wind out of you; she is so believable, and so convincing at what she does, it will be nearly difficult to keep watching.<br /><br />The Texas Ranger played by William Forsythe is just plain<br /><br />topnotch all the way.<br /><br />I just wanted to say something to the talented Rob Zombie, should you be reading this, the character wearing the potato sack over his head at the beginning of the film, and also later on during the last third, etc., should never have taken the sack off his head--because that was one menacing get-up, bro. You see, once he took the sack off, the burn makeup they had on his face reminded us of Freddie Krueger and it did look kind of lame.<br /><br />In fact, both Freddie Krueger and Michael Myers are old hat and ought to be retired. Man, we've had enough flicks about them.<br /><br />Anyway, Devil's Rejects rocks big time! Can't wait to see what else Rob Zombie comes up with.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Thank you Rob Zombie for this dirty make you want to take a shower afterwards horror film. This is one of the best horror movies in years. Far superior to House of 1000 Corpses which I thought ripped off 70's horror more than revived it. Rob Zombie succeeds here with his original intention. This film comes across as a fresh and horrible blast of pure wonderful trash right across the screen, majestic and raunchy at the same time, a film that will stand the test of time. Rob Zombie proved he is more than a novelty in the movie world and I am anxious to see what he does next.</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>I wasn't a big fan of House Of 1000 Corpses. But, I still wanted to give The Devil's Rejects since I loved the characters. When I saw this film this summer, This film was the best horror film this year and one of the best films this year.<br /><br />Rob Zombie returns to conclude his story after House Of 1000 Corpses. In this film, the police finally go to the old farmhouse to take down the killers. The arrested Mother Firefly {Easterbrook}, but Otis {Moseley} and Baby {Moon Zombie} have escape. Also, the police are after Captian Spaulding {Haig}, who is apart of the murders. Now, Otis, Baby and Spaulding are trying to get to Spauding's brother Charlie {Foree}, so they can hideout there. Their mission isn't gonna be easy, especially since the Sheriff {Forsythe} is hell bent of getting revenge because they killed his brother.<br /><br />This film really gives you the feeling of those old 70's horror classics like The Last House On The Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film look, the visuals, the 70's music being played just gives it that feeling.<br /><br />House Of 1000 Corpses didn't give you that feeling. House Of 1000 Corpses feels like watching a Rob Zombie video. Which I have no problem with that, but Zombie said that it reminds you of those old horror films from the 70's...and it didn't<br /><br />The Devil's Rejects is a great horror film and I hope to see Rob Zombie write and direct more films in the near future.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>Now we all know a lot of the movies this year suck due to the fact that their either remakes (besides war of the worlds which was a great movie period)or stupid marvel movies.This movie is pretty much so far a original masterpiece and should had had more attention then what it did when it came out. The movie is about a family that do things to pretty much whoever walks by their house but that was the first movie this movie they get caught for all the things they did and now it's pay back time.<br /><br />This movie is great and I promise you a great time seeing it.NOT FOR KIDS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>How anti-video game d*** Roger Ebert gave this movie two thumbs up is a total mystery to me, especially when there are much better options like Resident Evil: Extinction which he probably gave a low score to just because it's based on the games. This is basically how the film felt: 90% disgusting porn and dirty talk and 10% blood and gore action. The gore is fantastic along with the Lynyrd Skynyrd tracks, but the whole movie is about disgusting topics that I don't even don't want to go in to(It makes Hostel look like a Disney movie). Just avoid this movie people, it's not worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The Devil's Reject is surprisingly entertaining and captivating horror rollercoaster ride experience. It has loads of blood and gore and the characters are pretty nasty. The Sheriff character is well depicted and played by William Forstyn. He's kind a combination of good and bad, the role could've been played by Tommy Lee Jones. The Firefly family members include the clown father, the son, the daughter, and the dirty mouthed captured mother are very disturbing and intense characters. Watching them in this movie reminded me of characters played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in Natural Born Killers. I actually enjoyed this film more than other similar films such as Saw and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The special feature's production documentary is also worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>And in my opinion, I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses. 1000 Corpses has a Texas Chainsaw-feel to it. The Devil's Rejects has that nostalgic-feel of low budget 70's horror films. Creepy and chilling, it's more shocking than scary in the sense you won't be checking your closet for Captain Spalding once you're done watching, though if you've never feared clowns before, you probably will after you see this. It's disturbing and will satiate your cravings for horror. I wouldn't recommend watching it alone, but if you like this genre, especially if you can appreciate the older movies from this genre, I definitely recommend The Devil's Rejects. If you saw 1000 Corpses, you shouldn't miss this one from Rob Zombie. I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This wasn't bad.  I actually enjoyed this one a little better than House of 1000 Corpses.  House seemed like Rob was trying to cram a million differant horror ideas into one movie, this story seems really focused and intense.  If you like murder and mayhem, this is for you.  Rob seems to relish in lingering over the death and destruction.  This is a very violent film, so gore hounds will be real happy with this one.  Any fan of Three's Company may recognize Terry(Priscilla Barnes) who gets naked in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>I just got done renting The Devil's Rejects and let me say that Rob likes taking us viewers into hell!!!!!! I liked that it was more real then putting in digial effects and the story was awesome too!!!!!!!! Baby, Captain Saudling, and Otis are back again and this time they are on the run from the police!!!!!! Needless to say the police officer that is after them had his brother killed from them and he is determined to catch and kill each one of them!!!!!!!!! If you have not seen the first one which is House of 1000 Corpses then watch that one and then go watch this and all the cast did a great job and it is sad to see the talented Matthew McGory pass away and this is his final performance,but i thought that it was touching that on the bonus stuff they pay tribute to him!!!!!!! GO OUT AND RENT THIS HORROR/THRILLER YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>This is the first cult film classic in many a moon and Rob Zombie delivers the goods in his second feature the sequel to House Of  a 1000 Corpses (Sid Haig and Sheri Moon are on fire in this one -- William Forsythe and Ken Foree also rocked the house.)  I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved this movie and how much Hollywood needed this movie.  This is a full blown 70's style nightmare and its works on so many levels I can't even begin to tell you.  The most important level I think the film works on whether this was intentional or not (and I think that it most certainly was) is in the question "Who are the villains in our world?"  The film clearly seems to be saying we all are.  And thats what makes the film so relevant in a demented way and without a doubt pure brilliance for a film in its genre.  The casting is genius, the writing is unbelievable (gives Tarantino a serious run for his money), and the soundtrack is to die for.  The only warning I feel I have to give about it other than that it is extremely violent and has some of the roughest language you will ever hear is that it is NOT a traditional horror film.  It is more in line with a Sam Peckinpah film like Straw Dogs than say Dawn of the Dead.  Which is a major compliment to be sure.  If you're in any way a fan of hillbilly/redneck films, Tobe Hooper flicks like Chainsaw and Eaten Alive, violent blacksploitation, The Munsters, The Marx Brothers, or the italian giallo fare from the 70's you're gonna love this mad work of artistic genius that is the first truly great film of the year.  Can't wait to see what Zombie does next.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>Essentially, Rob Zombie brings back the B-movie tradition of the 70's/80's-style slasher-flick, utilizing aesthetics with a combination of influences from 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Friday the 13th', even 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' {particularly in the resemblence of 'Tiny's mangled face to Freddy Krueger}. These personages are based on Marx Brothers characters in name only - these are entirely "hellbilly" in countenance, consisting primarily of Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby Firefly, with a couple of side characters, who are veritably 'awakened' from their slumber by vengeful Police from the massacres in the previous film House of 1,000 Corpses". Mama Firefly is taken into custody, and Tiny is nowhere to be found...<br /><br />Set in the Texas desert, this white-trash family, each with their own neurosis, bounce their particular insanities upon eachother, experiencing the joys and dangers of life on a caveman level of existance. After all, a family of wolves can at one moment enjoy a freshly slaughtered rabbit or deer together, happily tearing limb from limb, then go off to later play together.<br /><br />After another shootout, the pursuit begins again and they are on the run, pulling all their resources together at the expense of others, calling upon the evil clown to accompany Otis and Baby in this latest predicament. So after Spaulding accesses a car in the name of "important clown business", the three are reunited, spreading terror upon all those they encounter, usually ridiculing, humiliating, mutilating, and otherwise raping their victims before finally killing them.<br /><br />Along the way they meet up with pimp 'Charlie Altamont' {Ken Foree, whom you may recognize from 'From Beyond'} and have one hell of a time in wordly pleasures, until he pulls a veritable "Lando Calrisian"*, betraying the group to the crusading Sheriff. Charlie has more of a moron than an imbecile in a henchman named 'Clevon' {played by Michael Berryman: 'The Hills Have Eyes'}, engage in a particularly amusing scene while purchasing chickens from an inbred cletus.<br /><br />Sheriff Wydell, who fancies himself a "devil slayer", readies himself for a 'final confrontation' - a veritable "apocalypse" in his mind, employing the aid of a couple of nefarious bounty hunters called "The Unholy Two", comprised of imposing bikers 'Rondo' and 'Billy Ray Snapper', who interrupt the festivities and construct arrangements to Wydell's specifications. Continuing with his revenge-fueled righteous christinsanity, besides photos of victims being stapled to their chests, Otis is actually nailed into his chair a-la the nazarene {the fact that he has long hair and a beard added to the effect greatly}, and are set to burn alive in a literal "Hell". Now the punctilious "hunter becomes the hunted" scenario transgresses. "The Angel" is let loose to be pursued by the wolf on her heels receiving a taste of her own medicine, but in one of those unexpected 'twists', just when all seems finished, a mysterious ally appears...<br /><br />With the odds stacked against them, the movie ends in a hail of bullets to a final end...?<br /><br />With a relatively all-star cast, there will be some recognizable familiarities from time to time. Herein is one Priscilla Barnes {'Terri Alden' from 'Three's Company'}, being slapped around, fondled, deceived, and stabbed. Geoffrey Lewis, who has one of those faces materializing from many formative evocations. Also amusing is the manner in which the last victim at the motel is dispatched - by pure horror. The skin from the face of her own husband is placed upon hers, where she is left dangling on the back of the door to be found by the screaming maid. She inadvertently does herself in.<br /><br />This film displays, in an albeit base level, the might is right dynamic, and that man is a vicious animal in his most primal state, where so-called principles of 'good and evil' are completely subjective terms, where the clever and ruthless prevail, manipulating where necessary to gain selfish ends, moving the world according to what is placed into action. Perceptions will sometimes be tested in what one perceives is supposed to happen, and what actually can, and does happen.<br /><br />_________<br /><br />* Interestingly, it is noted that some scenes contain subtle 'Star Wars' references from time to time, from a mention of having a Princess Leia fetish, to the subsequent betrayal akin to Calrisian's on Han Solo for Darth Vader.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I love horror movies and just movies in general. Up until House of 1000 Corpses, I thought the horror movie genre was dead. Horror movies these days have cliched scripts, terriable acting, and usually a who who's list of young hollywood actors. Rob Zombie didnt need any of those for his masterpieces. He loves horror movies, and it shows. Devil Rejects proved that Rob Zombie can produce and write movies as well. The story was kinda of loose, but I still highly enjoyed this movie. Captain Spaulding is probably one of my faviorte movie characters in the last 10 years. He's funny and evil all rolled into one. The movie is ultra profane and violent, and makes you feel helpless, like they are going get you next. Baby is also anther chracter that deserves some credit for her role, she was insane and sexy all rolled into one. Thank you Mr.Zombie for proving that horror movies arent dead and keep on cranking out those master pieces.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Ever been hit in the skull full-force with a Louisville slugger?<br /><br />Have you?<br /><br />I imagine the answer on that one is gonna be negatory. That's fine. Imagine yourself down on your knees, with some maniac with a sack over his writhing, roiling, insane mutant features standing over and behind you, arcing the baseball bat up into the air. You try to brace yourself, but you really can't. Not for that. The Louisville slugger screams down through the air, and smashes into your skull, and the shock of the blow alone drives the blood spraying out of your eyes, your nostrils, your mouth.<br /><br />You feeling the blood rush to your face in sympathy? Good. That's what "The Devil's Rejects" is like: a nasty, brutal, psycopathic, happily, laughingly evil monster of a movie that takes a little Alabama ironwood and smashes your skull wide open.<br /><br />Let me introduce the Devil's Rejects: so Evil even Satan wouldn't have them.<br /><br />Now: you live in a world that says it's alright, you can travel by day, the Monsters live in the dark, in the shadows. And you're good: so God will guide you, kiss your daughters before they sleep at night, light your way with a column of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night.<br /><br />And all that other mumbo-jumbo horsesh*t that's supposed to keep the night terrors away. And let's say you're the unfortunate young balladeer of Mom & Pop country-folk songsters "Banjo & Sullivan", traveling across West Texas with your young wife, your harpy mother-in-law, your banjo-strumming father-in-law Sullivan, and you decide to hole up in a do-drop-Inn fleabag with running water and a minimum of cockroaches, just for the night, just between gigs.<br /><br />Is your God gonna protect you from the Monsters that walk by daytime?<br /><br />From the three froth-jawed demons on the high prairie, slaughtering, torturing, killing, raping? Like the Lizard King would have said: Killers on the Road, and their brains really *are* squirming like a toad.<br /><br />"The Devil's Rejects" may very well be the most vicious film in American history---ever.<br /><br />Rob Zombie has distilled, fermented, brewed up the raw evil of "House of 1,000 Corpses", let it sit, stew, breathe, and then served up a potent White Lightning of terror. "The Devil's Rejects" is certainly a contender for the most brutal American movie ever made.<br /><br />It's also as simple and clean as an axe-wound: stacking the bodies of your victims like cordwood in the basement doesn't fly even in remotest Texas, so a loaded-for-bear police assault team under the command of Sheriff Wydel---whose brother George was murdered by the Fireflys---show up at Chez Firefly, blast a few of the clan, lose the rest, and come away with Mama Firefly as their prize.<br /><br />The survivors---Baby (Sherri Moon) and Otis (Bill Moseley)---steal a car and, after a pleasant afternoon of wilding, slaughter, rape, torture, mutiliation, dismemberment and killing, manage to hook up with their doting funnyman dad, the pancake-makeup wearing killer clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig).<br /><br />From there they go on the lam from the Law, planning to lay low for a while at a whorehouse run by buddy and kingpimp Charlie Altamount (Ken Foree). They are unaware that they're pursued across the high desert by lawman Wydell, riding his men and a pair of bounty hunters---the Unholy Two (Danny Trejo & Diamond Dallas Page)---and whipping and driving them after the remaining sh*tbags who killed his brother.<br /><br />You know, to do the Lord's work. Or the Devil's. Whatever.<br /><br />Now, there are two things that struck me about "Devil's Rejects": Point #1:It's a Monster movie. It's shot like a Monster movie, the camerawork shot, mostly, from the perspective of the victims.<br /><br />That goes double for sympathy: there is no one here to root for. While this is a road-trip down Hell's asphalt, and like any road-trip you're gonna bond with your funny new buddies---Baby, Otis, and the Captain. But that should never confuse you that your cracking-wise and well-armed new amigos are also monsters. Monsters that eat children, that rape old women, that crucify the weak and the unlucky.<br /><br />Zombie, remarkably, never stoops to make the Firefly clan heroes. His Otis is a windswept Biblical prophet gone rabid and eating carrion: try to stop the shivers when those graveyard-blue feral eyes draw down on a victim, staring out from a windblown mass of matted dirty-blond hair. Yeah, Baby Firefly can drop a man dead with that witchy smile (and Sherri Moon owns every inch of her character and crackles with psychopathic charisma)---but she's a killer.<br /><br />And Spaulding, cackling, old coot Spaulding, is the biggest Monster of them all: the Monster who breeds monsters.<br /><br />They're wild dogs; they deserve to die. And that leads us to Point #2: Monster Huntin' is Dangerous Business. Two words: Sheriff Wydell. While the Fireflys go on a literal road-tripping killing spree, Wydell (Forsythe) is on a one-way trip to the Dark Night of the Soul. It's astonishing just how perfect Forsythe is with his role, what a worthy foe he becomes in the face of the bloodthirsty clan---a kind of 20th century Doc Holliday, half wild-eyed revenant, half fire & brimstone preacher. It's also a testament to Forsythe's skill that he can hold his own in a flick teeming with killer performances---and a testament to Zombie's craft that the man backs off and gives the Sheriff some room to breathe and come to life.<br /><br />'Rejects is unreal. Insane. Diabolical. Wallowing in blood. Possibly evil. And most of all, proves: Hell *really* is other people.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I appreciated Rob Zombie's attempt at reincarnating the '70s--which may have been the best decade when it comes to horror flicks--with his first movie House of 1000 Thousand Corpses. That movie was strange, but fun and a little more than just creepy. But Rob should have quit there.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie seems to be on constant rewind, as you hear and see the same things over and over again, i.e. curse words and brutal, senseless (plot-wise) killing. The blood is computer generated in most scenes, and you can tell easily, especially when the wound begins to wobble out of place. And to add to that, there really isn't a conflict worth mentioning. Yeah, the killers are the bad guys, but they're also the main characters. They're on the run from the law, but why aren't they running? I mean, they stay in the same general area the whole movie. If the conflict was the run/chase, then apparently the writer (Rob Zombie himself) didn't get the memo. Sometime while watching this movie, I began to think the cop was the main protagonist, but that can't be true considering the movie doesn't end with him, but with the killers. So in the end, a lot of what happens was just pointless; The Devil's Rejects is a gooey mess of a movie that's more out to gross you out than scare you.<br /><br />A few other things that bothered me about the movie was, a) the predictability--the last ten minutes are practically spelled out for you-- b) the fact that some elements from the past movie was conveniently left out (i.e. the underground creatures), and c) the characters weren't unique, with only a couple differences to separate them; they all swore like truckers, they're all bad-a**es, all of them are mentally unstable, and none of them blink at the sight of death. The only difference is the on/off switch that the killers don't have when it comes to murder.<br /><br />The movie does have a few good things going for it. As a gross-out movie, it easily achieves its purpose. The setting match the times of the movie (the '70s) almost perfectly. The sound track was pretty decent as well. And the one-liners delivered by Spaulding are as funny as they were in the first, and Spaulding himself is excellently acted despite everything. Plus, the DVD has bloopers, something that always attracts me to DVDs.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie unless you like gross-out movies, or if you really, really enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses. This just isn't a movie that has to be seen and one that fails at almost every point to present some sort of a well-plotted story.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie's follow up to his surprise hit House of 1000 Corpses, is one of the few horror sequels that manages to not only live up to the original, but it also manages to surpass it.  Influenced by the classic exploitation/horror films of years past (Last House on the Left, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Zombie has given the Devil's Rejects a much grittier look than his last film, as the story picks up with the homicidal Firefly family on the run from the law.  Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), Otis (Bill Moseley), and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) are on the lam from a revenge driven and slightly deranged sheriff (William Forsythe) who plans to give the killers a taste of their own medicine.  Along the way, the trio adds more to the body count, resulting in a climactic bloody showdown that is surprisingly well weaved.  While it doesn't necessarily offer anything new to the horror genre, it doesn't try to, and the cast that Rob Zombie has assembled here does great work.  Haig walks the line between frightening and hilarious as the clown faced Captain Spaulding, while Moseley is less over the top this time around as Otis, but he is all the more subdued and terrifying.  Leslie Easterbrook (replacing Karen Black) as Mama Firefly is a bit overacted, while Moon is once again seductively scary as Baby, while Forsythe almost steals the entire movie.  Zombie has again assembled a supporting cast of older horror film and cult favorites, including the original Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Hills Have Eyes icon Michael Berryman, Danny Trejo, PJ Soles, Priscilla Barnes, Steve Railsback, and former pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Paige; most of which are pretty memorable.  Pushing the limits of it's R rating, the Devil's Rejects is not for the faint hearted, and while it may drag a bit towards the end (you are guaranteed to never listen to "Freebird" the same way again), this is a real treat for older horror fans looking for a film that recaptures the unpredictability and tension of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>In a film world overrun with "torture cinema," Rob Zombie's "The Devil's Rejects" both embraces this current trend and hearkens back to a more innocent time--the exploitation era of the seventies where films of this type found underground success.  Following up the chaotic, and not very satisfying, "House of 1000 Corpses"--"The Devil's Rejects" continues the saga of the murderous Firefly clan.  But where "House" was an amped-up, kaleidoscopic music video of carnage and macabre humor with no particular plot--at least "Rejects" has Zombie embracing aspects of legitimate film technique and story telling narrative.  Much more accomplished than its predecessor, however, doesn't make it much more entertaining.  To be clear, I am not one who thinks that violence in films is the end of our society.  I have embraced many films within this genre for various reasons, I just happen to think "The Devil's Rejects" commits the greatest sin of all--it creates no suspense.<br /><br />The film's plot, as if it matters, revolves around the Firefly family as previously mentioned.  Their home, and the site of countless previous murders, is raided by the police in the film's opening moments.  A close knit group, to be sure (especially for psychopaths), brother Otis and sister Baby escape and arrange to meet up with their father Captain Spaulding who runs around like a maniacal clown.  First stopping at a desolate motel to murder and torture at random, and later moving on to a house of ill repute--mayhem follows this wacky bunch!  Hot on their trail, however, is Sheriff Wydell--who has a personal agenda of his own.<br /><br />I credit Zombie for effectively recreating the gritty feeling of a seventies exploitation flick.  The setting and mood are spot-on.  I, also, enjoyed some of the cameos from a roster of forgotten or B-movie stars that populate the picture.  I think there was fun to be had here--I just didn't have it.  The humor fell flat, the brutality felt familiar, and the lack of dramatic tension left me feeling nothing.  A film of this type needs to generate suspense to be successful and through all the bloodlust, nothing approximating real emotional consequence evolved until the film's ending.  I credit William Forsythe, as the sheriff, for this last minute reprieve of excitement.  His performance hits all the right notes in an over-the-top spectacle of madness and revenge.<br /><br />This endgame, only the final 20 minutes of the film, really does ramp up the tension.  The sadistic retribution and raw power within this segment is so much more satisfying than anything that has preceded it--for the first time, the film connects at a visceral and emotional level.  But, alas, it's too late to salvage the picture.  A 4 star ending on a 1 star movie--I can only round up the overall score to 2.  I know that this film has its admirers, I just didn't see anything particularly new.  But more critical was the sense of apathy I had throughout--who knew that vicious serial killing could be so flat and uninvolving?  KGHarris, 03/07</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>You would think that killing plus Rob Zombie, plus cool music, plus lots of long greasy hair, plus funky clothing and unshowered bodies, plus blood guts and gore would equal a pretty cool movie but in this case, it just equals a stinker!<br /><br />The movie looks cool but it has NO PLOT! Sure, old slasher movies are violent (and had cheesy effects and didn't look as good) but they had more story and they were scary. This movie wasn't scary, suspenseful or eerie, it was just violent and relied so much on shock value that it failed to be shocking after a while. I would tell you fine readers more about the story but there isn't much to tell. Psychotic and sadistic killers go on a killing spree, there is lots of cool music and it's filmed like a music video, the end. Now maybe you won't have to waste your time watching it!<br /><br />I thought the ending fell flat and I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters. I am all for gore and violence but please, Rob (though you are awesome and talented) next time make it have a point! Personally I think Rob Zombie needs to stick to music and leave acting and screenwriting to people who can actually act and write. I might have liked this if it had more 'meat' to the story, I felt something was missing.<br /><br />I know a lot of people liked this movie and I will say it has some visual elements which are pretty cool so I did give it an extra star for ambiance and appearance. It also had a fast pace and that was good. It wasn't my thing but if you like senseless killing, tons of gore and don't care about the lack of story, you might like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I was not a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, but I appreciated Rob Zombie's directorial debut and what he was attempting to achieve with his first film.  The film lacked finesse - there's an art to even bad horror films and a fine line between an homage and ineptitude. Zombie had lots of great ideas but they simply didn't gel on screen.<br /><br />All is forgiven with The Devil's Rejects.  Zombie wisely dumps the Dr. Satan angle (whose appearance was the film's "jump the chainsaw" moment) and instead focuses on creating a movie that's focused, violent, vile, and lyrical all at the same time.  It's a 70s homage, complete with grainy film and little makeup.  By firmly placing his film in the 70s, unlike the first which could have happened anywhere, Zombie brings surprising freshness to the standard inbred family of serial killers.  In a twist that determines much of the film's narrative, the Firefly clan gets exactly what it deserves. Or does it?<br /><br />See, The Devil's Rejects is a road trip movie about a bunch of free spirits who do whatever they want to whomever they want whenever they want.  Only in the counterculture 70s could this message seem appealing as our anti-heroes fight The Man.  And The Man comes aknockin' with machineguns and body armor led by the maniacal Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe).  Wydell spirals madness in his quest to avenge the death of his brother, Lieutenant George Wydell, murdered in the first film. All pretenses of justice are cast aside as he hires mercenaries to track the Firefly clan, uses torture to elicit confessions, and even resorts to the murder of a helpless woman.  The real villain, says director and producer Zombie, is any one of us if we're pushed too far.<br /><br />But you might have a different interpretation.  Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) is a disgusting clown who isn't above robbing mothers and terrorizing children.  Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie, who doesn't laugh at all in this movie, a wise move) is a tease who uses her looks to lure men to their deaths.  Otis B. Driftwood (Bill Moseley) is an unrepentant serial killer who skins men alive. Collectively, these three helped kill over a thousand people.  They are bad people meeting a bad end, and though Wydell's methods are hardly lawful, they are most certainly just.<br /><br />And therein lay Zombie's genius.  By the end of the film Spaulding, Baby, and Otis have been beaten, tortured, and harassed. When Otis has nails hammered through his palms, is he the Devil thrashing in hell or a Christ-like figure suffering his way towards redemption? Should we be rooting for the bad guys, the way we root for Freddy and Jason?  Or should we be condemning them to the same kinds of tortures that the Firefly clan inflicted on their victims?  How vicious a punishment must be inflicted before it's considered just?<br /><br />Zombie gives no answers.  He simply sends three serial killers to their logical end with dignity they might not deserve.  And along the way you can't help but admire Zombie's artistry in creating a tale that, no matter which side you come down on, keeps you watching right until the last shot is fired.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a really nasty movie! I can not believe that I liked it. I don't know why, it is just so wacked, I could not believe what I was seeing. If you like twisted horror this is for you. The DVD transfer is good and there are some extras.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though main characters from "House of 1000 Corpses" re-appear, it may not be exactly right to call "The Devil's Rejects' a sequel. True, "The Devil's Rejects" is extremely gory and violent, but the film's entire tone gets less jokey and more nihilistic, closer to that of new American films made in late 60s and early 70s before such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Straw Dogs."<br /><br />Am I taking the film too seriously? Maybe or maybe not. Whatever the truths may be, it is true that writer / director Rob Zombie improved his skills. Beware, however, that his improved skills include several torture scenes and killings that will be disgusting to some. Body counts rise steadily up until its ending and so is the cruelty of the characters.<br /><br />The story has not much to tell. Even fans of the film would admit that it is predictable and formulaic. The house of Captain Spaulding and his family is raided by policemen led by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe). Two escape, but one is captured. The escapees start another killing spree before the final confrontation with the sheriff who prefers to exact vigilante type 'justice' by outdoing what the family had been doing.<br /><br />The acting of the killing family is all in all good - good, I mean, in playing the nastiest and most sadistic characters in a frightening way - but it must be admitted that they are all outshined by underrated William Forsythe doing over-the-top acting which is fun to see. Fun is, I must add, of unique kind.<br /><br />Viewers would find the film too bloody and sick, but some of them would love it for that reason. I was fascinated with Rob Zombie's skills to make relentlessly violent scenes about the relentlessly depraved people, and his homage to the 70s films, using the minimum-scale sets, road movie formula, hand-held camera, soundtrack music and so on. Lots of cameos include Michael Berryman. What else do you expect?<br /><br />If you ask me whether I would see "The Devil Rejects" again or recommend to others, my answer would be probably No. But the watch was fascinating, and I couldn't stop watching it. But I am not sure you will find it the same way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Time and time again we have seen sequels that try to capture the economic success of the original by rehashing the original story.  This is particularly true in the horror genre, where sometimes being different means a new twist Jason shows up instead of Mrs. Vorhees or Laurie turns out to be Michael's sister.  At the other end of the spectrum you can sometimes pull off an actual switch in genres, such as when the haunted-house in space movie "Alien" becomes the marines in space movie "Aliens."  But the second "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie showed a complete lack of understanding of what made the original work and even when they came up with a neat twist for the sequel to "The Blair Witch Project," they never got around to a story that would make it work.  All of this leads us to "The Devil's Reject," which is a sequel to Rod Zombie's "House of 1,000 Corpses."<br /><br />Now, "House of 1,000 Corpses" was Zombie's first film as a writer-director and it involved lots of gory special effects and a plot line that throws in everything and anything that he could come up with to either scare people or make them want to throw up.  But many of the most horrific moments flew by really fast and I became convinced that the movie really was the equivalent of a ride through a fun house.  The fact that there is just such a ride in the film, Captain Spaulding's "Murder Ride," reinforced the idea that this conclusion is a reasonable one.  Thinking about the movie only got in the way of what was happening, so you just watch the movie and attempt a post mortem afterwards.<br /><br />"The Devil's Rejects" is a sequel in the sense that it has the same characters and mostly the same actors.  Sid Haig is Captain Spaulding, Bill Moseley is Otis Driftwood, Sheri Moon is Baby, Matthew McGrory is Tiny, and the only change in the casting is that Leslie Easterbrook is now playing Mother Firefly instead of Karen Black.  For some reason Otis is a lot more restrained than he was in the original, but otherwise the group is the same group of homicidal maniacs as before.  The story takes place after the events of "House of 1,000 Corpses," but even more important is that most of the movie takes place away from that location after the initial scene, in which Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) and the cops lay siege to the place and capture one of the gang.  However, the rest get away and if you think laying low would be the smart thing to do under the circumstances then you clearly missed the life philosophy previously espoused by Otis.<br /><br />It is almost as if Zombie took to heart the criticism he received the first time around and went out of his way to do something as close to completely different as he could get away without breaking the connection between the two.  The sadism of the original usually accompanied off the wall lunacy and here it is more real world, which makes it more horrific because what is in this film could really happen and you can no longer distance yourself from the proceedings.  The future victims are not youngsters anymore, which is a big difference given the genre, and with this particular sheriff after we get to see if the titular characters can take it as well as they dish it out.  You can even say the differences is light night and day, because most of what happens here is when the sun is up, as if Zombie wants to show he does not need darkness and shadows to twist the guts of his audience..<br /><br />Zombie got started as a musician and there is a nice irony here in that instead of his own stuff he uses music from the 1970s to underscore what happens, from Elvin Bishop's "Fooled Around and Fell in Love" to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird."  Again, it seems clear he is going out of his way to be different and if "House of 1,000 Corpses" was, at best, a homage to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," then this 2005 film strikes me as owing something key to the likes of "Bonnie and Clyde" (or maybe "The Wild Bunch" given the western motifs).  Zombie's goal is to come up with shocking violence that is not gratuitous, and how much you "enjoy" (for lack of a better word) this film will depend on how well you think he does on that score.  Because there are scenes in this film that will upset you, which, it should be remembered, is an acceptable goal in a horror film.  If you are jaded by what passes for horror films and find yourself laughing at things like "Jeepers Creepers 2," then this is a film that has several scenes guaranteed to keep your from laughing.  Whether it is the performances or the characters that are compelling does not really matter because either way they are as compelling as a car wreck.  Given the status of the horror genre today, that would be a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>When HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES came out, it glorified Rob Zombie's love of B-grade horror flicks while giving an insane twist at the same time. It was a quietly successful film, and many of Zombie's following either loved it or hated it. Most loved it. It was one of the most insane movie experiences of my life. I wasn't sure how this sequel was going to hit me, but I've only got one word for you...INSANE!<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is one hell of an insane film. Rob Zombie shows more as a director here with his unbelievable camera angles and surreal setting (the desert locations worked to good effect). The acting in this movie is also over-the-top. Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, and Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob's real life wife) nail their parts in such convincing manner, you'll start to wonder if they're playing "real" crazy people. But you have to give big credit to William Forsythe, who plays his character with such guts and conviction, he's a believable dirtball, and you'll feel the same throughout the film.<br /><br />We pick up at the home of the Firefly family, who seem to be resting in peaceful slumber for the most part. Little do they know that a full-scale ambush is about to take place, thanks to the law enforcement in the area. When the showdown begins, its violent, the camera moves with the action, and the only two who manage to escape (not counting Mama Firefly, who was captured) are Otis and Baby. They manage to kill off a poor old lady and steal her car, and drive off. Sheri makes contact with Captain Spaulding, the father of the insane family. When they all eventually rendezvous at a hotel, they take some hostages and some insane events begin to unravel. Some of the hostages do not make it, and eventually they have to get out and run off to take refuge in a strip-club type hotel. The intercuts with Mama Firefly are very amusing...and very creepy. But she finally gets her just desserts thanks to the insane sheriff, so now things take an ugly turn. We eventually head back to the scene where everything began, and the one of many near-climaxes begins, with the sheriff going nuts and holding everyone hostage until someone takes a stand...who is it? I wouldn't dream of giving this away, but the ending is just absolutely mindblowing...you will shake you head in disbelief, but you will ultimately have enjoyed this crazy, insane little flick that Mr. Zombie has poured his heart into...for you gluts to enjoy. One of the most insane scenes in the movie has to do with a woman wearing the mask of her...again, can't give it away...but you'll be somehow reminded of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in a way.<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS ups its predecessor in every dimension conceivable, in terms of action, camera-work, and acting. The violence is up there, but the crazy acting just steals the movie. The leads are all terrific, and the movie is just one whole insane experience. If you liked HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, no doubt you will never view movies the same way again after the zany horror of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>"The Devils Rejects", Rob Zombies follow up to his directorial debut "House of 1000 Corpses" is a gritty, unflinching horror exploitation film.

Such cameos include PJ SOLES (Halloween, Carrie, Rock N Roll High School) Elizabeth Daly -credited as EG DALY (Valley Girl, Pee Wees Big Adventure) and Priscilla Barnes (Threes Company).<br /><br />Thanks Rob, for giving us horror fans a film that we can love and that you can most definately be proud of.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Devil's is a better movie than the first. It's not as horror as House of 1000 Corpses, instead its more of Natural Born Killers. There's more of a plot and less disturbing imagery. I guess revenge isnt that disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie, once again, steps into the world of mayhem, slaughter, and death with the lethally disturbing family from House of 1000 Corpses (2003).  Those who have not seen House of 1000 Corpses will most likely be in for a revolting surprise that will shatter the mindset of safety.  In this sequel, Zombie makes sure that the audience gets another ghastly experience that grabs them over the throat that never lets go after the opening scene where Tiny (Matthew McGrory) drags a naked female corpse through the woods.  It is one of those films that will make the viewer struggle for breaths, as the audience tries to guess what kind of horror they are about to witness in the next scene.  The film is disturbing, horrific, gruesome, nasty, filthy, and whatever else the audience could possibly come up with, but this is also Zombie's intention.<br /><br />The Devil's Rejects looks and feels in many aspects like many of the films from the 1970s-grainy and rough.  In a sense, Zombie creates a homage to the cult horror and exploitation films from the 1970s such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), The Hills Have Eyes (1977), and Dawn of the Dead (1978) among many other films.  Yet, he succeeds in bringing his own flavor of the new millennia to the story, which makes it a cinematic mutation of the horror genre.  The film even bears some resemblances to Michael Haneke's brutal Funny Games (1997) in its use of psychological violence.  Thus, Zombie invents a brilliant look and feel in the film that feels both raw and crude, which enhances the agonizing psychological horror that the film creates.<br /><br />On a quite summer morning a caravan of police vehicles enters the compound of the serial killing family.  The police have the intention of getting the family dead or alive, preferably dead.  In charge is Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) who wakes up Otis (Bill Moseley) with a loud call from the outside.  Otis fumbles around the female corpses that he had an orgy with the previous night.  Baby (Sheri Moon) and mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook), Otis' family members,  also wake up from the Sheriff's call.  Together these three and the all ready awakened grandpa arm themselves with machineguns and revolvers ready to shoot anything that moves.  This is a violent shootout that brings back memories from Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet (1977) commence, which ultimately leads to Otis and Baby's escape.<br /><br />Once the two siblings, Otis and Baby, have acquired a car they make a phone call to Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) to warn him about the police raid, as he has also partaken in the gory orgies of murder and rape at the house and the police might have photos of him torturing victims.  These three bizarre characters meet at a motel, maybe a tribute to Psycho (1960), where they continue their cruel entertainment.  Their escape turns the film into a road movie that is similar to both Thelma & Louise (1991) and brilliantly violent Natural Born Killers (1994), but much more grotesque in its violence.  Together they intend to seek shelter at Charlie Altamont's (Ken Foree), who many might recognize from the Dawn of the Dead (1977), brothel.  In this viciously slaying road movie, Zombie turns the tables on the killers, as they become the victims of merciless law enforcement.<br /><br />Overall, The Devil's Rejects is awful and distasteful, but it is within this ugliness that Zombie finds something extraordinary.  It is not a pleasant cinematic experience, nor is it an entertaining one, but there is something wise within this horrific tale.  Curiosity, might be the prime reason people see it, and then of course all the Rob Zombie fans will want to see it.  If it is curiosity that drew the audience to the theater to see this vile film, then the viewer should experience guilt for watching the repulsiveness on the screen.  In addition, there is a moment in the film where the audience will have two opposite feelings generated almost simultaneously in regards to the murderous family.  These two feelings are vengeance or compassion, which further creates a moment for bizarre forgiveness.  Zombie throws in a myriad of ideas, whether these are intentional or not I could do not know.  Nonetheless, there are several notions to be reflected upon against the moral qualities of humanity.  It is a clear that this film transcends far above House of 1000 Corpses, as Zombie's storytelling technique and visuals have also improved.  Lastly, House of 1000 Corpses has a far higher body count and gore, but The Devil's Rejects reaches further into the madness where it rocks the very foundation of humanity and decency.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Plot: The Firefly family has been carrying out some nasty business in their house full of unspeakable horrors and gruesome remains for years on any innocent wanderer they can find. But the local sheriff Wydell and his smalltown police force are closing in on the vicious group of redneck psychos in an attempt to end it once and for all. This family isn't going down without a fight, though. A few are left behind and killed in the line of battle when a shoot-out occurs, but two of the members manage to escape -- Otis and Baby. They go on a killing rampage and meet up with their good friend and fellow sadist Captain Spaulding. The three of them are tracked by the cops and are for sure in a sticky situation, but once it becomes personal for sheriff Wydell things get a whole lot uglier. Wydell is seeking vigilante justice, and he's going to a whole new level to get it. It seems the Fireflys might have finally met their match.<br /><br />The Devil's Rejects, at first glance, might be confused with a gorehound horror flick for cheap thrills and gratuitous violence. It certainly has plenty of graphic violence (not to mention nudity and lots of adult language, thoroughly earning its rating), but these things must be put to the side so the viewer can realize what has really happened here: Rob Zombie has taken a unique turn from his first House of 1000 Corpses film and given us a truly mesmerizing and brutal flick that acts more like a warped modern-day western than a run-of-the-mill horror. Just when we thought all there could be anymore is mindless slasher cliches or wattered-down suspense, The Devil's Rejects steps on the screen and gives us what we've been waiting for. A damn fine movie, that is. I would encourage any fan of horror movies and even open-minded western fans to check this out, as it rides a firm and intriguing line between the two genres, giving the viewer one amazing experience. There are plenty of twisted good times to be had, and even some humor thrown in the mix, which only reinforces the morbid nature of these madmen. Just be warned, it's only for the strong-gutted. And it's that gritty, in-your-face realism that makes it what it is. Very entertaining indeed!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I hated this movie simply because it was so mean spirited. The jist of the movie is so ridiculously pro-murderer that you have to really examine your ethics if you like this movie.<br /><br />THis movie has no suspense, scares or thrills. The charactors are vicious sadists who kill for joy. It is one thing when the violence is intense because it adds to how scary the charactor was, or because it makes a climax, where the killer gets their due, more intense. However, this movie just minimalizes the lives of innocent victims. What was the point?<br /><br />In "Texas CHainsaw", the family was sadistic, but that led to the intense horror of what the victim was going through. it made her escape all the more gratifying. All the zombie movies, where they show gore galore is fine, because it illustrates the horror of being eaten alive.<br /><br />Violence, without a story telling purpose, is just plain mean.<br /><br />This movie transforms the 3 murderous family members, at the end, into a Bonnie and Clyde, folk heros, which was illogical.<br /><br />I hated this movie so much because it seems as though it advocated and glorified violence, murder, and sexual assault onto innocent people. This has no redeeming value.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>WOW..I like it a lot..<br /><br />Really disturbing kind of gory movie love he's style the way he makes movies and camera shots,Is like  back in 70s movies such I love. Really enjoy the movie was real good scary kind of western..Is like "The Dukes of Hazzard" on acid!! I bought the DVD and I am glad i did!..But compare this to House of 1000 Corpses  .I think House of 1000 Corpses was a notch scarier & goryer. But I liked this one as well a lot, Great casting and actors done the solid great job!! With double DVD set with great picture and 6.1 DTS sound and a lots extras. WOW!!

I actually enjoyed House of 1,000 Corpses much better than the sequal. The sequal took itself way too serious. Rob Zombie should have stayed with the corney humorous horror movie instead of trying to make you feel sorry for the "Rejects". If you like blood, gore and torture on a serious level then this one is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I'll say right up front that I saw this with out having seen 'House of 1000 Corpses'. Reports were that that movie was no good, and that it wasn't liable to make too much of a difference if you'd seen the original to get the sequel. I suspect I was correct. Either way, this is a pretty good movie. Some will tell you this isn't a horror movie, and they do sorta have a point, but, on the other hand, 'The Devil's Rejects' is the kinda film that is pretty much only going to appeal to people who consider themselves horror fans. As you've doubtless heard a million times, this movie is in the vein of 'Last House on the Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes', and if those are horror movies so is this. Actually this leaves me in a kinda strange position, as those are the two most obvious predecessors to this film, but I don't like either of those movies very much, as much as I enjoy 70's horror in general. Of course, the problem with those films was mainly in execution rather than concept, so if you do it right you can make it work. And Zombie made it work here.<br /><br />This film is pleasantly short on plot. Basically, there is a family of murderers, and a vengeful, nutty cop who wants to get them. They kill people and fight one another etc. It's mostly situation based, as the family takes hostages and murders people and just generally creates havoc. Oddly enough, this film is much more reliant on the performances than is your typical horror film. The clan members all verge on parody, but they keep it held back just enough to make them believable, and I suppose one might say that that would be the goal when it comes to making ludicrously villainous characters. Sid Haig is Captain Spaulding, the father of the family, and while he's pretty evil, of course, he's the most charming, playful member of the family. Haig does a real good job with him. Bill Moseley is Otis, the craziest, most sadistic one. His performance is much praised, perhaps over praised. He's believable enough, but not really that interesting. The director's wife plays Baby. This sorta nepotism is always worrisome, but she stands up passably well against the other leads. The real standout, however, is William Forsythe as Sheriff Wydell. He is... intense. In a way this hurts the film, as I believe we are supposed to sympathize with the family towards the end of the film. This didn't happen for me, largely due to the strength of Forsythe's performance. He's a very bad man too, no doubt, but still not as bad as them, and he's just more compelling and intriguing than any of them, too. Zombie stuff a few old horror icons into small roles, most notably Ken Foree and Michael Berryman. Zombie deserves some credit for making them be there for a reason, making it not feel like a cameo. I like that kinda stuff, but I want it to flow nicely, and not *feel* like a cameo. (The Takashi Miike scene in Hostel, anyone? Still, that movie was pretty good. If you like this you'll probably like that, though it's quite a bit more modern. I wrote a review of it for Amazon, but alas I used a naughty word and they didn't post it, nor will they ever let me write another one now, for some reason. Jerks.)<br /><br />This is an ugly, ugly film, grainy and washed out, with grimy scenery and filled with unattractive people, many of whom do not have enough clothes. Many people will be understandably put off by this, but I think the grit works. I should note that though this is a violent film, it isn't very gory. (The one exception is when one person is run over by a large truck, with splattery results.) Still, there are plenty of scenes that will put off less adventurous viewers, so consider yourself warned. The film also deserves credit for being relatively unpredictable. The lack over any real protagonist means it's tough to say who is likely to survive til the end. And the final scene was quite surprising to me, and I thought it worked pretty well. (Well, actually the execution is a bit overwrought, but I think the concept it good enough.)  The film also has quite a bit of humor, and I think it was generally surprisingly funny.  Fortunately, Zombie holds back enough on the humor that it doesn't really dilute the intensity.<br /><br />The most notable flaw in the film is the opening firefight.  To be blunt, it's just dull.  Zombie needs to work on his action scenes a bit.  Not too big a problem, but definitely noticeable.  Also, the period songs are occasionally distracting and obvious.  Still, no big deal.<br /><br />Hmm, I haven't really said much, but I'm tired of writing. It's pretty good. Not fantastic or groundbreaking, but worth seeing.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Sequel to 'House of 1000 Corpses' is set some months later with the Texas State Police making a full-scale attack against the murderous Firefly family for the 1,000+ murders and disappearances of the past several years. But three of the family members escape, including Otis, Baby Firefly and Baby's father Captain Spaulding. The evil trio go on a road trip, leaving dozens of mangled bodies in their wake. Evading a massive Texas Rangers dragnet as well as a group of equally murderous bounty hunters led by Ken Dwyer (the brother of a policeman Mamma Firefly killed in 'House of...') who's obsessed with finding the deadly killers, the surviving Firefly clan gather at a run-down amusement park owned by Captain Spaulding's half-brother, Charlie Altamont, whom offers them shelter and a new base of operations for their killing spree as Sheriff Dwyer, the Texas Rangers, the FBI and others slowly close in.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>When I first saw this movie in the commercials I thought it was interesting because of the title,then I found out that it was a sequel from house of a thousand corpses so I rented it and hated it accept for one scene so I had doubts about this movie but I felt it was different then the first so decided to see it anyway and I was right and wow what a movie it was, it was right to the point , first the firefly family has to escape from the cops and then they start to slaugter people on their way and in a very bad way.

This is one sick in your face horror film and has proven that Rob Zombie could be the new horror director of the coming decades. I never saw House of 1000 Corpses, but I plan on renting it tonight since The Devil's Rejects is a semi-sequel. Besides the gore goodies that are missing in all the PG-13 horror films today, this film boasts some very good acting (especially William Forsythe as the sheriff and The Firefly family (Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby) who are so good you will forget these aren't actually psychos in reality) and the music is extremely well placed. It was also quite nice to see Sheri Moon Zombie's bum a number of times. I must also warn people not to leave when "Free Bird" plays at the end. About ten people walked out of the theater thinking it was the outro, but almost the entire song (8-10 minutes) plays before the film is over. I think it is a great sequence and those people who left early missed out (not to mention it wraps up the movie in a more definitive way!). If you can stomach extreme language, sexual content, gore, torture, and one freaky clown, The Devil's Rejects is one of the weirdest yet most satisfying horror films to come out in a very long time. Great job ROB!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I didn't like much "House of 1000 Corpses", it was more like OK to me, so I didn't expect a lot from "Devil's Rejects". And I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to see what I saw, for Rejects is one of the most vicious, violent, brutal, over-the-top movies I've ever seen. It may seem quite disgusting for an unprepared person, so be aware. For a long time horror fans it's definately a tribute to classic horror flicks, but Rob Zombie did everything he could so his film would terrify and shock the audience three times more than oldies. I'd call Rejects "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" meets "Natural Born Killers" meets "From Dusk Till Dawn", and I'm sure I'm not the first person to come up with such a conclusion. Speaking of "Natural Born Killers" - I guess Mickey and Mallory Knox seem just kids in comparison with the Firefly family.<br /><br />Rob Zombie's flick knows no limits, it puts us into an atmosphere of total chaos and mayhem, and we can't help but watch it as we look at the terrible aftermath of a road accident - shocked but unable to shift our glance. Zombie's world is a wild world, it's beyond good and evil, the concept of good and evil itself does not exist there, therefore you can't tell the difference. "Devil's Rejects'" world lies completely beyond me that's why it was so shocking and impressive. When William Forsythe's character tortures the Firefly family members, I don't know whom should I feel for. And who is better - them low-lifes, or low-lifes who were hired by sheriff to hunt them? Anyhow this movie is a total mess in a good meaning of the word, I like those kinds of messes.<br /><br />Besides William Forsythe, whose performance is just awesome, and the Firefly family, we meet many actors here who are well-known to all fans of horror and B-movies of eighties: Ken Foree from "Dawn of the Dead", Leslie Easterbrook from "Police Academy", Geoffrey Lewis, Priscilla Barnes, a porn icon Ginger Lynn, Dave Sheridan from "Scary Movie", Danny Trejo for God's sakes! You'll find many familiar faces here.<br /><br />And the ending... Well, it won't be a surprise if it enters the annals of movie history some day (I'm serious).</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>What a dumb movie.

The gang of rejects were so twisted and malformed that they were to be not only hated, but likable. To help play this card along, the sheriff that was tracking the killers turned into a reject himself. I suppose this was an attempt to reveal some deep pseudo-intellectual philosophy about how we're all rejects at heart, or maybe not. Honestly, I don't care. The movie wasn't cool. In fact, it tried so hard to be something, that it became nothing. Are you smelling my drift? I thought so.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was hit and miss. Some of the actors did an amazing job. Sid Haig was outstanding as Captain Spalding, and the Unholy 2 (which included Diamond Dallas Page) were good as well. But most of the acting was horrendous. Sherry Moon captured on film one of the worst acting performances in recent memory. Every line she spoke sounded forced and aweful. Leslie Easterbrook was nearly as bad, but her main flaw was over-acting.<br /><br />With so many good horror movies on the shelves, I would recommend Wolf's Creek or High Tension. Rob Zombie tried real hard to be cool. He should have tried real hard to make a movie. I really felt the shadow of an aged rock star in this movie; a rock star that is trying so hard to remain cool that they become a caricature of themselves. This movie is like a caricature of a horror movie.<br /><br />I have read that this movie isn't "trying to be a horror movie." Who cares. Instead of "trying" to be something, it should have treid to entertain. Horror movie or not, it was forgettable.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 34<br /><br />20 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I got a confession: I didn't even buy this. My relative who lives with us has this and House of 1000 Corpses on DVD so I just borrowed it to watch it. Well good thing I don't buy these because although there's a certain entertainment factor that's crucial in a film which this film has, it's also marred by bad dialogue and a feeling of just plodding its way to its conclusion, rather than build tension or memorable scenes.<br /><br />It's essentially a sequel of sorts to House, which was an absolutely bad film. In that film we root for the kids to make it out alive only they don't. Similar to Freddy or Jason, we end up rooting for the killer(mainly because the actors in those films were bad). Here, it's obvious we're supposed to root for the Firefly family only if they get killed off we're like "hm, no more movies then".<br /><br />Basically, cops raid the Firefly home, leaving one killed and another captured. 2 escape, daughter Baby and son Otis. They take some hostages which of course are dispensed with(one of them really dispensed with), they then meet up with Captain Spaulding, the dad. On their tail is the Chief, chasing after them mainly because they killed his brother.<br /><br />After Pulp Fiction came out, many films were accused of having its dialogue/tone "Tarantino-esque". No more is this evident than Rob's films. Like Corpses, many dialogue is trying to be witty and funny but it sounds like a kid who's learned how to swear so he's being creative by mixing them up. There's literally a dialogue exchange like this: "**** you. **** me? **** you, mother****er!" Good dialogue like that is hard to come by folks.<br /><br />One thing that is thankfully exercised from Corpses is the processing trickery such as having negatives and color overexposed or degraded. There is use of that freeze frame from the last one but at least here it's used to better effect. If Corpses was trying to be a splatterhouse film, Rejects is trying to be spaghetti-western/horror which oddly reminds me of From Dusk Till Dawn.<br /><br />If you're into Rob's films, the genre or you just like it, then pick it up but personally a horror movie should creep you out, not make you laugh in the wrong way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>If you are offended by the F-Bomb, disgusted by dead animals and unfathomable filth, frightened by the thoughts of a serial killer dressed as a clown ala John Wayne Gacy, or appalled at onscreen murder and torture, then this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />A psychotic family on a secluded ranch are awaken one morning by a police raid led by acerbic small town Sheriff Rydell (Williams Forsythe).  What the law will soon find is not only the tens of missing people, but also the results of the most heinous mass murdering spree in U.S. history.  When Rydell only manages to capture the family matriarch - Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) - his personal vendetta, which has a taken on Captain Ahab proportions, burns his desire for justice asunder.<br /><br />The remaining family members are perhaps the most disturbed group of sociopathic killers ever.  Led by foul mouthed father Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), a quick-witted pervert who paints his face like a clown; the other two are brother Otis (Bill Moseley), a wraith-like psychopath with grungy hair (he looks like a Rob Zombie album cover); and sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), a blonde bombshell who disarms with her beauty and surprises with her sadism.  The trio wreaks havoc upon all they encounter, and abuse the world about them without remorse or hesitation.  When Sheriff Rydell enlists the help of criminal mercenaries - played brilliantly by the duo of Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page - the explosive situation runs its course in a heart-stopping finale.<br /><br />Everything is near perfection, and Devil's Rejects has the feel of an older horror movie.  With one Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage after another, there is definite respect paid to 70s and 80s horror (i.e. several unnecessary T&A shots, stupid people die, over-the-top sadism).  Even Michael Berryman, original creepy bald guy from The Hills Have Eyes, makes an appearance as a pimp's right-hand man.  The pacing of the movie falls right in line with theme, even providing a few freeze-frames mixed in so viewers can absorb the carnage.  The blood and gore are all present, and just enough to satisfy the gorehound.  The acting is top notch, believable, and downright scary.  The lengths to which Haig, Moseley, and Zombie go to make everyone loathe them is outstanding; in their attempts at evil and wickedness, they are admirable.<br /><br />Credit goes to Rob Zombie for making a captivating tale of evil, and for a creation that not only resembles the work of Tarantino, but rivals it as well.  Highly recommended for the demented - one of the best horror movies of the past several years.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>This movie I didnt expect to be good when I was see'ing trailers etc and I also stated on my house of 1,000 corpses review it looked stupid and did say my opinion could change, and my whole opinion is changed.<br /><br />This movie was absolutely 100% horror. It's bloody and gory and violent along with tons of foul language, full frontal nudity and did I say violent, every thing a horror should consist of,plus the movie never bores at all.<br /><br /> Its good to see how Zombie with no question in mind pushed this movie to be as insane as he could get it and I cant even imagine if he releases a directors cut. He took a chance and I feel succeeded very very well, going "R" rating is just good to see the man wants to make a horror what a horror should be.<br /><br /> What i like to see is that in this movie you get to learn about the characters  with a ton of dialogue and see'ing what each individual is like. Which is a plus. Also I love a movie where I actually cheer for the villlians as  no matter how much wrong they did I was on there side 100%. For Zombies second movie he did absolutley awesome and give him a ton of props and respect for making this  excellent flick.<br /><br />The make up FX's are great, no CGI ( thank god ), this movie gives the feel of a straight up horror movie from the 70's. And 70's horror is my favorite horror, it shows Zombie knows what real horror is.<br /><br />Everything FX's wise looks real as can be. the end is a complete shocker, will njot spoil anything. But I ill tell you through the wole movie you will beon there side no doubt.<br /><br />He has stars from "Hills have eyes","Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 original ), the slut chick from the " Warriors ",  Terri from " Three's Company" who must be in her 50's and show her bare breasted and damn she is actually still looking hot. And a few more recognizable faces like a wrestler and this spanish guy who when they show him you will know who he is and so on.<br /><br />He had all the right actors for the right parts and he did great. Im looking foward to see'ing what his next flick will be. I know we are done there will be no sequel as Rob Zombie said. Im sure he will make another flick in 2 years or so and will get the funds and I will go see it cause im sure it will be as good as " House of 1,000 Corpses" and " The Devils Rejects" .<br /><br />I own " House of 1,000 Corpses" on DVD and when " The Devils Rejects" comes out will buy it that day no question.<br /><br />This year Rob Zombies film blows Romeros " Land of the Dead" away buy quit a bit.

It was reviewed so horribly that I didn't even want to waste my money on it.  In the end, I was glad because I really didn't care for it too much.  So, when Devil's Rejects was announced, I rolled my eyes and thought nothing of it.  Until the decent reviews came in.  At that moment, I thought, well maybe Zombie got his act together and maybe the new one will be decent.  I should have waited for HBO again.<br /><br />Really, I am the prime demographic for this movie.  I'm in the low 20s, I'm a guy and I love horror films.  I enjoyed the 70s horror gore flicks, the 80s stalkers and the more adult horror films of today (like Haute Tension and Saw are two that come readily to mind).  The movies that are truly horror (because there are major differences between scary movies and horror movies).  And, to Zombie's credit, The Devil's Rejects feels at times an homage to the 1970s gore flicks like TCM.  Unfortunately, it's like he took the worst parts of those films and ignored the best.<br /><br />At the heart, Rejects is a road trip movie about a family of serial killers.  And the movie is mostly told from their point of view, with a couple of scenes as viewed by the obsessive detective.  I'm not sure who is supposed to be the protagonists of the movie and I'm sure that that is the point of the movie.  All of these characters become or are at the beginning all morally ambiguous or the antithesis of morality that I can't even begin to relate to them.  So, when the killing starts, I'm so distanced from the movie that I don't even care.  It's not suspenseful, it's not scary, it's just violence in the name of violence.<br /><br />And it is here that I think Rob Zombie missed the point.  The reason the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was so effective in its horror was that we had a character we could sympathize with.  Sally Hardesty was a sympathetic character so that when she was trapped at the hands of the cannibalistic family, when she's being chased by Leatherface and when her friends are all murdered in horrific ways, we feel the horror.  When the Firefly family is tortured in the Rejects, I don't feel sympathy for them, I don't feel anything.  It's just violence.  And it's deserved.<br /><br />And, for a horror film, it was incredibly boring.  With only a few sequences that were horrifying or intense (the aftermath at the hotel involving the maid for instance) that were interesting, we are given boring and pointless dialogue, driving sequences and sequences of horrible acting.  The whole movie felt drawn out that I was actually looking at my watch, waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />The only really fun parts of the movie involved Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding.  He was my favorite character in House of 1000 Corpses and he is the only shining light here.  His grin filled with rotting teeth, his scary clown routine and his home life all provided the only source of entertainment in the Rejects.<br /><br />Truthfully, I didn't have the highest hopes for this movie.  I was willing to give it a chance based on some of the reviews I've read, and I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised.  But, even with my low hopes I was still disapointed.  It lacked some of the good things from 70s horror and took all of the bad.  Instead of feeling like an homage to that genre and style of horror, it became a mess of a movie.  In the end, I didn't care and I wasn't horrified by much of anything (hotel scene is about it) because for the most part, they all deserved it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Thil film depicts ultra violence and gore. It tries to scare  the audience with brutal ways of killing  people<br />but the acting was so bad it's laughable. For example, in one scene a person was being killed with an ax. The<br />killer hit his victim at least three times with an ax. The victim screamed and moaned but he continued<br />to talk! His face was covered with blood but it showed no pain at all. The make-up looked absolutely fake.<br />It's so boring that I rejected it from the player after finishing two-third of it.<br /><br />There are much better horror movies which made me shudder. They are: Slither, Cabin Fever, 28 days later,<br />Pet Semetery and the Grudge.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>In the past, I have been asked to soften my stance on this kind of garbage, but I refuse as I will always tell it like it is.  Movies like "The Devil's Wussies", I mean, "The Devil's Rejects" are the kind of movies that are embarrassing for the horror genre.  This movie would make me laugh if I wasn't so disgusted with boredom and the movie's inherent stupidity!!  This movie is simply garbage and is a boring waste of time.  It's not scary, there's no substance, there's no style, there's no suspense, and it's just a bunch of stupid moronic nonsense that is totally uncompelling and very much indicative of a lack of imagination on the part of Rob Dumbie, I mean Rob Zombie...added to which indignity, I heard this guy Zombie is doing a remake of the all-time classic "Halloween"...what a sad day that will be for the horror genre.  Oh, just let me run to my video store and buy "The Devil's Rejects" and place it right along side classics like "The Shining", "The Exorcist", "The Omen", The original "TCM", and "Halloween"...pleeeaase!! I'm glad I just rented this garbage.  "The Devil's Rejects" is nothing but trash, plain and simple.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie's sequel The Devil's Rejects to the 2003 movie House Of 1000 Corpses is slightly better but it's really a borefest if you ask me. A real yawner of a movie. The acting varies in this movie but the real treat is seeing William Forsythe (The Rock, The Substitute) as Wydell. Forsythe digs deep down in his role and makes it the memorable thing in this whole entire movie. The Firefly gang are on the loose from their slaughter farmhouse and Forsythe is on their tail because they kidnapped and killed his cop friend. Forsythe wants to burn them down to the ground, give them a taste of their own medicine. The Firefly gang consists of Otis, played by Bill Moseley and Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie and along for the ride is that clown from the first one Captain Spalding, played by Sid Haig. When the gruesome stuff kicks in it gets kinda mundane and it's like, ok, whatever. Also starring in this movie is Dave Sheridan (Bubble Boy), Geoffrey Lewis (Salem's Lot, The Way Of The Gun), Danny Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids), Diamond Dallas Page (Ready To Rumble), Ginger Lynn and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes 1 and 2). One other thing would be the part where the movie critic guy comes in looking like a Gene Shalit wannabe talking about The Marx Brothers. Nothing special here....</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>The original House of 1000 Corpses was great because it was a celebration of Zombie's love for the horror genre. It also included such great camerawork and surrealistic colors and humor.<br /><br />This film was just a straight killer flick. Nothing fun or original from the 1st film was included.<br /><br />Karen Black? Gone. Replaced by an actress (most famous for the Police Academy films) who couldn't capture 1/5th of Black's mania or comedy.<br /><br />No mentions of Grandpa Firefly, Dr. Satan or The Professor.<br /><br />What a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Mr. Robert Cummings may not have quite achieved perfection yet, but he is improving.  With the Devil's Rejects he's managed to improve on some of the things that went wrong with "House".  "House" was a nice throwback to 70s horror and it took place in the late 70s as well.  The problem was if Rob wanted a retro feel, he certainly screwed it up by using that annoying rock video type editing and using his metal-industrial crap on the soundtrack.  Rejects uses tunes from the 70s, and rightfully so if that's the tone your going for.  Plus, he learned how to keep his camera still this time.  Plotwise, Rejects is still a bit of a ripoff of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I'll certainly take a ripoff over a remake anyday.  It's easy to accept the "borrowed" plot points considering Rob's love of the genre.  It comes across more as an homage and an all around labor of love rather than just a way to line his pockets.  The same can't be said for a schmuck like Michael Bay.  In Rejects, all supernatural elements from the previous film are gone, and the focus is strictly on our main characters and the man in pursuit.  Yes, it's certainly brutal and unpleasant.  The average filmgoer might be repulsed, but genre fans will probably just have a good time with the onscreen carnage.  Horror fans will also enjoy a few cameos including Ken Foree, PJ Soles and Michael Berryman.  The true highlights of this film are Sid Haig, who like in the first film is the real scene stealer.  William Forsythe as the crazy cop is also a big highlight.  I admire Rob's use of character actors for the leads.  You can be sure that if some big studio were doing this film, we'd see Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom or some other schmuck in the lead.  Bill Moseley's character isn't as crazy this time around.  In "House" he ranted and raved and seemed more uncontrollable.  Here he's still a loon, but a bit more sane.  In the end, Tobe Hooper is still the one who got the best performance out of Moseley.  Mrs. Zombie's character is still rather annoying and I personally could have done without her.  Zombie seems obsessed with showing her buttcrack to the world.  Apparently he wants the world to see it as much as he must see it at home.  I guess he figures he's doing us all a favor.  I think it's rather pointless myself.  After seeing the buttcrack for about the fifth time, you get the urge to slide a piece of toast down there.  The end sequence is played out in slo-mo to the Skynard song, "Freebird".  I'm disappointed that Rob Zombie would be so cliche.  Come on now, this is the most overplayed classic rock song, and I certainly don't need to have it invading the films I watch.  Heaven knows I have a hard enough time dodging it in my day to day life.  These are only a few piddly complaints.  All in all this was a fun movie.  Much better than any PG-13 "horror" film currently playing in theaters now.  Though I wouldn't call this film a horror film, it's demented enough to appeal to fans of horror.  When I say "horror" I'm referring to actual horror films and not rock video movies with ghostly little girls or remakes.  Give it a shot, why doncha?  There are worse things on the video shelves.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Like an old episode of Starsky and Hutch, The Devil's Rejects  tries real hard to be 70's retro-hip. In reality, this film is nothing short of an abomination. Rob Zombie is without a doubt the worst director (since Ed Wood) to hit the big screen. His use of sound is a joke, every song on the soundtrack has been used in one commercial or another and his side swipe transitions are so past lame. Zombie still has not found his own trademark style. He seems perfectly content ripping off other director's techniques and patching them together as if no one will notice. The Devil's Rejects is totally devoid of a script, a purpose and a reason for being made. If Zombie is trying to relay a message, I guess it would be that "Hey, serial killers are people too". Zombie's attempts to humanize Captain Spaulding, Baby and Otis simply serve no purpose. These people are animals, plain and simple. I don't want to hear a sermon when I go to a horror film, I just want to be scared. Unfortunately, this film is not scary in any sense of the word. Freddy Krueger, oops! I mean Dr. Satan makes a few cameos during the course of the film in the most trite and predictable ways. The Devil's Rejects essentially has no plot and centers around the 3 surviving members of the clan trying to escape from the sheriff (William Forsythe). Wrestling fans may recognize Diamond Dallas Page as one of the bounty hunters that the Sheriff hires to find the gang. I really thought that this film couldn't possibly be any worse than House of 1000 Corpses, but that film looks like Citzen Kane compared to this train wreck. Anyhoo, I'd just as soon burn my $10 then see this film again. This is quite possibly the worst film of the past 10 years...Avoid at all costs.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I haven't seen "House of a 1000 Corpses" however, this is an interesting film - would have been 3 and a half stars for me.<br /><br />The violence is very unpleasant and there is also quite a lot of nudity (women of course) and inferred sexual violence as well. But don't watch it if you're easily upset by these things.<br /><br />Unlike some previous reviewers I disagree about the acting and the directing. Some of the cutting/editing was very clever and most of the time the acting was pretty good. There is an edge of very black comedy (ala the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) in this film. OK it is very black and I didn't actually laugh but I assure you it is there. This is helped by a classic soundtrack of 70's rock (the film is set in 1978), which provides a very strange contrast to the extreme violence being portrayed.<br /><br />The murderous family are quite believable, and there continual bickering with each other has a ring of truth about it. Look out for Geoffery Lewis a veteran of the two Clint Eastwood "Every Which..." films.<br /><br />In all honesty you don't really care what happens to the people in the film, but it is strangly compelling viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Some movies are for almost everyone; The Devils Rejects is not one of those.  With violence and brutality from end to end, a heap of "adult" language and a healthy portion of nudity, this film is not designed for a wide demographic.  But for those who are fans of violent horror movies (especially along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre), The Devil's Rejects may be for you.<br /><br />The story follows the homicidal Firefly family, who seem in trouble from the start when the police come to end their long reign of terror.  Otis and his sister Baby escape and eventually reunite with their father, Captain Spaulding.  Being on the lam doesn't really distract from their desire to kill, as they first wreak havoc at an isolated motel before finally finding refuge at a brothel.  Meanwhile, the local sheriff is in pursuit, driven by his own demons.  None of the characters are very pleasant or likeable, so it is hard to really root for anyone; instead, you kind of hope they all meet their maker (you'll have to watch to see who actually does die).<br /><br />Writer/director Rob Zombie obviously has a fondness for this movie genre, and movies in general.  There are plenty of references to other films here, including the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the most obvious of influences), Psycho and even Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.<br /><br />Actually, The Devil's Rejects only seems like a horror movie.  In fact, it is really a comedy.  A grim, twisted dark comedy, but a comedy nonetheless.  And while this film succeeds on a horror level, its humor sometimes falls flat.  You can tell that certain situations are supposed to be funny, but they just aren't.  An eccentric movie critic, a cop who wants to be an Elvis lookalike and an argument over ice cream are just some of the more noticeable attempts at humor, but they don't always deliver.  As a comedy, this is a three-star flick, but Zombie's success on the horror aspects - fascinating even as he repulses - elevates this by a star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie has one of the most disturbing styles when it comes to film making. I would hate to see his nightmares! This movie definitely pushes the boundaries and I loved every minute of it. I also liked how it was totally different looking than house of 1000 corpses. Check it out, but be warned its not for the faint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Devil's Rejects is actually good!  It's suspenseful, interesting and *extremely* bloody.<br /><br />For years I thought Rob Zombie was some kind of joke director never really capable of delivering *true* suspense or horror- only capable of offering the really fake and exaggerated variety.  Much to my surprise, this movie proves otherwise.<br /><br />It's about an old man dressed up as a clown, a long-haired dirty and scruffy looking guy, and a hot Jessica Simpson-looking blonde who go around deserted western towns terrorizing and tormenting the few innocent people they happen to come across.  They viciously stab, beat on, and humiliate people sexually because they believe they're doing "the devils work" (hence the name of the movie).<br /><br />An underlying theme is a police officer who's out for revenge and does his very best to track down these three horrible murderers.  Will he succeed?  Well you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />This movie is DEFINITELY more appropriate for fans of the more intense variety of horror films such as the Hills Have Eyes.  The graphic nature of the killings is obviously why.  I wasn't expecting such a disturbing take on the suspense genre with Rob Zombie at the helm but I was flat out *wrong* in this case.  His most spectacular participation directing movies is by FAR best experienced in the Devil's Rejects!<br /><br />I also love the many classic rock songs that were featured as part of the soundtrack.  Expect a lot of Allman Brothers Band, Joe Walsh, Elvin Bishop and Lynyrd Skynyrd songs to pop up from time to time.<br /><br />Overall: bloody, violent and constantly intense.  Just the way I like 'em!  Obviously the high point of Rob Zombie's career, and an underrated film in the humongous universe that makes up horror classics.  An amazing movie really.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>When I very first saw The Devil's Rejects in 2005 at the theatre, I hated it! I thought it was a piece of crap and didn't know it was going to make us side with the bad guys. In summer of 2007, I decided to give this a 2nd chance because Rob Zombie was directing a remake to my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I like better now than when I first saw it. It starts with Sheriff John Quincy Wydell and his troopers begin a full-scale attack against the Firefly family. Only Otis and Baby make it. Mother Firefly is caught. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding plan to meet at the Kahiki Palms Hotel. They torture and kill the members of Banjo & Sullivan, then they seek refuge at brothel owned by Captain Spaulding's brother, Charlie Altamont. Wydell turns into a vigilante and hires bounty hunters to find the Fireflys. Wydell threatens Charlie into giving up the Fireflys. Wydell then takes them back to their house and tortures them. If you love Rob Zombie's work, and have a crush on his smokin' hot wife, you'll love THE DEVIL'S REJECTS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>I passed up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome.  I never rented it.  However, I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, and loved the movie.  A coworker explained that this was a "part two" of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, so I gave it a chance.<br /><br />I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves.  I also purchased the following items related to this flick; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008JL80">House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].<br /><br />After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own.  I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Jeez, where do I begin on this one?<br /><br />Okay, this movie fell through my cracks, mainly due to my<br />personal views on the original "House Of 1000 Corpses" &<br />the fact it's played exclusively on Showtime (I'm an HBO/<br />Cinemax man myself). But every so often I wanted to see<br />this, having high hopes that this would take the unfortunate<br />hokeyness of Corpses and put it in the right direction. I mean,<br />the characters of the Firefly family all have great potential<br />that to me didn't reach it effectively the first time. Would<br />Zombie correct his mistakes being allowed a second time around?<br /><br />Taking place shortly after the Corpses, Devil's Rejects pretty<br />much begins at the Family's downfall by Sheriff Wydell, this time<br />as the brother of the originally slain Wydell from the first film,<br />played by character actor favorite William Forsythe. Forsythe<br />plays the revengeful Sheriff typically over-the-top, and by the<br />time he loses it, you're already well aware it's gonna happen.<br />Escaping the raid is four principal characters: Captain Spaulding,<br />Otis Driftwood, Baby Firefly, and captured Mother Firefly (this<br />time played by Police Academy's Lesile Easterbrook). So when your an on-the-run psychopathic family, what do you do? Go killin' of course! And in typical family psycho tradition they find another group to go torture & humilate in the likes of the Banjo & Sullivan family, a traveling country group who, of course, just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />Without spoiling too much more, you get the principal idea. Look, Rob Zombie is my age, so the guy grew up with the exact horror sexploitation films that I did. There's no doubt this movie is more of a homage to past films like "House On The Edge Of The Park" or "I Spit On Your Grave", just without any victim retaliation. Each character is played still so over the top, you just cannot figure out if Zombie's intent for the film is either parody, straight forward horror, or just plain comedy, and that's my main problem. While some characters grip the right feel (Haig and Moseley do add some true Horror credibility here), other characters like the Mother and especially Sheri Moon's Baby just comes off as annoying. REAL annoying actually, almost making me want to shut off the flix right then and there. But then again, the overall feel is better presented here than in Corpses, but getting to third base instead of first still isn't a homerun to me.<br /><br />I should note that ALL of Zombie's films look great. There is no doubt he is a great director. The look of sets, camera angles, music pieces, and such always hit the mark every time. It's just his writing. Too hokey at times, too much like a cheap copy of the films we grew up. Instead of a better way of telling this genre, he gives you an alternative one, not the same but not better either. That's the same feel I got from his 2007 Halloween too, Looks great, less filling! Also, his casting is always a treat for a Horror fan like myself. Always a group of "Oh, I know that guy/girl from..." list. For instance Priscilla Barnes, of Three's Company fame, plays one of the victims here, and in her big scene it's as if because she was availible to Zombie, he would recreate her humilation from 1979's Delta Fox strip-or-die section. To younger fans it's different, but to me and Zombie's generation it's more like "Yeah, yeah...I remember...". I mean it was cool then Rob, but now........<br /><br />Anyway, I'm glad I got it out of the way, and while I didn't hate the film, I consider it to be Zombie's best picture, even as far as saying it's miles ahead of Corpses and Halloween, it just doesn't hit classic territory still. Maybe if Zombie was born fifteen years earlier and made this in 1978 it would be a classic, but then again if that were the case he wouldn't have all those original films to be "inspired" by now, would he?<br /><br />Worth a rent, but still Zombie needs to put down the pen and<br />concentrate on just the directing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***1/2 2005.

My good Amazon bud, C. Blackshere suggested this one to me.<br /><br />This movie is about a family that enjoys killing and are very sick and sadistic.  This film is technically good and the acting is not bad---pretty good for recent horror.  The opening scene is a shoot out with the cops and immediately grabbed my attention!  This sick family goes on to kill after some members escape the gun battle.  They run havoc on a little motel in the desert, hold hostages and torture them.  The "big daddy" of the group, Captain Spaulding (a clown), comes to his kids rescue to help carry out more murders.  A cop then seeks revenge on this group for killing his brother, the fun then begins.<br /><br />Gore?  This movie has it.  But I wouldn't call it scarey.  It is just a fun, entertaining movie about a very sick family.  The clown, Sid Haig is excellent in this and actually makes the film.  The plot was something less to be desired as it skips all over the place and doesn't always makes sense of what's happening.<br /><br />But, I have to admit, with all its flaws, I did enjoy this movie and it's always nice to see a well photgraphed horror movie.  Probably the better of recent horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>***spoilers ahead***<br /><br />It wasn't all that long ago that rock star and horror fan Rob Zombie created a chilling new addition to the horror fan base of possible franchise hungry characters when he made HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. Creating a franchise was not his intent. Rather, it was to pay homage to the full bodied horror films of the seventies and early eighties, those grab you by the throat films that he remembered. The trials and tribulations that Zombie had to go through to simply get the film released and the success of the film when it happened are now legendary. So it was likely that a sequel would follow.<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is completely unlike the first film. Where the first delved into the oddball Firefly family and its penchant for homicide mingled with preaching, this one is straight up human destruction. Picking up where the last film left off, or shortly thereafter, we are presented with a new adversary for the family in the form of Sheriff Wydell (William Forsyth) the brother of downed Lt.Wydell (Tom Towles) from the first film.<br /><br />Wydell has nothing on his mind save for the extermination of this family that robbed not only him of his brother but so many families of their loved ones. The brutality and loss of loved ones is hit on here rather than the fun horror film gore of the first film. The true depth of depravity and pain that the Firefly family is seen as we turn from garish lights in the original to more realistic daylight here. And in that light we are witness to all they have done.<br /><br />The Firefly family escapes the attack of Wydell and his men with the exception of Mother Firefly (this time played by Leslie Easterbrook). Taken into custody, Wydell does his best to interrogate her, showing her pictures that the family took of their victims. But this is a lady without remorse.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Shari Moon) contact Capt. Spaulding (Sid Haig) and then head for a preordained meeting place. When the pair arrives they take several guests hostage in their room and begin to play twisted games with them, showing how truly low they can go. These are not the somewhat sympathetic cartoon characters from the first film.<br /><br />When Spaulding arrives the trio makes preparations to get out of harms way. But at the same time we witness a transformation of Wydell at the same time. The change is disruptive to the film as he goes from lawman to God's angel of vengeance. Tossed aside is the letter of the law and Wydell is reduced to little more than a member of the family in different clothing.<br /><br />Wydell does finally capture the three and takes them back to their home. There he proceeds to torture them in much the same way they did their victims. Suddenly the villains of this piece aren't as bad as we thought. And this is perhaps the biggest weakness of the movie. We are to revile these characters and BAM they become almost heroes.<br /><br />The final moments of the film almost cement this feeling as the tones of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" rise while we watch them driving. And the last thing we see is reminiscent of BONNIE AND CLYDE where other outlaws were hailed as mere victims.<br /><br />In the end this movie is not near as satisfying as the first. The sudden change in structure at the end dissolves all feelings that we had something different than most films that make icons of their protagonists. Granted we won't be seeing a sequel after this film's end (never say never). And Zombie proves himself as a director with fine capabilities shown in two films now. While this film is more original than most released this summer and more entertaining than others, on the whole I expected more. The actors still rule and we can hope that Zombie is now given more to do having proven himself capable.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>this movie was a trip, a bunch of crazy, no good killers, who fortunatley get theres in the end. rob zombie, like they say practice makes perfect. better the second time around. if you don't like the sadistic crazy maniac killers who don't give a crap, well this isn't for you. cause these guys and girl are just to freakin evil, no remorse, no mercy. they make everyone pay, in the worst way possible. in general the whole storyline and craziness, i liked it and i give it a thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Months later after the events of "House of 1000 Corpses", the Firefly family clan like Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon) and Mother (Leslie Easterbrook) still made their usual murders and are ambushed by Sheriff Wyndell (William Forsythe) and the police. Mother is arrested leaving Otis, Baby and Spaulding to escape as they hit the road killing people and kidnapping as usual for only Sheriff Wydell and bounty hunters must hunt them down.<br /><br />Gory and hilarious horror comedy from Rob Zombie that is a sequel to his 2003 horror hit "House of 1000 Corpses" manages to improve upon the previous movie. The film co-stars Ken Foree ("Dawn of the Dead"), Danny Trejo and Michael Barryman ("The original Hills Have Eyes"), this is a shocking and funny rollercoaster ride topped with gore such as a woman being squashed by a car, dark humor, sleaze and good acting with top-notch direction by horror lover and rock singer Rob Zombie including an awesome showdown.<br /><br />This Unrated director's cut DVD contains footage cut from the original "R" rated version to avoid an NC-17 rating and it is loaded with terrific extras such as bloopers, audio commentaries, make-up tests, deleted scenes, Matthew Mcglory debut, fake commercials, a mock talk show, music video, still gallery, TV spots and Trailer plus the second disc is a full length behind the scenes look behind the movie.<br /><br />If your into horror, get this one and i guaranteed you'll have some fun here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>this movie was over the top crazy! i liked all of the blood and gore scenes! this movie was much better then house of 1000 corpses!</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>This movie to me is great and should have been watch more because a lot of people did'nt see it and thats what you call stupid people.The reason why I say this is because this movie had every thing a movie should have, great acting as well as a great plot and soundtrack.The Devil's Rejects is a Part 2 of thousand corpses but I know a lot of you might say that movie suck but this one makes up for it all the way.<br /><br />  The movie is about the firefly family and how they get caught and must run for their lives to escape from the cops, and while they do that they leave a bloody trail on the way thats has dark humor and very gory if you get the urated version or even the rated one.<br /><br />  Don't read this review anymore and get this as soon as it comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>I'd like to open this review by admitting that "The Devil's Rejects" works as grade B trash, but not to the extent that Zombie would like--it doesn't have the depraved magic of "The Hills Have Eyes", Spinelli's "Maniac", or Craven's few gems before he became a corporate sellout.  Also, I find a great deal to admire in Rob Zombie's music and some of his comic book endeavors, but he just can't make movies.<br /><br />He's simply too mainstream now just to have fun, and as a result the genre is wee weed upon once again, people fancying this substanceless piece of sadism as "horror" or that it has anything to do with the films it shamelessly imitates.  Yeah, people get run over by trucks and fleshmasks are made, the three main characters are vile maniacs who seem to have popped out of nowhere, and Michael Berryman runs around, but a young Tobe Hooper did not make this movie.  Rob Zombie did.<br /><br />Zombie completely lacks originality; he tries too hard to alternate between the contemporary and the vintage ("Natural Born Killers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" just don't mix)<br /><br />and the acting is so bad that it makes some Troma films look like Academy Award material.  Captain Spaulding, Otis and Baby aren't believable even on the pathological level.  All we get are three greasy pieces of trailer trash with a homicidal edge.<br /><br />And isn't it strange that none other than Rob Zombie should make the very first film in which I actually rooted for a cop.  Nothing Wydell does seemed remotely wrong to me dealing with these three specimens.  Even watching them die in the overextended, boring last scene was pleasant in a dull way.<br /><br />Why does a guy who is so refreshingly obsessed with horror in his music and elsewhere have to f**k things up like this?  Roger Ebert had the audacity to call this "a good example of the genre".  Maybe he has Alzheimer's (or just a particularly bad case of morbid obesity), but I guess he forgot about "The Innocents", "The Haunting", "The Omen", etc.  He's certainly old enough to have seen the quality as opposed to garbage like this.<br /><br />Zombie should stick to music.</p></br></body></html>

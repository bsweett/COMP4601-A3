While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher - pompous, lacking self awareness, ridiculously awkward - in this he is a big city "scientific" investigator who comes to the provincial town.  Moreover, Irving's tale never quite enters the supernatural, but instead is a parody that leaves much to the imagination.<br /><br />That being said, Depp creates a very good character:  a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear.  THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it.  It is more of a traditional horror story that is tied off rather than left open, which I regretted.<br /><br />Recommended for fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>In, what has become one of my favorite films, Tim Burton served up an extraordinarily vibrant retelling of the Washington Irving classic, with rich baroque siennas, umbers, and golds jumping out of the mists of a secretive little borough, where a number of bodies begin to show up missing their thinking caps. Enter a constable ( wonderfully portrayed by Johnny Depp ), out of favor with his superiors, given to vapors, and scientific methods that appeal not at all to the puritanical powers that be. With the aid of a local beauty ( winsomely played by Christina Ricci ) of mysterious bent, and a young lad related to one of the headless, our gallant policeman puts aside his fear of large bugs, and searches for a human devil...<br /><br />Bottom line: there are plenty of extras in this particular version, and it's well worth the bread.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>I really had no expectations before watching this movie but REALLY enjoyed it. I can't add much to what has already been said by others, and agree it is destined to become a classic. Johnny Depp plays another nervous, eccentric, brilliant character and Miranda Richardson & Christopher Walken do not disappoint. Tim Burton puts his macabre signature on a classic tale with some strange new twists. Every time I thought I had it figured out I was proven wrong and the figurative fog lifting at the end was a nice touch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>Tim Burton breathes new life to the macabre tale of the tormented Ichabod Crane. I have not read the original story but I am a big fan of the classic Disney version and noticed that Burton changed several aspects of the story. The wimpy, laughable, big-nosed school teacher of the original is turned into a sophisticated, charming New York City constable who is called upon by the townspeople of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the mysterious, gruesome be-headings of it's residents. Besides countless severed heads, there is a lot Tim Burton throws at the audience and it's all done with the Burton style that his fans find irresistible. Very few can deny the fact that this film looks great from every angle. It's dark, dreamlike atmosphere will inspire awe and dread. From the sinister, mutated trees to the lurking fog that envelopes the dreary landscapes. There isn't a horror movie in recent memory that is this visually spellbinding. The cast is also first-rate. Johnny Depp is in sharp contrast physically to the quirky character depicted in the Disney version or the Jeff Goldblum 1980 film but he is very believable in the role and Christina Ricci's pale, angelic beauty shines even amidst all of the bloodshed. But one of the best characters in the film is the incomprehensible, vicious "headless" horseman portrayed by the great and always compelling, Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Parents should take note that despite the fantastic fantasy elements depicted in this film and the quirkiness of the main characters, "Sleepy Hollow" is definitely not for children. The film leaves nothing to the viewer's imagination and the violence and imagery is graphic. Some may find it disturbing. But for those old enough and who are fans of the original story and/or of Burton, Depp and Ricci, need to check this out. It's an incredibly violent excursion into a gothic world of witches, black magic and the walking dead. And thanks to the creative genius of Tim Burton, it's never dull.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an eerie version of the Washington Irving short story that goes beyond the initial narrative.  Burton twists the storyline and makes it his own, but he keeps the main premise and setting of the story:  Capturing the Headless Horseman, a Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken), who came to America's shores to seek carnage but loses his head during his mission.  He wreaks havoc along the countryside twenty years later after losing his head in order to seek revenge and a head of his own.  He has no bounds, and he beheads anyone who gets in his way.  Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799 in the village town of Tarrytown, New York upon the heels of the turn of the century, and Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), an eccentric investigator, is responsible for restoring the town's peace from the Headless Horseman.  Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is the daughter of the head townsman who has ties to the supernatural, and takes a liking to Ichabod.<br /><br />The film itself is amazing.  Burton adds a gothic dimension to Irving's tale and captures the gothic aspect of the story with a dark, foggy, and gory exhibition that is displayed with the characters, costumes and props in the film.  The cinematography is exceptional as well as Burton's teaming with Danny Elfman for the film's score.  The film has an array of horrific scenes of bloody gore, but the most interesting one is the scene where Ichabod takes jabs at a creepy tree with an axe that splashes out blood.  He discovers a most gruesome discovery as he digs deep within the tree, which will make you leap out of your pants.  Sleepy Hollow possesses the Burton traits that many will identify with:  Gray skies and dark nights that resonate doom and gloom and sunless snowy endings, and tinges of dysfunction within the family.  For example, Ichabod Crane is an investigator, but in his own life, he has unending nightmares of his loving mother and his monster-like father lurking in the background.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow will frighten anyone who is looking for a horror film during a Halloween night or anytime of the year.  However, this is not a film for small children, and I recommend Disney's version of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."  Nevertheless, Burton captures the Halloween spirit with much precision.  This quirky and scary horror flick will not disappoint those looking for the macabre in a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's take on Washington Irving's spooky headless horseman tale is one of the most fantastic horror movies ever made. An unsettling and sometimes shocking film, this is stylish, sexy and wonderful cinema that should not be missed by any fan of the genre. A long-time fan of Johnny Depp and owner of 25 of his movies, I have always loved Hollow since it scared the hell out of me in the cinema. Depp turns in one of his best performances yet, playing the queasy doctor Ichabod Crane to pleasing effect. Danny Elfman draws on past BATMAN music for the unsettling but refreshingly original score. STAR WARS fans should also note that this is the only film to have actors Ian MicDiarmid, Christopher Lee and Ray Park (Darth Sidious, Count Dooku and Darth Maul respectively) Considering this, it would have been good to sneak in David Prowse (Darth Vader). Anyway, this is my favorite Burton film and a modern classic, worthy of the title "Most beautiful horror movie ever made".<br /><br />After the hiccup that was Mars Attacks, Tim Burton, Hollywood's most eccentric director, is back on form. Adapted from Washington Irving's classic tale The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Burton's stylish take on the story of the headless horseman (Played occasionally by a freaky Christopher Walken) is Burton at his most macabre. Everything from the Burton outr&eacute; culminates in the film; the bats from Batman, the jack o' lantern from A Nightmare Before Christmas, and, as Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp from Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Burton's visionary touch takes the tone much deeper than the animated 1958 Disney version, with the headless horseman lopping off heads all over the place. The desaturated color and stunning cinematography goes a long way to making the action and shocking decapitations just that bit more gruesome, yet at some times, strangely poetic. The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en and 8mm) is fitting to the film's thematic touch and overall bizzaro Burton. Danny Elfman's downright chilling score takes the darkness even further. But there is humor amidst the full-blooded ghost story; Depp's fainting at the sights of the Horseman's handiwork, and the sharp script lets the actors, mainly Depp, have more fun. This is Burton's weirdest film since Batman Returns. Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>This was a really cool flick! It actually was kind of creepy. The acting by Depp,Walken,Jones, Ricci was all great, and of course Burton's unique style of directing made for a visually stunning film as well. The DVD had all the cool extras that I like, such as the making of the film, which incedentally I found mindblowing to learn that they actually designed each tree that you see in the western woods individually. Ths story is obviously about the headless horseman. It shows his origens, I won't give away the ending, just see it for yourself!</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>The classic tale of Sleepy Hollow is brought blazingly alive in the competitive film year of 1999 and it has a lot to qualify for to be one of the year's best movies. Well, this movie has all these qualifications and more too! It is truly one of the modern greats and one of the year's best films. The film has awesome mystery, horror, comedy, romance and fantasy balled into a great and amazingly intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker. In fact, this is one of the most well written and clever horror films of all time. Some critics have dissed this movie's script but I really thought it was fabulous. To act out this wonderful script they cast Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, and they couldn't have made a better choice. Depp is in almost every scene, and he steals every one with his wit, great accent and great enthusiasm for the film. Christina Ricci is also very beautiful and mysterious, although a little out of her depth. I enjoyed Miranda Richardson's performance, and she has a surprising waiting in the end. The cinematography for the film is lush and stunning, the art and sets are fantastically Sleepy Hollow-ish, and the visuals are truly breathtaking. So much effort went into this film, and a lot of people brought the unforgettable story alive. But most of the credit must go to the visionary and endlessly plausible director Tim Burton, who, with his great ideas, vision, abilities and past credibility's, has the right stuff to make this movie the perfect horror-fantasy. This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and one of the creepiest too. Sometimes I can still hear the headless horseman's stallion thundering along the forest, in search for heads to decapitate. I love this flick, and it kicks major butt, so if you're a Tim Burton fan, a person who enjoys the tale of Sleepy Hollow, a horror movie fan or just a movie fan in general, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed by this pitch-perfect masterpiece that is Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow!</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci ride on... Sleepy Hollow is a spooky adaptation of the story of Sleepy Hollow and the headless horseman. Depp plays the skeptical city police inspector who comes to the small town of Sleepy Hollow only to be bewitched by the young Christina Ricci and to fall prey to the spells and superstitions of the town. Positively horrifying is Christopher Walken (you watch it and you will know what I am talking about. The guy is scary when you see him looking normally; this is just abuse for the eyes!) The story is well-told, acting is good, and the cinematography and scenery evokes the kind of imagery that is necessary for this to be believable. Overall a fantastic film (in the sense that it is successful in the realm of fantasy).</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>When I see a Tim Burton film, I usually come away with a senseof awe and bewilderment.  I am in awe of his visual imagery (though Idon't particularly like his penchant for dark exposures and washed out colors) and I am perplexed at his use of this genius to create such bizarre and twisted films.<p>What is most disturbing about this film is that it tries to pass itself off as being based on Washington Irving's classic short story.  This is not even loosely based on that masterpiece.  It bears no more resemblance to the `Legend of Sleepy Hollow' than Johnny Depp bears to Ichabod Crane.  To put Irving's name and title on this goes beyond artistic license to shameless artistic forgery for its commercial value.  <p>This is not to say that this isn't a good story.  It is an excellent story.  I just object to the artistic deception.  What is sad is that we have a whole generation who will never read the story and believe they know it because they saw this film. <p>That being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres.  Burton attempts to create a comedy horror action adventure mystery romance.  It has too many competing elements that distracted us from the main plot.  The comedy element is the least effective. Burton's wry attempts at humor are sophomoric and puerile and detract from the better elements of the film, namely the horror/mystery aspect.<p>From the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful.  The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel. The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology.  The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.  <p>Johnny Depp did a fine job as the bumbling constable. He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation.  Christina Ricci was well cast as the coquettish Katrina.  Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.<p>I rated this film a 7/10.  It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  And Washington Irving it ain't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>I love this film. Tim Burton really did a wonderful job creating that kind of atmosphere no other director can create... and the cast is superb!<br /><br />Johnny Depp delivers one of his most offbeat performances... and Christopher Walken as the headless horseman... and Michael Gambon... all are great.<br /><br />Now about the things you want to know... the image here is top notch. Crystal clear, high definition picture as you've never seen - which is interesting: since the film has a dark cinematography you'll be amazed how well the High Def takes advantage of all it can do to give you a kind of image you'll think you only get in a movie theatre.<br /><br />In fact, to see the forest with all the fog and those trees in gorgeous high definition is a trully cinematic experience. And I do believe this is one of those movies who beg for high definition - And this HD-DVD edition delivers it just as you'd expect: flawlessly.<br /><br />And when it comes to sound... boy, this is incredible... an umbelievable bass runs through my living room as the horse gallops through the woods. All I can say is thast I've rarelly seen a sound design job as well done as this!<br /><br />Get this HD-DVD for a true cinematic experience!</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>In the middle of the mist we hear a horse ride, accelerated rhythm, until the fog dissipates and we see an impressive figure, his presence irradiates pure evil, his arm is ready to take another head.<br /><br />Tim Burton's back to the macabre.<br /><br />Gothic, colorful and vampire-ish, Sleepy Hollow shows us the vision of this extravagant director about Washington Irving's tale. It's a melodramatic story about the quarrel between intellect and emotion, pragmatism and mysticism, science and superstition.<br /><br />The sleek Constable Ichabod Crane puts science above everything. His controversial brainstorms take him to investigate a series of murders committed in the local community of Sleepy Hollow. Four people have been beheaded and everyone thinks the murderer is a headless horseman, a fierce war mercenary that came from the dead to take his vengeance.<br /><br />Ichabod will try to rationalize the facts, while he struggles to resist the charms of Katrina Van Tassel, only to reach the inevitable conclusion: that there is not a logical explanation for the murders.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Sleepy Hollow has some elements from the horror genre. A demonic villain that terrorizes a town. But it's also a gothic adventure with a pale hero running through skeletal trees to rescue his damsel in distress. That the hero is in more danger that the damsel is one of the great twists in this film.<br /><br />As Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp is an exquisite mix of neurosis, extravagances, manias and quirkiness. He's the antithesis of the classical hero, a coward with a brilliant mind but no experience in how to defeat an evil ghost. He's funny without being clowny.<br /><br />Alongside him, there's a cast of excellent actors that help recreate Burton's story.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a little over the top in his drama management and his approximation to comedy. But still, is a movie that achieves to recreate a world of fantasy with great realism, thanks to the skills of those who imagined an 18 century village that it could well be hell's portal.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow also confirms that Burton continues to ride on the dark side of creativity, hearing his own voices. In the movies, that's an enough excuse to feel forever grateful.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>This movie starts out with Christopher Lee talking, I honestly can't think of a better way to start a movie like this.<br /><br />So this is a fairy tale that plays out like a real movie, it's kind of hard to explain, but this movie does have  agood realism about it.<br /><br />Johhny Depp has come to town to find the headless horsmen.<br /><br />That is really all you need to know, not every scene is a classic, but the action scenes are wonderful.  The horseman is really bad-ass.  Christopher Walkien plays he horseman with a head, but looks way cooler without it.<br /><br />Some very sick moments, btu only like 1 or 2.  So the kids like 9 and over will probably be ok with this.  Overall the gore is very styleish.<br /><br />I love pretty much about this movie, except for a few scenes that I thought could have been better.  But the music was the best part for me.  It was so loud and strong, it exacted what the atmosphere looked like.  I don't know who scored it but he did an awesome job.<br /><br />The commentary is so-so, better than most.  And the making of is alright, but buy this dvd for the movie.<br /><br />VERY COOL.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is an interesting adaptation of Washington Irving's classic story.  I'm a Depp fan and he doesn't disappoint in this one either with his quirky/creepy demeanor.<br /><br />The picture quality is good and the sound is improved as well.  But in my opinion dark movies like this do not exhibit the breathtaking picture quality of brighter scenes in HD.  The picture is a bit grainy at times (not sure if this was the way it was originally filmed).  This is a movie definitely worth renting, but I'm not so sure about buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; could be called the best film by Tim Burton, it shows him moving up in the world from the &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; stuff which was good, but this is better. &quot;Sleepy  Hollow&quot; is visually hypnotic and frighteningly fun. It works best as  an art film, filled with so much richness in set design, costume design and  cinematography. Burton takes us into his own little world here, and it's a  great experience. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, 8MM) is in  the tradition of great storytelling, filled with entertaining characters  and ridiculous situations of gothic fantasy that never keep us from being  entertained or from having a good time. I do not condone it's R rating and  would take a kid to see this movie. It's great, visual storytelling that at  some points has the feeling of classic cinema. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is  a rich, dazzling work of the imagination. A great blend of creativity with  storytelling. Burton's true masterpiece in atmosphere and art.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>Sleepy Hollow is a very good Tim Burton film with very powerful preformances from Deep and Ricci.  I gave the movie 4 stars because I enjoy the actual movie but it drags a little bit between the good parts.  But what won it for me was the fact Burton got Chris Walken to do the headless horseman role.  To me he is a very talented actor, I hope Tim Burton and Deep do many more roles together. So if you like some horror mixed with few comedical lines then pick this movie up and see a new version and twist on the legend of Sleepy Hollow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Fans of Tim Burton can do a lot worse than watch this film.<br /><br />Johnny Depp puts on one of his amusingly patented, cowardly heroic performances, as Ichabod Crane, the skinny pale weirdo detective from NYC, solving the headless horsemen case. As isolated dreary Sleepy Hollow, the town that surrounds him, is as strange & secretive as Ichabod & the Headless Horseman himself.<br /><br />Good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion. Christopher Walken puts in one of his patented weirdo performances as the Headless Horseman! Short, sweet, & vicious! God love him!<br /><br />The script is fine for the chewing. The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen. A rich tapestry of dark hues & shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.<br /><br />A great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night.

We bought it off the DVD bargain rack and I'm surprised to find it there. In a lot of ways, it's a really excellent movie. First, the filming is just wonderful and fit's the story so well. Those dark gloomy woods are wonderful and the film sites within the woods are just marvelous. A lot of efforts went into these sets, believe me. Costumes too. It's just a well done movie! And the accompanying music by Danny Elfman suits the background and story so well and is a pleasure to listen to in itself. While watching the film, I wondered if there was an available soundtrack. I checked and there is. It figures. I haven't checked, but I could easily imagine this movie gathering in a bunch of Academy Award nominations or other awards of that type. It's that good!<br /><br />Okay, so what do I think of the story? It's drivel. Anytime there's a lot of superstitions, rotting bodies, ghosts, a headless guy riding a black horse at night and looking for his head, well, my mind just goes blank. It's a pile of supernatural stuff and my mind just doesn't understand. I'm a realist. This movie is unmitigated gibberish. I have the same problem with religion. Give me a lot of supernatural hocus-pocus and my mind just turns off. I can't help it. But, it's a reconstruction of a highly acclaimed work of literature. It's been a classic fiction story way back from when I was an undergraduate fifty years ago. So, it's highly acclaimed drivel. It's still drivel. But, people love the story and just look at all the high ratings. Well, to each his or her own. I enjoy Star Trek and that's drivel too, but it's tongue-in-cheek drivel. This is serious drivel. What can I say? I'm sure the majority of people wound love this movie and it's so well done. My advice would be to see it and decide for yourselves. You may well enjoy it, even immensely.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>It is 1799 in Sleepy Hallow.

Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees. And there's that little edge of rickety weirdness, especially when Depp whips out his buggy-eyed binoculars.<br /><br />Now, it's not perfect -- the witch's hentai-tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing. But Burton really infuses this movie with a sense of creeping, bloody horror that gets more and more nightmarish, peppered with moments of bleak humor (Ichabod trying to throttle the Horseman) and some really disturbing beheadings. It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.<br /><br />As for Depp, he's absolutely perfect -- he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason. He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic; how often do you see movie heroes who faint more often than the heroines?<br /><br />Christina Ricci is rather wooden at first, but she improves a lot as we discover some of the secrets she keeps hidden. Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel. Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over-the-top Horseman.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow" is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center. Blood, magic and a deranged undead horseman, all done with Tim Burton's gothic style.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>There are only a handful of movies that I consider to be the true Halloween classsics... and "Sleepy Hollow" is one of them.

Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees.

Let me say upfront, that I never have, and don't intend to, read the source material, as it looks boring. The script considerably expands on Irving's characters and moody atmosphere. The movie is very well directed by the Master Of Idiosyncrasy, Tim Burton (see "Edward Scissorhands," a bittersweet love story, or<br />"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street," a stylish and operatic "Kill Bill" set in Victorian England). The performances in this movie are first-rate, from Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci right down to the child actor who plays Young Masbath. I love the tender moments in the film (when Katrina holds Young Masbath in her arms and when she holds Ichabod in her arms); those are my favourite bits. What else can I say? I'm very sentimental. The suspense is chilling, and the ending will shock you. When you think, you know what will happen next, think again. Very complex and intriguing gem of a film. I won't say more, lest I give away the plot. "Heads Will Roll."<br /><br />The special features are quite interesting, beginning with a Making of featurette, and exclusive cast and crew interviews, which are very thorough. However, I think Christopher Lee and Martin Landau should have also been interviewed, as their roles were very small, but significant to the plot of the movie. Also, I'm somewhat disappointed that some scenes in the trailer (and lines of dialogue heard in the Making of featurette) were not in the movie or included as deleted scenes on the DVD.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film. It's worth repeated viewings to fully understand the complex (but well defined) plot. It deserved the R rating, for graphic horror violence and gore, and a scene of sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This isn't a "jump" horror film. It's considered a horror film for its general eerieness and beautifully creepy images. It's also a horror film for the many decapitations that are found in this film, so if you have a weak stomach, you've been warned.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give out brilliant performances for the younger crowd, while Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson will grab the attention of the older crowd. Christopher Walken is absolutely freaky as the Hessian [headless] horseman, while Christopher Lee's small role is a treat. Casper Van Dien, Ian McDiarmand, Jeffrey Jones, and Michael Gough are an excellent supporting cast.<br /><br />Tim Burton's imagination has been put to good use once again: sets and costumes are truly gothic and beautiful to look at. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay could've improved a bit with more polish and sheen, but it's only a minor flaw. Danny Elfman strikes again with his unique musical style (the main theme will have people shivering).<br /><br />So if you're a Burton or Elfman or Depp or Ricci or Walken fan, then this is the film for you. A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>I always liked the story of "Sleepy Hollow," but I felt it was overrated. This movie is a MAJOR improvement. The original story is basically this; Ichabod (an eccentric school teacher) comes to town; he falls in love with Katrina Van Tassel; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones dresses up like the Headless Horseman and chases Ichabod out of town.<br /><br />This movie changes the story (in my opinion) for the better. Ichabod is a constable who is having trouble with his superiors. (Notably Christopher Lee.) They send him to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow so he can prove his scientific methods for solving crime. (One is at least entitled to wonder if they are hoping he will get killed.) The first thing you will notice about Ichabod Crane (now a constable) is that he is A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT than in the book. He arrives at Sleepy Hollow and finds the people to be clannish. But he does make some friends who are willing to help him. While he is eccentric, we can see that his methods for solving crime have their logic.<br /><br />Bram is of course jealous when Ichabod has his eyes on Katrina. The events of the original story are quickly gone through. But this time, Bram succeeds in scaring Ichabod only for a moment, rather than away.<br />Ichabod then encounters the real Headless Horseman. While Ichabod is obviously terrified, he pulls himself together to find out what he can. (Even someone who comes back from the dead to kill could be following a pattern and have some motive.) One especially artful moment is when Ichabod is cutting at the tree of the dead. He gets splattered with blood, and we are not quite sure whether we should laugh or be scared.<br /><br />Without giving the story away, the more Constable Crane finds out, the more scared we can get. (Especially when Depp learns that the Horseman is not killing at random, and some live person may be controlling him.) Recognition can be VERY SCARY if well done. Poor Depp is also fighting his nightmares from his past. He has nightmares about his the murder of his mother and why he prefers logic and reason over religion.) The climax defines horror, and there is an especially interesting twist. (We are allowed at least a moment of sympathy for the Headless Horseman, who was so well played by Christopher Walken I may add.)<br /><br />Between the phenomenal scenery, the great music, the interesting deviations from the book, the interesting connections between Crane's past and present, the great acting by Depp, Gambon, Ricci, Lee, Walken, and others, the gradual unfolding, and the surprise twists, this movie is a masterpiece of horror. Johnny Depp will probably always be best known as Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow. But personally, I think this is his best movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>It's pretty sad that it has taken me so many years to finally get my hands on a copy of the DVD.  When this first came out, I went with my mom to the theatre and was instantly captivated by the enchanting morbidity of this film.  Oh, I had the video for years, but it's just so hard to use video now.<br /><br />Anyway, I am in love with this movie and its odd inability to be placed in any one genre.  I would almost call this a fairy tale, except the only unreality is hellfire and withcraft.  But even with all the death and blood and murder there is something positively sweet and even cute about this storyline that is admittedly a far cry from Washington Irving's tale of a funny Halloween prank.<br /><br />In this tale, the Headless Horseman is no story and prank but a real ghost terrorizing the citizens of a little New England village.  Ichabod Crane, still hilariously done by Johnny Depp, is a neurotic cop from New York City sent to investigate the murders.  Unfortunately, he is a realist who has no patience for magic and ghosts.<br /><br />The story is a tight, fun, and thoroughtly satisfying one that is endearing in all its bloodshed with its likeable characters that seem to have jumped right out of a storybook, albeit one that spends the entire plot in overcast gloom.  Even the blood, which defies all knowledge of clotting and reality, is fun in its macabre way.<br /><br />This is honestly one of my sentimental favorites, a deranged fairy tale brought to life.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.

It is a dark movie putting Washington Irving's classic story to the big screen. The movie is therefore about Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) sent to Sleepy Hollow from New York to investigate a series of murders. The murders all have one thing in common. The murdered people all have been decapitated and their heads are missing. Everyone in the town thinks that the headless horseman is the murderer. Crane thinks that they are joking until he has an encounter with him.<br /><br />The movie is fascinating with a haunting score by Danny Elfman, gorgeous visuals, wonderful acting and an awesome ending. The movie also has awesome fights and adventure scenes.<br /><br />This movie is definitely on my top 25 films of all time. It's a movie that everyone should see.

Tim Burton outdid himself on this one.  I've always enjoyed Burton's work, but I felt that he might have gone a little overboard with the second "Batman" flick.  In the case of the Headless Horseman, though, the liberties taken make the story that much more captivating.  As usual, Burton crams as much atmosphere as he can into this film.  You actually feel like you've been transported to the creepiest part of 1799.  Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod Crane.  He's a chicken, yet a brilliant mind lies under that facade.  Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, is also perfectly cast, since she combines beauty, brains, and "goth" all into one.  Miranda Richardson is another standout as Katrina's wicked stepmother.  Jeffrey Jones, underrated since the dawn of time, has a smaller role in this flick, but his acting skills make his character shine.<br /><br />The special effects were excellent.  Christopher Walken, though all of his lines were grunts, grumbles, and one whispery, "Shhh!" was an excellent choice for the Horseman.  He was a walking, riding, head-whacking special effect all on his own.<br /><br />The story was great.  As stated before, Burton did take a few liberties with the story, but they made the film that much better.<br /><br />If you're looking for a little Halloween fun, or just want to get a little spooked any time of year, watch "Sleepy Hollow."  It has just enough scares in it to mess with the younger kids(though anyone under thirteen should probably steer clear of this one), just enough fight sequences for the action fan, and great acting coupled with a plotline that'll keep even the toughest critic at attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Given that this is one of my absolute favs, I upgraded when the Blu Ray became available, only to my frustration.

Ichabod Crane is not the hero of the story.  He doesn't rid the town of the Headless Horseman.  Of course, this doesn't quite fit the bill for a Depp/Burton vehicle.  This would have made a fun sequel -- what happened after Ichabod disappeared.  As it is, it is a very shaky reworking that over-analyzes Crane's childhood and introduces too many plot and character changes to really make it recognizable.<p>Would that Burton had brought the original story to film with this much energy and whimsy and spookiness.

This is certainly not a real horror movie, but more a type of gothic thriller with humor to ease the tension. That doesn't mean that the movie is lacking shocking scenes, because there are several scenes not suitable for individuals with heart problems. Francis Ford Coppola is the executive producer and we know he did Dracula a few years ago. The effects are very good, except for Johnny Depp being squirted with blood a few too many times, but since it's Depp it's not that annoying. Sleepy Hollow communicates the mood of a gothic thriller through its cinematography and with the supporting soundtrack very well. It almost appears to be a black and white movie, but of course it isn't, as some of the important colors emphasize certain situations, and they did a very professional job at it and this comes across very good. The musical score is also just perfect for this movie and adds a lot to tell the story and to communicate the dark, terrifying mood. We enjoyed the movie and during this season it's certainly the right movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>Though I have heard about the title for a long time &amp; I knew there was a headless horseman, I really did not know the in-between plot.  So when I saw the DVD in our shop, I eagerly watched it with my husband. <p>Sure, the setting, especially at the start, was spooky, what with the jack-o-lanterns &amp; the sprawling fog.  There was also the continuous brewing mystery among the 'old town officers' &amp; their knowledge/connection with the mysterious decapitations happening in Sleepy Hollow.  The twist of events will surely catch you off-guard.<p>Johnny Depp/Ichabod was a funny character.  He portrayed an investigator promoting his latest techniques/discoveries in the crime field.  But despite the profession he got himself into, he was not really a tough guy but more of a scaredy cat.  He made me laugh all through the movie.  It is rare that you see the lead character bringing the light/funny moments in a suspense/thriller movie.<p>Christina Ricci likwise played the role quite well.  However, I don't find their teaming up fitting perfectly well, though I can't point out exactly what was wrong in their chemistry.<p>Overall, I recommend viewers to watch the movie.

But Tim Burton films so much of this in dream-like foggy soft-focus that the presentation seems like a soft video transfer (however the sound is top notch!).

Depp's semi-comical performance as the  easily grossed-out and chicken Ichabod Crane is a relief (from his stint on  the weak Astronaut's Wife).Christina Ricci, who played Katrina, is just as  skilled; She still needs to drop her Wednesday- Addams Family dead pan  facial expressions, though. <p>The GC effects are to be admired. This is  one decapitation film where the camera never leaves the victims or does a  cut away like in older films when the horseman is decapitating them; the  viewer sees a clean decapitation from start to finish.

He really knows how to set the tone before the story even begins, using  gray palettes as his overlay to create a somber and foreboding gloom over  landscapes and people. The art direction and cinematography in this film is  amazing, not only for the creepy and ethereal scenery but coupled with  interesting camera angles and long, focused shots on dream-like images.  <p>This is a film for all ages, just as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; is,  and both films share the properties that make them great.<p>1)Johnny Depp.  This man has an incredibly mobile and almost comedic face, his expressions  endearing and farcical. Edward Scissorhands taught him a lot about putting  forth without uttering a single word because he had very few lines. He  relied more on his eyes than anything, and I have been impressed by his  talent for improvisation ever since. Ed Wood only secured that position. He  makes an impressive turn with his character here, playing the endearing,  faint-hearted Constable Ichabod Crane. His constant episodes of passing  out, turning up his nose at numerous corpses and consistent nervous  stutters make him a very enjoyable presence on-screen.<p>2)Child-like  fantasy. Ichabod's flashbacks about his mother include a sequence where she  twirls into the air, milkweed tuft floating around like a summer snowfall.  This is the beauty among the muck and blood in this film, and it captivates  viewers young and old who share a fascination with magic and mystery.  Burton may be a scholar in the area of gothic cinematics, but he has a  special and unmatchable ability for uplifting and mystical moments in his  films, a prime example in yet again &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, where  Winona Ryder twirls happily in circles while snowflakes fall slowly around  her, the choral music making the moment even more touching and  serene.<p>3)The special effects. I have to admit, this was a lot more  graphic than I expected, but it did the film justice. I loved all the blood  and the head-severing. If this is going to be classified as a horror film,  it has to have some of the winning traits that make it so. I am a horror  fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed the disgusting cadavers and consistent  decapitation. Burton doesn't have a history of graphic violence in his  films, but it worked out well for him in this one, combined with the  computer-animated Tree Of The Dead and restoration of the ghost's  skull.<p>And if this isn't enough to get you to watch this film, then watch  Edward Scissorhands first. That is a great starter film for anyone who  wants to get acclimated in the Burton film genre. If that movie doesn't  make you hungry to see this one, I don't know what will.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Everyone put in a great performance in this movie, Christopher Walkin (doesn't he ever play anything other than a psycho in the movies?).

Johnny Depp steals the movie as Ichabod Crane, in this version a New York City police constable with new-fangled and unwelcome investigative techniques who is exiled to Sleepy Hollow by an unhappy magistrate (Christopher Lee in a spot-on cameo).  Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow (authentically portrayed as a post-American Revolution farming community) to find a string of unsolved murders attributed to the headless but ambulatory corpse of a Hessian soldier.<br /><br />Crane finds also a town full of intrigues and mysterious goings-on, which he will patiently unravel with the help of Katrina Van Tassel (nicely played by Christina Ricci) who turns out to have secrets of her own. A solid supporting cast helps carry the movie.<br /><br />Burton lays on an escalating series of horrible murders, each with supernatural overtones, that challenge both the investigative techniques and the rational beliefs of Ichabod Crane.  Each such scene is nicely creepy without overindulging the gore.  As it turns out, a genuine horror has been unleashed in Sleepy Hollow.  The betrayal of the long-deal Hessian is at the heart of his current incarnation as a killer.  Ichabod will have to dealt with his own bitter experience with witchcraft in order to identify the guilty and save the innocent.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those looking for an entertaining and well-executed update of a classic fairly tale, featuring fine direction and excellent if sometimes campy acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING.

Herein, there be witches!<br /><br />Ichabod Crane {Johnny Depp} is a forensic investigator who, after being assigned to the case by Judge Burgomaster {Christopher Lee}, travels from New York to enchanted Sleepy Hollow, following up on some grisly murders where the victims were all beheaded.<br /><br />With his various devices, his logic is challenged as the superstitious villagers lend their perspective on the mysterious 'Headless Horseman', who appears from out of a magnifient skeletal tree, an entrance to Hell, as well as a direct confrontation. Some history is provided on how 'The Hessian Horseman' {Christopher Walken; a Vlad-like warrior} became the phantom figure, and meets love interest 'Katrina' {Christina Ricci}, who turns out to be a latent 'white witch', whose protective spells save him in the end.<br /><br />There is a very interesting twist at the finale, where it is revealed who the true puppeteer is, thus connecting the sub-plots.<br /><br />Marvellous camera angles, special effects which compliment the story instead of distracting, splendid darkly elegant visuals, a 'gothic' adventure, and a most intriguing version of this delighfully ghastly tale comprises this pleasing adaptation of Sleepy Hollow.<br /><br />Tim Burton continues to create marvellous de-facto Satanic productions {virtually ALL visuals, and most characterizations}, combined with Danny Elfman's ingenious orchestrations, makes for a truly powerful combination, both of which are frequent pleasures.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is one of my favorite short stories of all-time.  There is something about this American folk tale that captivates my mind and imagination.  I can remember watching the Disney animated version of the tale as a kid around Halloween time.  It was pure magic.  And later, while studying English literature in college, I returned to the stories of Washington Irving with an "adult" and critical eye.  Yet, despite the deadlines of college and the sheer mass of reading to accomplish, I always took special time out to enjoy Irving's work.  It can make you a kid again.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW delivered on all of my high expectations for the film.  While I am normally upset by films that depart from the stories they purport to represent, Burton has managed to capture the feel and appeal of the legend, while at the same time churning out an entertaining Hollywood picture.  In my opinion, almost no one does this better than Tim Burton and he deserves much credit for it.  Of course, true fans of the legend will be disappointed by Burton's take, but I think that once viewers have allowed themselves to live in Burton's world for a while (and not Irving's), SLEEPY HOLLOW can be a great deal of fun.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW is, from a visual perspective, absolutely stunning.  Burton transports us to early-American New England, complete with haunted mysts and plenty of gore.  The action sequences with the Headless Horseman are marvelous and rank among some of the finest action sequences I've seen lately.  Another thing that SLEEPY HOLLOW nails is its comedic sensibility.  Burton's films are usually quite good at maintaining a level of "fun" throughout their length and this picture is no exception.  There is plenty of comedy to lighten the mood of the picture and allow it to take itself less seriously.<br /><br />Overall, SLEEPY HOLLOW is just a great horror/macabre picture, the kind that only Burton is capable of pulling off.  So if you find a deal, buy this picture, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, and just let yourself go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's films, often praised for the intensity of their mood, bring with them a glimpse of the darker side of the human psyche.  His characters are often dis-jointed, dark, but at their core, always human.  Often, his films are as centrally located around an individual, quite often the title role of the story....such examples include the title characters of films like "Edward Scissorhands, Jack Skellington of "A Nightmare Before Christmas", and Bruce Wayne in "Batman".  It is his central character that the story seems to evolve around, and it is often seen from that perspective, providing the audience a narrative thread that they can relate to throughout the film.  The same is true of "Sleepy Hollow".<p>Loosely based on "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving, Burton's "Hollow" is seen from the perspective of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp (formerly seen in Burton's "Edward Scissorhands")), a New York detective/criminal investigator who is sent to the farming community of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of several of the local townsfolk.<p>Burton weaves elements of the original "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" into his story, while creating backstory to further develop all the characters, from the families in Sleepy Hollow, to Ichabod Crane, even to the Horseman himself, centralizing the narrative of this story around Crane's investigation into the murders.  While in Sleepy Hollow, Crane quickly learns of a conspiracy that seems to exist amongst the principals of the townfolk.  With the aid of Young Masbeth (Marc Pickering), whose father was murdered by the Horseman, and Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), Depp's love interest and daughter of the town's acting governor, Crane's investigation quickly leads him on a hunt that will take them to the very heart of evil, as they learn the fate of the Horseman, a Hessian Mercenary sent to fight in the American Revolution before falling to the sword when betrayed by two mysterious little girls many years before.<p>Filled with rich imagery, lavishly created special effects, and plenty of genuine frights, "Sleepy Hollow" promises to bring thrills, chills, and plenty of scares.  Moreover, though, the story uses horror to aid the story, not replace it.  Unlike so many horror movies released in the past ten years, Hollow does not rely on gore to create thrills, but instead, (as with most of Burton's work), it uses subtle mood, growing tension and human vulnerability to really bring the story home in a way that is both terrifying and immensely engaging.<p>Rated R for violence, gore and brief sexuality, this is not a film for the young.  However, for anyone looking for a good scare with a great story, this is the film for you.  (NOTE: This film is a departure from the original story by Irving.)</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>I used to love Tim Burton. Being a sf/fantasy/comics freak from childhood on, Burton was one of the few Hollywood filmmakers separate from the Lucas/Spielberg axis who was making stuff that I could always count on seeing with my non-film buff friends who were into the same sort of genre stuff I was. I loved "Edward Scissorhands", "Beetlejuice", and "Ed Wood", and always looked forward to what came next.<br /><br />But in the past decade or so he's disappointed more often than not. His "Planet of the Apes" remake was complete dreck, and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", while not terrible, didn't seem necessary or particularly necessary either. "Sweeney Todd" was a little bit better, but still didn't make me particularly worry about having missed a couple of his more recent works. I caught up to one of those recently though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified.<br /><br />"Sleepy Hollow", first of all, has very little to do with the Washington Irving story which it is "based on" according to the credits. "Inspired by" might be more accurate, and the film takes equal inspiration from the works of Edgar Allan Poe (specifically his prototypical detective character, Dupin) and Hammer horror films from the late 50s and early 60s - going so far as to cast Christopher Lee in a small role at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />The cast is certainly a big, big part of the fun here, with such wonderful character veterans as Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Martin Landau and Christopher Walken all getting juicy (if generally small) turns in this story of a New York police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), with "advanced" ideas being sent (more or less as punishment) to the small Hudson valley town of Sleepy Hollow to deal with a series of gruesome beheadings, in 1799. As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).<br /><br />It's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic. My only real problem with it comes in the ending, which is too much like a Scooby Doo "aha, I've got you now" episode; most of the film managed to keep me guessing at least a little bit but the finale is all too typical. Oh well; this is certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while, and there's even some interesting stuff below the surface - the whole colonial/witch-haunted/Protestant New England of the 17th-18th centuries brushing up against the coming of modern science and the Industrial Revolution and secularism is quite expertly handled, though it never gets in the way of a good old-fashioned story. Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd-favorite Burton film at the moment after "Ed Wood".<br /><br />The DVD transfer seems quite excellent; I haven't listened to the commentary yet (I often don't) and the other extras are of middling interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Sleepy Hollow is just a great looking movie that deserves a DVD play at least once a year in October. This is one of the ultimate Halloween movies. It features spooky sets, one of Danny Elfman's best music scores, enough gore to make Sweeney Todd proud and the visual touches of Tim Burton. The acting is good all around, with no one standing out from the crowd. I like Johnny Depp in this, but it's not one of his best performances. As a whole, Sleepy Hollow is my favorite flick from this director and it has been since I first saw it in theaters back in 1999.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>while i thoroughly enjoyed the opening hour of this tim burton / johnny depp collaboration, it loses all its energy in its secind half. as always, its visually interesting but the plotline falls back upon the revenge destroys cliche. it will be interesting to see just what this director & frequent muse wreak upon their upcoming project, the ULTIMATE revenge meditation: sondheims "sweeney todd".</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>Tim Burton really is an artist. Johnny Deep was perfect for the role of Ichabod Crane. The other cast are also perfect for their parts, especially Christopher Walken (in his second Tim Burton film) as the horseman. I also adore the gothic atmospher that Tim Burton puts into his best films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Tim Burton always has a distinctive style, except Planet of the Apes which could've been directed by anyone. So after a box office failure with Mars Attacks!, he returns to the more gothic dark flavor which can be seen in Batman and Beetlejuice. Plotwise, it's not the best but visually it hits its mark.<br /><br />It's a pretty common story but as usual, Tim takes a story and changes it a bit. Here we have Ichabod Crane, a New York constable with ideas about experimental medical gadgets, he gets assigned to a small town called Sleepy Hollow, where grisly murders have taken place. People have been found decapitated, their heads missing.<br /><br />Arriving in the town, he finds himself not being really welcomed by the townsfolk who tend to have big secrets. But soon, Ichabod starts to learn and try to solve who's behind the murderer: a former Hessian mercenary who came back from the grave as the Headless Horseman.<br /><br />Before I get into the look, I have to mention the plot. You know that segment in a movie where the villain explains the plot and puts all of its small details into order? Well this has it and you're still like wtf? One character goes "five victims and four graves" and we know one was a woman. You already know why there's 5 isn't there? And yet they actually spend some minutes on this?<br /><br />Now for the look of the film. Sure it's not some spectacular landscape images or beautiful gardens, but oddly enough it looks beautiful. However there is one scene where Ichabod's mom in a flashback spins around and the camera pans around them. Great shot. One thing that isn't really here is his distinctive sense of humor. There's scenes that he might find hysterical but you're a little huh? After a kid asks someone if they know of the Headless Horseman, a woman does that finger across the neck and he goes "that'd be him." Ooh, knee slappingly funny.<br /><br />Johnny Depp proves he's still one of the better actors this generation with his portrayal of Ichabod as someone who thinks he's buff and macho but deep down he's quite squeamish and awkward. However he was little to no chemistry with Christina Ricci. And hey look: a bunch of Sith Lords in one movie. We got Ian McDiarmid(Emperor in Star Wars), Ray Park(Headless Horseman in fight scenes but he's Darth Maul) and Christopher Lee(Count Dooku but here he's Ichabod's superior).<br /><br />The film is rather suspenseful but not scary, quite gory but not vomit inducing. It's the kind of film that when there's no action or great looking scenery, you want the action and fortunately this has it.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>THIS MOVIE HAS HAD SOME GREAT ACTING IN IT.I have seen some good movies in my time by Tim Burton.

This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&quot;  Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley.  Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography.  If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark.

He stayed true to the spirit of the original story in many  respects and kept you guessing and on your toes for a while... but the  movie languished and it was pretty flat when it was all over.<p>There is  one awesome scene, in which you see the headless horseman exiting his  hidden lair... seeing that just once almost makes the movie worth seeing  (almost).<p>I'm not sure what was missing, but something was. The film was  good at startling the audience in many places and the costumes and  backdrops were excellent... a feast for the eyes for this genre.  I can't  imagine ever seeing this film again, however... it just left too much to be  desired.  There were a few light, humorous moments that were sadly too few  and far between in the film.  After seeing a film by Burton like &quot;Ed  Wood,&quot; and knowing what he is capable of, this film was a  disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's latest effort, Sleepy Hollow, is a delight with one exception. We'll get to the exception later, because it's just a judgment call of his that I disagree with. He is one of my favorite directors, and here are some of his most wonderful creations: PeeWee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman and Batman Returns. Now add Sleepy Hollow to that list.<p>What makes Burton a great director is his style, which is unique to him. His is a childlike point of view, a dreamlike approach in which reality is hardly a consideration. His visions tend to balance delicately somewhere between dreams and nightmares - too humorous to be bad dreams, yet too full of dark images to be good ones. The upstate New York village of Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a quaint and almost inviting one. Still, the sun never shines, and the countryside is anything but inviting. <p>Into this world comes Ichabad Crane [Johnny Depp], a police detective from New York who believes in the scientific approach to solving mysteries. When he is sent to the village to investigate a series of gristly murders, in which the victims are found literally headless, he makes a list of people who might have motive. He scoffs at the villagers' claims that the killer is a Headless Horseman returned from the grave. Unraveling these crimes will also unravel Crane's nerves, as well as his belief in everything's having a rational explanation. <p>Depp, the great physical actor of our times, leads a cast of wonderful performers. Every role is memorable, especially his and Miranda Richardson's. Depp conveys more with his body language than he does with dialog, and he has been a favorite of mine for years. He he can make even a bad movie watchable, and he can make a good one great. You are probably less familiar with Richardson, an English actress who can portray virtually any character.<p>As in any Burton movie, the sets are fascinating. Everything is just a bit out of kilter and exaggerated. Even mundane items have a slightly spooky quality to them. These visual tricks serve the function of drawing the viewer into the movie. They become part of the story.<p>Now, about that judgment call. Sleepy Hollow is filled with enough many violent images to earn it an R rating. I wish they had been toned down. Had Burton chosen to do this, it would have allowed the movie to go out with no more than a PG-13 rating. This would have opened this otherwise delightful period piece to a broader audience. As it is now, I cannot recommend it for younger viewers. I am not, by the way, getting into the fray concerning the general level of violence in entertainment. My remarks are intended to be about this one particular picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>That and other cheery senitments are waiting to be found in director Tim Burtons' &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; an errie, stylish and smart slice modern horror.  Though &quot;Hollow&quot; may not be grab-your-seat-for-dear-life terrifying, the suspense is palpable and if you give the movie a chance, the tension and creepiness slowly seeps into your skin, and stays there.<p>Bouyed by Burton's unmistakeable visual storytelling style, the plot methodically plays out, leading Constable Ichabod Crane (Burton regular Johnny Depp), from his comfort zone of logical reasoning to far more uneasy territory:  A Headless Horseman loose in the small rural town of Sleepy Hollow cutting off heads almost at random...or is he?  Crane if baffled as to the reasons why, but he still finds time to develop a relationship between himself and a local noblewoman (Christina Ricci) while he investigates old grudges and conspiracies that lead to an unexpected, but senisble conclusion.<p>The cast here is outstanding, led by Depp, whom I am enjoying more with every new role I find him in.  His cautious Crane is a far cry from his turn as the flamboyant Jack Sparrow, but Depp is so achingly convincing you forget he ever donned eye-liner and a dingy three-cornered hat.  Ricci is effective, but next to Depp she is unfortunately dwarfed.  Chistopher Lee and Christoper Walken make brief appearances in the film, as a judege and the horsemen respectively.  Lee presides over his court with stately arrogance and Walken is devilishly deranged as the mad Horseman (When the horseman appears with his head of course).<p>Visually the film is wondrous.  The cinematography is breathtaking, giving a surreal gothic look to the film.  Sets are gorgeously designed from the dank town to some very creepy woods.  The film is also superbly edited, and the visual effects are just about seamless.  The horseman sequences are well-executed pieces of CGI (despite the occasional gore, one sees every head sliced off), and Crane's flashbacks to a troubled childhood are a feast for the eyes as well (albeit a bloody one).  But the gore cannot bring down a brilliantly crafted horror story, with a refreshing intelligence that puts most other horror films today to shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>As he did with Batman and Planet of the Apes (and is reportedly doing with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) Tim Burton has taken a classic story and placed his own unique stamp on it. The atmosphere and sets are classic Burton, especially the gnarled and nightmarish trees that surround and define an important part of the collective psyche of Sleepy Hollow.  <p>Johnny Depp (as Constable Ichabod Crane) displays his skill at portraying a character who is both humorous and earnest in this adaptation, applying Burton's concept of 19th century forensic equipment to the task of uncovering the origin of the mysterious circumstances that are causing people to lose their heads in the small village...literally. <p>For the most part, the supporting cast is also marvelous, from the voluptuous Christina Ricci to Miranda Richardson to Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid, just to name a few.  <p>The only person who seems miscast in this Burton fable is Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  Come on, Mr. Burton, just because you have given Walken pointy prosthetic teeth and the ability to ride his supernatural steed out of a gnarled old tree, are we supposed to be frightened?  The only thing frightening about Walken is his general lack of acting ability. Then again, Mr. Burton has always approached macabre subject matter with a dark sense of humor, so perhaps this casting is intended to be as tongue-in-cheek as the &quot;scientific instruments&quot; that Depp's Ichabod uses to practice his detective work. <p>If one went into the film not knowing that it was a Burton creation, one might come out of the film scratching one's head over the visual treatment of the story.  Since Burton has trained the viewer to expect a slightly exaggerated and off-beat style, however, the look and feel of the film should not come as a great surprise to anyone who is familiar with Burton's previous work.  In fact, for the most part, Burton shows great restraint in crafting most of the characters to be unusual, but not as over-the-top as, for example, his characters in Mars Attacks!<p>Best watched around Halloween, Sleepy Hollow is an entertaining ride through a &quot;nightmare&quot; with a distinctly Burton-esque feel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>Tim Burton is, in my opinion, one of our great visionary filmmakers, and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is yet another creative triumph. Inspired by the classic 19th century story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; by Washington Irving, this film depicts a United States that is just about to enter the &quot;modern&quot; age. Constable Ichabod Crane (a superb Johnny Depp) is sent to a rural New York village to investigate a series of murders--killings which the locals claim are the work of a supernatural fiend known as the Headless Horseman.<p>&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; works on may levels: as historical &quot;costume drama,&quot; as mystery-thriller, as love story, as fantasy, even as satire. The sets, costumes, make-up, special effects, and sumptuous Danny Elfman score blend marvelously to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and romantic. The filmmakers have assembled an amazing ensemble cast of veteran character actors to support Depp and the luminous Christina Ricci (as Crane's love interest). I was also impressed by Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth, a brave boy who becomes Crane's right-hand man.<p>Depp is excellent in his role, yet another in a series of oddball outsiders and weird &quot;prophets&quot; which he has played to perfection over the years. Depp's Crane is eccentric, comic, heroic, and very appealing.<p>I think it's healthy to be suspicious of attempts to make movies out of literary classics. But &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is an attempt that works. The changes that have been made (most notably, changing Ichabod Crane from a schoolteacher to a police investigator) make sense and are handled deftly by the screenwriters. The gruesome violence may be a bit much for some viewers, but I did not find the violence to be gratuitous; rather, it is well-integrated into the overall plot and atmosphere. Overall, an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent from NYC to Sleepy Hollow to investigate 3 grisly decapitation murders.

I like Johnny Depp. I like Tim Burton. I wanted to finally figure out who Casper Van Dien is. And, though he's uncredited (at least, until the end credits, that I noticed), I love Christopher Walken.  So why was I so underwhelmed with this movie? <p><p>Point 1: What made the  Blair Witch Project so effective? 1. Lack of musical score. 2. Lack of  musical score. 3. Lack of musical score. Is it me, or is Danny Elfman  starting to repeat himself these days? I could have sworn I'd heard a  number of parts of this soundtrack in other Burton flicks. (Point for the  devil's advocate-- this may be par for the course in Hollywood; if the  previews are anything like the film, you can expect The Green Mile to have  the same soundtrack as The Shawshank Redemption.) Pieces of it are just  plain overblown. Not the whole thing; there are times, as always, when  Elfman's music is creepily effective, but more often than not it gets loud,  melodramatic, and annoying. <p><p>Point 2: I have a thing against any movie  that requires someone to stand up, pace, and explain the whole thing at the  end. The idea of a good mystery is that enough clues are given you so that  you can figure it out for yourself, if you have the quickness of wit and  aren't being distracted by a theater full of crying children (which I was).  And make no mistake, the clues are there to be found. However, no context  is given them. At the end, when the clues are pieced together so you figure  all this out, the clues are flashed back on the screen. But in every case  save one, you see more in the flashbacks than you did in the actual scenes.  Not good, not good at all. <p><p>Point 3, and I'll admit this is a personal  preference: Christina Ricci doesn't sound right with an affected  new-world-British accent. Period. <p><p>Point 4, and it's even more  naggy-stupid-personal: they found the single ugliest child in the human  race to play Ichabod as a kid. Holy cow. He's out of one of those  nineteenth-century portraits where the kids' heads are five times too large  for their bodies and no one ever smiles. Now we know why-- they all had  teeth that look like his. Ugh. <p><p>Sure, there's good stuff to be said.  Walken, Walken, Walken, Johnny Depp, a fine cameo by Christopher Lee (with  two minutes of screen time, one wonders why he's in the opening credits),  Van Dien, and for that matter most of the villagers; the gore factor is  done with an eye to humor, and many of the film's laughs come at its  bloodiest moments; Burton's sense of the fantastic and silly is as  perfectly-honed as always. I just wish it had come off as a better mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>I own a few of Burton's films, and it's obvious he has no clear vision regarding the scope of his projects. Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, his version of Planet Of The Apes, The Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice are all basically small concepts forcibly stretched out into attempts at full movie scripts. So far the only film a value in a critical sense by him is Sweeney Todd... and that subject is basically hack material by now. I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else... no stand out acting, boring redundant Elfman soundtrack boys choir and all... "ooooo~ewwwww~oooooo~ahhhhhhh~haaaaaa~haaaaaa~oooooo"<br /><br />I doubt Burton has the capacity to conceive of anything of true substance having made countless films all revolving around cheap fluff material.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>There is so much right about "Sleepy Hollow" that it's unfortunate it goes awry.  Terrific Hammer style cinematography.  Jaw dropping Oscar winning art direction.  Rousing Danny Elfman score.  Expectably fine work by Johnny Depp as the bumbling Ichabod Crane.  Terrifying turn by Christopher Walken as the Headless Hessian.  Too bad all of this is in the service of a byzantine script that practically undoes all that's good about the film.  The plot that engulfs this film is so maddeningly confusing you want to throw something at the screen.  I hate movies where the writers think they are smarter than the audience.  Director Tim Burton stages some interesting set pieces and at times there are some genuinely scary moments.  Not enough, however, to save this film from the mundane.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Trash film usurps title. People that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new Mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to. This must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old German film.<br /><br />The filmmakers attempted to capture a cross between Nosferatu. It may have worked in 1920 however the film is to clear and sharp. It comes off looking more like a cross between a cartoon and a graphics ad.<br /><br />The actors outweighed the characters and looked like they were reading the script. I could swear that some were watching the teleprompter. And who's idea was it to cut up a three day old corps to get covered in blood that if was any, had lone ago coagulated? I could go on with quite a few examples. But you get the idea. This should be helpful even if you liked the movie.<br /><br />If you are driving by a place that rents this DVD, stay in the car!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>THIS STORY IS UNTHIKABLE WITHOUT THE PRESENTATION THE EFFIGY OF JOHNY DEPP WHO'S SO LIKABLE IN CONTRAST WITH THE HIGHT PERFORMANCE OF CHRISTOPHRT WALKEN THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD !

Though major - and sometimes crazy - liberties are taken with the original legend,  this movie surely delivers a rush of spooky delights, and Johnny Depp, in a  mannered and winning performances, is delightful.  The charging horses  through the fog of an impossibly scary/beautiful forest make your heart  pound, though the movie is not as memorable as some other Burton creations  (Nightmare/Christmas; Edward Scissorhands).  Definitely not for the faint  of heart, and certainly not for the youngsters -- the gore is in your face;  and given the storyline, there are many, many beheadings, all done with the  amplified sound effects of a sharp blade slashing through the base of one's  skull.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Yes, this is clearly a somewhat toned-down horror flick but, WOW! I haven't seen much to compare with this outstanding film, in any movie genre, for ages. While it's much shorter and a different sort of story, I think that this production stands equal in quality to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>, and that is a huge compliment.<br /><br />In fact, if you have previously enjoyed either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000797E7">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a> (which is the "white-knuckle" version of the most famous of all Sherlock Holmes entries), or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305609330">Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>, (the magnificent cinematography version), then you will clearly love "Sleepy Hollow."<br /><br />THE STORY: This yarn springboards from Washington Irving's compelling tale of terror, the companion work to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00221Q2TS">Rip Van Winkle</a> from this Classic American author's famous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0766184900">The Sketch Book</a>. In the case of the film, a youthful and naive New York City constable (Ichabod Crane) is directed north to a New England Dutch settlement where a series of murders has begun to generate chaos in the community -- the year is 1799, only about twenty years after the American Revolution. The first nuance of the murders which Ichabod encounters is that all the killings have been effected by decapitation. The locals are sold on the idea that the perpetrator is nothing short of a terrifying headless horseman (artfully played by a deranged-looking Christopher Walken), purportedly a ghost of a Hessian soldier, but Ichabod is a man of science and he initially asserts that the headless horseman yarn is ludicrous. But Ichabod's scientific approach quickly gives way to his tormented imagination... especially when subsequent murders ensue.<br /><br />This is a terrifying mystery thriller of the First Water, directed by Tim Burton. The screenwriting (Kevin Yagher) is incredibly compelling, the cinematography is magnificent, the locations (mostly in England) are magical, the filmscore compositions (Danny Elfman) are faultlessly appropriate, and the acting is superb. Johnny Depp as Ichabod (at least for the purpose of this particular film version) amounted to flawless casting. I was also very pleased to see the great Christopher Lee (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009TB5G">The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>), in this film however briefly it may have been.<br /><br />Viewers should prepare for a long sitting as the running time is 105 minutes -- but there is never any drag and the action is both tasteful (for the genre) and non-stop. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, a presentation of enhanced widescreen (16:9).<br /><br />In summary, this Oscar-winning 1999 film is one that you won't want to pass by. I was not in the least surprised to discover that it was produced by the renowned and talented Francis Ford Coppola, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286S38">Dementia 13</a>.) The film is rated R due to one mild and brief sexual scene as well as for the violence and the gore of the numerous heads which bounce wide-eyed along the ground after they are separated by sword and by axe from their terror-stricken hosts. I'm normally not a big fan of contemporary movies but, in this rare instance, I award "Sleepy Hollow" my most enthusiastic and very highest five-star recommendation.<br /><br />REVISION: (4/10) If you loved this film as much as I did you'll likely also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>This Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci borrows characters and the setting from Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but otherwise bears no resemblance to the story. Although I am usually unhappy when Hollywood drastically alters a classic, I was happily surprised with this film.<br /><br />Depp plays Ichabod Crane, a New York City police detective rather than Irving's schoolmaster. The time is 1799. Crane is despised by the New York authorities because he uses scientific methods to solve crimes as opposed to the old-fashioned methods of beatings and torture. To get him out of their hair, he is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate three grisly murders. All of the victims have been decapitated.<br /><br />The film is very atmospheric and you get the feeling of gloom that sets in during the late fall after all the leaves have fallen from the trees, the days are short and dark, and winter will soon arrive. The Oscar nomination for best cinematography is well earned.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is not for young children or sensitive viewers as there is a lot of blood and gore, but everyone else should enjoy this film - especially if viewed in late October or early November and of course at night.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>It's been ten years since this cool Johnny Depp film came to play and it's still as fun and as comedic as they come.<br /><br />Loosely based on the Washington Irving tale, Tim Burton wanted to make a story that woudl be a horror tale, great texture and capturing some 18th century wildness.<br /><br />Oddly, this story reminded me of Columbo, kind of like an 18th century Columbo.  Similar in a lot of ways with the conspiracy theories, the four Sleepy Hollow conspirators, and the fact that Icabod's scientific know-how falls prey to an actual horror, the headless horseman.<br /><br />The Danny Elfman score adds to the mystery of the horseman.  Rated "R" most likely because of all the heads being lopped off, quite cleanly I might add.<br /><br />The detective mystery aspect is fascinating since I did not see that ending coming.  Christina Ricci plays a naive girl who dabbles in witchcraft and Icabod faints at the sight of spiders and corpses.<br /><br />Great flick for a Halloween night.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool extras, such as an interview with the cast and crew and you really get into Burton's head and see what he was all about, plus film trailers and such.<br /><br />Uncredited appearance by Martin Landau in the beginning of the film, and a short but masterful rendition of a court judge by Christopher Lee.<br /><br />To add, the photography was the best.  The deep, muted colors throughout the film gave it a moody, depressing look.  After the evil is banished at the end, all is bright and autumn red colors.  Yeah, a bit corny but interesting play of color and light.<br /><br />Other Burton Films Recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J074">Beetlejuice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWDI">Edward Scissorhands [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>The first thing to keep in mind about this wonderfully macabre Halloween horror flick is that the plot has very little to do with Washington Irving's original story, in which Ichabod Crane was a schoolmaster, not a New York City detective sent upstate to solve a series of murders. Having said that, though, Tim Burton's film is a beautifully scary piece of work. (He has said he deliberately included a lot of the feel of Disney's 1949 animated version.) I love Johnny Depp's slightly histrionic, over-the-top performance as the neurotic Constable Crane -- and the wild-eyed Christopher Walken is perfect as the Hessian swordsman with teeth filed to points. I don't think Christina Ricci is all that attractive so I don't find her a convincing love interest, but whatever. Among the excellent supporting cast, Ian McDiarmid ("Senator Palpatine") and Miranda Richardson are especially good, and Christopher Lee even has a small part. The cinematography is dark and stormy, the trees are gnarled, and Danny Elfman's score is quintessentially spooky.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Depp did a string of adaptations in the late 90's early 00's, 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'From Hell' to name a few.  I hadn't until the other night seen this film, but I had heard mixed reviews regardless.  It's by no means a wonderful film, but its stylish take on the classic tale is a bit intriguing.  Depp plays Crane, a detective sent to unravel the mystery behind recent beheadings in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk all know it's the work of the headless horseman, but Crane isn't convinced.<br /><br />Depp plays his character as only Depp could, with that awkward feeling permeating every move that makes his characters appear more natural than rehearsed.  Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's mysterious love interest, does a decent job as well, carrying her weight in a Depp driven project, but its Burton who really steals the show.  Tim is one of our finest directors, and as was mentioned, he is over-the-top, but that's what makes him so enjoyable.  There's no subtlety, and like with most of Burton's masterpieces it is layered with humor which adds to the atmosphere only Burton can paint.<br /><br />I didn't find this to be a scary film, not in the least, but it was an interesting film with enough entertaining value to keep the viewer watching time and time again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Ever more interested in visual stylizations than story or pacing, Tim Burton is in good form for the first half of "Sleepy Hollow," which "borrows" liberally from the Hammer films that starred more than a few actors in this cast.  Here, talented Johnny Depp brings to life a different Ichabod Crane than the schoolteacher imagined by Washington Irving -- more Poe's Dupin, he is an anachronistic detective seeking scientific plausibility in his investigation of gruesome murders.  That "Sleepy Hollow" manages to evoke memories of Saturday afternoon monster thrillers is its biggest strength; rapid descent into talky romantic pablum and hocus pocus is its undoing, as the sparks between Depp and the dour but childlike Christina Ricci misfire, and the denouement is surprisingly tensionless.  Students of literature will find little of the short story upon which the film is loosely based except character names, but fans of everything from "The Brides of Dracula" to the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes thrillers will get visual treats.  The climax in a windmill -- despite the tiresome need for rather illogical pyrotechnics -- is right out of a horror movie (and, perhaps, Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent.")  Though the bloodletting is rather, well, bloodless, the violence in the film is amped up enough psychologically to make the film non-kid friendly, and Burton can't resist his predictable need to shock by turning, in this case, a rather pleasant bedtime moment into a family's massacre.  It's really worth about three and a half stars, but with Amazon's system, I'll round up to four because of the appearances of so many great character actors -- look for them yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I liked this movie because it had a dark, gothic atmosphere. The whole movie draws you into a cold autumn town being stalked by the headless horseman. The movie had great gore and bloodshed in it The butchery is beautiful. It has a very good story line that was way more developed than the original headless horseman story. This is a great Halloween movie. Great sound, great picture</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>The only beef I had with this movie is that Christopher Walken had such a brief part, that and we didn't get the opportunity to hear him speak. Other than that short complaint, the movie was superb. After watching Tim Burton's the nightmare before christmas and Monkey bones, I had expected a rather lighthearted jaunt through the dark and musty woods of Tim Burton's imagination. What I recieved was a thrill ride down a very spooky trail of terror, Not to mention humor. Johnny Depp made a very good wuss. Hah.<br /><br />I'm not picking on him, he's cool its just he wasn't quite what I expected. Someone more along the lines of Jack Sparrow I suppose. Come to think of it, I guess he really was like Jack Sparrow......<br /><br />Anyhow, back to the film at hand. The movie starts off with a bang, ending with just as much energy and gore that threaded its way throughout the movie. Not for the weak stomached as Johnny Depp made quite clear as the movie advanced. It grew rather difficult to pick out where the diabolical left off and the realism began, Tim Burton made them so much of the same that one would almost believe we truly live in a world infested with enraged Hessian's and bleeding trees. That was nice touch. Hmmm.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Stylish, visually excellent, and a total  entertainment  treat, both aurally and visually.<br /><br />For a comprehensive experience, I would recommend reading the original tale by Washington Irving. The amazing thing about this re-telling of the story, is that although it is an original script, all of the threads of that great story are present in the film. Which is part of the reason, I feel, that this film works so very well.<br /><br />After watching the film, you get a definite feeling of a wide open space, but listen to the commentary, and find out just what the crew had to do to create the illusion that is there in the film. Depp is in great form , as his chameleon like  ability to change for roles is expressed, and he incorporates his version of Roddy McDowell ( in a sort of tribute I think), together with the Ichabod Crane character ( and Ichabod apparently means "The Glory is Gone"... so kind of interesting there). Depp hones that nit-picking, detail  orinted, and partially jittery character that seems to be expressed by Roddy, and uses it well in the films course.<br /><br />Surrounded by a cast which is brilliant as well as totally supportive, you can see the best of the best in this group; all the main support characters appear in films regularly, and the very avuncular Patriarch of the family whose daughter is Christina Ricci's  character, is joined by the Notary, the Doctor, The Priest, The Magistrate, and etc., as well as the pre-eminent Brom, and the mysterious second wife of the Patriarch.<br /><br />The film is well paced, from the start where the Elder of the Village is attacked, through the introduction of Depp's character, with the all too brief appearance of Christopher Lee, the cast draw out an amazing series of performances.<br /><br />The unravelling of the threads of deceit and conspiracy make for a well crafted  tale. And Christopher  Walken's role as the body and head of the Horseman is truly masterful.<br /><br />An Excellent  film.<br /><br />ENJOY.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Secret Window) stars as Ichabod Crane who is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate murders in which the victims head is cut clean off. The town tells of a headless horseman who searches the town for his head so that's why he takes people's heads for himself..to find his. Soon Depp digs deep into the towns past secrets about the headless horseman, Ray Park (plays the horseman without its head and starred in Stars Wars Episode 1 The Pahntom Menace and X-Men). Back in one of the wars the  evil horseman, Christopher Walken (plays the horseman with his head on and starred in Catch Me If You Can and The Prophecy) , is killed and his head is cut off. Depp also in the process falls in love with the beautiful Christina Ricci (Addams Family Values, Pumpkin). Also Depp has flashbacks to the murder of his mother with a very memorable scene where his mother pops out and blood flies out with her. Not a scary movie but it's a pretty entertaining flick and Tim Burton is at the top of his form trying to figure out clever ways to chop heads off. Also starring Miranda Richardson (The Crying Game, Spider), Ian McDiarmid (everysingle Star Wars movie), Christopher Lee (Lord OF The Trings Trilogy, Gremlins 2) and Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers, Modern Vampires). Depp is hilariously brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Johnny Depp is an exceptional performer. Look at all the movies he has done. He is one of the best Chameleons I have ever seen. He throws himself totally into his roles. Sleepy Hollow is no exception. I love this modification of the original story. Making Ichabod Crane a detective rather than a teacher was brilliant. When he comes from the city to investigate a Sleepy Hollow decapitation, he finds that there is much more to the crime than what meets the eye. The support cast is great and some well known names are amongst them. Tim Burton did a wonderful job of making the atmosphere beautiful and frightful.<br /><br />Christopher Walken is magnificent as the Hessian that is now headless. Walken is another Chameleon that can marvel you with his stylish bravado. He plays the blood thirsty Hessian mercenary to the hilt.  The special effects are incredible including the seamless transitions of the horse and rider entering and exiting a tree. A very dark and spooky rendition compared to the previous versions of Sleepy Hollow. The DVD quality is wonderfully sharp and crisp. This DVD includes a featurette "Behind the Legend". The are numerous extras that make this the best Halloween movie I have.</p></br></body></html>

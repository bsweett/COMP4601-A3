The focus point of the film revolves around real life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina played by the wonderful Don Cheadle. Paul is put under a huge amount of stress when hundreds of Rwandans, namely those of the Tutsi tribe flock to his hotel for refuge. Instead of just putting together film from one point of view, writers Keir Pearson and Terry George wrote the film from all angles. Through out the film it is explained why the Hotu tribe has revolted against the Tutsis through radio broadcasts. It does not justify their actions but it certainly explained why their hatred for the Tutsi people. Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina was absolutely amazing with his subtle performance as the protanganist of the film. Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana was equally wonderful. There were time during the film when I felt that I was watching a documentary than a film based on a true life event. My heart was breaking through out the film as the body count rose from the massacres and Paul's reaction to the deaths of the locals. I loved this film because it did not preach or blame anyone for the atrocities, not to mention being biased. It simply told what happened without sounding preachy. What Paul Rusesabagina did took a lot of courage for saving over a thousand people and despite the countless deaths, he managed to remain calm and collected although he was pushed near the edge at the time. In my opinion, "Hotel Rwanda" should have won for best picture at this past Oscars. This film gives me faith that there are films out there that can entertain and move the viewer at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle was excellent in this movie!<br /><br />This movie diserved the awards it received,<br /><br />rent it today, and see for yourself!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Rwanda is a beautiful country with four neighboring countries Tanzania (east), Congo (west), Burundi (south), and Uganda (north).  This country is located in the middle of Africa, which has flourishing green forests and hills.  The Canadian Lieutenant General Rom&eacute;o Dallaire who was assigned as commander of the United Nations troops in Rwanda called it heaven on earth before the three dreadful months in 1994 when nearly a million people where murdered and maimed.  Hotel Rwanda illustrates one man's struggle for survival while trying to save as many as possible, as his nation turned into hell on earth, a hell that the Western World could have prevented, but decided to ignore, as it probably did not seem important or profitable.<br /><br />A sad issue with the Rwanda genocide is the Western World's decision not to exercise previously learned knowledge from what happen at the Evian Conference of 1938 when the Western World closed its borders to German-Jewish refugees.  This was a decision that cost more than six million Jews their lives, as it indirectly gave Hitler the notion that the world did not care for what happened to the Jews in Germany.  A recent documentary, Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Rom&eacute;o Dallaire (2004), could help shed some extra light on how the world disregarded the events in Rwanda, as it depicts Dallaire's attempts to get help and his own perspective on his situation in Rwanda.  A situation where Dallaire was left in Rwanda with a mere 300 soldiers for an assignment required at least 5000 soldiers, as he helplessly could hear and see victims being butchered that were left to rot on the streets.<br /><br />A question rises when one hears about this dreadful story.  Why did people not pay more attention to the murders in Rwanda?  Several notions come to mind such as the war in former Yugoslavia and the people's fascination with O.J. Simpson's glove size.  These news stories took up more coverage time on the news than Rwanda, as almost a million lives were scuffed into the slots to fill time in between news and commercials.<br /><br />A black screen opens Hotel Rwanda, as the audience can see the opening credits and hear radio broadcasts from different radio stations.  Through these radio broadcasts the audience quickly learns where the Western World is focusing its attention, the war in the former Yugoslavia.  Another broadcast provides more in-depth information on how the radio helped spread lies that fed the hatred and anger against the minority group Tutsi.  These broadcasts where frequent, but no one tried to prevent them.  In the documentary of Dallaire the audience can learn that the Catholic Church could have helped lessen the effect of these radio broadcasts, but did not try to spread the word on a wide-ranging level.  It was simply ignored, as many thought that these Hutu extremists were simply crazy, as they ran around in their colorful outfits screaming prejudicial statements against the Tutsi.<br /><br />Amidst the anger and hatred a luxurious hotel, the four-star Hotel Des Milles Collines, functions as an oasis of delight.  The Des Milles Collines has a skillfully diplomatic manager by the name Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who knows what to say, what gift to offer, and how to make people feel good at all times.  The work at the hotel takes up a lot of Paul's time, as he frequently finds himself missing out on vital information in regards to what goes on in the nation.  Nonetheless, he is grooming important relationships with key characters in the Rwandan government, which later will be of much use for him.<br /><br />In a meeting between the Hutu president of Rwanda and the Tutsi rebel leader arranged by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), whose real name is Rom&eacute;o Dallaire, both parties sign a peace treaty.  This was a treaty that many welcomed, as many believed that it would bring peace and calm to Rwanda.  However, shortly after the signing of the peace treaty, the President's plane is shot down.  The Hutu extremist's radio broadcast blames the Tutsi, which begins a three month long slaughter of the Tutsi.<br /><br />Paul finds himself in a predicament, as his wife and many of his neighbor's are Tutsi.  He makes the decision to help save them by bringing them to the Des Milles Collines through bribes and diplomatic poise with brutish soldiers.  It leads into an eye-opening beginning for Paul while many of his preconceived notions begin to break, as the truth leaks out.  In a strong scene between Paul and Colonel Oliver, Colonel Olivier describes for him how little this nation is worth to the Western World.  As a member of the enlightened and educated Western World, this scene will induce shame and guilt, as what Colonel Olivier states is the same thing the audience can learn from Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Rom&eacute;o Dallaire (2004) where Dallaire explains how little he could do as he was ordered to do nothing.<br /><br />In a seemingly hopeless situation Paul uses his diplomacy in order to maximize the chance for survival, as he and others can bear witness to the madness outside the hotel's walls.  Poignantly genuine is the character that Don Cheadle presents, as he depicts a very humane person who realizes that he must use his powers to survive while trying to save as many as he can.  However, his performance also brings gut wrenching scenes where he stands strong in moments of immediate danger while also displaying moments of true emotions such as fear, happiness, melancholy, and despair.  The film's success rests within Cheadle's brilliant performance, which is highlighted by the talented cast that surrounds him such as Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Hakeem Kae-Kazim among many others.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda provides a great opportunity for the world to experience the misery and fear that the Tutsi of Rwanda were subjected to during their persecution.  It could not be considered a wonderful film due to its grotesque nature, but it is an important film that should be seen.  The director, writer, and producer Terry George who previously has written screenplays for films such as In the Name of the Father (1993) and The Boxer (1997) displays his skill to tell the truth without shocking or displaying an overwhelming levels of the gruesome crimes that were committed in Rwanda during the spring of 1994.  Instead, he offers the Western World a moral lesson that should not be forgotten, as he leaves the audience with the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his selfless effort to save 1200 people.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The film is one of the most gritty, intense,factual dramas in the past few years.  The Rwanda Crisis in 1994 was a horrific atrocity, but it must be made known to the world. Many people don't know about politics and Africa and other troubled nations throughout the globe.  It would have been easy for the crew to give a one-sided tale about the horror of war and fill a 90 minute picture with nothing but blood and guts. It would have been easy to "shame the world" by painting a picture of a negligent international community who has larger concerns than the Rwandan people.<br /><br />But the crew of this film put together a film that will resonate for many years. It involved politics, culture, family, religion, race, and many other questions of ethics. It told the WHOLE story from all perspectives and made you see the HUMANITY.<br /><br />This film is a must see for anyone who claims oppression or has an interest in international affairs. It was almost like watching a documentary. This was a real event, with real people, and real consequences. If more people knew about these atrocities maybe something could be done.<br /><br />While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>so brilliantly and unforgettably acted, it leaves one totally breathless and completely moved as well as drained! do not dare let this awesome film pass you buy-it is an instant classic with the always great don cheadle delivering still another great performance.  WOW!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>After seeing HOTEL RWANDA in a local theater a few months ago, I knew I had seen something powerful and memorable. But there is one little germ of doubt that persists in my mind about director and co-writer Terry George's approach to dealing with the tragic events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994. In telling the heroic story of hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle)---an ordinary Hutu man who eventually ended up saving the lives of many Tutsis---I wonder if George perhaps took the easy way out. Let me explain.<br /><br />George clearly has something to say with this film. Not only is he, like Rusesabagina, horrified by the genocide that was allowed to Tutsis in Rwanda; he is also disturbed by what he sees as American reluctance to seriously intervene in a situation that simply screams of human rights violations. It is an anger that infuses much of HOTEL RWANDA; it is what gives the movie much of its emotional punch. I wonder, though, if George fundamentally miscalculated by telling Rusesabagina's story and trying to make an uplifting movie, rather than telling another, more tragic story. It seems a bit too easy to tell yet another crowd-pleasing "triumph of the human spirit" story when such a massive tragedy perhaps cries out for a rawer approach. Perhaps the anguish at the heart of George's film might have been much more powerful, both emotionally and intellectually, if he had told a sadder, more humbling story that---for lack of more eloquent terms---really rubbed your face in the madness that overtook Rwanda in 1994, and the agonizing indifference of foreign troops to this massive human tragedy (an indifference that, some might argue, we are witnessing once again with many foreign nations' reluctance to directly intervene in the Darfur situation today). In short, I think HOTEL RWANDA suffers just a little bit from what I can only attribute to Terry George's divided intentions: he wants to tell an uplifting, "triumph of the human spirit" story---one that echoes Oskar Schindler's heroism in Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST---but also wants to ask serious questions about whether we did enough to prevent the Rwandan genocide from getting out of control. And, by doing the former, he perhaps stunts the latter, to some extent.<br /><br />Still, George does tell a powerful story in HOTEL RWANDA, and the film, as a whole, is undeniably compelling and moving. The fact that the film raises such relevant issues at all is to be admired.<br /><br />And Don Cheadle is to be admired, too. The character of Paul Rusesabagina is, almost unbelievably, Cheadle's first lead role, and he comes through with an amazing performance. The desperation Rusesabagina feels as he tries to negotiate for the lives of the Tutsi refugees (including his Tutsi wife, played by Sophie Okenedo), the horror he feels when he sees a street littered with corpses---all this comes through authentically in Cheadle's performance. In fact, I think Cheadle may have come up with the most viscerally powerful scene from the movies last year. It comes right after he sees that corpse-strewn street. Paul is back at his hotel, in his room. He tries to tie his tie, but he is so unnerved by what he has just seen that he never seems able to get it right. Finally, emotion so overtakes him that he throws down his tie in anger and breaks down right next to his bedroom door. The sheer raw emotion of Cheadle's wordless action in that scene is something that I certainly have not forgotten since seeing it; if Jamie Foxx had not so awed people with his interpretation of Ray Charles in RAY, Cheadle might have copped a well-deserved Oscar on that scene alone. (As impressive as Foxx undoubtedly was in RAY, not even he, in one of the final scenes set at a drug rehab center, came up with something as powerful---and as real---as Cheadle's quiet explosion in HOTEL RWANDA.)<br /><br />Despite my reservation about Terry George's rather timid (and occasionally heavy-handed) approach to dealing with the Rwandan genocide, HOTEL RWANDA is worth seeing not only for the troubling issues it raises, but also for Cheadle's great lead performance. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is a powerful movie about a turbulent time that was ignored by the west whilst it occurred. It has some poignant and powerful performances, with Cheadle really shining. It is quite hard hitting and not easy (emotionally) to watch in places, but it keeps you hooked and engrossed the whole time. It has even more impact when you realise this is based on a true story. This is a fantastic film and one I highly recommend. Well worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The year is 1994. The country of Rwanda is experiencing the beginning of a brutal civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsi. When the notorious Rwandan Genocide has commenced, a hotel manager named Paul Rusesabagina (played brilliantly by Don Cheadle) provides shelter for his own family and friends, as well as a thousand refugees who are trying to protecting themselves from harm. At this time, Paul does all he can to protect everyone from fear, famine, and the militia.<br /><br />Since this is based on a true story, you already know that it's going to be brutally disturbing. Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful film that touches on hate, violence, and political corruption. It also focuses on family matters and, to some extent, the American media. Those who have weak stomachs will have to be warned: this is a completely solemn piece of work that's grounded in hard-hitting realism. It's not as violent as Schindler's List or Full Metal Jacket, but it's the drama and realism that makes it so gut-wrenching. And it's not only the drama that makes this film so endearing: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix give very convincing performances.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is an excellent and unforgettable film that is quite effective due to the story being true. It's strong, it's unsettling, it's humorless, but most of all, it's important. This is easily one of the best films of 2004, and one of the best of the 2000's.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Back in the mid-1990s, if you lived in the Western Hemisphere--or in Europe--there's a good chance you knew nothing of the genocide taking place in Rwanda on the African continent.  (I'm guilty as charged, and pride myself on allegedly being "well informed.")  Which is what makes the award-winning film HOTEL RWANDA all the more compelling, as it tells a heart-wrenching story about one man's humble heroics to save over 1,200 souls in the face of utter brutality.  Based on a true story, Don Cheadle gives an unforgettable performance as Paul Rusesabagina, an assistant manager at the five-star Hotel Milles Colliness in Kigali, Rwanda; when the dominant Hutu tribe (of which Paul is a member) begins a bloodthirsty genocide of the minority Tutsi tribe (of which Paul's wife, and accordingly his children, are members), Paul gives refuge to his extended family and acquaintances at the hotel, using nothing but his wits to stave off brutal armed militias bent on total slaughter.<br /><br />Through Cheadle's performance we come to know Paul as a man with feet of clay who makes more than his fair share of mistakes, yet his intentions are always nothing but honorable and humane.  By his leadership and example he keeps the hotel staff working, his Tutsi guests insulated from the carnage outside, and his other guests safe.  Eventually Paul reaches his breaking point, but it's not until he has overseen the safe transport of his charges via UN trucks out of the country; when he fails to truly acknowledge or understand what he's accomplished is exactly when the viewer will stand up and cheer.<br /><br />Other noteworthy performances include Sophie Okonedo as Tatiana, Paul's wife; Nick Nolte as an embittered, frustrated colonel serving in the UN Peace Keeping Force; and Joaquin Phoenix in a small, yet powerful role as a photojournalist on a mission to tell the world about Rwanda's savage civil war.  Speaking of savagery, the violence is more implied than it is portrayed, which in my book makes it all the more terrifying--and Paul's heroics all the more compelling.  HOTEL RWANDA is a lasting tribute to the indomitable human spirit.  Enthusiastically recommended.<br />--D.

And a lesser tragedy is that Don Cheadle did not win the Best Actor Oscar!  How could they not award him the oscar for this magnificent performance?!  To give it to Jamie Foxx for doing a two-hour impression is ludicrous.<br /><br />This movie is a monumental account of what happened in Rwanda that the whole western world turned their face away from.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Hotel Rwanda" isn't about entertainment, but rather about past mistakes and lessons that the International Community must learn from them. Unfortunately, the price of some mistakes is too high...<br /><br />In the case of the Rwandan genocide, the price of non-intervention was a million Tutsi victims, murdered by Hutus in 1994, while the International Community did nothing even though the UN had troops there. As one Colonel of the UN's forces (Nick Nolte) in the film said, "We are here as peacekeepers, not as peacemakers". Foreigners who happened to be in Rwanda could leave the country, whereas the Tutsis were left to die. That was quite ironic, actually, if we take into account that the division of the people in Rwanda between Hutus and Tutsi wasn't natural, but rather imposed by their European colonisers.<br /><br />Rwanda was, at the time these events happened, a place where unlikely heroes were all that was left. One of them was Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), assistant hotel manager of a four-stars hotel and Hutu. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo)was Tutsi, though, and his children were considered Tutsis too. ... When mayhem began and Paul was left in charge of the hotel, he stepped up and started to hide there other Tutsis that had nowhere to go. "Hotel Rwanda" allows viewers to understand how difficult it was for Paul Rusesabagina to stay alive, and protect the people he took under his wing in a time when many armed Hutus wanted to kill the "cockroaches" (as they called the Tutsis).<br /><br />Watching this movie is quite striking, as it is based on a true story. Paul Rusesabagina exists, and he ultimately managed to save more than 1200 people from certain death, taking them to a safe haven. His arms were bribes, contacts, and calls he and the other "guests" of the hotel made to acquaintances living abroad, telling them what was happening ("We must shame them into sending help").<br /><br />You can learn about all that in this outstanding movie, directed by Terry George. Moreover, you can watch the real protagonists of this story in two of the DVD's bonus features, "A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda" and "Return to Rwanda", and know what really happened, in their own words.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this film. Too often, when we read about massacres like this in books, they seem abstract, something that doesn't necessarily affect us. That isn't true, but what is going to make us realize that?. "Hotel Rwanda" can do it, and I think that is a reason more than good enough  to watch this film.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family came to see the movie and he received a five minute standing ovation.

A genocidal tribal civil war, the bloodiest in a generation was reported poorly or ignored completely by the establishment western media.<br /><br />  There are award deserving performances all over the place. Nick Nolte for one playing an overwhelmed UN peaceleeper, Col. Oliver. Another is Tatiana, Paul's wife, played wonderfully by Sophie Okonedo & of course, Mr. Cheadle.<br /><br />  The movie plays out like a game, a serious, deadly, bloody game where the accident of being born to the wrong tribe could get you hacked to death. Paul has crushing responsibilities thrust upon him. He must protect his wife & family as well as his Tutsis employees & over a thousand Tutsis refugees who have no where else to go except the gated protection of the hotel.<br /><br />  A skillful use of his contacts, bribes, blackmail & personal charm are used. He saved 1,200 people from certain death.<br /><br />  I don't like to give ***** very often.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people through the attempts of one man to save a few from death by machete.  It is not an effort to tell the whole story of the Rwandan tragedy, nor is it an attempt to shove our faces into the horror of what happened in those months of 1994.  The protagonist is a simple hotel manager, a real person whose name is Paul Rusesabagina.  He is an intelligent and resourceful man working at a four star hotel in Kigali.  He knows how to use petty bribes to grease the wheels in order to get things done in this small and corrupt country.  He is a Hutu and a member of the majority, but his wife and therefore his children are Tutsis and are part of the resented minority.<br /><br />The movie doesn't spend much time explaining the dynamics of this situation except to point out that these distinctions are purely arbitrary and were created by the Belgians.  There are rumblings on the radio and in the streets that a slaughter of the Tutsis is going to happen, but Paul does not believe them.  The events erupt when the President of Rwanda dies in a plane crash and the agitators blame it on Tutsi rebels.<br /><br />Paul has no intention of saving anyone beyond his family when this all begins.  However, as it hits closer to home he makes noble choices and uses his skills in bluffing and bribery to keep his family and the ever growing band of refugees at the hotel alive.  It is poignant how these people are abandoned to the mobs by the West, but also significant how their private campaigns to their well connected friends in other countries buys them time.<br /><br />And the difficulty of working with those in the killing machine outside is not all there is, there are also those Hutus on staff that resent the Tutsis and buy into the lies urging them to exterminate the cockroaches.  It is an awfully precarious situation that Paul is trying to keep from tipping into extinction.<br /><br />The movie does show a few stark images without getting horribly graphic.  Don Cheadle gives a wonderful performance and deserves his Oscar? nomination and probably should have one the award for this performance.<br /><br />I think this is a movie that everyone should see and think about, especially with mature young people who need to know what happened not so long ago.  Then we need to think about what is going on right now in the Sudan and write our representatives about what we think should be done to help end that horror.  After all, that is really the point of this movie.  We can stay uninvolved because it happens so far away, but it sparks our conscience to ask us if we should.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I've read a lot about the genocide in Rwanda.  I picture scenes of despair, murder, and dismemberment.  All I have to do is hear the word "Rwanda" and I am filled with sadness at the thought of the brutality of human beings.<br /><br />I therefore looked forward to seeing Hotel Rwanda.  Don Cheadle had even been nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.  I wanted the world to know of the horror that took place just ten years ago.  And I hoped that somehow, this knowledge might change something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not that film.  I was disappointed.  However, I am not the filmmaker.  And I wasn't the one making the decisions.  This is not the story of the genocide.  It is simply the true story of one courageous man who helped save more than a thousand people.  And, for this reason it is a fine film because I know it was viewed by millions of people, some of whom had never even heard of the country itself.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is superb in the lead role.  He manages his luxury hotel with sophisticated understanding of human nature and the power of bribes and flattery.  This is the time of the Hutu uprising and, as he is a Hutu, he is safe.  But his wife is Tutsi and she and their children are at risk.  How he saves them, as well as all the other people, is a story of courage.  He's a fine actor, and he shows complex emotions.  I was always aware of the terror he felt underneath all his outward calm, and I, too, feared for his family.<br /><br />Nick Nolte is cast as the powerless U.N. official.  His performance was fine, as usual.  It's obvious though that he's had some plastic surgery.  It makes his face look smoother but I miss his cragginess and range of expression.<br /><br />This was not a perfect film.  It was too long.  It somehow simplified the horror.  And it never dealt with the fact that after the Hutus had done their murdering, the Tutsis came back and murdered some more.  However, I applaud the fact that it was made at all.  And I also came away with a real appreciation of Don Cheadle's acting skill.<br /><br />Recommended.  It's a true story.  And a lesson in History.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I got to watch this film recently&it truly just got at me very early on.it was said seeing what Power&force can do to a whole place.the Brutality&Loss of Lives was so Emotional.Don Cheadle was Great. he is One of the Most slept on Actors in the Business&after this Performance He won't be denied any longer.the whole Cast was truly in tune with the task at hand.when you watch a film as this you see the world differently&for whatever is happening in your world you just know that whatever you are dealing with isn't half of what is truly going on in the world.the saddest part after viewing this film is that this Genocide of a People all happened within the past 10-12 years which truly is Scary. a Must see film&this film should be taught at all schools.very intense film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is powerful and brilliant!

It'll engage you like nothing, or almost nothing, you've ever seen. And that's the verdict of Michael the Uber-Cynic, so what more do you need?<br /><br />It's a sad world we live in. We hear the word "genocide" so many times that we don't even feel it. We see so many civil wars that we don't even care. I knew Rwanda had made the news, but that was about it. I ignored headlines and skipped to the comics and the sports page. Another month, another civil war, another genocide, another geography lesson, and I finally quit listening. I thickened my crusty old shell and concentrated on making mo money. But I know now what happened in Rwanda back then, and I'm glad that I know. It does matter. I've never been to Africa, and about 99% of my readers have never been to Africa, but it still matters.<br /><br />Don Cheadle, who I admired in the days of PICKET FENCES, gave a powerful performance in the true story of Paul Rusesabagina's struggle and his heroism. This film won all kinds of awards, and I can see why. But that's not important. What it did, for me, was put a human face on what happened. It's a powerful story told well, with real people living through a seemingly unreal situation.<br /><br />I find this tidbit interesting, and it pleases me greatly. The writer always had Don Cheadle in mind. The financiers suggested Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, etc etc. And you know I love Denzel. But Don Cheadle made this role his own. I can't picture anybody else as Paul Rusesabagina. Probably not even the real Paul Rusesabagina if I met him. Sometimes it's like that. It doesn't have to make sense.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that everyone watch this film. I don't think it could be any better than it is.

A true one, to be sure, and not unlike many that remain unrecorded and unthanked because their own heros perished among the million corpses left behind by this most inexplicable genocide.<br /><br />I use the term inexplicable advisedly. Hotel Rwanda movingly registers the uncommon heroism and presence of mind by which 1200 of them survived. What it does not attempt to do is to explain the causes of the tribalism that turns neighbor against neighbor in places like Rwanda, Bosnia, and  - dare I say it - Indianapolis?<br /><br />That's a far different story, and one that is receiving careful attention from friends like Dr. Abel N'jerareou, living practically next door to Rwanda in Francophone Africa.<br /><br />We are all tribalists at the core, an almost hard-wired instinct that becomes lethal over and over again when the family tribe upon which we settle our hunger proves too small for the design. Hotel Rwanda alludes to the same when 'family' becomes the explanation for doing nothing as the first neighbors are hauled off screaming and bloodied into the night.<br /><br />Might tribalism also go some way toward explaining why nations that have the power to intervene in episodes of genocide so seldom do so? Even that amalgam of nations so easily charged with the role of international sheriff that we call the United (sic) Nations?<br /><br />When the mostly white Europeans are escorted out of the H?tel des Mille Collines by rescuing forces and Nick Nolte's idiosyncratically but powerfuly performed UN coronel asks for something strong at the bar and levels with Don Cheadle's hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina 'these people are not here for you', one realizes anew that tribalism is not an African phemonenon.<br /><br />Critics of armed intervention except in the most extreme cases (a definition convenient enough to fairly never occur) do well to consider whether chaos is a force that - once loosed and allowed to run wild - can ever be contained to those populations where it first gains its grip.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda reminds its living-room viewer that there is evil and that it kills men, women, and children fairly indiscriminately. To say nothing of red and yellow, black and white.<br /><br />The nation of Rwanda is well on its way to achieving its goal of a 'new Rwanda' where the 'unfortunate facts of history' are relegated to the past via footnoting them in the brochures for its fabulous gorilla safaris. Tensions remain. Rwanda will soon be something other than synonymous with machete-driven massacre.<br /><br />The next news will come from somewhere else, where this morning neighbors of diffferent tribes chat over coffee and biscuits.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>This film is certainly as good as any movie released in 2004 and will stand the test of time. Anyone who has the slightest interest in world events knows of the killing of a million or more Tutsis by the Hutus in the mid-90's. HOTEL RWANDA is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina who almost single-handedly saved 1,200 people in 1994. His character is played by Don Cheadle, nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role as the hotel manager. He gives a magnificent performance and in any other year should have won. Although he is in practically every frame and could have carried the movie alone, he doesn't have to as everyone else to a person weighs in with fantastic acting-- Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana and Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, to name two; but the list doesn't stop there.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are almost too painful to watch. The most poignant line in the movie for me is when a commentator asks the question and does not get an answer: "how many acts of genicide make genicide?" It is well-known that officials in the U. S. Government played semantics with the word "genicide." Cheadle mentions in his commentary included on the DVD something to the effect that the only thing that prepared him for the making of this film was run-ins with the LAPD, a sad indictment of that police force.<br /><br />This movie should be required viewing for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>In 1994 one of the most brutal acts of civil war occurred in Rwanda, Africa.  It was genocide on the most horrific scale of our lifetimes, rivaled only by Hitler's regime in the 1930's.  Hotel Rwanda is the true story of one man, hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who managed to harbor 1,268 refugees inside the upscale hotel he managed until he could find a way to bring them all to safety behind the Tutsi rebel lines.<br /><br />Though a peace treaty between the Hutu's and the Tutsi's was signed by the Rwandan President, only hours later the president was assassinated and the militia were given the signal to begin killing the "Tutsi cockroaches" that had once enslaved the Hutu's.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is a 10 star movie, it left me breathless with its beautiful portrayal of bravery and courage, and crying from the brutality of a genocidal regime.  Not since Shindler's List have I seen a movie with this much power and courage, enough to make even this cold-hearted reviewer break down and cry like a baby.  When one single, everyday person shows this much valor and heroism in the face of utter hopelessness, it makes me believe in the human race again.<br /><br />Although there is not much overt blood in this movie, there are scenes of violence so horrific that you will cringe in your chair and set aside your cup of hot chocolate.  Hotel Rwanda is a tale of faith, hope, love, bravery, courage, violence, callousness, atrocities, and the shame of humanity.  Only UN General Romeo Dallaire (renamed Coronal Oliver for the movie, and expertly played by Nick Nolte) stayed behind when all other industrialized nations fled the country and left over one million people to be butchered in the genocide.<br /><br />The cast in Hotel Rwanda was incredible, with stellar performances by Don Cheadle playing Paul Rusesabagina, Sophie Okonedo playing Tatiana Rusesabagina, Desmond Dube playing Dube, Fana Mokoena playing General Bizimungu, and Joaquin Phoenix playing reporter Jack Daglish.<br /><br />If there is one movie that everyone should see, it is this one.  There are simply not enough good things to say about this movie and how incredibly moving it is, you will just have to sit down and watch it for yourself.  I wound out buying it the same day I rented it, and have watched it over and over, my mouth still dropping open in amazement at how people can be both cruel and kind.  Buy this one.<br /><br />Also, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of 'Shake Hands With The Devil', the real account of Rwanda written by Romeo Dallaire, the UN General that stayed behind during the war.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>A hotel manager houses Tutsis refugees during their conflict with the Hutu militia.  Heartwrenching performances and the overall message of bravery and courage were defined clearly by Mr. Don Cheadle.  There is a definite lesson in this movie about giving of oneself and the testament of the human spirit.  High recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>There is an absolute truism about the Nazi Holocaust: we must never forget and our slogan must be "never again." So to, this movie reminds us that we must never forget the holocaust that was Rawanda in 1994. Since, in Rawanda, it did happen again, the pledge the world made after Hitler's holocaust, has not been kept. In this movie, we are subtly reminded of something: that we acted against the genocide in the Balkins but, we all but abandoned Rawanda. Nick Nolte, who plays the head of a UN peacekeeping group, tells the manager of a five star hotel, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) that the world is abandoning Rawanda because the victims are black. Nolte uses spicy language, including the "N word" to drive home this stark point.<br /><br />Initially, Paul wants to protect his family but, as all foreign guests are evacuated from Rawanda, Paul takes in 1,200 refuge from the vicious civil war in which members of an ethnic group, the Tutsis are being slaughtered by the Hutus. Paul is a Hutu and he takes in both Tutsis and Hutus. He resorts to bribery, cajolery, the good offices of the UN, and anything else he can grasp at to save the refugees. He risks his own life on several occasions and at times, he seems almost defeated when he breaks down from the sight of the piles of slaughtered bodies. It is truly an attempt at ethnic cleansing, as the Hutus target Tutsi children so that the ethnic group can be permanently cut off.<br /><br />This movie shows the horrors of genocide in which the targets of the genocide are dehuminized. We constantly hear the maniacal rantings of a Hutu radio announcr referring to the Tutsis as "cockroaches" and the situation seems hopeless. However, just as in Schindler's list, out of hopelessness arose hope and, indeed a small victory, so too, in this movie, we end our view of the horrors uplifted.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>A brilliant, beautiful, heartbreaking movie.

In 1994, the Hutu tribe massacred almost a million members of the Tutsi tribe in Rwanda while the Western world largely looked away. UN peacekeepers were in place, but they had no mandate to prevent the genocide. The event was viewed by the outside world as mainly a local problem or dispute.<br /><br />In the capital city, a man named Paul [Don Cheadle] managed a luxury hotel owned by a large corporation in Europe. During the uprising, he housed 1200 refugees in the hotel. He managed to save them all. A Rwandan himself, he was able to do this because he knew the ins and outs of the corrupt local politics.<br /><br />Ah, Africa! Quick! Named three movies that portray that continent accurately. Why are we so indifferent to the place? It was the West that carved Africa up into the nations we know today. It was the West that lost its control of the place. Are we indifferent because we have little control?<br /><br />Whatever the answers to these questions, "Hotel Rwanda" remains a searing movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is one of the most moving and disturbing films I have ever seen. There are no scenes of graphic violence here nevertheless the movie shocks and makes you hold your breath. It is almost phisically painful and unbearable let alone emotional pain.<br /><br />Hutu and Tutsis - two main nationalities of Rwanda. A long time ago Tutsis presumably came from Northern Africa, from Egypt or Ethiopia, they are tall, their skin is brown, they have chiselled features and they were cooperating with Belgian colonists all the time Europeans were occupying Rwanda. Hutu are presumably natives, they are stumpy, black like night and have rugged features. Belgians did not want them to cooperate considering useless and lazy. But once Belgians left the country it was only a matter of time when Hutu would want to take revenge upon Tutsis. And in blood-soaked Africa revenge always looms.<br /><br />I'd like to mention that if you're interested in this topic, there's a novel by Canadian writer Gil Courtemanche called "Un dimanche &agrave; la piscine &agrave; Kigali" translated as "A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali". Action takes place in the same hotel "Mille Collines" as in "Hotel Rwanda" and describes the beginning of Rwandan massacre that left behind nearly a million dead. The main character is a Canadian journalist who's in love with a Tutsi girl. And I'd say this book is not for the faint-hearted. In April, 2006 Canadian director Robert Favreau released a screen adaptation of the novel - "Un dimanche &agrave; Kigali". Although I haven't seen it yet, I hope it will be good.<br /><br />Saying that such films help us not to let something like this happen ever again is trivial, but it's true. And the more people know the history the better. The safer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>Excellent movie that tells the horrors of the genocide in Rwanada and what the world did or did not do to to help.

Shows just how low our human nature can sink. The ultimate horror story of the late 20th Century, while seemingly the rest of the world looked on unruffled. Paul Rusesabagina was portrayed to perfection by Don Cheadle, rapidly becoming one of our greatest actors. And almost stealing the attention from him, is the talented Sophie Okonedo, as Tatiana his wife. Both earned well deserved Academy Award nominations. But everything about this film is done to perfection. One of the best arguments against Intolerance.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Paul Rusesabagina is Hutu.  We see the word on his passport.  His wife is Tutsi.  She is in mortal danger.  But Paul doesn't realize it yet.  He believes that the violence threatened by the ruling Hutu against the once ruling Tutsi in Rwanda will not happen because the UN peacekeepers will not allow it, nor will the world stand by and watch the slaughter.<br /><br />Paul manages a luxury hotel.  He is a worldly-wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well-chosen gifts and flattery.  His demeanor is calm and measured.  He tells his driver that to give a government official or some other important person ten thousand francs is not as effective as giving him a rare Cuban cigar worth the same amount.<br /><br />He visits a supplier to gain supplies for the hotel.  While he is there a crate containing hundreds of machetes overturns.  He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.<br /><br />This is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of director<br /><br />Terry George's calculated method.  He has a story of genocide to tell, a story of criminal neglect by the West, especially by the United States under President Clinton who stood aside and allowed the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people to take place, as did the rest of the world through the UN.  The next hint comes from government radio in which the Tutsi people are referred to as "cockroaches."  This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans.  The psychological trick is to make the killers believe they are killing vermin.  One cannot help but recall the Nazi propaganda machine and its methods prior to and during the Holocaust.<br /><br />Next we see in a scene at the hotel bar that it is really impossible to tell by appearance the difference between two young women, one Tutsi and the other Hutu.  The Tutsi are said to be tall and to look down their noses at the Hutu who are said to be shorter and perhaps darker, but this is clearly a fiction.  Even so, racial differences are invented and racism is inculcated into the mass mind.  All of this is necessary because the slaughter is to take place using not bullets or gas chambers, but instead the cheap machetes from China.  To get armies of young men to kill their neighbors and fellow countrymen, women and children with machetes requires the stirring up of a mass hatred of epic proportion and demonic intensity.<br /><br />The personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left.  We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic.  Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail.  In particular there are scenes of carnage on a vast scale, including the chilling horror of the nighttime bumpy ride along the "river road" which was said by George Rutaganda, a sadistic man, to be "open" and the preferred route to take back to the hotel.  The bumps in the road were the bodies of recently slaughtered Tutsi that the hotel van could not help but drive over.<br /><br />The acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding.  Nick Notle is effective in the role of a compromised and nearly helpless UN commander.<br /><br />This is a message film.  The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans.  He indicates that Western prejudice against black Africans in part allowed the slaughter to take place.  By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another--their familiar humanity--we are made to share this horrific human tragedy and to realize that we could have prevented it had we only known or cared enough.<br /><br />Will we care enough next time?--and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Hotel Rwanda' is not without flaws, most noticeably the film's slightly mawkish ending, but it is still a strong statement about the humanity and injustice. More remarkable thing about this film is that it works brilliantly as first-rate thriller set against the background of the actual massacre in Rwanda without losing the touch of reality.<br /><br />Don Cheadle has been known primarily as supporting actor, but in `Hotel Rwanda' he literally became Paul Rusesabagina, true-life hotel manager who saved the life of more than 1,000 Tutsi refugees, housing them in the hotel, using clever and sometimes daring tactics, and doing tough negotiations with the army and the militia demanding the life of the Tutsis inside.<br /><br />And Paul is not the only one who dedicated himself to the impossible task. The film is fair in not forgetting the (if not perfect, still precious) jobs done by other people - Nick Nolte is very good as UN commander, and so is Joaquin Phoenix as journalist. It is slightly regrettable that the role of Tatiana, Paul's wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, is relegated to that of a damsel in distress, but her strong acting saves it from a typical stereotype. Jean Reno also appears (uncredited) briefly.<br /><br />The script by Terry George (who also directed the film) makes use of some of the Hollywood conventions (like one `saved-by-the-bell' episode), and some scenes of the film are, to be frank, implausible. The film is most convincing (and hauntingly so) at the earlier chapters, where the impending catastrophe is palpably sensed in what you can hear in the radio news or in the rumors people talk.<br /><br />As many reviewers said rightly, the film is tour-de-force of Don Cheadle. The real Paul Rusesabagina is a more robust person, but Cheadle embodies the spirit of everyman who just wanted to save his family and do the right thing. Helped greatly by his riveting acting, the film will grab your heart, being constantly unsettling, gripping, and inspirational.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>It is no wonder why Hotel Rwanda was nominated for 3 Academy Awards in 2004 and 2 Golden Globe awards in 2005. Don Cheadle who plays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina delivers an outstanding and heartwarming performance. This is truly a inspirational film. Based on the true story of a very courageous man, this film recounts the terror that Paul Rusesabagina, his family and the country of Rwanda experienced when war broke out in their small country and many of Tutsis were slaughtered. Unable to just watch all the madness, Paul opens his hotel to over 1,000 refugees. We see a dedicated man go to great lengths to save his people and try to put an end to the violence. There are many touching and heartbreaking scenes in this movie but knowing that this is a true story, it makes this film even more riveting. Paul is a great man of courage and many lives were saved due to his efforts. There are great special features on this DVD giving us even more insight to the actual terror that happen in Rwanda. Although we find out the film was actually shot in South Africa, this doesn't take away from the movie. A must have movie that really opens your eyes to the violence in this world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>The film, Hotel Rwanda, is similar to Schindler's List and The Diary of Ann Frank, in that it is more than entertainment; it documents a national act of genocide of one people against another. Therfore the film has to be reviewed both as an artistic statement and as a political statement. I will cover both in this review.<br /><br />First, this is suberb film making with an incredible cast of actors. However Don Cheadle demonstrated that his acting skills are of the highest order. The film did an excellent job of balancing the tensions and drama within the hotel with the terror in the streets. Major societal tensions are mirrored in the hotel staff, some of which are Tutsis and some of which are Hutus. The film did an excellent job of demonstrating the terror as parents tired to keep thier children from being murdered against a mob of Hutus, intent on killing all Tutsis in the country. Thus the film demonstrated at the individual, the family, the neighborhood, the ethnic, and the national levels the terror of this genocide.<br /><br />Second,the film is a political statement against genocide and the politics around genocide. Long brewing social injustice,a breakdown of the social contract, opportunistic political leaders, prejudice and stereotypes, and a highly visible or high profile catalyst to mob violence are the formula for genocide which this film displayed very well. The film is subtle in demonstrating that many of the Tutsis were of a higher economic class than the Hutus and this was due to the Belgium preference for the lighter skinned, thinner, taller Tutsis as compared to the shorter, darker, thicker Hutus. This long brewing social injustice set the stage for opportunistic politicians to gain control of the country with ethinic warfare as their vehicle. The assassination of the President by his own military, blamed on the Tutsis rebels, and fanned into flame by violence monger radio personalities served as the catalyst that sparked the terror.<br /><br />There has been much discussion around the lack of a response from Europe and the United States during this catastrope. The explanations include the recent US military crisis in Mogadishu (see Black Hawk Down for a great film on this incident), the lack of understanding of the politics and tensions in the region, the involvement of the UN in Bosnia and Serbia, and racism against darker races.  All of these forces, no doubt, played a role. However we have to ask both our politicians and the media to do a much better job of educating the public around these issues. The media was slow to report this genocide and thus delayed international action. We should never let this happen again.<br /><br />Buy this film, it is outstanding. Keep it in your collection since it is part of human history.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I was ten when the genocide in Rwanda happened, and to this day I still can't remember ever hearing about it until some years later (I think it was two or three years later when I was taught by a history teacher that the genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda was one of the worst genocides since the Holocaust). That should tell you how bad it was, that schools would only talk about it as a secondary item to something history deems more important. In fact, Waco was given more attention than the murder of more than 1,000,000 million people. It's sad, to think about this now and realize how misinformed as a country we had been.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are people out there who feel a certain obligation to make us know what had happened to the poor people of Rwanda. Hotel Rwanda, and plenty of other movies and books dealing with the Rwanda Genocide, came out recently and started to finally shed some light on this event. Though it took ten years, we are now finally getting to chance to understand.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is very much like the movie Schindler's List. It's about a real man who is forced to act, put into a situation where he became the protector of the people of his country. Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a four star hotel who, when his world breaks apart because of hatred and civil war, takes on some pretty severe responsibilities simply because he was the only one who could, as the entire world has backed itself out of the conflict in Rwanda. Though a realistic thinker, he's also a man of high morals, and gives everything up--money, possibly his job, even his self-respect--to save those who come asking for his help. Using his influence and his intelligence, he finds ways to continually keep the Hutu militia from his hotel. But soon, it becomes an impossible task, and he must think about leaving the hotel. With little outside help (only a small force of UN officers and the Red Cross) he attempts to take that next step.<br /><br />The character of Paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, one of the finer actors of today, and his presence in this movie is felt in absolutely every scene. He plays Paul as a silent and  cunning man who looks at his Hutu heritage as if it were a hated middle name, something easily passed over. He knows how to work those around him, and understands more than most that the world revolves around money and bribery, and is more than willing to use this to save those around him. He chooses to be a caring human before saving his own self-respect, and this is what makes the character of Paul so special, both real and in the movie.<br /><br />Though I usually cringe when recommending movies of this nature (something about historical movies always tend to twist the events to serve the needs of entertainment) I don't do so with Hotel Rwanda. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, and in fact I wish everyone could see this movie. It's equally as important as Schindler's List. It's a story of human strength and human weakness all in one, and makes a strong distinction between the two. Hint, the people with the guns and the power aren't necessarily strong.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that just anger's you and feel sadden all at once. Don Cheadle was truly Oscar-worthy for this film and 100% convincing in his role as the Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, and Nick Nolte and le grand Jean Reno give outstanding performances in their limited screen time. British-born newcomer Sophie Okonedo also gives a fine performance as Cheadle's Tutsi wife. Filmed in South Africa as an international (mostly Canadian) production, the faces of the many other important supporting characters looked more than sufficiently authentic, providing a profound human backdrop to the events unfolding on the screen.<br /><br />Regarding the film, there are a couple of points where the forced dramatic moments border on excess, but in all cases the faces on the screen included white ones, lending a certain amount of slack. When African faces were alone on the screen, the terror was sufficiently evident to never have to feel forced. The plot devices certainly owe a debt to earlier films like The Battle of Algiers, Salvador, The Killing Fields, and Schindler's List, but we should remember that this is essentially a true story. Furthermore, Hotel Rwanda's focus on one family and the strength of its bond provides an element of hope and positive feeling that brings something new and invigorating to this genre. Above all, I loved this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In 1994 when Rwanda descended into the bloody madness of genocide Paul Ruseasabagina (Don Cheadle) was reasonably secure in his process.  He belonged to the Hutu majority that was slaughtering the minority with machetes and he was the manger of the five-star Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali.  But his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is Tutsi and the Tutsi are not only being called "cockroaches" on the nonstop incendiary radio broadcasts they are being exterminated like them.  Not only are his wife and children in danger, so is the rest of his family and so are the guests in his hotel.  It is up to Ruseasabagina to do something about this madness simply because there is nobody else to do the job (it would be easier to call the character Paul, but given the story it seems important to focus on the fact he was an African).<br /><br />"Hotel Rwanda" is a true story, and even though we know going in that Ruseasabagina is going to save over a thousand refugees this is still a harrowing story.  For the most part the genocide happens outside the walls of the hotel, but there are enough scenes and stories of what is happening to make it clear that the people huddled in the hotel are in mortal danger.  What is probably the most unforgettable moment comes while a van is being driven through the fog and appears to have gone off the road (the DVD extras also contain scenes of the unforgettable way the Tutsi have memorialized the victims of the slaughter at one location).<br /><br />The explanation for why the United Nations, the Europeans, the Americans, or anybody else with a speck of humanity in them does not intervene to stop the genocide is articulated by the Colonel Oliver character played by Nick Nolte, who tells Ruseasabagina that the problem is that these are just black Africans killing other black Africans.  The words are spoken in disgust and are brutal, but they are horribly true and what redeems Oliver is not only that is he is willing to articulate the brutal truth but that there will come a point where orders to stand by and do nothing are no longer going to be obeyed.  Likewise, the cameraman played by Joaquin Phoenix provides a memorable scene as the Europeans leave the Milles Collines and the character is so shamed not only by the retreat but also by the presence of a hotel employee holding an umbrella over their heads in the pouring rain.<br /><br />But there is one person who cannot turn his back on what is happening.  Ruseasabagina is literally the right person in the right place, because only the hotel could have become a refuge for the Tutsi and only the manager of a five-star hotel could have known exactly how to placate the military men leading the massacre.  Not only does he speak their language, there is a sense in which they want to speak his as well, showing that even though their arms are covered in blood they can play the role of a civilized man.  Cheadle's performance, deservedly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, is appropriately controlled just as Ruseasabagina had to be in persuading these thugs to help him.  He cracks only once when a mundane part of his preparing for his job suddenly becomes an impossibility to manage.  He is also a hero who is flawed, making mistakes and trying desperately to do the right thing, even if that means forcing his wife to make a fateful promise or abandoning his family to try and save others.<br /><br />There is an obvious comparison to be made between "Hotel Rwanda" and "Schindler's List."  But watching this 2004 film I could not help thinking that if during the Holocaust there had been images of Nazis herding Jews into the concentration camps on the nightly news nobody would have done anything either (but if a whale is trapped in an ice flow in the arctic a rescue mission shall be sent).  Stories such as this emphasize the small number doing good against the large number doing evil, but there is always that even larger number signifying all the people who do nothing and assent to the evil by their silence.  Those who watch "Hotel Rwanda" will find themselves counted among that final number and should well remember that even if they were oblivious to what happened in Rwanda history will repeat itself is this regard and give us another chance to do the right thing.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>This is a movie that is unforgettable in it's accurate portrayal of human brutality.

Don Cheadle is superb as the heroic hotel manager who more than rises to the occassion using his wits to keep his family and hundreds of others safe in the midst of chaos. He surely deserves great recognition for this role.<br /><br />Rwanda is a lesson in how Governments and the media can selectively focus on problem areas in the world and also can selectively ignore others. For example most Americans now know differences between shiites and sunnis and kurds but how many know the differences between tsuties and hutus ? That fact that the hatred portrayed in this film is so irrational combined with the look the other way attitude of much of the west contibutes to an astoundingly shameful episode of recent history. The film does much to illuminate and educate.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>"The Kite Runner" may be the best book I have read in recent history, and without a doubt, "Hotel Rwanda" wins the corresponding prize for movies.  Unable to believe the senseless violence and slaughter of innocents, my eyes opened wider and wider as the movie progressed, until at some point, the tears could not be held back any longer.<br /><br />Don Cheadle aces a career making role as Paul Rusesabagina, the quiet, understated hotel manager of a five star hotel in Kigali, Rwanda, who breaks every rule in the management book to protect not only the hotel guests, but refugees from both sides of the genocide that rocked Rwanda in 1994, while the rest of the world looked the other way.<br /><br />A Hutu by birth and passport stamp, Paul is married to a Tutsi woman (Sophie Okonedo, whose voice changes drastically in octave as the role demands), and by this distinction, his children are also Tutsi, and therefore branded as cockroaches to be exterminated.<br /><br />Because of his position and well-placed contacts, Rusesabagina is able to cling tenuously to his little safe house, putting up a brave front for the 1200 people he is sheltering from the Hutu tribal forces.  When he finds out that the UN peacekeepers cannot help them, and that the rest of the world doesn't want to know about African problems, he resorts to the local language, securing protection by whatever means necessary from the authorities, led by General Bizimungu, who has a weakness for Scottish water of life, foreign currency and self preservation.  Being only human, and in a crisis situation, he makes crucial errors in judgment, but by his conviction he manages to hold it all together for as long as necessary.<br /><br />There are too many powerful scenes to describe, and you have to watch the movie to fully appreciate the horror.  There are no gory images as in "Saving Private Ryan" or "Blade", but the Director manages to effectively portray the despair and mass killings without being offensively graphic or crude.  One of the most heart rending scenes takes place on a road in the early morning fog, and this is the final straw that rips through Rusesabagina's brittle fa?ade of being in control.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix (you know I have to mention him), in a small role as a cameraman sums it up best when he said "I've never been so ashamed."<br /><br />This one is a must see.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 23, 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>If this film had been released at any other time in our history, it would still be a powerful, inspiring film. That it was released while we are spending billions upon billions of dollars killing people to instill democracy in Iraq makes it all the more significant. Yes, I realize that the Rwanda situation occurred during the Clinton administration, so I'm not blaming Bush for this catastrophe. That would be ridiculous. But I *am* blaming the West for turning their back on a country in desperate need. The horrible truth is that the West - in general - simply doesn't care about Africa, which is a point bluntly made in the film by Nick Nolte's character. He said something along the lines of: "You just don't matter. You're black."<br /><br />This movie isn't the story of the Rwanda genocide. At times, I found myself wishing, perhaps out of morbid curiosity that it was. I'm glad, however, that we saw very limited instances of the massacres because, frankly, in today's age of television being everywhere, I've seen enough real life bombings to last a lifetime.<br /><br />This movie instead is the story of a man who is a manager of a four star Belgian hotel, who was at first hesitant to become involved in the political upheaval surrounding him. Instead, he turned the four star hotel that he ran into a refugee camp of those fleeing the Hutus, though he himself was a Hutu and could have avoided the trouble simply by claiming his Hutu heritage and leaving the confines of the hotel. But his wife was Tutsi, so of course he could not leave her.<br /><br />Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, does a miraculous job. He is perfectly contrite as a good hotel manager should be, his emotions well contained, and his accents perfect. The genocide comes as a surprise to him, for he seems to believe (in the film at least) in the general goodness of man; that the warnings heard on the radio that the Hutus will be killing Tutsi's like flies are not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />One of the most interesting moments in the film came when a reporter, played by Joaquin Phoenix asked two women: how can you tell the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi? They explained that Hutus generally had wider noses, and mentioned some other "structural" differences. He asked the two girls what they were. One was Hutu, the other Tutsi. He expressed surprise, as did I, for I thought the two could have been sisters. It's a very pointed commentary on the ridiculousness of the bloodbath that occurred. People were divided by how they looked - and in some cases, you couldn't tell the difference at all.<br /><br />Bring that back home to America...we're still having some of those same problems in our country. Thankfully, those problems aren't likely to break out into genocide, although they do cause some rather ugly turf wars. But there is a mirror here that reflects those exact problems that led to genocide - we are not immune.<br /><br />This movie was uplifting, wonderfully acted, and deeply touching. It also enraged me, and as I left the theater I commented to my friend that I was embarrassed to be from the West.<br /><br />I disagree with one reviewer that it would be an embarassment to give Oscar nods to Million Dollar Baby, Ray, or others over this film. There are many worthy contenders this year. Don Cheadle certainly deserves consideration for Best Actor, but can we honestly say that his performance was more moving and emotive than Jamie Foxx's? Anyway - my only point is that this movie is just as worthy of Oscar consideration as many other films released this year. It will be an Oscar's ceremony that I will be interested to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Every now and then a movie comes along whose subject matter is so important that the art of the film is almost irrelevant.<br /><br />The universally praised HOTEL RWANDA (MGM) is ordinary filmmaking about an extraordinary man.  Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the manager of an elite hotel who exhibits the highest, most noble of human traits when he bravely takes a stand against the barbaric, bloody savagery during the 1994 Hutu massacre of the Tutsi minority.  Almost all the Tutsis were eventually slaughtered (by machete).<br /><br />When his country descends into chaos, Rusesabagina first wants to save his family, assuming the world will intervene.  When that doesn't happen, he opens his hotel to over a thousand refugees. When a crazed militia storms the gates of the Hotel compound, the  stakes are substantially raised for his, his family's and "guests" safety.<br /><br />Cheadle is magnificent as the clever, calm, quick thinking, heroic but never larger-than-life Rusesabagina.  Sophie Okoneda and Nick Nolte co-star in this unforgettable film.  Don't miss this rare true story about an honorable man trapped in a living nightmare of raging humanity at its most abhorrent, brutal, irrational and bestial level.<br /><br />If you are reluctant to see this excellent film, fearing graphic depiction of the bloody events, fear not; almost all of it is off screen.  Superior extras include "Return to Rwanda" and a commentary with the real life Paul Rusesabagina</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>One of the most intensive killing campaigns in human history was conducted in the tiny Central African country of Rwanda in 1994. The brutal ethnic conflict between the Tutsis and the Hutus, which exploded into mass murder that year, have origins which go back to Belgium's colonial rule, where the minority Tutsis were favored, thus exacerbating differences between the two tribes.<br /><br />In April 1994, the plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down. This event was the last straw which, after years of strife, triggered the tragic and brutal genocide. Extremist Hutu militia, aided by the Rwandan army, launched systematic massacres against Tutsis almost immediately after the plane crash. Despite reports of mass killings, most of the world turned a blind eye to the people of Rwanda. The UN failed to take immediate action to stop the bloody genocide, due to opposition from France and the US. Militiamen broke into supposedly sacrosanct Red Cross ambulances and hospitals searching for victims. Around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed within 100 days, and over three million people fled to neighboring countries.<br /><br />Terry George's "Hotel Rwanda" is a gritty, realistic depiction of this terrible tragedy. The storyline is based on the true life activities of a single, man whose goal was to save as many people as humanly possible. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan who formerly managed the Milles Collines, a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in the capital city of Kigali. When Hutu extremists begin to slaughter members of the minority Tutsi tribe, Rusesabagina returns to the hotel and does everything in his power to save his family, friends, then orphans, and ultimately strangers. He uses the 4 Star facility as a refuge for as many as the walls will hold, and then some. The film follows Rusesabagina, through his real life drama, as he wheels, deals, finagles and barters for seemingly every single human life he touches. A Huti married to a Tutsi, Paul qualifies as a target for both factions. His story is that of an ordinary man who rises-up, courageously, to defy death in the name of his fellow man. "Paul Rusesabagina saved the lives of 1,268 Africans by standing with them at Hotel Rwanda."<br /><br />The almost nonstop fear, suspense and sense of anxiety which permeate this film are due, in part, to Mr. Cheadle's extraordinarily believable performance, and in part, because Director George so clearly conveys here the chilling reality of recent history. George, who co-wrote the script with Keir Pearson, was assisted in his work by the actual Paul Rusesabagina and by eye witnesses to the events.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent and features: Sophie Okonedo, who gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, Rusesabagina's wife; Joaquin Phoenix as Jack, an American news reporter; and Nick Nolte as the indefatigable UN Colonel Oliver, who tries against all odds to keep the peace.<br /><br />Man's wont to commit genocide, in the 20th century alone, makes a somber, shameful statement about the human race. Watching "Hotel Rwanda" does take an emotional toll. It is a powerful, disturbing, educationally eye-opening experience. There are some extremely unsettling images, as when Rusesabagina and a co-worker get out of their vehicle on a foggy morning, just after dawn, to inspect the road for obstructions. They find it littered with corpses, as far as the eye can see. I found myself sobbing more than once. Do not let this deter you, however. This is a brilliant movie with some incredibly uplifting and inspiring moments. "Hotel Rwanda" is a must see film about a period in recent history when most of us were too busy going about our lives to pay much attention to what was going on a small world away.<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't said, especially the top-voted review for this DVD. I knew this movie wasn't going to be happy or anything, but wow. Some of the scenes were very stark and gripping, with quite a few tear-jerker moments.<br /><br />It's especially very sobering considering that this was based off a true story, and that this kind of thing still happens around the world, not just Africa. It disgusts me that people today still consider genocide an acceptable option for ANYTHING. Heck, I wouldn't know the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi, they all looked the same to me. It truly saddens me that people are willing to kill and beat and rape just because someone's a Tutsi, even though many of them married Hutus, had children, worked and lived alongside Hutus, and never did a single dang thing against their neighbors.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>hotel rwanda is an excellent movie. extremely moving and heartfelt that you can't help but wish there was something you could do. it delivers the truth that is happening or has happened in so many countries. this film is touching and truly inspirational on so many levels. it just makes it all the more sorrowful when you know it's based on true events. the brutallity of some people, that stands against this one mans courage to stand up and help. he is determined to help his people to survive at all cost. even if it means his life. he feels he must fight, even if he fights alone. all the while you see the fear in his eyes, but you also see the courage in his heart. he gives his people refuge in his hotel. he does all he can to protect them. he gives everything, although he is in constant danger. in the meantime outside of this hotel all around there's people dying, getting tortured, and chaos has broken loose. when no one in the world can help them, or care to what can he do? he wants to do more, but how does one man stand against an army. in the end he is a hero in the eyes of those he helped and is an example to all others, and just when he thinks he can do no more, help has come. excellent directing, and if this film doesn't move you in one way or another, damn then i don't know what's up with you. i got to hand it to don cheadle, this man is wonderful. this is a one in a lifetime performance. i don't think anybody could have done it the way he did. great actor, and you know he gave it all and then some in this film. he portrays brilliantly what one man did to save over 1,200 refugees from the hands of mad men. it's a powerful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This gut wrenching movie is based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a five star assistant hotel manager in Africa who spent his life being accommodating to the rich, famous and powerful clientele of the hotel Mille Collines in hope that one day he could call on them to help his family.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose in 1994 just before the president is assassinated. Following this begins the unbelievable genocide raged against the Tootsis people. Paul has to think fast on his feet to keep his wife and children alive (they are Tootsis, he is Hutu). His actions surprise even himself. Without expecting it, Paul becomes a humanitarian, saving over 1000 refugees by hiding them in the hotel while over 800,000 Tootsis were being slaughtered.<br /><br />The act of killing so many people seems incomprehensible. Hotel Rwanda's disturbing content deals with the dark side of humanity. It did not try to over shadow the horror with flying limbs and splashing blood like they could of. It focuses instead on the emotional and psychological turmoil of the main characters and those within the hotel. This is one of the best films I've ever seen.

Wood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film tells of a disturbing, shameful, and tragic episode in Rwandan history, a story that was shaped by the colonial racial politics of its former Belgian masters. In 1994, the African republic of Rwanda descended into civil war. The Hutu majority, inflamed by the political rhetoric of guerilla radio, rose up against the Tutsi minority. This tribal warfare led to mass murder, with neighbor against neighbor, and would eventually see nearly a million Rwandans killed.<br /><br />During this time of great turmoil, fear, and slaughter, an oasis existed in the capital city of Kigali. That oasis was the Belgian owned luxury hotel, Milles Collines. There, its native manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a member of the Hutu majority, would find himself in the role of shepherd with a flock of refugees on his hands, which would include his own wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okenedo), a member of the Tutsi minority, and their children.<br /><br />After the non-native guests and non-native refugees were evacuated to safety, Rusesabagina was left with the daunting task of taking care of nearly twelve hundred native guests and refugees, many of which were the hunted Tutsis, which just outside the gates of the hotel were being indiscriminately massacred, butchered with machetes or shot execution style at point blank range. Extermination of the Tutsi minority was the agenda of the day, and none, including children, were to be spared.<br /><br />While a handful of United Nations peacekeepers were at the gates of the hotel, their presence was only for show, as their orders were not to shoot. One of them (Nick Nolte) finally told Rusesabagina, who was hoping for help from the outside world, that not a single country was going to lift a finger to help them, and he brutally told him exactly why. So, Rusesabagina was left with having to maneuver around the corrupt Hutu militia, getting supplies and whatever protection that he could, to ensure survival. Situational ethics was the order of the day, as Rusesabagina bribed, wheedled, and did everything he could to ensure that those in his care would survive and outlast the madness and carnage that was going on all around them.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film, deftly directed by Terry George, who keeps the carnage and gore to a minimum. Yet, he manages with just a few well-placed scenes to convey a sense of the overwhelming magnitude of the genocide that took place, while the entire world watched and did nothing. Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance, low-keyed, controlled; yet, nonetheless, deeply moving. Were it not for the extraordinary performance of Jamie Foxx in "Ray", there is little doubt that Don Cheadle, who, along with Foxx, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, would have won. The rest of the supporting cast also give stellar performances.<br /><br />This is a brilliantly acted, well-directed film that deserves a place in one's personal collection.

He gets caught up in the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis that eventually led to the slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsuis and moderate Hutus.  The Tutsis were given favored status by the colonizing Belgians but the hatred intensified once independence was granted in 1962.<br /><br />Cheadle, a moderate Hutu, had curried favor with many influential people in his position in the hotel.  When violence broke out he was able to shelter more than 1200 refugees in his hotel protecting them from the wanton extermination of the Tutsis by the radical Hutus.  Cheadle and wife Tatiana played by Sophie Okonedo and family were afforded some protection within the confines of the hotel by U.N. forces Colonel Oliver played by Nick Nolte.  He also bought protection with bribes to Rwandan General Bizimungu played by Fana Mokoena.<br /><br />Cheadle had to use all of his influence and wits to protect those he harbored in his hotel when Western powers and the U.N. invoked a policy of non-intervention.  This decision potentiated the slaughter of the innocents and will always remain as a scar on the disposition of mankind.<br /><br />George's realistic portrayal of this horrendous chapter in human history was an eye opening experience of an incident that didn't get the worldwide media coverage it deserved.

When their is an assasination of a person of great power the Hutus set out to eliminate all of the Tutsi's off all ages, men and women.

There were several times, that I simply had to look away from the screen since I could never fathom the inhumanity and the brutality.

Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina is a really, really good and calm four-star hotel manager. And he was able to channel his skills at pleasing guests into improbably saving a thousand refugees during a massacre that Western civilization essentially ignored.<br /><br />Sophie Okonedo plays Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana, a member of the Tutsi tribe that faces extinction in the massacre. Together Tatiana and Paul - a member of the Hutu tribe - work despite incredible odds to cope with this tragedy and save their family and endangered community.<br /><br />Okonedo and Cheadle's most powerful scenes, though, come when the Rusesabaginas are forced to discuss what to do should their family be slaughtered. The actors are able to juxtapose the very real love that this husband and wife felt for one another with the absolute horror that they could die at any moment under a machete. One scene on a rooftop reduced me to tears.<br /><br />There are several bigger-name white actors in the film, namely Nick Nolte, Jean Reno and Joaquin Phoenix, who are able to pull the viewers in, but they are pushed to the sidelines as the story continues.<br /><br />Cheadle carries the film.

Hotel Rwanda doesn't waste any time setting up it's overtly charged, suspenseful political tone. Plus, come to think of it, it may in fact be targeted at ignoramuses like myself whose apathy toward the African condition takes centerstage in its riveting drama.<br /><br />Civil unrest has broken out in Rwanda and two warring tribes are at loggerheads, intent on ethnic cleansing. A massacre has been ordered by one side. Innocent civilians are being slaughtered in their gardens and backyards. One man, a hotel manager in a four star hotel in the middle of the riot-torn city, must take it upon himself to save the lives of as many people as can be packed into his premises, much to the chagrin of savage rioteers.<br /><br />A throbbing game of cat and mouse ensues. Guest-starring are choice anthropoids from a largely impotent UN who lend a political undertone to the goings-on. The film is finely edited and moves along at a rapid clip as we see sacrifice, grace under fire, valor, love, even an occasional tranche of timely well-located humor.<br /><br />Interestingly, the screenplay's rawness accentuates Hotel Rwanda's impact. The setup of one man doing a noble turn and saving people of different ethnicity is reminiscent of Schindler's List, but instead of Spielberg's noirish rendition, this film conjures up images of Oliver Stone's classic, Salvador, that showcased James Wood as a sparring journalist in South America. Gritty, infectious.<br /><br />Nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back.

Or it is dealing with how those in wealthier, more established countries prefer to pretend such trouble does not exist, that they need not become involved?<br /><br />Is it about two very similar people groups killing each other? Could the movie be a reminder of how the systemic killing of a people group can happen today, that the evil of the Jewish Holocaust is not unique to the 1940s?<br /><br />At first glance, "Hotel Rwanda" might look like a condemnation against the West's unwillingness to respond to an absolute carnage of genocidal hate. For some, they might see Bill Clinton, or the United Nations as impotent figures in this tragedy of humanity. They are easy figures to pick on, depending on the audience's personal politics, and the fact of who was in office at the time.<br /><br />For me, the tremendous strength of the movie was one man's valor, of hotel manager's Paul Rusesabagina humble commitment to do the right thing, even though the world around him was chaotically destroying itself.<br /><br />The plot is simple: two of Rwanda's people groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, are killing each other. Mostly, it was Hutu extremists trying to exterminate the Tutsis. A hotel becomes an ad hoc refugee camp, deftly managed by a man who preferred to be anywhere else. Can the hotel remain safe? Will the people hiding there survive?<br /><br />Don Cheadle, perhaps best known for his brilliant portrayal as Sammy Davis Jr. in 1998's "The Rat Pack," is hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.<br /><br />Rusesabagina was just a businessman, the manager of the Belgian-owned Mille Collines, a top hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. He worked hard to raise his family, and tried to keep politically neutral. When he saw neighbors killed, he kept his head low. When he brings in neighbors to be sheltered in the hotel, he still fights to retain his neutrality. However, when refugees start coming to the hotel by the dozens, he begins a new mission as the shepherd of a displaced people.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie is shot within the hotel. Rusesabagina struggles to manage the appearance of a top quality hotel, since this image helps gird them against attacks. Bribes of money and liquor provide him with more protection, as do desperate calls from some 'guests' to their powerful connections outside of Rwanda.<br /><br />When the camera takes us outside, we see awful scenes of gang-style killings. Although the Hutus and Tutsis aren't Bloods, Crips, Vice Lords or Latin Kings, but instead, are arbitrarily designated cultural groups, the murders are the same. Just as in any Chicago, New York or Los Angeles gangland war, the precise reasons for the constant violence are loosely based on dictatorial leadership, bigotry and bloodlust.<br /><br />Listing the scenes which sank my heart is impossible.

Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager in Rwanda, secretly used his position and intelligence to shelter over a thousand refugees during the genocide crisis. Cheadle is great in this movie. A very moving and powerful movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>It is so ironic how, in a world of omni-connectivity and 24/7 news,  perhaps as a result of an overabundance of "information", events as horrific as the Rwandan conflict could be overlooked as blatantly. This movie portrays the manager of a hotel in the capital of Rwanda (played impeccably by Oscar nominee Don Cheadle) as he harbors over 1,200 refugee Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were fleeing from the horror of a certain death by machete in the hands of the Hutu extremists.<br /><br />It is simply impossible not to be touched by the movie and be on edge all through it, when you realize how much cruelty there can be in this world, potentially leading to the killing of as many as 1 million people because they are different in some way, or happen to have a certain label stamped on their passport... The movie does not focus as much on the killing of the people, but rather on the heroic acts of the hotel manager (Paul Rusesabagina). Still there are numerous moments of violence presented in the it.<br /><br />You just have to see this movie. Not doing so would be equivalent to looking away, the same way that most countries (the U.N. included) did during the Rwandan Genocide.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Terry George<br /><br />Cast:  Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Desmond Dube, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Fana Mokonedo, Cara Seymour.<br /><br />Running Time:  121 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 on appeal for violence, disturbing images and brief strong language.<br /><br />In 1994, tensions between the two primary tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis, exploded into full out war. "Hotel Rwanda" tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, "Traffic"), a resourceful Hutu manager of a posh, dignified hotel located on Belgian ground within the country, who helped over a thousand Tutsi refugees by keeping them safe inside his hotel while hell on Earth broke out all over the area.  The easy comparison to make for "Hotel Rwanda" is to set it alongside "Schindler's List." Both films feature a kindly soul reaching beyond himself for the greater good, set against the backdrop of horrific genocide (one million Africans were slaughtered during this war). While "Rwanda" doesn't live to up the standards set by Spielberg's masterpiece, it does feature its terror in living color, and draws attention to a moment in African history that hasn't been dramatized with much effect before.<br /><br />Writer/director Terry George has covered the Irish experience thoroughly in his films "Some Mother's Sons," and "In the Name of the Father," and he brings to "Rwanda" the same strength of focus to share untold stories to the world. "Rwanda" is an important film, sure to open the eyes of many with its taste of the Rwandan holocaust, but it also retains a powerful dramatic arc that might upset some looking for a more documentary feel to the film. This is Paul's story first and foremost, and the violent overthrow is seen through his eyes, or overheard on heated Hutu radio broadcasts. George sustains the breathless dramatic tension as we watch Paul sprint around his hotel trying to keep the Hutu army at bay, the ineffective U.N. officials (lead by a gruffer than normal Nick Nolte) on the grounds, and his own Tutsi family alive while his supplies dwindle, members of his staff turn on him, and hope slowly drips away. Brutal violence is seen outside of the hotel, but George keeps the view of atrocities spare, utilizing them only when he needs to make a persuasive point.  As Paul, Don Cheadle crafts a sublime performance that requires far more than what the actor has been giving the cinema for the last few years. This is a touching performance of frantic internal struggling and the craft of smooth talking, and it reveals that Cheadle has something more to offer the art form. He's wonderful, and the film would be lost without his presence.  Unfortunately for "Rwanda", the script, which was carefully constructed by George over years of research and investigation, takes the audience through repeated ebbs and flows of drama and intrigue as the brutal Hutu army frequently visits the hotel with guns, machettes, and other forms of grisly killing machinery; however, the film never seems to peak.  Sophie Okonedo gives a fine, emotional performance as Paul's estranged Tutsi wife, earning an Oscar nomination for her efforts.  Nolte gives a fairly distilled performance as the lead United Nations saftey supervisor, while Joaquin Phoenix, who plays an assertive, yet sensitive televison new cameraman, is mistakenly taken away from the film halfway through and his talents are enormously wasted.  Just so certain audience members don't go home and stick their heads into ovens, "Hotel Rwanda" does end on a slightly hopeful note, which the right choice for this bleak film. While it isn't the definitive word on the Rwandan holocaust, George has constructed a fine dramatic feature, and a good first step to educating the masses on this disturbing event.  A harrowing story told with adequate execution, "Hotel Rwanda" is a definitive look at the perils of genocide; however, a comparison to "Schindler's List" is unwarranted.  Cheadle gives the performance of a lifetime; perhaps one of the most underappreciated roles of the decade thus far.  Powerful, yet not supremely spectacular.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>This movie is INSPIRATIONAL and is definately a movie I'd buy for anyone on my Christmas wishlist. This movie tugs at your emotional heart strings and makes you leave the theater wanting to be a better human being. Based on a true story during the Rwandain genocide that sadly went on unnoticed to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Paul a man living in Rwanda desperately wants to help his Tutsi wife and three children survive the genocide- hides not only his family but hundreds of Tutsis in the hotel he works at... making sure that they are fed, have a place to sleep and are safe. He does everything in his power to help these people from bribing soliders and virtually begging the United Nations for aide. He ends up becoming a true hero.<br /><br />Paul a common man with common thoughts is portrayed in the movie to be just someone who wanted to help- his act a selfish one in the fact that he could not stand the idea of people being killed and sitting back and watching. The scenes are graphic and disturbing as you hear screams in the street as children and women ared dragged away to die at the hands of a machetti. You see Paul go from being a reasonabley wealthy Rwandian to one that must hide in his hotel and cross corpses on his way to work.<br /><br />The movie dosn't distract unlike Schindler's List- the story focuses solely on Paul and the dilemeas he faces in keeping those in his hotel alive- while you hear/see the events unfolding around him. It is a crime that the movie did not win best picture of the year or that Don Cheadle didn't recieve an Oscar for his OUTSTANDING performance. This movie shows that he is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is a movie that I wish Hollywood made more of- for it's one of those movies that makes you more aware and realize that this CAN never happen again- I felt guilty after watching the movie that the US did not do anything to stop the masacree. It's our responsibility and duty as Americans to prevent these genocides from occuring- right now there is a similiar genocide going on in Sudan. After seeing this movie and the horror- imagine if it was you and your family- what would you do? This movie will make you want to change the world. I hope that people after seeing this movie will decide- we MUST do something. A great movie- well worth it's pricetag and definately a movie to own!</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This film is an absolute masterpiece that speaks about the true events that happened in Rwanda. This movie was very disturbing and I had to fight my tears for most of it. Cheadle gives a hands down absolutely brilliant performance and after seeing Ray, I would have given the oscar to Cheadle even though Foxx was good as well. The movie shows all that this man who owned a large hotel went through to save his people. The town is divided between the Hutu and Tootsies. Cheadle's character is a Hutu but his family and most of his friends are Tootsies. When certain Tootsies kill a Hutu general, the Hutu go after the Tootsies trying to kill all of them. They succeed in many ways in this horryifying story. But, Cheadle's character takes all the Tootsies he can find and hides them in his hotel. This movie shows the atrocities that really occured and also shows how barely any other countries did anything to intervene. It shows even worse the racism in which the governments that help save the whites but just leave the black(tootsies) for dead. This is nevertheless a masterpiece that depicts an atrocity.<br />Seeing this makes me realize how lucky I am to be in the comfort of my home while those poor people had to go through this. But, it also makes me feel very guilty that our government didn't give any sufficient aid in this situation.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This is a great story about tremendous courage and sorrow.  I guess if Rwanda had wells of oil perhaps the great west could more readily recognize a true axis of evil.  However, it never cease to amaze me the evil men can do.  While watching this I kept wondering where was I and what was I doing when this horrible event was happening...and quite honestly I don't know.  The writers and director of this movie performed an excellent job in telling this story and I highly recommend it.  Perhaps we can all learn from it and see to it that nothing like it happens again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>What the "Hotel Rwanda" is can be argued, but what cannot be dismissed is the power of this two hour movie about how one man can make a difference.<br /><br />Is "Hotel Rwanda" a story about internal, contrived politics destroying a country? Or it is dealing with how those in wealthier, more established countries prefer to pretend such trouble does not exist, that they need not become involved?<br /><br />Is it about two very similar people groups killing each other? Could the movie be a reminder of how the systemic killing of a people group can happen today, that the evil of the Jewish Holocaust is not unique to the 1940s?<br /><br />At first glance, "Hotel Rwanda" might look like a condemnation against the West's unwillingness to respond to an absolute carnage of genocidal hate. For some, they might see Bill Clinton, or the United Nations as impotent figures in this tragedy of humanity. They are easy figures to pick on, depending on the audience's personal politics, and the fact of who was in office at the time.<br /><br />For me, the tremendous strength of the movie was one man's valor, of hotel manager's Paul Rusesabagina humble commitment to do the right thing, even though the world around him was chaotically destroying itself.<br /><br />The plot is simple: two of Rwanda's people groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, are killing each other. Mostly, it was Hutu extremists trying to exterminate the Tutsis. A hotel becomes an ad hoc refugee camp, deftly managed by a man who preferred to be anywhere else. Can the hotel remain safe? Will the people hiding there survive?<br /><br />Don Cheadle, perhaps best known for his portrayal as Sammy Davis Jr. in 1998's "The Rat Pack," is hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina.<br /><br />Rusesabagina was just a businessman, the manager of the Belgian-owned Mille Collines, a top hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. He worked hard to raise his family, and tried to keep politically neutral. When he saw neighbors killed, he kept his head low. When he brings in neighbors to be sheltered in the hotel, he still fights to retain his neutrality. However, when refugees start coming to the hotel by the dozens, he begins a new mission as the shepherd of a displaced people.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie is shot within the hotel. Rusesabagina struggles to manage the appearance of a top quality hotel, since this image helps gird them against attacks. Bribes of money and liquor provide him with more protection, as do desperate calls from some 'guests' to their powerful connections outside of Rwanda.<br /><br />When the camera takes us outside, we see awful scenes of gang-style killings. Although the Hutus and Tutsis aren't Bloods, Crips, Vice Lords or Latin Kings, but instead, are arbitrarily designated cultural groups, the murders are the same. Just as in any Chicago, New York or Los Angeles gangland war, the precise reasons for the constant violence are loosely based on dictatorial leadership, bigotry and bloodlust.<br /><br />Listing the scenes which sank my heart is impossible. Singularly difficult to watch was the body-strewn road where Rusesabagina was driving.<br /><br />"Hotel Rwanda" is not a movie to bring a young family. Like "The Passion of the Christ" and "Schindler's List," it has the kind of violence which is shown to remind us of the reality of the events being presented. Like in those movies, the audience I sat with sat stunned while the final credits rolled.<br /><br />Like "Schindler's List," the antihero's commitment is the redemption of the story.

It's basically Schindler's List set in Africa, full of intensely frightening moments and the triumphs of the human spirit. Don Cheadle is finally given his first leading role and man does he ever prove himself worthy of being a leading man. While his role isn't as flashy as Jamie Foxx in "Ray" or Leonardo DiCaprio in "The Avaitor" he still achieves the respect from me by his excellent performance here. The main reason I gave this film four stars is that for some reason it didn't quite impact me the way I thought it would. Don't get me wrong, the events are horrifying (especially when you know almost one million people were killed in a matter of months only 10 years ago), but the movie itself didn't have the impact on me like Schindler's List did. I still consider this a film everyone should see at least once, and it's too bad "Sideways" filled the last Best Picture spot for the Oscars rather than this deserving film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Normally, I'm not a big fan of message movies. Usually the politically correct leanings of the director are more than I care to endure. However, this one surprised me because it's good film-making, in addition to carrying a very heavy message about man's inhumanity to man. Don Cheadle does a great job as the noble hotel manager. The violence is visible, bit not gagging. I add my thumbs up to this very popular flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is by no means a perfect film--the ending is so blindingly happy it's as if the filmmakers forgot about the genocide--but it is well-made, has moments of power, and is a noble attempt to shed light on a terrible moment in recent human history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>There can be little doubt that the greatest human tragedy of 2004 was the Asian tsunami which killed some 300,000 people.  In this one rumbling of the earth's crust, a great swathe of people have their lives snuffed out from Indonesia through Sri Lanka and India to as far a field as Somalia on the coast of Africa.  Nature is truly a cruel mistress.<br /><br />Yet how many people who were brought to tears by this tragedy and rushed to offer help realise that nearly a million people died in 1994 in the tiny nation of Rwanda?  But it's true and the world turned a blind eye.<br /><br />In an attempt to fill the vacuum, "Hotel Rwanda" is a truly great work of art.  The film eschews gratuitous violence as seen in a Hollywood horror film but, nonetheless, serves to remind the viewer of the hell that humans can inflict upon each other.  "Hotel Rwanda" is a must see film for 2005 and it deserves its three Oscar nominations.  One can only hope that it is looked on favourably by the Academy.<br /><br />Don Cheadle as the hero, Paul Rusesabagina, is a revelation.  What's more, this story needed to be told.  Rusesabagina is a 21st century hero in much the same way as Oskar Schindler was in the 20th century.  Cheadle plays a great part and I can only hope that others see the depth of his character.<br /><br />To all readers, see this film!  It is a story that is unknown to the bulk of humanity.  It is a story that is told with grace and impact.  Do not miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan Hutu and manager of the luxurious Mille Collines hotel.  The film is efficient in its story-telling and we are told early that there has been tension ever since the Belgians left because when the Belgian colonists first came to Rwanda they arbitrarily divided up the native Africans into the more elegant and fair-skinned Tutsis and the darker, broader-nosed Hutus.  The Belgians gave a measure of power to the small amount of Tutsi's, and after Belgium leaves the tensions escalate.<br /><br />Rusesabagina is a Hutu, married to a Tutsi (in a wonderful performance by Sophie Okonedo).  A peace agreement is quickly ignored, the Rwandan President's plane is shot from the sky, and the Hutu's are driven by voices of hatred to "Cut the Tall Trees" - a chilling phrase we are told early on is a "signal" for Hutus to murder Tutsis.<br /><br />Rusesabagina opens the doors of the Mille Collines to everyone, most significantly to terrified and hiding Tutsis.  Don Cheadle is the heart and soul of this movie, and we are amazed as we watch him save 1,200 lives by bribing, pleading, outsmarting and standing up to the murderous forces that come to the Mille Collines.  There are several astonishing scenes where Paul essentially shames white Europeans and his Rwandan staff into "doing the right thing".  At one point he is quite certain that the hotel is about to be over-run and everyone inside murdered.  He is incredibly calm as he phones the Belgian headquarters of his hotel company (a brief, but effective cameo by the wonderful Jean Reno) and thanks the company for what they have done, then informs him that they are about to all be killed.<br /><br />Nick Nolte brings the right combination of fear and fearlessness to the role of the Canadian Colonel representing the United Nations, leading a tiny force of UN "peacekeepers, not peacemakers" - he and his troops have their hands tied.<br /><br />This film effectively displays the irrationality of hate crimes and genocide.  The accompanying documentaries are enlightening showing the real Paul Rusesabagina, and we get a sense that the heroism shown in the movie is no exaggeration.  We are also chillingly reminded that genocide is ongoing in Africa (at present in the Congo and Sudan).  The challenge is plainly issued for the world to step up.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie is Don Cheadle's movie.  His quiet gravita carries the weight and he deservedly wins an Oscar's nomination for it.  To put it in a nutshell, Hotel Rwanda is akin to Oskar Schlinder saving the Jews in Schlinder's List.  Here, we would get to see how Rwanda is abandoned by major powers such as French, Belgium, and even America.  Unlike Iraq, Kuwait which have oil that America needs, Rwanda has nothing that those major power craves for.  Even when genocide begins, personnel for the White House is still debating if "genocide" is a just definition of what happened to Rwanda.  One million corpses is quite a body count, isn't it?  Even when Paul (Don Cheadle), House Manager for Mille Colline could leave Rwanda, he morally chooses to stay back to ensure that those under his protection would leave safely.  Established supporting cast such as Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Sophie Okonedo.  A movie to watch, lest we forget of human's propensity to commit evil towards one another.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I did not know much about this movie before I watched it.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is something else)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide important insight not to mention more than a few tears.<br />More relevant than ever, the movie does a great job as an eye-opener to one of the darkest events of the twentieth century.  The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate description of conditions on the ground during the few months that the conflict lasted.  The world's reaction, or lack of it, (especially the American and British hypocrisy and inaction, and the French support of the Hutu perpetrators) is briefly touched upon.<br />Moreover, it could have been and it should have been much more graphic in showing what really took place in Rwanda's "killing fields."<br />Hopefully more will be done to stop the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Western Sudan and we will not have to wait for another movie to come out after it's all over before people become aware and do that which is humane.<br />Similarly to movies like The Lord of War, The Last King of Scotland, and Blood Diamond to name a few, Hotel Rwanda draws attention to some pretty important issues facing Africa.<br />In short, Hotel Rwanda is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Here is Hollywood's exploitation of the 1994 Rwandan genocide that raised Don Cheadle's Tinseltown status to the level of Clint Eastwood and Julie Roberts. By now you probably know it's about a hotelier that saved 1,000 people or so from extermination during the 1994 Tutsi-Hutu uprising.<br /><br />What you may not know is there is another contemporary film on the subject, "Sometimes In April", a made for cable flick from HBO, that in my opinion captures the action, politics and humanity of these events better than this one (see my Amazon review for more on that one).<br /><br />That's not to say this is an average film, for it is clearly better than average. But it is more of a Hollywood that real life production. While the crowd scenes and, especially, the scenes of refugees leaving the city were realistic, most of the violence on screen paled by the standard set in the other film, which concentrated more fully on the human outcomes than this one, which largely were constructed around the activities of one man, his work place, his relationships and family.<br /><br />One thing that irked me to no end watching this was seeling all the Rwandans speak English with an African accent. I checked out Wikipedia and learned that all Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda and share the same culture and religions.<br /><br />So why make a film that's supposed to be semi-documentary on a topic of international interest where, in effect, the Nazis speak English with a German accent? Because it's a Hollywood production, that's why. Sad but true, you know money makes the Hollywood world go round.<br /><br />If you rent this, try to rent "Sometimes In April" and make your own decision on which one better portrays this terrible story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Hotel Rwanda is about a man who, during the early-90's Hutu and Tutsi war (and of course genocide), was faced with extreme challenges, and met as many of them as he could.  The characters name is Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), a man who really existed (and still does), and did become more then a hero for those who were protected in the hotel.  This is that story, and I assure you is quite good.<br /><br />With so many great film aspects too because the acting itself was quite superb, and recognized as many were nominated for Oscars.  However, more then that the movie just seemed to capture the tension, violence, and just absurdity that occurred in those few month's.<br /><br />Because as I mentioned before, the world mostly ignored the violence, yet with this film one cannot escape the realities that were those of the day, in Paul Rusesabagina's home of Rwanda.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Full of tension and turmoil, with one of 2004's best performances by Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda could probably be forgiven for a somewhat mawkish ending. Because the movie stands alone as a great emotional drama and tells of a terrible time in African history where genocide was committed on a vast scale and where the Western world largely ignored what was going on. Now, for the first time, the West can really see the atrocities that were committed on such a large scale.<br /><br />Don Cheadle plays the real life Paul Rusesabagina a smart, focused hotel manager of the Mille Collines, the Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Kigali. Paul is caught up in a nation consumed in ethnic strife, when the ruling Hutu tribe begins the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994.  The Tutsis are considered" cockroaches" and deserve to be slaughtered, but the problem is that many Westerners can't tell the difference. Paul himself is even married to one, the beautiful soft-spoken Tatiana (played with astounding authenticity be Sophie Okonedo).<br /><br />Together with their children, they narrowly escape death many times, as Paul is forced to bribe their very survival. He was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. Cheadle portrays Paul as a smart, sophisticate, who keeps his cool under stress and who understands power, and has a cynical knowledge of the machinations of the outside world. He thinks fast, and can trade favors, whether it is trading U.S. currency to keep his friends alive, or giving jewelry, single-malt Scotch, and Cuban cigars to the local police force to keep the hotel and the refugees safe.<br /><br />There are some wonderful moments in this movie. In one scene there's a bitter conversation where Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) a brusque United Nations soldier. Tells Paul that he's dirt and worth nothing because he's black, and worse a black African. The Colonel, in a fit of helplessness, ultimately blames racism for Western indifference to the Rwandan nightmare. In another scene, Paul, at the last second, decides to remain at the hotel while his wife and children are transported to safety in a United Nations convoy. Minutes later that convoy is raided by the Interahamwe.<br /><br />For a film about genocide there's surprisingly little violence - just enough for the viewer to get a pretty accurate picture of what actually went on. Bodies are strewn everywhere, and there are no hideous mutilations shown - everything is kind of sanitized through a hazy fog. But scenes of military trucks packed with cheering, violence fuelled machete-waving soldiers is enough to keep the viewer on edge.<br /><br />The West's reaction to the drama comes from disparate radio reports, and often in the form of dialogue between the main characters. All the performances are outstanding, and the producers have done an excellent job of recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere of the hotel, where Paul is forced to take care of hundreds of refugees who are sleeping in the corridors, and outside by the pool. Hotel Rwanda is not a great film, but it does do a terrific job of showing how violence and chaos can erupt without warning almost anywhere. Mike Leonard January 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle is simply fantastic portraying the courageous Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who risks everything to save the lives of those targeted for death.  Paul naively thinks that the Western World will never allow genocide to take place.  He realizes too late that liberals are inclined toward pacifist remedies.  Also, the fact that some white soldiers would inevitably have to shoot black thugs does not help things.  Political correctness reigns supreme within the halls of the West's liberal institutions.  Paul and his wife Sophie (Tatiana Rusesabagina) are living the good life.  They are educated and economically well off.  The ethnic differences between the Hutu and Tutsi are not relevant to them.  They soon learn that others don't agree.  Some will not hesitate to massacre even the infants of their ethnic opposites.  We watch as the horror unfolds.  It appears that Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is able to stop the murderers when push comes to shove.  And yet his superiors will not allow him to employ violence regardless of the circumstances.  This is, needless to add, not escapist entertainment.  I hate to guilt trip anybody, but perhaps it is a moral imperative to see Hotel Rwanda from beginning to end.  Who said that you have a right to look the other way?<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda should have been made around ten years ago.  Unfortunately, the liberal Hollywood establishment most likely desired to protect both President Bill Clinton and the the ineffective Kofi Annan.  I'm sure that a lot of people wanted to stop the making of Hotel Rwanda.  The United Nations comes across as feckless and impotent.  Why does it exist?  What purpose does it serve?  These are unavoidable questions which will haunt you.  Director Terry George has put together a great film.  I cannot praise him enough.  There is no question but that Hotel Rwanda earns five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>The 1994 Rwanda civil war - one of the worst civil conflicts in the 20th Century, kept in low profile as the region did not hold much sway over strategic interests of the American and European powers. Clinton's administration pulled out at a critical time and the U.N. were ineffective as around a million Tutsis were massacred by the Hutu ruling party.<br /><br />So highly relevant territory for a major film telling the true story of Raul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), owner of the 4 star Hotel des Mille Collins in Kigali, who uses his patronage to provide refuge for Hutus and Tutsis in the midst of the fighting.<br /><br />The horrific violence - medieval in its close up brutality with machetis, is not overblown at the centre of the action but lurks very close to the edges - the sinister indictments of hate broadcast on the radio, massacres viewed at long shot, eyewitness reports, overheard conversations. A range of techniques bring the conflict to life, in an almost documentary style.<br /><br />It is this aspect of the movie which makes it worth watching over the story, which is a fairly standard one of everyman rises to hero in time of conflict to protect those around him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Or, "Sir, would you like some DEATH with during your stay?"<br /><br />Yes, Don Cheadle owns, quietly, every scene in this flick.<br /><br />Yes, director Terry George & vet cinematographer Bob Fraisse (who served up the kinetic street warfare in "Ronin") cook up a little deadly cinematic ghoulash. They evoke, vividly, the feral sink of depravity that was Rwanda in 1994, when more than a million Hutus & Tutsis were slaughtered in an orgy of ferocious destruction, turning the land into a reeking abattoir.<br /><br />But in the end, so what? What is the point here?<br /><br />If the point is that something Horrible happened in Africa---well, folks, get over it. Something horrible is always happening in Africa: ask the Sudanese in Darfur, where a brutal genocide against the south is carried out by the Muslim Janjaweed militia, who have slaughtered nearly a million in the last two years, who take delight in refining their tactics of rape and carnage.<br /><br />Or ask the Cambodians, whose skulls their former God-Emperor Pol Pot used to stack by the millions, as if building little bony towers to heaven, even as liberal lion Noam Chomsky apologized for him.<br /><br />Or dial up the thousands of Iranian students huddled in broomclosets in Iran, who are regularly beaten, abducted, tortured, and killed for daring to voice dissent to the Mullahocracy's iron rule there.<br /><br />I'm sure you would have heard outrage had you parachuted into Iraq before April 2003---muted, because an Iraqi expressing his revulsion for Saddam's death camps, torture factories, & rape rooms would have been in danger of apprehension by the hated secret police---and maybe had his tongue pulled off for his troubles.<br /><br />What happened? The UN dithered & stalled (just as it did with Rwanda, as it does with the Sudan), despite Saddam's violation of more than 13 separate sanctions over the past decade. Eager to remove Saddam---for his atrocities, for the threat his intransigent regime posed the US, and for his probable secret WMD program (moved to Syria while the US waltzed with the UN for fruitless months)---the US took action, and deposed the tyrant in weeks.<br /><br />Did the US mishandle post-war Iraq? Absolutely. But for its troubles, the US, and particularly President Bush, received nothing but international vilification: for saving millions of Iraqis from torture & tyranny, Bush was branded "a new Hitler". Liberal 'experts' now assure us we have no place remaining in the middle of a "civil war".<br /><br />You know, a 'Civil War'. Just like in Rwanda. Or in the Sudan.<br /><br />Which is why this type of movie, however beautifully acted, however balefully true, however illlustrative of the savagery of Man at his worst---its appeal eludes me. Does it make you feel righteous, weeping over the long-buried dead, while ignoring those about to be shoveled into the charnel pit? Does it make you feel oh-so-sweet-sanctimony?<br /><br />Remember this, then: the next time you weep into your popcorn over cinematic bloodshed: when another tribe, another people, face the cameras with tears in their eyes and bayonets in their backs & beg rescue from a weary West, the answer will likely be: "Sorry, it's none of our business. Try the UN."<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>One of the lines in the movie was "Most people that are watching what is going on over here mearling say, "that is to bad" and then go on eating their dinner."<br /><br />Those were words that haunted me throughout the rest of the film.  Now LUCKY we are to be Americans.  To be able to say and do anything and not be killed for it.  Even those jerks that high behind the first ammendment.  We as Americans have no idea how wonderful life is for us because we have never had to deal with such horrors as you will view in this film.<br /><br />Of course we had 911 in which most people have forgotten about or don't care about anymore because if we are not directly affected by it we seem to loose interest very fast because we live are lives very fast and don't take time to smell the roses.<br /><br />Everyone including children should view this masterpiece of a film.

This was the war which our liberal press and our then president, Bill Clinton, purposely choose to ignored despite of its genocidical nature.<br /><br />Don Cheadle did a wonderful job as a moral man in a very immoral position. Instead of taking the easy path for safety, he choose to take a route of human responsiblity by protecting those who could not protect themselves. Cheadle's effort clearly earned him the nomination for Academy Award for best actor. He was well supported by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife and also earned a nomination for best supporting actress. There are genuine chemisty between the two and their relationship create the foundation for why Don Cheadle's character did what he did. In simple terms, the film worked because Cheadle's character was believable despite of the fact that this movie was based on a true story.<br /><br />The film did bring out the Rwandan Civil War to the movie theaters. Script did have to called to attention the differences between the Tutsi and Hutu since most Americans probably don't know or really care. But casual ease that these Africans slaughtered each other may surprised many people.<br /><br />The film itself wasn't that high of a caliber. The movie was definitely too long, Nick Nolte was badly miscast as the UN military commander and the script was underwritten as most of the characters in the movie appears to be somewhat lightweight. Only Don Cheadle's character was totally fresh out and thanks to the great work by that actor, Paul Rusesabagina came alive. Sophie Okonedo brought her character alive despite of having a pretty limited character. For that, she earned her nomination for an Oscar.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty decent film but only because the two lead actors were so good. Without Don Cheadle or Sophie Okonedo to carry the load, this film could easily be one of them easily forgettable made for TV flicks that would get three days of hype by the network and disappeared.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is hotel manager at a swanky 4-star Belgian report in Rwanda in 1994. When Hutu-Tutsi violence begins, he must use all of his charm, hotel resources and favors to save 1600 of his family and countrymen from brutal deaths at the hands of rampaging mobs and militias.<br /><br />This episodic film is more notable for the importance of bringing the Rwandan genocide to the screen than for its acting, sets or script. There's a certain unidimensionality to the characters, who either are very good, or very evil, or on their way to becoming so. The plot is somewhat contrived, with the small band of refugees at Rusesabagina' hotel enduring a series of escalating threats until (in the nick of time!) they manage to flee. The clich&eacute;d approach to a horrifying story dulls its impact. Still, "Hotel Rwanda" raises important questions about the role of the outside world (media, government, business) in moderating brutality. It shined a spotlight on the lack of interest that "civilized" nations had in stopping the killing. The scenes in which white church workers abandoned their African "friends" was more than a little infuriating.<br /><br />Three cheers for Cheadle, though, who was completely convincing (if 2 turns too noble) as an African man in the midst of chaos. A thumbs-sideways for the film's toned-down violence. True, more people may see the film than if its violence was R-rated, but the lack of horror drained the movie of its emotional context.<br />I give the film three stars for quality, plus one for civic value.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is a fairly absorbing movie about the massacre in Rwanda/Burundi in 1994.  Most of us have come to understand that the world stood by while genocide was taking place in this country.  However, at the same time, a massive military intervention ocurred in the Balkans over "ethnic cleansing".  There was a definite issue over whether or not American and European countries were willing to aid Europeans in trouble but not Africans in greater trouble.  It is an issue many people still struggle with.  Upon viewing "Hotel Rwanda" many will be inclined to agree that the world did not care enough about the fate of Black Africans to intervene in their behalf.  I'm not completely certain whether the movie suggests this because it is the truth or whether it is the true because the movie suggests it.  However, I have no problem with the movie's efforts to make a statement on the issue.<br /><br />This is a very good movie about one man's heroic efforts to protect roughly 1200 people who otherwise would probably have been killed.  I understand that this is based on actual events and I am glad that this individual's bravery has been presented for the world to acknowledge.  I found the suspense, frustration and fear to be very well developed in "Hotel Rwanda".<br /><br />My main issue with "Hotel Rwanda" is that I had to play back a number of scenes in the movie because I had no idea what had just been said.  I had to replay some scenes three or more times.  There is an accent of the actors that was difficult for me to easliy understand.  This may have been a issue unique to me and my mild hearing problem.  However, if I saw this movie in a theater without the ability to replay the various scenes, I may have had an even harder time understanding who represented what.  As it was there was a lot that was explained too briefly for me to always be sure what was going on, why, and how some people were related to others.  That may seem to some like I'm quibling over minor points and missing the big picture.  However, I felt that it inhibited me from being able to fully appreciate the big picture.<br /><br />I thought Don Cheadle made a case for himself as a serious actor.  However, after the complaints I heard about his not receiving the recent Best Actor Oscar, I'm afraid I expected more that I got.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and one I would readily encourage others to watch.  I did not think, however, that is is a "great" movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Wow!  Just wow!  I am impressed with this one.  I was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when I first heard about this one, seeing how I normally associate Tim Meadows, with flat, not very funny, comedies, when he stars, and very vague cameo and side roles in other Adam Sandler and Will Ferrel main Headliner movies!<br /><br />But this one, wow! He is really a talented individual!<br /><br />I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.  His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.<br /><br />I also like how this movie, once again paired up Nick Nolte and Mr. Meadows, for the first time since 48 Hours!  Nothing short of brilliance, I say!  While Mr. Meadow's role was much more dramatic in Hotel Rwanda, keep in mind, he did show a sufficient amount of that "angry black" character he is famous for in 48 Hours.<br /><br />Definitely pick up this movie!  You won't be sorry!<br /><br />MC White said:  You'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up, and memorize all of the Main Character's names!

As an American reporter says: "People will watch this massacre and murder and say, what a shame, and turn back to their dinner."<br />And that is exactly what happened.<br />"Hotel Rwanda" is shot in flat, almost non-dimensional color that detracts from the inherent drama of this story. Think about the hand held camerawork and use of color in Oliver Stone's "Salvador." "HR" is the opposite of that groundbreaking film in execution.<br />But, and this is a big BUT: there is the courageous performance of Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who becomes the savior, through cagey-thinking, horse-sense really, to thousands of Rwandans. Cheadle's Paul is frightened yet calm: his expressive eyes and face always thinking, pondering about what to do next to save his family, friends and whomever else he can: through whatever means he can.<br />"Hotel Rwanda" is not a great movie but it is an important one for it tells a story that everyone everywhere needs to know, understand and digest. Why did all of the major powers turn their heads when it was happening? Why did We allow this to happen?</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>This inspiring movie should be shown at every NRA annual banquet, along with Schindler's List, as cautionary tales about a totally powerless and disarmed populace. Also a testament to the utter uselessness of the United Nations, who have presided over a couple more massacres and genocides in our time. "The West" is criticized for not intervening, but isn't the UN the voice of the whole world? If "The West" was immoral and wrong not to intervene (and I'm quite sure the US wanted to step in there and vaporize those murdering scum) where was the rest of the planet? Where was the moral voice of the UN? Nowhere, apparently. A familiar scenario.<br /><br />This movie paints a horrifying picture that we can only hope to avoid by sending oodles of cash to Smith and Wesson. The total helplessness of the unarmed citizenry will make you want to find your nearest gun dealer. I mean, really, that's the thought running through your mind the whole film. That's why even proponents of gun control have been found to own their own guns, like Carl Rowan. I myself don't have one, but this movie made me think about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Hotel Rwanda is just average. Cheadle does a great job. He speaks well with an accent, and he is very convincing when everything falls apart around him. When he speaks to the staff at the hotel about calling loved ones, you feel like he means what he says. When he cries from the dead bodies along the road, you feel his despair.  Although Jamie Foxx won an oscar for Ray, I think that Cheadle did a better job of making me connect with someone I had never heard of before.<br /><br />Aside from Cheadle's acting, not much in the film stands out in my opinion. When people are getting slaughtered everywhere, I am confused as to what Nick Nolte is actually doing. He doesn't shoot anyone during the entire film, even when people are being killed around him. I'm not saying he should of killed someone, but it's hard to connect with someone who doesn't seem enthusiastic about helping. Don Cheadle's Wife in my opinion is flat out terrible. She isn't likeable at all. Moreso, she is always crying about something. She cries at the drop of a hat(cliche), and it just makes her appear weak and cowardly. Yes, tons of people are dying around her, but she doesn't have to bawl at every chance she gets. The other part of the movie I hated was the ending. The ending just feels rushed. I'm not saying the ending is bad. It just feels like they made it in a hurry to make a different movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Hotel Rwanda' is just a medicore film about a horrific, undercovered, and forgetten genocide in the African country of Rwanda.  The genocide occured in 1994 and it is now finally being revealed to the majority of the American public.  Nothing really stood out in the film that made me remember it too much.  Watch a PBS documentary about the event if it comes on television one of these days.  It will most likely be more informative and enlightening than this movie.  Making a movie about a tragic event does not make it automatically worthwhile or rewarding.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>While it was easily one of the best movies in a slow year last year, Hotel Rwanda was just as easily among the most frightening.  The prevailing storyline may be a moving and inspiring, but it takes place against the backdrop of some of the most horrific events in recent memory.  In a manner reminiscent of Schindler's List and The Pianist, Hotel Rwanda uses its story to shed a stark light on one of those instances where the unthinkable happens, namely the Rwandan genocide of 1994.  Fuelled by decades-old tribal hatred stemming from the days of Belgian colonization, and enabled by the fear and indifference of a Western world still reeling from the then-recent disaster in Somalia, that year the majority Hutus unleashed a paroxysm of violence against the country's Tutsi minority, killing nearly a million men, women, and children in a period of barely three months.  While ethnic and tribal clashes are nothing new-witness Israel, Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia-the convergence of factors in this case seemed especially combustible, a fact to which the staggering body count certainly attested.<br /><br />Exploring the genocide mostly through the eyes of one man, the movie seeks to find redemption among horror by illustrating a single instance of the best of human nature in the midst of an explosion of the worst.  Don Cheadle has a tall order in filling the role of real-life protagonist Paul Rusesabagina, but he manages to bring equal amounts of passion and nuance to a role that demands both.  For those who don't know by now, Rusesabagina was the Hutu manager of the prestigious Hotel Milles Collines in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, a hotel that literally became a refugee camp when over a thousand people sought shelter there from the guns and machetes of the rampaging Hutu milita.  The movie wisely portrays Paul as less a born hero than one who had heroism thrust upon him, as the narrative sees him emerge from a consumnate businessman concerned with himself and his family (his wife was a Tutsi) to the savior of hundreds, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.  While it should go without saying that Hotel Rwanda is a dramatization and therefore not entirely factual per se, the portrayal of its hero is never less than believable.<br /><br />The violence is largely implied, rather than explicit-there's nothing to match the most cringe-inducing scenes in Schindler's List or The Pianist-but the film more than succeeds in capturing the sheer terror of what was occurring.  This is never more true than in perhaps the film's most harrowing scene, when a minor fender bender lands Paul and a villainous employee in a clearing-turned-slaughterhouse, and Paul gets out of his van to the sight of corpses strewn out literally as far as the eye can see.  There's no action or dialogue, but the harsh reality of senseless massacre is still put on the sharpest possible display.  Even more than the violence itself, though, the dehumanization necessary to murder on such a massive scale manages to terrify: much like the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking, the Rwandan genocide was spurred by a belief that the enemy was completely outside the bounds of normal human decency.  Alternately referring to the Tutsis as traitors and "cockroaches," the Hutus were able to justify their indiscriminate butchering of civilians with the time-honored devices of scapegoating and projection, which are ultimately the backing for pretty much all such atrocities.<br /><br />The movie also conveys yet another sad reality of human nature with its implications of the widespread apathy that greeted news of the atrocities in the Western world.  Granted, many countries were in no mood for foreign entanglements in the wake of the bungling of the humanitarian crisis in Somalia (including the deaths of 18 American soldiers vividly depicted in Black Hawk Down), but in light of the occcurrences in Rwanda the refusal to intervene shown by the so-called international community was still shocking.  Unfortunately, Western governments were concerned primarily with protecting their own, as the movie bitterly demonstrates when the United Nations peackeeping forces aren't allowed to evacuate anyone from Kigali but foreign nationals.  Of course, people everywhere tend to be concerned primarily with their own-their families, their friends, their countrymen-so the tragedies of Rwanda ultimately aren't all that surprising.  The impotence of the UN is brought into especially sharp relief through the well-meaning Canadian colonel played in career-reviving fashion by Nick Nolte, whose good intentions are outweighed by his inability to do much of anything to stop the rampant bloodshed.  It's not at all surprising to see Paul quickly reduced to bribery and bargaining with the Rwandan army and Hutu militia to keep his charges alive.  While there are some moments of odd poignancy and even dark humor to be found here, for the most part Hotel Rwanda is a depressing (if still necessary) watch largely because it illuminates the aspects of our nature that we don't often acknowledge.  Ignorance and insularity are realities of life in the U.S. these days (we're at war with Iraq right now, but how many Americans have been there or even know what countries border it?), and Hotel Rwanda is clearly intended to reflect those realities back at its viewers.<br /><br />Now, before I take my leave of this overly long review, it should be noted that Hotel Rwanda tells only a small part of the story of Rwanda, and it's a fictionalized part at that.  Watching it doesn't substitute for reading about the events themselves and what they can tell us, so you shouldn't expect it to (which is also why so many of the criticisms I've seen of this movie on this site are off base; people seem to be knocking it for not being something it's not supposed to be).  However, if this movie manages to stimulate some thought and discussion, all the better.  Whatever the case, though, it's certainly a brilliant movie in its own right, filled with powerful imagery, moral indignation, and Cheadle's captivating acting.  And if you do feel like reading up about the Rwandan genocide, may I suggest Scott Peterson(no, not the murderer)'s gripping book Me Against My Brother.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>Because . . .<br /><br />1.

The story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Rwandan hotel manager who strove to save as many of his neighbors as possible from genocidal government troops, requires no embellishment to make it powerful, and George gives it none: he tells it as straightforwardly as possible, with a minimum of trickery and just enough gore to get the point across. (The relative lack of gore has caused some critics to turn thumbs-down on the movie; if George were really true to the story, they said, it should have been a bloodbath on the level of "Saving Private Ryan." I find myself in agreement with George, however; he said that by toning down the gore and getting a PG-13 rather than R rating, he could reach the young people who really need to know what happened in Rwanda.) The story here is as old as history, and as new as today's evening news: the endless ability of a mob of people to find pretexts to hate and kill, and the vitally important message that one person CAN make a difference, even in the midst of murderous chaos. The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part, but special mention must be made of Cheadle, who gives a performance of heartbreaking intensity and purity as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, who is deeply moving as Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana. This powerful film is a stern rebuke to us comfortable Westerners, who--as one character in the film points out--watched the horrors in Rwanda unfold on the evening news, said, "How horrible," and went on eating our dinners.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>About half way through this film hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (a Hutu) and his family are hiding on the roof of the hotel, and his wife Tatiana (a Tutsi) turns to him and says, "Paul, you are a good man." That, and not so much the genocide of nearly a million Rwandans, is the theme of this award-winning film--how one person's bravery, cunning, diplomacy, deceit, bribery and wits saved over a thousand people, many of them Tutsi refugees that the Hutu extremists sought to exterminate.

The movie is marked by a number of fine, understated minor performances, including small turns from Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno, as well as excellent work from Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo (as Rusesabagina's wife), and, somewhat surprisingly, Nick Nolte, whose career has really taken an upswing since Affliction.<br /><br />Not that the movie doesn't have its flaws; I'd have liked to see a lot more development in Gregoire's character, given how important he becomes towards the end of the film, for example; but what's here is sterling. Cheadle plays Rusesabagina as a consummate businessman, the kind of guy who's going to try not to rock the boat for as long as humanly possible, the most reluctant of heroes. His character stays believable even when everything else about him has entered the realm of the ludicrous. (You won't believe the film's ending until you read the little "what happened to...?" snippets afterwards.) Impressive, that.<br /><br />A fantastic film.

That's when you question the objectives of governments who want to 'free' other countries from 'opression' of dictators and genocide. Where were these guys when 1 million people lost their lives in Rwanda? Perhaps, 1 million rwandan lives meant nothing to them and in future the countries from which we have nothing to gain will remain sub-human and meaningless to governments like ours. Don Cheadle gives the performance of his lifetime, before this I thought he was best in Out of Sight, but the performance in Hotel Rwanda overshadows the one in Out of Sight, and all of his other movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I have never cried through any movie more than I cried through this one.

I understand that there was hardship before between the two but when leaving people of the same country in charge, I would've hoped things would've ceased. I understand that people have built up hate from being the "lesser" when the Belgia were there, but turning on their own people does not help the situation. I do understand their anger though.  Mistrust can make people do funny things.  I find it even worse that the same people who started differentiating between the two are the people who were too cowardly to go back.  I am not surprised.  I think this may make lots of people in America uncomfortable from visualizing what can happen if the minority becomes the majority and withholds anger from predudice and racism in the past.  Fortunately, I doubt this will happen.  I cried so hard at the end of this movie that you would've thought I knew the people personally, and I am absolutely not a cryer.  Phenomenal movie.

THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The thought of almost a million people killed over a 100-day period is beyond imagination, but that is exactly what happened a mere ten years ago in Rwanda when the dominant Hutu tribe slaughtered the minority Tutsi tribe in a civil war that drew little media attention, and much worse, minimal help from the United Nations peacekeeping forces. The killings were the most brutal possible, as the Tutsis were murdered one person at a time. Just like Oskar Schindler, Paul Rusesabagina is the unlikeliest of heroes, as this soft-spoken family man and savvy negotiator is put to the test in the posh H?tel des Milles Collines, which he manages in the capital city of Kigali. Against absurd odds, he is able to provide refuge for nearly 1,300 Tutsis and consequently saved their lives. Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force. Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. Consequently, there is less emphasis on the actual killings and the political leaders involved, though enough is shown to leave a lasting impression. The prospect of death always feels imminent as the story whittles away all the parties who could have helped the Tutsis but chose not to.<br /><br />Generally a dependable supporting player in grade-A Hollywood pictures, Don Cheadle is an inspired choice to play this reluctant hero, as the actor economically portrays a man used to making deals to get what he needs for the hotel and then uses this skill in response to the shocking events to pacify the Hutu general in charge. In fact, most of the film consists of his increasingly desperate negotiations as the stakes continue to climb, including making a devastating choice to stay at the war-torn hotel while pushing his family onto a truck that could mean their escape. Cheadle plays these key scenes with minimum fuss and makes them all the more emotionally resonant, in particular, when he has a delayed reaction to seeing corpses strewn on a fog-blanketed road and weeps uncontrollably as he is dressing to bargain yet again. Matching him every step of the way is the superb Sophie Okonedo, who transforms the standard wife-and-mother role of Tatiana into something quite transcendent. Effective in much smaller roles are Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force; Joaquin Phoenix as a cynical photojournalist; Cara Seymour as a compassionate Red Cross worker; and Hakeem Kae-Kazim as the wily Hutu general George Rutanganda.<br /><br />The DVD has two excellent documentaries. The first is "A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda", one of the better making-of featurettes given the participation of the real Paul Rusesabagina, who reasons that the lack of global, specifically American, support in 1994 for the Tutsis had to do with the devastating U.S. losses suffered in Somalia and the fact that Rwanda has no bargaining chip of economic value, i.e., no oil, no natural resources other than coffee and tea. The second, "Return to Rwanda", movingly follows Paul and Tatiana Rusesabagina back to their native land after living years in exile in Belgium. He even participates in the audio commentary along with George and singer Wyclef Jean. Strongly recommended, in fact, essential viewing of a reenactment of a massive genocide swept under the rug by the Western media.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film tells of a disturbing, shameful, and tragic episode in Rwandan history, a story that was shaped by the colonial racial politics of its former Belgian masters. In 1994, the African republic of Rwanda descended into civil war. The Hutu majority, inflamed by the political rhetoric of guerilla radio, rose up against the Tutsi minority. This tribal warfare led to mass murder, with neighbor against neighbor, and would eventually see nearly a million Rwandans killed.<br /><br />During this time of great turmoil, fear, and slaughter, an oasis existed in the capital city of Kigali. That oasis was the Belgian owned luxury hotel, Milles Collines. There, its native manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a member of the Hutu majority, would find himself in the role of  shepherd with a flock of refugees on his hands, which would include his own wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okenedo), a member of the Tutsi minority, and their children.<br /><br />After the non-native guests and non-native refugees were evacuated to safety, Rusesabagina was left with the daunting task of taking care of nearly twelve hundred native guests and refugees, many of which were the hunted Tutsis, which just outside the gates of the hotel were being indiscriminately massacred, butchered with machetes or shot execution style at point blank range. Extermination of the Tutsi minority was the agenda of the day, and none, including children, were to be spared.<br /><br />While a handful of United Nations peacekeepers were at the gates of the hotel, their presence was only for show, as their orders were not to shoot. One of them (Nick Nolte) finally told Rusesabagina, who was hoping for help from the outside world, that not a single country was going to lift a finger to help them, and he brutally told him exactly why. So, Rusesabagina was left with having to maneuver around the corrupt Hutu militia, getting supplies and whatever protection that he could, to ensure survival. Situational ethics was the order of the day, as Rusesabagina bribed, wheedled, and did everything he could to ensure that those in his care would survive and outlast the madness and carnage that  was going on all around them.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film, deftly directed by Terry George, who keeps the carnage and gore to a minimum. Yet, he manages with just a few well-placed scenes to convey a sense of the overwhelming magnitude of the genocide that took place, while the entire world watched and did nothing.  Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance, low-keyed, controlled; yet, nonetheless, deeply moving.  Were it not for the extraordinary performance of Jamie Foxx in "Ray", there is little doubt that Don Cheadle, who, along with Foxx, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, would have won. The rest of the supporting cast also give stellar performances.<br /><br />This is a brilliantly acted, well-directed film that deserves a place in one's personal collection.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Cheadle does an excellent job and we are shown what we ignored, to our shame. And it still goes on. A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed.  HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world.  HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers.  How many of us knew about this incident before now?<br /><br />But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people,  and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters.  With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.<br /><br />The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational.  Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead.  All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can.  Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb.  The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored.  This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement.

Cheadle races to save his family and the people around him in order to survive this massacre.This powerful, intense and true story hits you hard...it hits you at the core.

He and his family had been missionaries in Africa, specifically Kenya and Rwanda.  We became friends.  Two years later as the rest of the world ignored the genocide that was occurring in Rwanda, I watched some of the suffering my friend had to go through.  People he had known, went to school with, worked with, and played were now dead and there was nothing he could do about it.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a movie that tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a sort of modern day Oskar Schindler, who used his influence, contacts, and limited funds to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis refugees by housing them in the Milles Collines Hotel that he managed in Rwanda.<br /><br />For historical reasons that really were insignificant, the Hutus in Rwanda came to power and using the military available to them began an extermination of Tutsis.  In a period of just three months over one-million Tutsis were executed by the Hutus.  Many of Tutsis women were raped before being killed and family homes that had stood for generations were completely destroyed.  The Tutsis appealed to the world at large, specifically the United Nations.  However, for the most part, the world sat silent as a massive genocide not seen since the days of Hitler took place.  The Tutsis people were left to defend for themselves and the HOTEL RWANDA became their only refuge.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA captures a glimpse of the despair, frustration, and isolation that many people in Rwanda felt in those bleak days of 1994.  Don Cheadle gives an Oscar-worthy performance portraying Paul Rusesabagina.  It is rumored that the film's producers tried to get everyone from Denzel Washington to Wesley Snipes to portray Rusesabagina, but director Terry George insisted from the beginning that Cheadle was the man for the part and in the end his choice was correct.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a moving film portraying how the courage, compassion, and conviction of one person can make a difference in the world.  At the same time, the movie is somewhat somber because it reminds us that though the events that happened in Rwanda in 1994 were unusual because of the massive scale of murder that happened in such a short time, the events themselves really aren't that unusual and are a reality that many people in Africa have to face everyday.  Events similar to what happened in Rwanda are happening right now in Uganda, Nigeria, and other African nations.  Except for in Nigeria, because of their relatively large oil reserves, the rest of the world ignores the horrors that happen in these nations.  HOTEL RWANDA is a film that works incredibly well because it forces viewers to taste their guilt for idly sitting by and doing nothing as a continent rips itself apart.  There aren't very many films that can do that and do it so well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>When I first heard about Rwanda and the massacres in the spring of 1994, I wanted to do something about it and was horrified that America wouldn't get involved, mostly because of our bad experience in Somalia just 6 months earlier as well as still deep-rooted racism that is apparent in our media and military actions (the recent Tsunami disaster another example). Shamefully, our country (as well as Europe) views the problems of Africa and most of Asia (beyond the Middle East) as not worth much to sacrifice our lives. Because we ignored the problem and allowed the massacre of nearly a million lives, it is important to have books and movies speak out about this crisis. For that reason, I am grateful that this film was made.<br /><br />Though the similarities to "Schindler's List" are apparent (like Oskar Schindler, who saved 1200 Jews from the Holocaust, Paul Rusesibagina, a Manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, managed to save 1200 Rwandans--the Tutsi minority--from being slaughtered). Paul used whatever cunning and lies he could to save his people at every little setback...which included bribery, booze, desperate calls to the Hotel chain's European financial backers, and outright lies to the Hutu General about his being on the U.S. hitlist for war crimes. This film shows that in desperate situations, situational ethics applies, as a strict moralist would likely end up dead. Using personal relationship with thugs to save lives is a lot better than any sanctimonial denouncement of the thug's behavior.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is amazing in this film, as he nails the accent perfectly. The scene where he breaks down and cries after having seen the devastation of the massacre with his own eyes is heartbreaking to watch. If not for Jamie Foxx's phenomenal performance as Ray Charles, I think Don Cheadle would have deserved the Best Actor Oscar this year.<br /><br />The song "Million Voices" by Wyclef Jean is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to Rwanda, as it encorporates a children's choir and relevant lyrics about the human disaster that remains part of Rwanda's historical legacy. After the Holocaust, many people vowed, "Never Again!" would they allow such genocide to take place...yet as we have seen from history, it happened in the Soviet Gulags, on the killing fields of Cambodia, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, and now in Sudan. Films like these are important to bring about awareness, but in the end, its really a calling to us, daring us to take action in whatever way we can.<br /><br />The DVD features a short documentary on the real Paul Rusesibagina's return to Rwanda, as we see the horrible preservation of some bodies (at first, I didn't realize I was looking at human remains...they looked like white plaster statues of stick figures). In a way, such a preservation will probably force people to remember, as the human tendency seems to be towards, "it never happened." We must remember what evil is capable of achieving...and that it was possible to slaughter half a million people by machetes alone. See this film and may it fill you with a hope to act out whenever injustice rears its ugly head, in whatever form it takes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Terry George's "Hotel Rwanda" ought to be mandatory viewing for all United States citizens who see the Rwandan genocide as something remote that happened 'over there' to a class of people whose lives somehow don't matter as much as ours do.<br /><br />The triumph of the film is that the actors - most notably leads Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo - humanize the recounting to the extent where it resonates with its audience on a personal level.  In contrast, stories where the audience is told "and X thousand people were slaughtered" tend to get marginalized.  It's maddening, but it's the reality.  Credit director George for recognizing this truth and latching on to a great way to relate the true extent of this tragedy.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pair "Hotel Rwanda" with a viewing of HBO's harsher, more in-your-face "Sometimes in April."  Think of it as an inside-outside combination: in "Rwanda," you're inside the Hotel Mille Coline (in capital city Kigali) looking out; in "April," you're outside the hotel trying to get in.  The result of viewing the two films is to give you a compelling 360-degree view of these shocking sequence of events.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>A big rap from the few mainstream writers critical of Hotel Rwanda, intimated again today in the New York Times, is that it was not graphic enough in depicting the scenes of genocide in Rwanda.  Huh??? How pathetic an attitude is that?? And what does it say about us as a society??  Do we really need to see gruesome machete cuts close up to understand the genocidal horror of Rwanda in 1994??<br /><br />But this is a review, not the late Susan Sontag on the state of American culture as reflected by its writing critics.  And for this reviewer, Hotel Rwanda must be seen for its depiction of  one man's desperate and resourceful efforts to save lives in the eye of homicidal insanity.  Paul Rusesabagina did what he had to do, flattering and making deals with human vermin, and as a result more than 1000 people alive who otherwise would be dead.  He is a hero and this movie makes that correct judgment unequivocal.  But if the personal story of this one man is clear, Hotel Rwanda, through the character of Nick Nolte,  makes no less clear the complicity of the world for its refusal to intervene in a timely way to mitigate the slaughter.  Nolte portrays the UN peacekeeper colonel who is revulsed by what he is seeing, by the limited mandate -- not to mention manpower -- he has to oppose it, and by the developed world's interest in saving its own white-skinned citizens, period.<br /><br />Rwanda was 1994; a decade later we get this film made in the U.S. and continued silence from the European countries most responsible -- by their colonial-era policies -- for contributing to the horror.  Now it's 2005 and there is a place called Darfur and a sad new chance for the world to make history, or, in a decade's time, another movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Every actor in this film is excellent and delivers a rather understated performances.  Perhaps it's because the harrowing and tragic tale is something the real-life people portrayed here have come accustomed to somehow and that is a tragic commentary in of itself.  In any event, this film while filled with excellent supporting actors belongs to its lead, Don Cheadle who earned a Best Actor nod for this performance (and should have won hands down).<br /><br />Cheadle has been building an impressive resume with memorable supporting roles in which he nearly eclipses his leads.  He began his career on TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJ6">Picket Fences - Season 1</a> and remainded on the show for it's entire run and eventually emerged as the star of it.  He then went on to cool roles like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630528072X">Volcano</a> with Tommy Lee Jones and facinating and complex roles such as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>, but nothing compares to his quiet, restrained performance in this film that I can only compare his role and delivery of it to Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225857">To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)</a> in which both actors have the challenging task of exhibiting what I call "quiet courage" under great calamity and showing their great love and compassion for others without exactly "showing" it.  It's all in their subtle gestures, whispered dialogue, and revealing eyes.  Both films remind me of that old adage teachers like myself live by, "no cares how much you know until they know how much your care."<br /><br />I, like other reviewers here, went into this film knowing nothing about the topic.  I rented it based upon my respect of Don Cheadle and the positive reviews that surrounded this film when it was released.  Again, I knew nothing about the topic of the film itself and was I shocked by the events that unfolded in the film.  It is truly a harrowing tale told with great respect and dignity.  I found no silly cliches or trite treatment of this compelling and important event in history.<br /><br />This film is outstanding and it that will move you and stay with you long after the experience of viewing it is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>That is what Hotel Rwanda is all about, BUT more importantly it ends with hope, hope that this will never happen again.  Don Cheadle gives a performance of a lifetime in this movie.  I say that a really good movie can make you tear up, and I was tearing up during this movie.<br /><br />Terry George has directed a fabulous film.  Everything is woven together wonderfully.  This movie never turns to melodrama and has a documentary type feel to it.  Like United 93(another great movie)it draws you in and you know what is going to happen, but when it does you still find yourself in tears.  That is what great movies do.<br /><br />The sadness for me is that this is not a fake, it is not fiction.  This really happened.  The movie is amazing, BUT it also gives you a sense of anger at the US and all the big powers, I love the line Nick Nolte uses after he finds out they are only evacuating the whites.  Watch this film, it will give you a much better understanding of what happened in 1994...</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>I would agree with this reviewer who says, "Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina as he really was during the ensuing chaos: "an expert in situational ethics" doing what he morally had to do, at great risk and potential sacrifice, with an understanding that wartime negotiations are largely a game of subterfuge, cooperation, and clever bribery."  The portrayal of America is not especially good.  The film makes it seem like the U.S. doesn't care about the tragedy because it is "not in their interest."  This may be an unfair shot.  It' almost like they are saying there is no oil or economic reason to fight, so let the black suckers die.  It may not be that simple as Hollywood makes it out to be....just a thought.<br /><br />Great acting, great picture, no doubt about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle; but his performance gives it so much. It's hard not to be reminded of Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oscar Schindler, but Hotel Rwanda has just the kind of human believability that Schindler's List lost quite quickly. Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future. It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda - Nick Nolte, Jean Reno, Joaquin Phoenix - but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.<br /><br />And yet, the actors aren't the focus of this film, or at least not all of it; Hotel Rwanda is practically a documentary, and excluding a few sentimental moments, it makes no dramatizations and no beautifications in presenting the horrors of the massacre in Rwanda. If at times the film seems to drive the message home a bit too forcefully - and it often does; Hotel Rwanda leaves very little to our interpretation, and that sometimes interferes with the drama: I had a bit of a problem with characters uttering lines that explain what we should have figured out for ourselves, like Joaquin Phoenix saying 'I'm so ashamed' to nobody in particular just after spending several minutes showing just how ashamed he is - it's all part of the director's intention. Hotel Rwanda doesn't make excuses for itself: it refuses to leave any viewer indifferent, and it refuses to let you twist its meaning. The message is so plain and strong that it cannot be ignored and overlooked. The film is just enough shockingly brutal to make sure that we get it. And we do; it's a depressing, powerful experience, which makes you as truly ashamed as Phoenix's character was of the kind of horrors human beings are capable of, and of your own inability to interfere.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda never had a shot at the Oscars - it's just too frank and too straightforward for the Academy to stomach. But it might just be the best movie made this year. At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention. It's a true masterpiece that will probably be remembered as a classic for many years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>When I first heard about this movie, I remember wondering how the absolutely horrific events that occurred in Rwanda could be captured in a PG-13 movie, and still stir the outrage they should.  After seeing HOTEL RWANDA, I know they can't.<br /><br />I remember years ago getting my Newsweek delivered and finding inside some of the most disturbing photographic images I've ever seen.  Reading the statistics in the accompanying story simply added to the horror.  How could our modern society, with its instant communications, color TV, and so forth have let this bloodbath go on?  Hundreds of thousands of people murdered in the most horrific ways.  And yet, it seldom even made front-page news.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a handsomely made film, and it is VERY well acted.  Don Cheadle is particularly fine in the role that finally got him some  attention at awards time.  He is so underrated, because he's so effortless.  We're rarely aware of him acting.  Sophie Okonedo, as his wife, is radiant. I sure hope to see her in more movies in the near future.  The story of this man and wife (he is in a management position at a luxury hotel in Rwanda and finds himself not only taking in refugees who are doomed to be killed otherwise, but risking his own life to save them) is riveting as far as it goes.  We absolutely admire the risks they all took...Cheadle in particular shows great amounts of courage shining through knee-quaking fear.  He's the most reluctant of heroes...he's almost saving the lives of his refugees because that's what you do for your guests.  I don't mean to downplay his achievements...I'm simply saying that his courage is almost casual...as though no sane person would make another choice but to be brave.  But you can tell underneath that he's terrified.<br /><br />But the outrages that took place in Rwanda still demand more attention.  The film tries to show how the outside world abandoned Rwanda in its time of extreme crisis and chaos.  But so much brutality is missing.  Am I looking for gratuitous violence...no.  But I would like to see the public shocked out of its complacency.  Remember how SCHINDLER'S LIST got people talking about the holocaust as no other movie ever had.  Or how SAVING PRIVATE RYAN made clear the path for THE GREATEST GENERATION and fundraising for the long-overdue WWII Memorial?  This was in great part because Spielberg set out to slap us in the face with a visceral reminder of that the people who lived those events went through (and the people who didn't survive).  Both of those films left me silent, amazed and beyond tears.  HOTEL RWANDA should have done the same.  Certainly the atrocities committed were of a caliber to rival events that occurred in Europe in WWII or in the USSR during Stalin's reign.<br /><br />So, I guess I watched the movie with the wrong expectations.  I found the story fascinating and engaging.  The scene where the couple agree that they will commit suicide with their children if the rebels come (and later, when Cheadle thinks they may have mistakenly carried out their pact) will put a lump in your throat, and move you to the edge of your seat.  Another scene where Cheadle and a companion are forced to drive their truck of supplies over piles of bodies begins to suggest what this movie could have been on a visceral level.  My intellect was stimulated, my heart was moved, but my gut stayed uninvolved.<br /><br />By all means, see this fine movie.  But don't let it fool you into thinking what happened in Rwanda is being captured in the film.<br /><br />I seldom comment on the bonus materials, but in the case, I would say that the DVD offered a perfect opportunity for a "history lesson" documentary about Rwanda's recent political history...just who are the Hutu and the Tutsi's?  But it's not there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>There are many papers and commissions that examined what happened in the spring of 1994, when almost a million Rwandans were slaughtered by their own countrymen. Analysing these events makes us feel better, removes us from the emotions of such a tragedy. But it doesn't really matter what social-colonial or historical factors led up to it; it only matters that the genocide happened. Hotel Rwanda is an edge-of-your seat true account of the courage of one man in the midst of cowardice of many.<br /><br />Accomplished actor Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, assistant manager of a four-star Belgian hotel Des Mille Collines in the capital city of Kigali. Paul is Hutu. Hutus speak ominously on the radio of exterminating "Tutsi cockroaches." UN Peacekeepers in the country are helpless to intervene. All hell breaks loose and Paul's hotel becomes a makeshift refugee camp holding eight hundred terrified Tutsi. Only his quick-thinking is buying his family and the Tutsi moments to live - but for how long? Crazed Hutu hooligans as well as the Hutu army are shooting Tutsi and hacking them to death with crude machetes.<br /><br />The movie is stellar on all counts. It strikes at your heart, gently takes your face, and makes you look in the mirror. As Wyclef Jean wrote in his closing song for the film, "Million Voices," "There's no money, no diamonds that can replace Rwanda."</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>To depict a genocide from within is impossible but here the film is admirable because it does not so much show the traumatic horror but the reactions of possible victims. Fear of course. Never any panick. But then the survival instinct takes over, though it takes also some time to do so. Some will never be able to look for a solution and they will very passively remain in the hands of those they consider as possible saviours. Others will try all they can to find a way out, to stay alive, to survive but with their companions in this drastic situations. Family first, neighbours second, and then friends of friends. This is the spirit of the main character. Others still will be egotistic to the final end of the event and they will run into the fire and literally commit suicide. Finally others will try to resist and look for guns or a way to refuse to die in silence or shouting. If dying I must let me take a few enemies along with me. This last type is not really shown in any way. The rebels are not victims but fighters coming from outside and closing in on the militia. This film also shows drastically how little the international community cared for this particular genocide in Rwanda. The people on the ground (United Nations and Red Cross personnel) were helpless and absolutely abandoned in this mess. The international community seems to have waited for the massacre to be over. As the UN general says : they are blacks, not even (...), plain Africans. So no one cared and no one tried in any way to stop the massacre. As for an explanation the film provides none. We are absolutely alone in front of these images, situations, barbaric acts and we have to use our own heads to build some kind of hypothesis : heritage from Belgian colonialism, hatred between two communities, greed and jealousy of one to get what the other has, refusal to share, a sense of superiority, a desire to kill and enjoy real violence. Some might even say it is nothing but genetic. In such situations it is so easy to get racist or racial. The film remains rather reserved on the depth of such a catastrophe.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br></body></html>

To make things more difficult, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) discovers upon his arrival in Transylvania that he is up against more than just the humble vampire. Accompanying Van Helsing on his mission is Carl (David Wenham), a 19th century version of James Bond's Q who, among other things, exhales some truly great one-liners throughout the course of the film, a highlight of which is "Why does it smell like wet dog in here?". I remember this moment induced a huge roar of laughter at the cinema but without seeing the scene that preceded it it's a little hard to appreciate here.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman puts in a very admirable performance indicating once again why he is one of Australia's greatest exports. David Wenham's performance in what is essentially the role of comedic side-kick is extremely funny and entertaining. It is certainly a diversion from his previous roles and a very interesting addition to his repertoire. While playing the role of Count Dracula, Richard Roxburgh with his accent and wig is barely recognisable. He brings to this much-played character a very entertaining fresh twist - indeed it is the uniqueness of Roxburgh's performance that is particularly notable. Having been played so many times before it is becoming inherently difficult to bring something new to the character which Roxburgh has succeeded in doing. Kate Beckinsale very near revives her role from her previous film Underworld, once again trying to vanquish, among other things, werewolves.<br /><br />As you might well have guessed this is a film that relies heavily on the use of special effects and while at times they are spectacular (the horses jumping the ravine is certainly a highlight), this once again proves that effects don't make a film - writing does. While Sommer's intentions were good, if not a little ambitious, the film is a tad clunky at times and doesn't quite deliver in the writing department. That's not to say it a terrible film - nothing could be further from the truth, as it is certainly a worthy addition to the action/adventure genre. However, given my fondness for the two Mummy films it is inevitable that comparisons be made and without being too over-critical Van Helsing simply doesn't compete with either of them. Despite its short-falls Van Helsing is still a fun couple of hours and is well worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Heck, VAN HELSING is lots of fun and that's what makes this movie so entertaining for me.  Sure, it's overbrimming with special effects, but they're so cool and well done, I never tired of them, even a few of which were a little over the top.  Director Stephen Sommers who brought us the delightfully campy MUMMY series gives us a riproaring, action packed adventure story, and even though it's camp and humor is not quite as on target as in the Mummy movies, there is still plenty of tongue in cheek humor to soften the monstrous savagery.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (who would make a good James Bond) stars as the enigmatic Van Helsing, not your typical Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but a strange man who has a clouded past.  Jackman does well in the role, infusing the requisite macho and spiritual qualities.  David Wenham as Carl is wonderful in his low-key, restrained performance.  Wenham, who also appeared in LORD OF THE RINGS, is a capable supporting actor and was fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale is certainly beautiful, but I've never been overly impressed with her acting abilities, but she makes a nice heroine.  Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is a little too effeminate at times, but he is certainly a snarly vampire.  Kevin J. O'Connor behind great make-up plays Igor with a humorous flair.  Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster overcomes his overwrought makeup to portray the man-made "monster" who wants to be accepted.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score is appropriately melodramatic and the visuals, cinematography and art direction are Oscar worthy, as are the effects.<br /><br />Critics generally hated this movie, Newsweek's David Ansen placed it in his ten most disappointing movies of the year.  I found it highly entertaining and that's what movie making is supposed to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I was weened on the original Universal Monster movies, I remember dialing into the late night Ghost Host UHF shows back in the day to catch "Bride of Frankenstein" or "House of Dracula" and really falling under their spell. So when I heard about Van Helsing I was pretty excited. I did enjoy the Mummy movies for what they were, that is I enjoyed the Indiana Jones aspect of the films, and when I found out Sommers was in charge of Van Helsing I expected more of the same. There were elements to Van Helsing that I really liked. The Van Helsing character resembled a turn of the century James Bond who instead of tackling SPECTRE, hunted down evil. The Wolfman scenes of Van Helsing packed the biggest punch of the movie, which may have been one of the bigger problems with the film overall, seeing as how the Wolfman was a secondary character. Mr. Hyde's cameo was fun, as were Dracula's brides. But I am not a big fan of CGI special effects. I don't see the difference between CGI and a guy in a rubber suit or make-up. Sure you might see the zipper on the rubber suit, but no matter how convincing the CGI is, you can't help but notice that the monster is basically a cartoon. The biggest downfall for Van Helsing to me was Dracula and Frankenstein though. After years of associating Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff with the roles, Dracula in the film came off as a pretty weak character, one without much menace. The Frankenstein monster seemed almost helpless in the film, and came off as whiny. This movie reminded me a good deal of Sean Connery's "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". The idea looks good on paper, but for some reason just doesn't click. This movie is just some harmless fun, entertaining while on, but forgotten by the time the end credits finish rolling. Van Helsing isn't the worst movie I've seen involving Universal's monster collection, but it is far from the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Van Hesling" is yet another movie based on a series of comic books. I can comment only on the movie as a movie, as I am unfamiliar with the series. I can say that, by its look, the film is faithful to its comic book origins.<br /><br />As a movie, "Van Helsing" is a handsome product, which like director Stephen Sommer's other big hits, "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns", suffers from too much reliance on computer generated special effects. The opening, a homage to Universal Studio's horror films of the 1930s, is glorious. The introduction to the anti-hero Van Helsing is also intriguing. Here is a man who doesn't know who he really is and who is a pawn of the Catholic Church. His is an interesting conflict.<br /><br />The movie proceeds to Romania, circa 1890. It's a country in turmoil, its people ruled by fear and superstition. And why not? Vampires and werewolves abound.<br /><br />Van Hesling [High Jackman] is dispatched by the Church to Romania to finally take care of the nasty Count Dracula. There he meets the amazing Anna [Kate Beckinsdale], a princess whose family Dracula [Richard Roxburgh] has been trying to destroy for centuries.<br /><br />For the most part, "Van Helsing" is good fun. It's a great adventure. What bogs it down is the special effects. Initially, they are interesting. The problem is that these effects go on and on and on. This causes the movie to run at least thirty minutes longer than the story requires. The movies "Van Helsing" pays homage to ran anywhere from seventy to ninety minutes. "Van Hesling" itself runs one hundred and thirty minutes, mainly because it insists on running the same `cool' special effects over and over again. [Note to Hollywood: Less is more.]</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>The whole movie is like a wild roller-coaster ride from one action scene to the next. The special effects were excellent -- a lot of morphing though and showing of vampire teeth.<br /><br />This is not a film to ask questions, but instead just sit there enjoy the screaming from the characters (and there's a lot of it -- I had to turn my theatre system down as the screaming apparently never stopped), and have some fun for a little more than 2 hours.<br /><br />And you'll see everybody: Dracula and his vampire brides, the Frankenstein monster, wolfman, etc. -- and as mentioned before, a lot of morphing. My teenagers love the movie. You must also forget the original stories of Frankenstein and Dracula, etc. -- although these characters are in the movie -- this film is not about the underlying work of literature, but it's just what it is: a wild roller-coaster ride with lots of action and special effects, just for the fun of it to pass a rainy afternoon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Van Helsing is a very good movie. Perfect if you are looking for a horror film to enjoy. Hugh Jackman is amazing.<br />After the movie, I had to run to the internet and get more information on Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a great performance ! He was the best Dracula yet !</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>And there were lots of them. Dracula walking on walls was a good one, as were the transformations and the CG harpies.<br /><br />I think the women's costumes count as special effects, too. Anna's exaggerated hour-glass figure says a lot about Kate Beckinsale's ability to endure a corset. Also, her blouse managed to cover her quite properly and still convey the idea of not being there - that was pretty special. I think some strategically placed pink pectoral patches enhanced that illusion. Those brides of Dracula had some very special effects in their bodices as well. (BTW, after seeing where the spawn of Dracula comes from, I really don't want to know much about their home life.)<br /><br />Plot? I guess there might have been one. Sort of. The lead character, Van Helsing, goes around shooting bad guys with a sort of crossbow/Gatling gun kind of thing. I suppose I could say more, but it still wouldn't add up to real story line.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie in a bland sort of way. You could do worse - but you might have to try.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie has amazing special effects and borrows from a lot of the action movie directing that is currently in vogue.  Jackman is very likable as a monster hunter hired by the church to eliminate all supernatural creatures and some man-made (Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster).<br /><br />After disposing of a giant Mr. Hyde in London, Jackman is sent to Transylvania to battle the evil Count Dracula.  There he meets up with a beautiful vampire slayer who is also after Dracula for turning her brother into a werewolf. However, she is reluctant to go after him because the townspeople are content to keep status quo with Dracula.  Dracula and his vampire wives periodically feed on the townfolk to satisfy their urges as long as the townfolk don't hunt them.  Any actions by the townfolk against the vampires would result in terrible retribution.<br /><br />Van Helsing battles Dracula's wives who swoop and dart through the air around the town while Van Helsing is shooting a "machine gun" type bow and arrow.  The special effects of these scenes are amazing.<br /><br />Later, Van Helsing does battle with Dracula with the help of a werewolf and the Frankenstein monster.<br /><br />We later learn that Dracula can only be killed in one way (that way is revealed late in the movie) but that way is super risky.  Meanwhile Dracula is unleashing a plan to launch a vampire army to take over the world.  It is up to Van Helsing, his beautiful slayer, and Frankenstein to defeat him and time is running out.<br /><br />A fun ride to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This is such a fun movie! It is one big, dumb, loud, action packed, monster mash B movie fun! Hugh Jackman is great along with Kate Beckinsale and Dracula, The Wolfman, Frankenstein, Dracluas Brides, Goblins, Mr. Hyde (Who was much cooler in "LXG: The Movie" but whos complaning). This is what summer movies are all about!</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>They finally put the trailer up on the internet, and I think the movie looks awesome!  My friends complain to me how it's so stupid, how the weapons couldn't possibly have been built back then, how this is dumb and how that is lame, yada yada yada.  Dudes, if you're listening, seriously, GET A LIFE!!!!!  It's a movie, for pete's sake!!  Hollywood is not afraid to change things around!  That's one of the things I love about the motion picture: the ability to forget all that crud you learned in school and have some fun!  To heck with logic, historical accuracy, etc. etc.  You want those things, go read some boring science or history book.  Me, I'd much rather just sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie.<p>Judging by the trailer, I can assume that I'll be able to do just that with VAN HELSING.  I can already tell Hugh Jackman does a great job, even if this version of the legendary vampire hunter strays a little (or a lot) from Bram Stoker's original.  Though many may complain about this, the character has been around for over a hundred years, and it's quite refreshing to see some new life brought into the character.  Again, I don't care what they change around as long as I get a good movie.<p>One of the things I think looks really cool about the movie is that though the famous characters of Dracula, The Wolf Man, and the Frankenstein Monster aren't quite the same as I and countless others remember them (in the classic Universal horrors), the whole movie looks like an homage, in a sense, to them.  Therefore, I think the film will be the most fun for those (like myself) who grew up with those beloved classics of the Thirties/Forties.  I probably wouldn't assume any of this unless I knew the film was in the hands of Stephen Sommers, the man who gave us the modern classic THE MUMMY.  Anyone who's seen the Boris Karloff MUMMY will see how the remake/re-imagining payed homage to it.<p>On the other hand, I can only pray that it's more THE MUMMY than THE MUMMY RETURNS.  (shudder . . . . . .)<p>That little worry aside, you can be sure of what movie I'm going to see come this summer movie season: VAN HELSING!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>this Van Helsing kicks butt till the very end.  i love all of his weapons to defeat the vampires.  at the way beginning of the movie he fights against Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>It's VERY unusual for me to give a horror movie five stars. But then this is a very unusual movie.<br /><br />Probably most of you know that Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackson) appears in the Dracula story as the one who knows most about vampires, and is dedicated to fighting them. This is the same character, in a way, but almost nothing else about this is the same.<br /><br />This Van Helsing, a very attractive and capable young-looking man, is actually some 400 years old. He's also working for a secret order of priests who send him out to kill Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Along the way, he encounters a variety of nasty creatures, including Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Jekyl/Hyde and three Brides of Dracula, who are of course also vampires. Then there is their numerous offspring . . .<br /><br />Igor, originally Dr. Frankenstein's assistant, is working for Count Dracula by this time, since when Dracula loaned Dr. F an abandoned castle in which to reproduce his original work, the count was paying Igor's salary.<br /><br />Two more characters are critical to the story. I can tell you very little about Prince Velcan Valericus without spoiling several surprises, but Princess Anna Valericus is a beautiful, strong, fearless young woman who becomes Van Helsing's ally -- or he becomes hers. The Valericus family has tried to kill Dracula for hundreds of years, so far without success, and with major losses. In fact, the family will be lost entirely if Prince Velcan and Princess Anna do not survive.<br /><br />This is a major high action movie, with incredible special effects, that kept reminding me of the recent Zorro movies: there's a good bit of humor mixed in with all the blood and gore. And there is plenty of blood and gore, but somehow it didn't bother me so much as in most horror movies. I think it has something to do with the entire thing being in the realm of the supernatural, and therefore not nearly as frightening as psychotic murderers and the like that might be real.<br /><br />Unless you really can't handle horror stories at all, I think you will appreciate this movie. Van Helsing is just the right sort of hero, and even wears a hat rather like Indiana Jones.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>Special effects matching Underworld or Twilight easily. Hugh Jackman(Wolverine on X-Men) and Kate Beckinsale(Death Dealer on Underworld) star in this excellent vampire/werewolf, even vampire vs. werewolf movie. Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein's Monster are on this too. Easily a match for other movies in this genre. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>And my job is to tell you what a great movie this is, and how eye poppingly wow the blu-ray is! A wonderful horror-adventure story paying homage to the universal monster movie classics! Hugh Jackman is fantastic in the lead role as Van Helsing and the rest of the cast make this a fun watch. Plenty of tongue and cheek moments but the action and scares will make you jump too. Completely enjoyable.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: For those of you who own the ultimate edition this blu-ray version comes with all the extras except for the original universal monster movies (Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman). If you want those I suggest picking up the special editions on DVD. As for the look and sound of this movie...WOW!!! DEMO DISC!!! SHOW THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS!!! ABSOLUTELY WORTHY TO UPGRADE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A35AMPDFAB8JLT.html">A35AMPDFAB8JLT</a><br/><p>I think Stephen Sommers ("The Mummy", "The Mummy Returns") had fun making this film. This tongue in cheek tribute to the classic horror films from the 1930's and 1940's is a thrilling ride with an amazing sequence of visuals. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Dracula's lair with the frozen ice sickles hanging from the ceiling and furniture, to the marvelously dark scenes of the Dracula castle high up in the craggy mountain ranges, to the splendor of the Fellini like ballroom scene inside a Cathedral with its motley group of guests. Perhaps we could have done without the initial battle between Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and the grotesquely huge, cigar smoking, Mr. Hyde, but once we get beyond this point the film is charmingly engaging as we move from one visual spectacle into the next as Van Helsing and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), and the friar, Carl(David Wenham), battle the likes of Dracula, the Werewolf, and the Frankenstein monster. This movie was created with the energy and spirit of movies like "The Mummy" or the "Pirates of the Caribbean".  Pop up some popcorn and then just sit back and enjoy this roller coaster ride!</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>van helsing was a very enjoyable movie. i liked it. having all these monsters put together in one movie was a good one. nicely done. the makeup and special effects were great. the fact that hugh jackman was the lead was a very good choice. impressive acting and very believable. strong character. he made this movie all the better. as for kate beckinsale, she played her role well. good actress, and giving us a taste of what she has to offer. a story where monsters are a common thing. dracula, his ladies, frankenstien, dr.jekyll and mr. hyde, and the werewolf are thrust together. in creepy transylvania where all of these monsters reside. van helsing(hugh jackman) is called upon to take out this evil clan. just another mission, just another monster, but this one is a lot stronger. dracula who needs frankenstien to help him to get his babies to live. without him, all attempts fail, and they die. he wants to rule and take over. he must be stopped and frankenstien wants no part in it. anna is a vampire killer and her family has been for a long time. they must continue to kill them until there is no more left so that they may live in peace and continue on to heaven. they meet when van helsing kills one of draculas ladies. he is the first to have killed a vampire in years. thus they must help each other. all the while emotions get involved and makes for an even better picture. then annas brother gets bit by a werewolf, and so he bites van helsing. who will eventually turn into one as well, unless they retrieve the antidote. anna never expected her brother to become that which they killed. she is the last of her line. she must fight until her mission is complete. they come upon draculas home, where the action continues, and anna must fight like never before. the only way to beat dracula is to get bit by a werewolf. well lo and behold van helsing will become one. nice fight scene in the end. great stuff. these kinds of monster flicks do it for me. the ending should have been different, but at least anna and her family found peace at last. and frankenstien was free, and van helsing having loved will continue on to be a different man.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>When I first watched "Van Helsing" my initial reaction was that it wasn't that great, it was just average.  Upon thinking about it, and rewatching the film, I have changed my opinion to some extent.  While still not the best movie ever, but for a monster movie it does a very nice job.  Plus the idea of bringing together iconic film monsters, such as; Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde making a cameo, was a unique idea and one that director Stephen Sommers pulled off magnificently.<br /><br />"Van Helsing" follows the adventures of a vampire hunter named Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who first appeared in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.  Now Van Helsing hunts more than merely vampires, as he takes on various monsters for a secret organization within the Catholic Church that seeks to rid the world of evil in all it's forms.  Through his journey he comes across the lovely Anna (Kate Beckinsale), a kindred spirit for Van Helsing, and together they must stop Dracula and his minions from destroying anymore lives than they already have.<br /><br />The concept of bringing together so many of Hollywood's classic movie monsters in one movie seemed like an idea that would never see fruition.  As cool as the idea was there just didn't seem to be a director, let alone a special effects house that would be able to do justice to so many epic characters.  That is, until director Stephen Sommers resurrected the classic monster, the mummy, for his big budget films "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns".  The films did so well that they even spawned a spin-off that served as a prequel of sorts to the franchise, called "The Scorpion King".  With a director that was adept at reinvigorating classic monsters, Universal Studios saw the chance to bring more of their classic monsters to life, thus "Van Helsing" was born.<br /><br />With the enormous success of `The Mummy' franchise and now with "Van Helsing", director Stephen Sommers is proving himself to be Hollywood's go-to-guy for monster movies.  With good acting and a good storyline that blends so many of Hollywood's classic monsters together without rushing any of them, this really is an enjoyable monster flick.  Now that the origin is essentially out of the way for this updated version of Stoker's classic vampire hunter, it will be interesting to see where this franchise will go in future installments.  Since, "Van Helsing" was successful, it is conceivable that Universal Studios would move forward with a sequel, so here's hoping for another great adventure in "Van Helsing 2".<br /><br />"Van Helsing" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>Great special effects movie, but no story. Personally, I prefer more of the psychological vampire type stories, where the vampire gets into the head of his victims before attacking, but this is still an ok flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>I was really expecting a schlocky summer film when I heard of this one.  After buying it and watching it I was quite surprised to discover that it was really quite good.<br /><br />Van Helsing, Gabriel and not Abraham from Dracula, is a mystery.  He was found on the steps of Saint Peter's with no memory.  He was then enlisted by a society that protects the world from evil.<br /><br />We first meet Van Helsing as he confronts Mr. Hyde at Notre Dame Cathedral.  After that mission he is sent off to deal with Dracula, a vampire.  This is not Stoker's Dracula, but an interesting new creation.  This time Van Helsing is given a guide who's character offers a lot color to the film.  He must stop Dracula before a certain family line is extinguished.<br /><br />Well, it wouldn't be a good movie if everything went as planned.  With werewolves, vampires and the legacy of Frankenstein running through the film Van Helsing is kept very busy and the audience entertained.  There are some points that seem to have been lifted right from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but it is mostly fresh and original.  We see a good number of Universal's classic monsters in a whole new light (we miss the Mummy, Invisible Man, and the Creature especially).  The action is typical these days after things like Buffy, Xena and Charlie's Angels but it seems handled differently.<br /><br />If you like action, monsters, and good vs. evil then this is a movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>He's not far from his Wolverine character in this one.  It still is entertaining if you like the action genre. On the DVD you get to see a 360 degree view of the castle and the extras are worth the price.  I still think this could become a franchise. Too bad the producers of the X-Men never made a Wolverine movie instead.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Hugh Jackman both films would have never been tolerable.  It's a testament to his talent when he can carry a movie that's almost straight special effects. Acting in front of a green screen can't be very satisfying as an actor and he pulls it off well.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of the monster films to like this one.<br /><br />It has enough outlandish stunts in it to make it one you can see at least twice and still enjoy. Myself, I love the old classics and hope more of them are relased with this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Van Helsing is one of those movies which you just don't take seriously what so ever.  Hugh Jackman was a fine actor to play the lead and Kate Beckinsale was eye candy, her accent pretty much resembled that of Count Dracula from Sesame Street. Director Stephen Sommers abandons a plot and just amazes with visual and special effects.  Sommers's scored big with the "Mummy" blockbusters which were enjoyable though the first film was a great deal better.  The dialogue is more than laughable.  The plot I won't even bother to try and explain cause it's that bad.  Pretty much Jackson plays Van Helsiing  a lethal hunter, who kills monsters for a living, soon Beckingsale's character must help him to try and stop Dracula.  Make sense?  Probably not, but it's still enjoyable.  As I said earlier the visual aspect of this film is stunning, the action is nearly non-stop too.<br />  Van Helsing is rated PG-13 for Non-Stop Creature Action Violence, Frightening Images and for Sensuality.  The violence is pervasive and includes the use of an assortment of Helsing's many sweet weapons such as his cross bow, pistols, etc.  There are also many creepy and frightening montsters (what a shock to find out)  so this film.  The sensuality is nothing explicit, just some sexual innuendo.  Overall a big-budget summer flick (approximately $150 million) which has done well at the box-office.  Worth seeing in theatres, but you probably could wait and get it on DVD or video. May be a tad scary for adolescent audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>At the end of the 19th century Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is notorious in Europe and his name is often associated with death.  This tale begins where Van Helsing has just finished a mission involving Mr. Hyde, and now Van Helsing is about to embark on a new mission with werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein, and Dracula.  This means that Van Helsing must travel to Transylvania where Dracula and his cohorts reside.  When Van Helsing arrives to the mountains of Transylvania he meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).  Together Van Helsing and Valerious bring more death and destruction to the monsters that cross their path using high-tech weapons made by Van Helsing's follower fryer Carl.  Van Helsing is a movie with visual eye candy that is strikingly spectacular as almost every scene has computer generated images and extraordinary heroism.  This initially leads the movie into a cinematic action experience.  However, the cinematic experience is spoiled as the movie is almost utterly supported by characters telling the audience what they are going to do and not leaving anything for the imagination.  These verbal cues are often redundant and very little story is supported with visual cues besides the combat and rescue scenes.  These combat and rescue scenes are most often extremely far-fetched, which lends very little support to any suspense.  Instead, the suspense is neglected with absurd shoot 'em and beat 'em up scenes.  Lastly, there are occasions with situational comedy, which lightens up the cinematic experience, but it does not save this absurd cinematic experience as it goes into a downward spiraling pattern from the beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>The summer 2004 movie season officially got underway with the release of VAN HELSING.  The movie was written by Stephen Sommers (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS). The film stars Hugh Jackman (X-MEN, X2) as Van Helsing, the famed literary vampire hunter who killed Count Dracula.<p>Unlike the usual interpretations of the character, Jackman's Van Helsing isn't an aging scholar fighting his last battle. Instead, this incarnation of Van Helsing presents the character as a 19th century James Bond crossed with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who is employed by the Vatican as a secret agent to ward off the forces of evil.<p>After the movie's introductory episode with Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame in Pris, Van Helsing returns to Vatican City. His superiors send him to Trannsylvania, Count Dracula's hunting grounds.  For half a century Dracula has been living in a symbiotic relationship with the villagers. But Dracula has begun killing more and the village is under siege by werewolves.  Dracula is up to something big and only Van Helsing can stop him.<p>VAN HELSING is full of plot holes, many of the characters lack development, and there is some really corny dialogue.  However,  the movie has some amazing special effects and provides some very interesting interpretations of literary and movie characters (I especially enjoyed the representation of Frankenstein).  The movie isn't meant to be a deep piece of cinema.  It's a movie that does what movies have done since they were first invented:  entertain and excite.  VAN HELSING is a great piece of mind candy to chew on.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I had very high hopes for Van Helsing.  I thought that it would be a good concept to combine Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman.  I didn't really expect a deep story line and the best acting.  I was expecting a lot of action and something to keep me entertained for two hours and change, and thats what I got with Van Helsing.<p>The story is about Van Helsing (Jackman) getting sent to Transylvannia to kill Dracula.  Why he was all of a sudden sent there now is a mystery, since Dracula has existed for 400 years.  Dracula wants to use Frankenstein's Monster in order to give his children enough power to survive and continue to have vampires exist.  Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) is trying to kill Dracula in order to fulfill her family's destiny.  These are the main plot points of this movie.  <p>Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a man who is "employed" by the Vatican to stop evil doers.  He is a very religious man, whom is in a constant inner struggle about if what he is doing (killing people) is righteous.  Jackman does a good job for what he was given.  I really hope that he excells as a big action star, but this role reminds me a lot of his Wolverine character from the X-Men series.  Kate Beckinsale is alright in the movie, mainly a pleasure to look at.  Dracula really annoyed me throughout the movie, along with Frankenstein's monster.  <p>The best part of this movie was clearly the action scenes, and believe me, there were a lot of them.  This movie did not really have too many boring parts.  I don't like how every action scene was CGI and no stunt men doing what they do best.  I guess I'm kinda old school and occasionally like to see stunt men doing the stunts, instead of a computer animation.  Van Helsing is not a bad movie.  I wouldn't say that its a good movie either.  Its more good than it is bad.  Its basically an action movie that keeps you entertained throughout the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>STORY: Well, this is an interesting piece of work to dig into. I went into the movie expecting nothing more than an action ride, and even though that's what I got there was a little more to Van Helsing than you would expect. Even though that "more" can in fact be too much. The story is about Gabriel Van Helsing, a vanquisher of evil who works in the name of god. He has been assigned to help Anna Valerious, the last member of her family, to kill Count Dracula. Count Dracula must be killed in order to send the rest of Anna's family to heaven and out of purgatory (I know, sounds lame . . . it is). Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster to unleash his children of the night by harvesting his energy (Sounds even lamer . . . it is). All the while, Dracula uses the aid of the wolfman as well as his evil brides to try kill Van Helsing and Anna; thus providing the audience with overdone action sequences. The dialogue of the movie is something to laugh at, as well is the lame character development, and the reality bending action. In one scene Kate Beckinsale is swinging from a cable only holding it with one hand as if she was just holding a rope while standing on a platform. The ending was a clich&eacute;. So why in God's name (no pun intended) would I give this movie two and a half stars. Well, two stars by all means is a very low score, but that half would insist that this movie is okay. It is.  The two stars go for the undeveloped plot, overdone action, and overall nonsense that is the movie. The half star is for the fact that it's fun to watch. I guarantee you will not get bored with this movie. The CGI effects are astounding and are incredible. The movie can not be seen on your TV and have the same effect that it does with a big screen and DTS. This movie is the definition for "summer blockbuster". This movie is fun, entertaining, and one hell of a ride. It just makes no sense.<p>ACTING: Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast as Van Helsing, although his acting is almost a replica of his acting as Wolverine in the X-Men films. Kate Beckinsale is the hot babe, the local gal from Transylvania with the sexy overly done accent.  Comic relief is provided by David Wenham (Best known as Faramir from The Return Of The King) and Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor (Best known as Beni Gabor from The Mummy). Who really steals the show is Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula. A very genuine fantasy performance that is not overly done, yet not so subtle that it goes unnoticed. <p>BOTTOM LINE: Fun movie plagued by a weak (very weak) plot and weak characters. Sometimes movies like this are good because you can park your brain at the door and set it in neutral, and let the movie do its job, entertain. Stephen Sommers is a huge fan of classic horror films and is why he remade The Mummy. I guess he wanted to do remakes for all the classics and to save time he just threw them in a blender to make this romp. It's obvious why the movie cost $150 million to make just by seeing the special effects, but at times they seem overdone. 90% of the camera shots in the movie have one CGI. A fun way to kick off summer and even though highly flawed, it shouldn't detract from the overall experience of this summer flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>2004's "VAN HELSING" is a special effects extravaganza. Some might think this is a good thing. I, on the other hand feel that it fails in the same way that 2003's "HULK" failed. First of all there are to many classic monsters in one movie. The actor that played Dracula should be shot. He was horrid. It was almost a comedic performance. He is probably the worse thing about the movie. Dracula is one of my favorite characters in film history, but it takes the right actor to play him. I'll take Gary Oldman anyday. Well enough about that. The story is ludicrous. Somehow Hollwood can bring Freddy and Jason together more believably than Dracula and Frankenstien, go figure.. In my one man's opinion, I feel that if you're gonna make a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, you should just call it that. I was inspired to watch 1992's "BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA" again (which features the character Van Helsing, played by Anthony Hopkins). I recommend you skip "VAN HELSING" and go with "BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA" instead. It's a classic. This film isn't. By the way there is a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, it's a comedy that stars Kristy Swanson as a cheerleader turned vampire slayer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Watching this movie I don't know why it's hated by so many. I watched the Day After Tomorrow yesterday and watched Van Helising today. I must say that Van Helsing is much funner movie and the one I'd want to watch more than once. People knock it for having so much action, well isn't that good ? I mean to me that made it entertaining through-out and it was never dull. I actually saw a 1 out of 10 review for this at igndvd.com and no way is this movie that bad. Maybe I liked it because I always wanted a movie with all the classic monsters together. I think Stephen Sommers does a pretty damn good job making adventures though. I actually liked the Mummy movies and if you liked those then you should be blown away by Van Helsing. I also really liked the look of the film, it a has a really nice classic monster movie look to it. Plus Hugh Jackman does a fine job in the title role, but when isn't he good ? It's just Dracula that I had a problem with, he's not that scary plus they needed a better actor playing him. Dougray Scott (Mission Impossible 2) who was originally supposed to play Wolverine in X-Men would've made a much better dracula. Kate Beckinsale  doesn't give the best performance either but hell I wasn't listening to her talk, was too busy drooling over her out-fit lol.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>I REALLY HAD NO EXPECTATIONS WHEN MY DVD ARRIVED YESTERDAY, BUT BOY IS IT EVER EXCITING AND FAST MOVING!  THE CGIS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME AS ARE THE VERY TALENTED HUGH JACKMAN AS WELL AS KATE BECKENSALE.  THE ACTION AND ADVENTURE ARE LITERALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND MOST OF THE ACTING BY A VERY TALENTED CAST IS FINE. PERHAPS THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I'D SAY SIT BACK AND HOLD ON TIGHT CAUSE ONCE THIS RIDE BEGINS IT'S NON STOP! GREAT FUN, GREAT POPCORN FLICK-I LOVED IT. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM SUCH A FILM-YOU LITERALLY LOSE YOURSELF FOR OVER 2 HOURS IN A GREAT ESCAPADE NOT UNLIKE THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY.

Along the way, Van Helsing brings his sidekick Friar and meets a gypsy princess whose trying the break a 400 year old curse on her family. Van Helsing battles with holy water, blessed salts, and midevil weaponry against the dark lord who knows about Van Helsing's forgotten past as Gabriel (the same name as one of the Archangels) ... before a Werewolf bite overtakes the occult warrior into his own darkness. Jackman is great and one sees a bit of wolverine in his take of famed supernatural monster hunter Van Helsing.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This film is a throwback to those old 50's horror films that had classic monsters doing battle with each other coupled with the wit of the 60's era all combined with the thrills and special effects of today's films.<br /><br />Entertainment rarely gets better than this.  Now stop laughing at my five stars for this kind of film.  This isn't the five stars you would give a film like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284646X">Platoon</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>.  It's more like the five stars you would you give a film like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDE">Aliens</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a>.  This is fun, thrilling, and engaging entertainment.  It's simple popcorn fun that the whole family, for the most part, can enjoy.  The CGI can be a little over-the-top, but it is still excellently done and doesn't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />The film has engaging actors who, while playing their roles with some seriousness, you can tell that it is all tongue-in-cheek and one expects them to wink at the camera at any time.  Hugh Jackman certainly carries the film with great charm and coolness that reminds one of Ford's Indiana Jones.  Kate Beckinsale is great as his reluctant partner and just looks dang sexy in this role that brings to mind her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUH6">Underworld</a> character.  She just sizzles on the screen.  In addition, excellent support is rendered by David Wenham, most known for his roles in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy</a>, Richard Roxburgh of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KLQUSU">Stealth</a>, Kevin J. O'Conner from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IONJGU">The Mummy</a>, and Robbie Coltrane who is best known as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.<br /><br />The direction is confidently done and unobtrusive.  He combines action and horror very effectively.  The photography is appropriately creepy and atmospheric.  The set designs are elaborate and the score is compelling.  The entire film is excellently produced and is what I call a high octane film.  This film gets you running on all cylinders.  Watch it and have a blast enjoying it for the kind of entertainment it is.<br /><br />The film is thrilling and suspenseful with the various classic creature battling each other and at times forming uneasy alliances.  This is just old fashioned witty and enjoyable entertainment.  The repeat value of this film is what also makes this film worthy of a place in your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My father is a huge fan of the Universal Studios monsters. He really enjoyed the remake of The Mummy, so the return of several onscreen monster staples simultaneously (the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula) was a must-see. We were not disappointed. <p>Van Helsing is not by any means a GOOD movie. It is pulp action fun, in the same vein as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Shadow, and the Indiana Jones series. Too many people confuse pulp-action movies for poorly directed films - one is on purpose, the other is unintentional. <p>The term "pulp" is derived from the paperback books that were made of pulpy paper. Cheap and filled with lurid tales of sex and violence, pulp was sort of porn for the action-minded: not much talk, lots of fighting. In fact, it's not unusual for the fights to actually string together so that the hero doesn't get to say or do much of anything. A lot of reviews emphasize, "Van Helsing never lets up." Yep, that's pulp. <p>Another surefire way to identify a pulp-type style is the hero. Heroes in pulp stories are ridiculously well rounded. Pulp heroes are scientists and master pugilists, excellent pilots and crack shots. While modern heroes pride themselves on their flaws, pulp heroes have none. Van Helsing displays all signs of being nearly indestructible. <p>Now that we've gotten the definition of pulp out of the way and established that the director's (Sommers) intent was to create a pulp film, we can ignore many of the basic weaknesses inherent to a film of this genre and focus on the other aspects. <p>This is one, gigantic homage. The film makes that homage very overt by filming the opening sequence in black-and-white. Dr. Frankenstein and Dracula talk, act, and ultimately get attacked by villagers with pitchforks and torches. The sequence ends with the appearance of Frankenstein's Monster, who goes out with a bang. <p>Flash forward to the Victorian age. Van Helsing is tracking none other than Mr. Hyde. Yes, THAT Hyde. Curiously, Mr. Hyde looks very similar to the heroic Hyde of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, including the fact that he's all CGI and rather ape-like. No matter, here it works - Hyde is rendered beautifully in Gollum-like detail, and he is a frightening sight to behold. We get to see Van Helsing in action without being distracted by all the movie monster hoopla. <p>What we learn about Van Helsing is that he is a combination of several characters. He dresses like Vampire Hunter D (Sommers knows his anime). He swings along rooftops from his grappling hook like Batman. He is backed by a super-secret organization dedicated to monster hunting that supplies him with bleeding edge gadgets, just like James Bond. In fact, he even has his own Q (David Wenham, playing a friar named Carl). If Van Helsing sounds like he's a superhero, see my comments about pulp heroes above. <p>Oh yeah, the plot. The movie revolves around Dracula's quest to bring his undead progeny (the union of Dracula and his three brides) to life. "Vampires are the walking undead. It only makes sense that their children would be born dead." I'll let that sink in for a bit...got it? Sure you do. Throw in some nonsense about werewolves being controlled by Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster being key to said progeny's resurrection, and you've pretty much got the plot down. <p>The special effects are amazing. Dracula's brides get far more screen time than any other version of the movie and here they can transform into bat-winged harpies as well as their typically attractive forms. The werewolves are very much the werewolves of Underworld, including the ape-like ability to scale walls. Surprisingly, Frankenstein's Monster is not the shambling moron so many people are accustomed to. In physical form, he is a true monster, complete with flapping braincase and steam-powered leg. He's also a well-spoken person with a heart. Frankenstein's Monster has the best dialogue, and that's saying something. <p>The parallels to Underworld continue with Kate Bekinsale who is in both films. Kate plays the gypsy Anna Valerious, dedicated to destroying Dracula. Kate looks great in this film but doesn't have a whole lot to do but be the love interest. She also apparently sleeps in her corset, which must be awfully uncomfortable. <p>The movie plays fast and loose with its own logic, something that the pulp-theme cannot justify. Werewolves shift in and out of human form when the full moon is VISIBLE. The definition of visible is rather flexible. In fact, the full moon seems to be in effect for an entire week. Transylvanian horses can really leap tall bridges in a single bound. And apparently silver stakes work on everybody, including Dracula. <p>On the other hand, the movie makes some winking allusions to history. Van Helsing "fought against the Romans at Masada." The monster hunter's background, which I won't give away here, owes as much to biblical history as it does to Vampire Hunter D. And Mr. Faramir is hysterical as the funny man. <p>My dad really enjoyed Van Helsing. My wife thought it was stupid. I thought the movie was intentionally stupid and thus enjoyed it. And oh yeah, it had Kate Beckinsale. <p>Just one question: Where's the Creature from the Black Lagoon?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After writing and directing the empty blockbusters of the Mummy and the Mummy Returns, Van Helsing finds him looting Universal's monster vault once again, this time featuring the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolfman (Will Kemp), and of course, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh).  Hugh Jackman stars as the monster hunter Van Helsing, teamed up with a princess (Kate Beckinsale) and a loyal friar (David Wenham from Lord of the Rings), sent to Transylvania to stop the count from unleashing a horde of bloodsucking offspring.  Some spots of the film are deliciously campy, while others stick out as plain dull.  The opening is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster films, and buffs of classic horror will find plenty of references and homages in the film.  The special effects are some of the best CGI seen today, and Van Helsing is more satisfying than Sommers' Mummy films, although underneath the break neck pace and special effects there isn't much left to it.  It's still worth seeing and it has a bit of a surprising ending, and a sequel is almost virtually inevitable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>All said and done, this film is a tremendous amount of fun.  Director Stephen Sommers takes the stuff of our favorite fictional monsters and blends them together to create a highly imaginative reconstruction of the story of Dracula.  Resemblances to Bram Stoker's original tale are entirely accidental.  Instead we find Dracula  (Richard Roxburgh) using with Dr. Frankenstein (Samuel West) to serve some dark and nefarious purpose.  Not very far in the background is a werewolf (Will Kemp) who carries part of the answer to the puzzle - when he isn't trying to chew a hole in Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman).<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, the last living member of her family, who have been dedicated to exterminating Dracula for some 400 years.  Thanks to an oath of her forefathers, the Valerious line is condemned to purgatory as long as Dracula wanders the night.  Concerned that this curse is about to become permanent, a secret order of the Catholic Church sends in their best occult assassin - Van Helsing - aided reluctantly by Friar Carl (David Wenham), who plays the mad inventor to Van Helsing's athletic efforts.  Gabriel shows up to help Anna, is promptly rebuffed by the woman, whose mind is definitely her own.  But the action goes ballistic, and no one gets time to be banished or stomp off.<br /><br />And of action, special effects, stunts. and computer graphics there is a great muchness.  Most of which looks just believable enough to keep the audience staring open mouthed at the screen.  An outstanding job is done with Dracula's wives (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran) and the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley).  So good that these characters very nearly steal the entire show.  Sets are equally carefully crafted, with a marvelous medieval town and two whole gothic castles.  The visual impression of the film often completely overwhelms the story.<br /><br />The acting is bright, with a slightly crude, sarcastic style of interplay between the characters. The overall touch is comedic, despite the inevitable sour grapes of the ending.  Don't look for greatness here.  The point is to create an exciting, fun experience, not to recreate the dark and brooding spirit behind the originals.  Sommers does well with this tongue-in-cheek, cut-and-run style and Van Helsing proves this once again</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>Don't let the negative comments scare you away from this film;  most of these viewers totally missed the point of the film.  This is a actually a parody of the horror genre (like Polanski's "The Fearless Vampire Killers").  So if you don't appreciate parody don't watch it and I'm not guaranteeing that you will find it good parody, just don't dismiss the film because somebody thought it was serious and said or wrote something negative about it-they are probably clueless.<br /><br />Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and "Redneck Zombies") to the subtle (see "The Fearless Vampire Killers" and "Evil Dead"). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped "Van Helsing" closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons "Q" Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then "Van Helsing" certainly qualifies.<br /><br />They went into this project saying something like: "let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the "horror genre". When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it).<br /><br />The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or "Igor" (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film.<br /><br />The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from "The Fearless Vampire Killers".<br /><br />The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in "The Aviator") as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.<br /><br />So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend disbelief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't, are just humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away.<br /><br />Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun. I suggest getting the "Ultimate Edition" DVD because of all the extras it contains.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>VAN HELSING, though a tadbit weak in storyline, is a great popcorn fun fest that is sure to please action/adventure fans.<br /><br />Full of hair-raising special effects, Van Helsing is fast-paced and fun to watch.  But the weaknesses were mainly semi-weak plot with Dracula being portrayed by a B-movie actor.<br /><br />But I'll be buying it mainly because I dig Hugh Jackman and Stephen Sommer's style of movie making.  I hope he just get's grittier stuff than the Mummy type movies.  I liked Van Helsing better than the Mummy movies myself, because the look of this film and it's pacing were excellent.<br /><br />Great mix of horror characters.  I will be looking forward to his next endeavor in films...</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>i have to say that van helsing was a great film. one, it had all the classic horror monsters in it and two, it had the legendary vampire hunter van helsing. what more could you ask. it had out of this world action, a few fright scenes, very smooth comedy, and to top it all of a all star cast of actors. our story begins one year earlier when the frankenstien monster is born (the opening is in black and white) then the next year we find helsing in france tracking down mr. hyde. then he is called to rome on a top mission. he must go to transylvania and stop count dracula from hacthing his children, his devilish brides and the wolf man. joined by his assistant carl, the transylvanian princess anna, and the frankenstien monster, to stop the counts evil plans. see the movie i gaurnatee you will put it in your dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Hugh Jackman has to have more talent than to be in big noisy special effects pieces like this.  It isn't so much that this is a bad story as it is burdened with so much noise, hyperkinetic special effects, and the kitchen sink.  I mean everything about all monster movies is thrown into this thing including Q from the James Bond series.<br /><br />But my main gripe is that human beings cannot fall hundreds of feet and be just fine.  I mean, if you have super heroes and monsters and all that, the real humans have to stay limited to real human powers to make the monsters exceptional.  If you make the people nearly as exceptional as the monsters you diminish the whole movie.<br /><br />Anyway, it was fun in the way a 2nd rate roller-coaster ride is fun.  You know you aren't really getting to the edge of things, but if you turn off your brain, you can enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>This is one of the few reviews that needs to begin with a discussion of the climax. Why? I still want to know how two of the three key pieces that composed the climax occurred. Since it's inappropriate to discuss the specifics of any climax in a review, I'll respect that. But I have to say: not only do I not really understand how it happened, I thought it was very poorly constructed. In addition to that, the d&eacute;nouement was fairly pedantic and, at best, without real feeling.<br /><br />OK. So much with the conclusion - the climax and the denouement. The concept for this film - a monster hunter with inexplicable longevity who works for an underground "sect" of the Catholic Church - isn't a bad one. European monsters have long held our attention: vampires, Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde. The main problem with the attempt to bring all of this together is that the writers didn't truly understand the nature of the monsters, or the fundamental arguments and/or nature of good and evil. What we saw in that regard was mostly sophomoric.<br /><br />Question #1 that I had: Why was Mr. Hyde in this movie? He seemed to serve only as a prelude to bring Van Helsing to the Church. Things should only exist in a film or book (any medium) if they are integral to the structure - not if they are merely a vehicle. This was a vehicle. There was also a problem with Mr. Hyde: he was larger than The Hulk. And yet, with such incredible strength, Van Helsing not only subdues him, but kills him. Amazing? No. Dumb.<br /><br />Question #2: Humans in this film were capable of sustaining mind numbing damage. Van Helsing himself should have been dead during his first monster encounter with Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing was hit hard - HARD - multiple times, and didn't appear to sustain even a broken bone.<br /><br />Since Van Helsing had somewhat immortal qualities (if the reason for his longevity was touched upon, I missed it), I could understand some of that. But what about the Valerios family? Anna sustained damage throughout the film that would have killed a herd of elephants, and had this rather remarkable ability to walk up walls and do somersaults off of them. What was that about? Is this strength bestowed upon her through some mysticism of the Catholic Church? Who knows? We sure don't. That means it isn't credible.<br /><br />Question #3: If Dracula wanted Anna dead so badly, and his three "brides" proved themselves entirely incapable of such a feat after repeated failures, why didn't he do it himself? This is a major problem in many fantasy, horror, thriller, or suspense films (or books for that matter). Instead of trying to work out a reason for why the Dracula figure doesn't take matters into his own hands (which would require too much creativity, apparently), they simply ignore it. But think about it. You're Dracula. You want this girl dead. Your brides can not accommodate your wishes. Would *you* allow them to fail, time and again, or would you just walk into the village and be done with her once and for all? Remember, the longer she remains alive, the worse your chances for survival are.<br /><br />Question #4: I have never seen a movie where all of the main characters (even a clumsy Frankenstein monster) had such remarkable acrobatic and Tarzan-like vine swinging skills. If anyone was entertained by feat after feat after feat of impossible gymnastic extravaganza, well, I don't mean to insult anyone, but come on. It's absurd. Sure, at some point you have to allow for the suspension of disbelief. But as John Gardner said (and this is a rough paraphrase): "Where Folly leads, Judgment must follow. To dumb it down, things need to make sense. Perhaps if these characters had lived in the 21st century, they would have belonged to a circus. But they didn't, and without all of that training, their feats were *impossible*.<br /><br />Was there anything good about the film? Well, the special effects were good, with the exception of all of the Tarzan nonsense. The swinging here and there, and even some of the flying, appeared absurd at times, and obviously CGI created. When we have seen such remarkable special effects in recent years, specifically with the Lord of the Rings films, these flaws are quite glaring.<br /><br />I was saddened when I looked at the director's credentials. His first film of note was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, starring then child prodigy Elijah Wood. That was a good movie. Since then, he's decided to take the amusement park route. Deep Rising (a squid attacking a ship?) The Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and the introduction of the Scorpion King? All of them, while perhaps stylish and shot well, were poorly written and offered very little climactic satisfaction. In other words, cotton candy.<br /><br />Just like Van Helsing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>I love monsters, and i thought this movie would be awesome!  Although the creatures/monster are awesome, i just felt like the movie was just "OK." It just didn't keep me captivated.  I like Hugh Jackman, especially as Wolverine, but this is just so typically aweful at times.  Kate Beckinsale is a good actress and she was a highlight to the movie, but it was just cheesy, I'm sorry to say that is movie was a disappointment to me, but if you love monsters/creature of the Old, this is a movie for you, it just wasn't for me.  It would of been nice to just have one monster per movie maybe, but it was just too much.  Sometimes less is more!</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>In the Far side of Romania, lies the country of Transvilvania- home of many nightmarish creatures including the evil and undestroyable Count Dracula and the only man who can can kill this blood sucker is Van Helsing. Inspired by Universal's classic horror films "Dracula" "Frankenstein" and "the Wolf Man" comes this thrilling action packed adventure from Stephen Sommers, the director of "the Mummy" "the Mummy Returns" Starring Hugh Jackman as the notiorous monster hunter who dedicates his life to vanquishing evil creatures, as he battles Count Dracula, the Wolf Man and he encounters the Frankenstein Monster with a Beautiful Woman with a family lasting mission to destroy Dracula. It's a spectular great visual effects filled thrill ride, an amazing landmark Universal film that pays homage to the classic horror films. If you like monsters, adventure and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, then see "Van Helsing" it's monsterous entertaining experience that I hope has a sequel. "My Job, my Life, my Curse is to Vanquish Evil"</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Van Helsing was like watching a 2 hour video game, or maybe it actually was a video game. For those who actually like a story with all those special effects, this movie did not deliver.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but it had no creativity to it. It seems as though the action, fantasy and horror movies have become so dependent on special effects that they actually can try to get by with little else, devoid of a good story or creepy characters. None of these characters were very impressive, and had little in the way of script to get themselves out of their proverbial holes. As one reviewer mentioned, Dracula came across as wimpy and annoying more than anything else. Personally, I didn't care what happened after about an hour and a half of viewing. I just wanted it to end.<br /><br />Perhaps a cynical viewpoint to express, but I'm sick of watching a movie and seeing nothing but special effects. This one is not much a movie mainly because it lacks what even the cheesy horror movies of the past had:  personality.<br /><br />None here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Van Helsing&quot; is a kitchen sink monster movie, so it is a question of how far it can go before things fall apart, which for me was pretty far.  The best part of writer-director Stephen Sommers' film is arguably the prologue, done in glorious black &amp; white as a wonderful homage to the Universal monster pictures of yesterday.  In Transylvania the torch bearing peasants are storming Castle Frankenstein, where the Victor (Samuel West) has just brought his creation (Shuler Hensley) to life and is screaming, &quot;It's alive!  Alive!  Alive!,&quot; the words immortalizing by Colin Clive back in 1931's &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;  However, there is a twist in that Dr. Frankenstein is working with Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who is after the secret of creating life for his own purposes.  Events take their tragic course and then we pick up the story a year later in color with the title character (Hugh Jackman) in Paris on the trail of the Hunchback of Notre Dame (who actually turns out to be a different literary monster).<p>To be clear, this is not Abraham Van Helsing, the wise doctor of Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; novel, but a mysterious monster killer whose first name turns out to be Gabriel.  I would say that he is decked out like Solomon Kane, but that has nothing to do with any of the Universal monster movies.  He is dispatched by a secret organization in the Vatican to go to Transylvania and kill Dracula.  Not just because the count is an evil vampire, but because the noble house of Valerious has been fighting Dracula for several hundred years and the entire family can only go directly to heaven, passing purgatory or worse, if they kill the vampire before he wipes out their family, which is now down to Prince Velkan (Will Kemp) and Princess Anna (Kate Beckinsale).<p>Apparently Dracula knows about the deal as well because when Van Helsing gets to Transylvania the vampire launches an attack with his three brides,  Aleera (Elena Anaya), Verona (Silvia Colloca), and Marishka (Josie Maran).  Fortunately, Van Helsing has a new sidekick, Carl (David Wenham), a friar who is clearly the Vatican equivalent of James Bonds' Q.  Carl main creation is basically a mechanical crossbow that shoots like a machine gun.  However, technology is of limited value when you are dealing with monsters.  <p>Sommers plays with the rules of his monsters a little bit.  This time around werewolves do not sprout hair but rather claw off their skin to reveal their fur (and visa versa), which I found rather effective.  The Frankenstein monster has a touch of the industrial revolution about him and is one of the more human characters in the film.  As for Dracula, it seems that driving a stake through his heart or shoving a cross in his fangs no longer has much effect and our hero has to discover exactly what you have to do to this particular vampire to get him to bite the dust.<p>In the end there are two flaws that undercut the effectiveness of this film.  The first has to do with the new werewolf rules, because I am still not sure when you turn into a werewolf and the whole transformation bit ends up speeding up to meet the demands of the plot.  The second is the idea that Van Helsing and Anna are too busy trying to be superheroes (or Tarzan), swinging around on cables and such.  There so much swinging on such things, over enormous distances, that the idea is done to death and just becomes a sort of running joke.  Add to this that at the end Sommers tries to over a transcendent grace note that is rather lame.  Fortunately the end credits are pretty cool, so you can still leave the theater having good thoughts about &quot;Van Helsing.&quot;<p>I was not grossly offended by this film as are some aficionados of the classic Universal Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man films have admitted to being.  For throwing three major characters into the mix &quot;Van Helsing&quot; does a good job of making the pieces fit overall and providing a nice summertime roller coaster ride.  The attempt to build chemistry between the hero and the heroine us really nothing more than an attempt to put off their kiss as long as possible and the mystery as to what Van Helsing cannot remember anything about his past is also a minor matter.  This movie is about monsters fighting monsters and on that part the film delivers with the volume turned all the way up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Actually rating should be 3.5 stars. This movie is strictly what is considered as a "popcorn flick". Make sure you check your brain at the door if you wished to enjoy this movie. Since this movie is not reality based, there would be no reason why it should not have a comic book feel to the entire film.<p>The computer graphics did a good job recreating all the classical monsters like the werewolf and if there was any real complaint, that it was too much CGI work. The story was super thin and dialogue was best kept simple as the story - which have Van Helsing going to battle Dracula and his minions. Hugh Jackson does a good job here soldiering on for God and Church against the forces of evil. Kate Beckinsale wasn't too bad and Dave Wenham who was badly miscast in Return of the King was actually pretty good here as a fiar, Brother Carl. While not as good his Mummy movies, I thought the director, Stephen Sommers did well. The ending surprised me a bit but I can feel a sequel coming if this movie make big bucks.<p>Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones and all made up, this may be a good movie to have a party around. It may scared little kids but grown should have fun with it. Don't take it seriously and it should be enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>This is a highly entertaining film with loads of technical expertise similar to the Matrix films. The computer graphic artistry is expert. It is a modern version of classic films with themes including Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolves, Brides of Dracula, *plus*, a swashbuckling adventurer, named Van Helsing, who on certain levels, resembles a darker, cutting-edge, mysterious "Indiana Jones", added to this is, a 'secret' religious group within the Catholic church that is 'fighting the worst kind of evil' resembling an off-spring of the "Da Vinci Code". Overall, the film was a huge hit with this viewer and the audience who sat in the same theater ... <p>It is non-stop action and in this sense, resembles the Matrix ... The film begins with scenes of magnificent snow-capped mountains, quaint villages with spired onion-domed steepled churches, hordes of peasants in revolt, trying to break into the castle while crossing the moat ... Dr. Hyde (Victor) has created a 'monster', Frankenstein ... Victor is killed and Dracula seeks to steal the machine which produces 'life' ...so that his 'off-spring' with his brides may be brought to life. for 400 years Dracula has been forced to drink the blood of the local peasants, but to his credit ... he never takes more than he needs (such a nice guy and handsome, too). Velkion and Anna, the son and daughter of Count Valerius of Transylvania are trying to fight Dracula and his vampire entourge (who just happen to be mostly -- no, in fact, *all* are females). Velkion, the handsome young count becomes a 'werewolf' during one of the fights against the evil forces which haunt this village. Van Helsing receives orders from a secret Catholic organization, he is to go to Transylvania to overthrow the powers of evil which are growing there and may overtake Europe. He receives James Bond-like modern weapons created by Karl, a friar, who is a modest-looking scientific expert. He becomes Van Helsing's side-kick in this adventure. Furthermore, he brings along a parchment, with an undecipherable Latin phrase that later fits into the mural on the wall. It becomes the 'missing piece' providing the "secet" to the entrance to Dracula's castle. The battle between "good and evil" ensues ... again, the resemblence to the Matrix is very evident but with lots of differences. The transformations of human into monster and back to human are quite creative and realistic, computer artistry at its best. <p>The casting and acting for the most part are superb. Richard Roxburgh plays Dracula with finesse. He looks authentically like a Transylvanian, complete with believable Eastern European accent. His clothes and manners are impeccable. His upper class haughtiness is perfect. Van Helsing is a great action hero,a true fighter for the cause. Hoswever, he is a let-down in the area of romance. The scenes with him and Anna (Kate Beckinsdale) do not *sizzle* ... unfortunately, our hero is much more interested in his *job* than *this* temptation, a tangential romantic relationship ... too bad ... that is the only reason I gave it *FOUR* and not *FIVE* stars. Of course, Van Helsing is not to blame, it is the writer. Nonetheless, even with this one flaw, I highly recommend this film. Great fun and entertainment.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Stephen Sommers must really love Raiders of the Lost Ark - he keeps remaking it; first as The Mummy, then as The Mummy Returns, and now as Van Helsing.  Perhaps the reason I liked this movie is that my expectations were so low - I'd been hearing negative feedback for weeks.  But what sold me is this movie is a love letter to Classic Age of Universal Monster Movies.  The plot of this film is no more silly than that of Frankenstein vs. the Wolf Man, say.  <p>Frankly, I think Sommers has ONLY seen those movies - everything in this film is reminiscent of them: Frankenstein in the windmill, Dracula's Bela Lugosi accent.  The main character is named Gabriel Van Helsing - either to distinguish him from Bram Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing, or Sommers just didn't know what his first name really was.  In actuality, this is an "alternate universe" story - the Frankenstein and Dracula have nothing to do with Mary Shelley or Bram Stoker...or history, for that matter.<p>This is essentially a James Bond film.  Van Helsing works for the Catholic Secret Service, going around the world, killing monsters.  The funny thing is, Hugh Jackman is basically playing Wolverine from X-Men all over again: he is an immortal super-hero who can't remember his past.  Sound familiar?  Watch the movie, the comparisons grow.<p>I enjoyed this movie for the art direction and the atmosphere.  Let's face it, no matter how many times filmmakers want to take us inside Castle Dracula, I'll be there to go with them.  The story is pure shlock, but that doesn't matter.  The whole film seems to be a promo for the Van Helsing Ride coming to a Universal Theme Park near you!  However, I mind mindless action movies less lately.  Screenplay writing is a dead art and if I'm going to sit through a banal script, I better be watching something visually interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Van Helsing(released May/04)stars Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious.This production was sure a roller coaster ride,but not in the good sense.I found it quite uneven,with the two stars playing it right on,with other characters sabotaging their work,thus weakening the whole;down to poor writing.The CGI,as far as creatures go,was also terribly weak.<br />The story opens in Transylvania and Dr Frankenstein is bringing his Monster to life.The castle he works in is owned by Count Dracula and Dracula wants the doctors creation for his own uses.An argument ensues and the good doctor dies.The Monster takes the doctor to the top of a windmill,which is set on fire by the towns people.They end up crashing down through the structure when the floor beneath them gives way.<br />A year later we find Van Helsing in Paris tracking down Mr Hyde.He finds him in a bell tower,struggles with him and ends up killing him.He is summoned to the Vatican,who bankrolls Van Helsings exploits.They reprimand him for failing to bring Mr Hyde back alive.His next job will be bringing the Count down.Van Helsing,along with sidekick Friar Carl,travel to Romania to find the Count.They meet up with Anna,the last member of the Valerious family,who have fought the Count for generations.Just before his arrival Anna's brother had been bitten by a werewolf and was now being used by the Count to bring his vampiric children to life.However it doesn't succeed,so the count looks for the Monster to use.<br />Anna and Van Helsing find the Monster first and spirit him off to the Vatican.Along the way Annas brother attacks the carriage and Van Helsing gets bitten,but not before Van Helsing kills him.Anna is taken captive and Van Helsing must travel to his castle to rescue her.In the attempt,the Monster is captured and taken by the Count to a secret lair.Anna,Van Helsing and the Friar discover a secret portal that takes them directly to the lair.The Monster is rescued but the Counts children are brought successfully to life.Dracula,and a now turned Van Helsing,fight to the finish,with the Count biting the dust.Van Helsing turns on Anna and kills her,but not before she injects him with a serum the Count had to undo the werewolf curse.The Valerious family has now been cleansed and purified.<br />The problem with a movie,especially Sci Fi/fantasy films like this where the suspension of disbelief is paramount,if you don't grab your viewers attention and pull them into your world right off,or cannot get them back somewhere along the line,then you are in trouble.And if your plot is such that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do exactly,then you are in even bigger trouble.Does this film want to be serious,or is it sending up the monster genre,or is it a light drama with serious overtones,or....?<br />The Count played by Richard Roxburgh,to me was almost played in a send-up kind of style.He seemed to be doing a poor impression of Bela Lugosi,not only speech wise,but his entire body language and look was slightly over the top and unconvincing;about as scary as a box of cereal.Then came the monster of Mr.Hyde.Van Helsing's first encounter is in a bell tower,and the huge Mr Hyde is hanging upside down looking at him.Again,giving off no menacing vibes whatsoever,and the CGI being too obvious and cheap.Then we have the character of Friar Carl.If I hadn't known what movie I was looking at,I would have sworn I was looking at a James Bond film,and this was "Q".Carl is the equivalent of that Ian Fleming character,showing Van Helsing around the workshop,chock full of hi-tech gadgetry.Carl also becomes a source of the film's lighter moments,with his naive and meek and mild manner.Trouble is,he didn't add to the story,just detracted from it.Then we come to Dracula's children.These things were like small gargoyles and again the CGI again detracted from their menace.Finally we have the Monster.At Dracula's castle,as he is being taken on the table up to the tower,he starts spouting bible passages.I have never seen a more erudite monster,than the one that appears in this film.It's weird and I found it so out of type as to be totally unbelievable.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include bloopers,commentary,two featurettes and a you are in the movie short.<br />All in all a totally disappointing outing for me.The writers had a virtual cornucopia of ideas here to work with,but in the end blew it.Some of the characters were played weakly and went against the film dynamic,the film itself not knowing exactly which way it wanted to go.And it had unconvincing creature CGI effects.Therefore,this picture had no where to go but down for this reviewer.The stars,Beckinsale and Jackman,both played it the way I thought the whole film would be played,but other characters sabotaged it.2 1/2 stars.Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>I have to say I actually enjoy this movie.  Hugh Jackman did the movie really good in my viewpoint, plus Kate Beckinsale was very entertaining preformance as the princess.  It had enough plot line for a good movie, this movie basically ends up being a love it or hate it movie as I call certain movies.  It had enough chessy parts to make for a mindless entertainment value.  Just remeber to keep an open mind while watching certain movies, some might end up surpising you just like this movie did for me.  It was better then imagne it could have been.  Plus I enjoy certain horror movies anyways, and most live up to the hype.  So if you need a good laugh and some good speical effects then pick this movie up and enjoy some good lines and action scenes.  Then after watching it make up your own mind about if you like it or didn't like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>I enjoy this movie, I still watch it.

Visuals and CGs were not as brilliant as Lord of the Rings trilogy but very good indeed for a passable entertaining movie. Everything was allright except Count Dracula. In behind the scenes featurettes on disc two I found out Stephen Sommers and his crew's adorable and hard effort of making this movie and make it a good and memorable one. but the question is, why beyond all of that efforts, they ruined most of their job's impression by casting a wrong person as dracula? and funny is, in "Dracula featurette" on disc two they mentioned some brilliant nominees as Jeoffery Rush for this role! Just imagine if Jeoffery Rush had played in this movie as Dracula, How memorable this movie could've been? I could give this movie 5 stars if they'd used someone else instead of that clown!<br />Hugh Jackman and kate Beckinsale were the best matches for their rules. A good complex I can say! In CG and visuals, they did a great and really monumental job. but their consequence have not enough impression! some CGs are very sophisticated and look like real and some like Mr Hyde, Frankenstein Monster and Dracula monster at the end of movie are awful. I think they've used too much imagination thet they shouldn't!<br />anyway It's a "must have" DVD set for a CG movie collection or even an action movie collection. Special features are really good and useful in the Ultimate Collector's Edition. I've not seen such accurate featurettes on making a movie in any DVD set except Lord of the Rings Trilogy extended editions! but the price of this set is irrationally high! Approx 50 dollars for a 2 disc set? I don't know why. me myself have Asian Import of the Ultimate Collector's edition which is even better than US version. It has a great outer box. A double DVD case plus two Dual-layer dvds with a marvelous print that I've never seen in any US made DVD! All artworks are included plus a great real DTS audio track! It doesn't seem bootleg with all of that great features and I bought it 8.00 dollars! With all the respect, I think it's time for some US producers to reconsider their prices cause US release DVDs are not unique in quality anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Showing you where I stand, Frank Langella will always be Dracula to me, and Laurence Olivier will always be Abraham Van Helsing to me. Also, so you know,this is not Dracula in the most traditional sense. If this is what you are looking for, then you are better off looking in the direction of Lugosi or Langella. All of that said, this is an excellent movie well worth watching. It pays tribute to the many horrors of the past. (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman) It even starts by showing the first scene in black and white. (A nice tribute to the black and white era of horror movies.) While paying tribute to this time in the history of horror, the movie takes a closer look at the hero (Van Helsing). While Peter Cushing (Christopher Lee's enemy)  and Laurence Olivier (Frank Langella's enemy) handled the role of Van Helsing with style and charm, this movie explores the inner struggles of Van Helsing. This time, the hero is kind of an Indiana Jones type. (A basically good person who has faults and is willing to operate outside the law if he has to.) Van Helsing's allies are well placed. (The woman who carries a personality not so different from himself, and the side kick who is a little more innocent and nervous, but loyal and dedicated.) While many of us are used to the silent and frightening Frankenstein as portrayed in horror, the Frankenstein here is a little closer to the actual book. (Someone who is articulate and carries a deep sadness.) Dracula doesn't quite dominate the screen the way Frank Langella does, but again, this movie is more about Van Helsing. But Dracula does have an acceptable amount of screen time, and despite his evil, he has his charm. The scenery is not exactly up to Director Franco Zeffirelli, but it is memorable. I'm not one who really cares for special effects, but this is one rare case where the special effects flatter the events instead of distracting from them. I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but they cleverly avoid the cliche happy ending. If you like this movie, I can suggest the following items as well. The book "Frankenstein" (1831) by Mary Shelley, the Lugosi version of "Dracula," (1931), "Horror of Dracula," (1958), and Frank Langella's "Dracula" (1979).</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Steven Sommers got it right when he re-made The Mummy even though it wasn't that good, but it was still entertaining.  The Mummy Returns was only crap in my opinion because of the terrible CG effects, other than that it was pretty consistent in quality.  Van Helsing somehow tries to combine The Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein into one movie called Van Helsing.  Though, Van Helsing is not the same character from Dracula and really has nothing to do with anything.  The mythologies of these three worlds are completely wasted for some crappy "comedic" lines and some overblown special effects.  The movie runs about 2 hours and 12 minutes and could've been edited to the pace that it was meant for.  Heck, it might have even been a good movie if it wasn't so long.  This film just reminds me of the 1979 Universal Dracula remake, which was crap as well and that's because it tried too hard to be great like it's predecessors, and with the classic Universal horrors you can't do that.  That's why The Mummy was good.  So, I say unless you like modern movies and their special effects circuses you might like this, but if you're a fan of respectable movies you'll recognize it as trash.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Usually I avoid any movie that promotes itself on Happy Meal boxes or Taco Bell cups, but "Van Helsing" surprised me.  Alot of action, interesting story and awesome special effects and make-up. I guess some people would rather watch a film like "The Village" (which is the equivilent to watching a hampster spin around on a wheel for 2 hours).  If you like being entertained with no strings attached, "Van Helsing" delivers.  Every movie ever made doesn't have to be profound.  Film snobs will hate "Van Helsing" and scoff because it lacks such things as "irony" and "character development".  Those topics are passe and trife and cleary used a bargaining tools for the jaded film slave desperate for validation.  "Van Helsing" is an excellent film for what genre it was made for.  Horror/Thriller/Drama/Action.  It fills all of those shoes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>This movie reminded me of the Abbot and Costello monster movies. Every monster, except for "The Invisible Man," was in this movie just for the fun of it, just like the Abbot and Costello movies.  The movie had its good points. First, the movie had a lot of energy. Second, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing was very good.  The special effects were good. The sets were terrific. I liked the Frankenstein monster. He was the only intelligent character in the movie.<br /><br />On the minus side, Dracula was not very scary. The plot was very stupid, but then it wasn't directed toward adults, I suppose. Of course, my kids would have torn the movie apart for its internal inconsistencies. I grew up watching monster movies so I am more forgiving. The special effects tended to defy physics and logic at every conceivable opportunity. There was a lot of swinging from cables and ropes for impossible distances. The movie redefined the vampire legend without explaining why. For example, silver stakes were substituted for wooden stakes, I think. Vampires can sexually reproduce, somehow, I think. It wasn't really clear to me what was going on. There are some plot points that absolutely insulted my intelligence or the intelligence of the vampires.<br /><br />Keep your expectations very low and the movie was okay. By all means, rent and not buy. I can't see any reason to see this movie twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The multi talented Hugh Jackman in an obvious money grab plays the title role in the predominantly awful flick "Van Helsing".

This movie... about VAMPIRES, FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLVES and DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE isn't even remotely REMOTELY scary. Not a sliver.<br /><br />Which is completely and squarely placed on the shoulders of Director Stephen Sommers. Which, and I could see it coming a mile away, also directed The Mummy, which also wasn't scary.<br /><br />And you know what... I don't think it was intended to be scary when they went into production... which makes it even worse.<br /><br />Before going to see this movie, I was completely aware of the downfall I would soon become fully aware of. The movie wouldn't be scary. It wouldn't be dark and risky. It would be a comedy with cool special effects.<br /><br />WHAT!! How can you pool the great monsters of our time and NOT KNOW YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MOVIE SOMEWHAT SCARY!<br /><br />Yet the Beckinsale/Maran factor drug me into the theatre and my preconceived notion was absolutely correct...<br /><br />Ho.

However, I was surprised because "Van Helsing" turned out to be a surprisingly great movie and blew all of my expectations right out into the ocean. <p> A special operative named Gabriel Van Helsing is a mysterious man who hunts demons and vampires in the streets of 1880s Paris and London but is assigned to hunt down a murderous vampire named Count Vladius Dracula who aims to spread evil and horrors all over humanity and Van Helsing travels to Transylvania where his world collides with a young woman, the last descendant of a family that has been dedicated to ridding the world of evil for centuries and now aims to destroy Dracula for good after the atrocities he's committed including murdering her father. Dracula has also been sending out a large swarm of smaller vampires hatched in his lair to exterminate the residents of a nearby town in the Transylvanian Mountains. Princess Anna's family has made it's vow that it will not enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed for good and Van Helsing is the only one who can really in fact can do just that. <p> I actually found the movie to more fun than scary for the most part but some of the scenes were pretty intense to watch and some were a bit much for me. This movie isn't necessarily one for the thinking crowd but "Van Helsing" is nonetheless a really fun and action-packed flick that is a really great homage to the classic 1930s through 1950s horror movies and brings back a lot of the old-fashioned styles of the past. In some ways too it also breaks some of the predictable elements of vampire films of the past. It almost even sheds a totally new light on the classic Frankenstein monsters of old. <p>This movie has it's share of flaws such as some hammy acting in some spots and awkward storyline but a lot of them are bypassed because this movie is just plain fun and worth killing a couple of hours. It is no masterpiece or even an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination but it is certainly worth a look...that is if you aren't willing to watch a movie that requires intellectualization but instead is like mind popcorn to munch on and that's what matters here. If you loved "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" then "Van Helsing" is worth the buck.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>This is one of those films where you just cannot trust the critics at all.  Like last year's vastly underrated THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, VAN HELSING is one of those movies that you know is gonna get pummled by the critics even before the movie comes out.  Not because of the film itself, but of what kind of film it is; critics just don't seem to like these sort of movies.  I for one love 'em, and VAN HELSING did not disappoint.  On the contrary, it was way better than I expected!<p>Right from the very beginning (in a terrific black & white homage to the beloved Universal classics of old), I knew that I was in for one helluva good time!  Stephem Sommers delivers a much better film than THE MUMMY RETURNS, when at the same time using almost all the elements from that film.  There's epic scope, reminiscent of the INDIANA JONES films; mind-boggling production design (the $148 million budget truly shows in the costumes and massive, intricate sets); and great action scenes, which thankfully lose the sloppiness seen in those of THE MUMMY RETURNS.  Alan Silvestri returns for the musical score, which unfortunately doesn't come close to the sweeping grandeur of his score for TMR, but there are still some great musical moments in this film.  But the main reason VAN HELSING truly rises above TMR is for the very same reason THE MUMMY was so great: the tongue-in-cheek attitude of it all.  Action movies like these are meant to be campy, but only to a point.  TMR pushed it waaaaaaaaaay too far, but VAN HELSING does it just right, very much like Sommers' first MUMMY film did.<p>The cast is just plain perfect, as well.  Hugh Jackman is the charismatic hero he always is (not to say that his role feels tired, far from it), and Kate Beckinsale makes for a surprisingly good female lead.  David Wenham is just plain hilarious as the friar Carl, who supplies Van Helsing with all his unique weaponry (similar to Q from the James Bond film series).  But for me, the best member of the cast by far was Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula.  His performance is nothing short of brilliance, eminating the same sort of twisted, operatic villainy that was present in Tim Curry's performance in LEGEND.  Roxburgh's take on Dracula is a totally new one, for no longer is he the quiet, horrific figure that Bela Lugosi was, nor the intimidating Dracula of Christopher Lee.  No, this Count is now a deranged-yet-contained lunatic (remiscent of Peter Cushing's Dr. Frankenstein); the tongue-in-cheek, mad scientist insanity Roxburgh lends to the role keeps one's eyes glued to the screen, allowing him to easily steal every scene he's in.  In short, his performance alone is worth seeing the movie for.<p>The plot is surprisingly original, adding fresh new takes on several monster legends without dishonoring the originals.  If it's one complaint I have about the film, it is that Van Helsing's actual identity wasn't quite as explained as it should have been.  (That's one thing I'm hoping for the DVD to explain.)  That, and the very ending (SPOILER ALERT!), in which you see Kate Beckinsale's face in the clouds, being greeted by her ancestors in heaven.  I'm sorry, but this was just way too cheesy.  Instead, they should've just shown Van Helsing looking up into the heavens and left out the faces.  But in the end, it's a very, very minor complaint in a 2+ hour movie.  Besides, the final shot more than makes up for it, almost guaranteeing a sequel (which I have mixed feelings about).<p>In conclusion, VAN HELSING is a fantastic way to kick-start the Summer Movie Season, and is sure to please any fan of LXG, THE MUMMY, or the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  Adventure lives forever, indeed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Have you ever watched "The mummy"? If so, and if you liked it, there's a good chance you'll probably going to enjoy "Van Helsing". Director Stephen Sommers once again used his proven formula to make a blockbuster movie: a likeable male character, a resourceful heroine, funny moments provided by the supporting characters, lots of visual effects, impressive monsters, winged ghouls, the works. <p>Sommers was very intelligent: he knew that a movie like this was going to be burdened by all the endless clich&eacute;s used in previous monster movies, made since the beginning of cinema history. Count Dracula, the Frankesntein monster and werewolves (among others) were portrayed in countless movies; some of them were serious, some of them were spoofs, some of them were good, most of them were terrible. <p>So, what did he do? He pays homage to all those movies. The very first scene is a nod of the head to early horror movies (Lon Chaney comes instantly to mind). This scene is filmed in black-and-white, and features all those constant elements of ancient movie-times: close-ups of the faces of the angry villagers, the huge monster carrying a human being in his arms, a terrible fire in the wind-mill, and more. Sommers also set a sarcastic tone to "Van Helsing" by featuring scenes with more than a close resemblance to other action movies, most notoriouly "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Mission: Impossible" (this is very funny), "Sleepy Hollow", "The name of the rose", and, obviously, Coppola's "Dracula" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein". <p>That is to say: Sommers wrote his screenplay in an intelligent way. He shows the viewer his intention since the first shots. The movie is greatly helped by the beautiful wintry landscape. The visual effects are carefully done, and the animated monsters interact with live characters in a believable way. I only wanted to remind the viewers that this is a work of fiction; in fact, Van Helsing is a fictional character, and vampire, frankenstein and werewolves legends are fictional too. I won't understand someone complaining that he didn't know what this movie was about, that he went to the theater expecting a movie like "The pianist" for example. "Van Helsing" is what it is, and it's good at that. <p>Hugh Jackman is a good actor, and shows it once again. But I think that he could have played his Van Helsing a little bit more loosely; the problem is that he would have looked too much like Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell in "The mummy". Kate Beckinsale is very beautiful in her dark looks, but she's still unconvincing as a romanian Lara Croft-like maiden. The touch of genious is Count Dracula: Richard Roxburgh (from "Moulin Rouge") is almost unrecognizable in his Bono-looks, an extravagant, sometimes pathetic creature. I almost forgot to say, the "romanian" accent was tiresome.<p>If I had to compare "Van Helsing" to "The mummy", I would have to say that "The mummy" is better: the settings, the characters and the story. But "Van Helsing" is not that far behind. It's one of those movies that start slow, but then picks-up the pace and completely grabs the viewer. <p>Anyway, a very good entertainment. For those who know how to appreciate it.<p>Grade 8.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I saw the ads and read all the buzz about this movie so I thought it might be pretty good, I was disappointed. I wondered what was going on with the B/W intro, turns out that was a flashback- it looked about as good as any part of the movie. For the rest you get an odd mix of action, some humor bits (including the James Bondish weapons lab in the Vatican Cellars, and the friar who develops some of them), and a lot of visuals.<br /><br />I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.<br /><br />Spend less than twice the money and get any season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll get better value.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition) is a horror/action movie with a thin plot but still it is very enjoyable. The special effects are quite good and what is not to like when the fabulous Kate Beckinsale is in it. Hugh Jackman does an alright job with the part that is giving to him as Van Helsing on speed. Do not expect a smart or thought worthy plot. See it for what is, a great popcorn movie that is filled with action, great special effects and many beautiful women and then it gets 3/5 since it never promised anything else to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>THE MOVIE WAS O.K!

Kate Beckinsale, as always, is just swell as the Transylvanian princess.  The movie isn't anything heady but it is good fun.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Van Helsing is an action packed and historical character, make believe story that finishes with sequel-attached movie in mind. (Take a breath run on!)<br /><br />  Van Helsing, (Hugh Jackman) the notorious vampire/demon slayer is cast as the savor from the dreaded power-hungry Dracula. (Richard Roxburgh)  The Wolfman and Jekyll/Hyde characters make special appearances. Also, Frankenstein is cast as good character. (Yes he is good.)<br /><br />  This movie starts fast, slow towards middle but speeds up again for the ending. Rent this DVD to see the special effects. Dracula's three female vampires transformation from lovely women to evil vampires is flawless. They wreak havoc on Transylvania folk. Wolfman's screen transformation is a must see. Widescreen edition and digital/high definition television is a must for total theatre experience.<br /><br />  The Transylvania set scenes is filmed realistic. The era is detailed perfectly.  Character costumes are detailed to exact Transylvania specifications.<br /><br />  Transylvania or Dracula's country is run my vampires. Van Helsing must find Dracula's lair to kill him. As detailed in the movie, Dracula and Van Helsing go way back in history. Dracula reveals Van Helsing unknown past.<br /><br />  The Transylvania princess (Kate Beckinsale) is last in lineage for Dracula to kill. If this is done, Dracula and his offspring will rein down on the world like know other in history. Unbeknownst to humankind, Van Helsing is summoned from the church to Kill Dracula. Can it be done!<br /><br />This movie should be filed under Special Effects in your DVD collection. Bonus features include: Dracula's castle, commentary and The Legend of Van Helsing. Van Helsing leaves you pining for more. And he will be back.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>This DVD  is brilliant; its a pity that the special edition had to be packaged separately at almost double the price and released a day later.<br /><br />Great action, great actors, ... sensual to the max, and a totally brilliant piece.<br /><br />The twist in this film is probably ( it seems ) a little too subtle for some, but its good enough for me ... adds a different aura to the Van Helsing mythos, and a good possibility of a sequel</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any Van Helsing comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Van Helsing prior to the film I have to say that the movie was FANTASTIC!<br />There are slight hints of James Bond, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and strong/obvious elements of Frankenstein and Dracula, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.<br />Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and Richard Roxburgh, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind. The setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />After The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, Stephen Sommers has scored another major hit with this action-packed movie!  In short, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Some of the effects were really great, while some seemed hurried and cheap. With that aside, it was a fun film if you leave your brain at the door. The character of Van Helsing himself was super cheesy. He is like a cross between Michael Douglas in "Romancing The Stone" and Indiana Jones. This is a movie that should be seen while on the big screen as it will lose half of its effectiveness on a TV screen. The brides of Dracula stole the show while the Dracula character himself was every stupid cliche of Dracula possible. 2 and 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Much too often i dont understand people and even more so the so called "professional critics". I went to see "Van Helsing" having read barrages of reviews describing it as anywhere between the disaster of all disasters or the joke to end all jokes. Knowing better than to trust critics i decided to risk 2 hours of my saturday night and i didn't regret it.<p>  Van Helsing is two hours of absolutely spectacular tongue in cheek entertainment. That's what it is, and anybody who's judging it on any other level than that is totally missing the point and will inevitably deprive himself of having fun with this cool flick.<p>  In a nutshell, Van Helsing is the guy to call when you've got trouble with some legendary monster. He arrives complete with his special tools and weapons and takes care of the gory business till the next job. From the opening sequence of the film when Helsing takes on a version of dr. Jekyll that looks more like an offshoot of the Hulk, you know you're in for some serious parody fun with loads of aces in the formula:<p>  the effects are truly stunning, but what makes the package even more attractive is the settings, the locations. Van Helsing's adventures take place in 17-18th century Europe, and the monsters are roaming all familiar cultural capitals like Paris or Vienna. The touch of the Eiffel tower being still under construction made me smile.<p>  But then the real plot kicks in and the opening sequence (which was by all means a treat) seems like peanuts.<p>  The exterminator is sent off to legendary Transylvania, where an all-star monster team is terrorising the locals, headed by Dracula and his flying-vampire brides (they totally steal the show of the first hour of the film) along with his army of genetic horrors, a stolen Frankestein with a partially blinking skull, Quasimodo who takes his orders directly from the King Vampire Himself, and of course, werewolves the kind of which i doubt you've seen in such form.<p>  Sounds like all this could be a mess to even attempt to tie into a "story"? Well, as far as I'm concerned, the scriptwriters did a great job of tieing all this together without insulting the audience, except for that part of the audience who insist stubbornly of treating this seriously. Those you can't satisfy anyway.<p>  Once these formalities are taken care of, and once you've understood on what level the premise of this film will work, the rest is a grand success really. The settings are even more impressive now, as the sky-piercing tower of Dracula appears together with the ultra-gothic village at the feet of his mountain which serves as a food source for him and his brides.<br /><br />  The effects jump to jaw-dropping levels by now, and this becomes a super-fun ride. Surprisingly, the nice touches here and there never cease appearing, as  the Dracula character is totally slick and very good with punchlines, while his brides have all the appropriate lines to qualify as high-flying, blood-sucking vixens of the highest order.<p>  I thought that by that time the wheels of the film should be about to fall off. It never happened though. "Van Helsing" keeps a frenetic pace through-out right to the very end, its parody feel is always there in perfect balance, and the overall result is actually very successful when you consider how badly this could've failed. <p>  To be sure, this film belongs in that category where you need to partly shut your brain off in order to enjoy it, but I'll tell you what: I've seen too many films lately where you're supposed to watch with your brain full-on and where the result was an utter joke. At least Van Helsing is totally honest with the viewer which is exactly why you can't possibly feel cheated afterwards, unless of course you want to. That's what some people would call bias (me included). <p>  The paradox of it all? That would be the fact that to make a film like Van Helsing work you need an intelligent film crew, especially that part of the crew involving the directing and the script-writting.<p>  One of the most fun films of 2004....</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Ignore the naysayers here and watch this movie on a big screen, with a good surround sound system cranked up nice and loud. This is a full-on modern cinematic rollercoaster ride, made purely for fun, and it delivers in spades.<br /><br />Essentially a melange of Dracula, Frankenstein, and James Bond, with occasional soupcons of various and sundry genre touches, Van Helsing is a feast for the eyes and ears, and damn funny to boot. I came in expecting nothing, and was well and truly blown away.<br /><br />The effects are flawless, the story quite hilarious, and the overall tone suggests Raiders of the Lost Ark of Transylvania. Jackman and Beckinsale are tailor-made and work well together. Roxburgh gives one of the most hilarious villain performances in screen history, perfectly over the top; his moments alone are worth seeing the film for. I rarely watch recent movies more than once; I've seen this four times in a year and it keeps getting more impressive with each viewing.<br /><br />This is a superb piece of craftsmanship that never takes itself too seriously, and delivers massive doses of fun and many thrilling moments. A better flick for a cold and snowy Saturday's eve would be hard to find.<br /><br />Give it some time; Van Helsing will be a cult classic yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This movie was fun, I read many negative reviews about the movie from people who expected something more then an action/adventure movie but it doesn't matter cause soon as Alan Silvestri (composer) start with the main theme of the movie (one of the best I heard recent years) you forget all logic and put your legs on the table and enjoy the ride, Hugh Jackman and all other actors are doing their job as limited as they are with their acting skills and Sthepen Somemrs who made a horrible movie a few years ago (The Mummy Returns) come back to form and direct some intense action scenes. "Van Helsing" will not win any awards, it probably won't have any sequels due to it's small box-office success and it will probably be forgotten in a few years, yet all  of that doesn't matter the fact that I found this movie very entertaining just like last year's underrated "LXG" (although LXG is much better) and I recommend it for all of you who like good action movies.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>What do people expect in a movie?  This is pure entertainment.  Not perfection.<br /><br />The characters were excellent - and droll - and in some cases, gross.<br /><br />This is great fantasy! Without being offensive!<br /><br />Van Helsing's blades are a bit remaniscent[?] of the Predator's blades.  Go, guys!<br /><br />chuckle. Guess Dracula's offspring had as much chance of survival as the Alien Queen's did.<br /><br />This is one I will be viewing again - I know I must have missed some neat parts.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [especially if you have been a comic buff] this is great guns.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>When movies are described as a "roller coaster ride", or just a "non-stop thrill ride", I already suspect that this is just another movie that will give me a headache.<br /><br />When is Hollywood going to figure it out that making movies with too many special effects, and very little comprehensive drama, ends up being a very disatisfying experience for the viewer?!  Many unnecessary special effects were thrown in just so someone who enjoys creating special effects can "show off" his particular animation talent.<br /><br />When compared to an actual roller coaster, yes, the results can seem to be the same.  Usually a "thrilling roller coaster ride" is only about an honest minute and a half.  You don't want to be on a roller coaster for two hours.  That's what this overkill "roller coaster ride" of a movie does to people like me.  If you're like me, you'll definitely be bored to tears before the "ride" is over.<br /><br />If this movie was written word-for-word as a book, the contents of the story would be very bleak.  Van Helsing, written here, is a pretty bland story.  A loud, "in your face" display of absolutely nothing interesting!  The movie "Twister" was the same way.  All visual, but no real story.<br /><br />"Your reputation precedes you..."  Nobody in real life talks like that, but Hollywood seems to think that's a cool line.  I hear it in movies alot.  In fact, this film has alot of cliches' of films of the past which continues to prove it's lack of originality.<br /><br />And, what's more, they couldn't have picked a more boring, uninteresting actor to play "Dracula".  What is he, a "she-male" or something?  Realistically, Dracula should have been more handsome and charismatic, the way Bram Stoker (the writer and creator of the original "Dracula" written in 1897) perceived him to be.  This Richard Roxburgh as Dracula definitely contributed more to the non-appeal of this film.<br /><br />Come on, honestly, is this the limit of comprehensive imagination?  Does "character development" make you feel like you're having to learn more about a character that you really want to?  The absence of "character development" makes it so that you don't care what happens to anyone in the film.  "Kill him off!", "Kill her off, too!"  Who cares?  We didn't get a chance to know the character anyway.<br /><br />I was really hoping to enjoy this film because I love "gothic artwork".  The still scenes in this film really were very beautiful.  But, it wasn't enough to save this "lame" film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>The year is 1887, and the villagers are storming Frankenstein castle with torches and pitchforks in a scene that lets you know exactly what sort of movie you're watching. "Van Helsing" is a popcorn movie, pure and simple, inspired particularly by the classic horror films of Universal Studios, with a Hammer Studios style (especially "Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter"), and a little James Bond and "Vampire Hunter D" thrown in. The villagers in question are Transylvanians, their anger ignited by the evil experiment taking place in the castle at the hands of Dr. Frankenstein himself, and under the watchful eye of his evil benefactor, Count Vladislaus Dracula. For reasons yet unknown to the viewer, Count Dracula has been sponsoring Dr. Frankenstein's efforts to harness the life-giving power of electricity in the form of a monster constructed from the bodies of 7 dead men. However, once the experiment is a success, the two-faced count lets his true nature show. Frankenstein's reluctance to allow his creation to be used for evil forces Dracula to put the bite on him (ouch, sorry). This disturbs the now living Frankenstein creature, who knocks Dracula into the fireplace with a piece of laboratory equipment and storms out of the castle with his father in his arms.<br /><br />Van Helsing Rule Number One: Fire doesn't work on Dracula.<br /><br />The villagers pursue the Frankenstein monster to an old windmill (classic), and, as he looms over them from the top screaming a very operatic "Whyyyyyy???!!!," the windmill is set ablaze. Just then, the crowd is frightened away by four horrific figures emerging from the clouds. They proceed to land before the burning mill and weep at the loss of their dream. They are Dracula and his three brides. Very cool black and white opening, though campy at times and thoroughly hammy. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula takes some getting used to, but with repeat viewings he can really grow on you. Two of Dracula's three brides, Josie Maran and Elena Anaya, can suck me dry anytime. Silvia Colloca is a bit too mature and downright scary for my tastes.<br /><br />Fast forward one year, to a world that is still dark, but now in color, where we witness a wanted man named Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) trailing another man known by two names: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The setting is Paris, nighttime, and the trail leads to the belfry of the Notre Dame cathedral. Here, we learn the nature of Van Helsing's work. He is a monster hunter, and he brings `em back dead or a live, which often results in him being mistaken for a murderer. In the big fight scene that follows between Van Helsing and the hulking Mr. Hyde, we learn that Abraham is an easy-going character, much more likeable than the usual tough guy hero personas. He's also a religious man, though he has issues (including a loss of memory reminiscent of another famous Hugh Jackman hero), and most importantly, he's the best at what he does. Clad in a dark leather coat and wide-brimmed hat, armed with spinning tojo blades and a sharp wit, Van Helsing makes short work of Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, and the cathedral's famous Rose Window.<br /><br />Avoiding capture by the French police, Van Helsing makes his way to his home-base of sorts, the Vatican City, Rome. Through a secret door in a confessional booth, after some chastising and grumbling back and forth with Cardinal Jinette (guilt and remorse take their toll on Abraham), Van Helsing takes us into the secret lair of a holy order made up of all the religions of the world on a mission to eradicate the monsters that plague our planet. At this point, Cardinal Jinette explains Van Helsing's newest mission to him, simultaneously divulging the details of the plot to us, the audience. It seems that the last two members of a line of Transylvanian nobles, Gypsy Princess Anna Valerious and her brother, Velkan, are in dire need of help to destroy Count Vladislaus Dracula. The fate of the souls of their entire bloodline rests on accomplishing this task, and now they are down to two.  Then, in a sequence right out of a 007 film, a quirky young friar named Carl (David Wenham) introduces Van Helsing to his new "ahead of their time" array of gadgets and weaponry. Before the scene is over, Van Helsing has wrangled Carl into the mission as well.<br /><br />Cut to Transylvania, where the aforementioned gypsy prince and princess are about to spring an elaborate trap to catch a werewolf. A CGI werewolf, but possibly the second coolest looking werewolf ever depicted on film(the first being in this movie also)! Naturally, despite some very cool action and werewolf footage, things don't go as planned. The werewolf does get nailed with a silver bullet, but not before taking Velkan over a cliff with him and down to the icy waters below. Her heart sinking, the lovely Princess Anna looks on and prays for help. Luckily, Van Helsing is on his way, sidekick Carl in tow. Their arrival is not a welcome one, however. The Transylvanian villagers, the same ones we saw storming a castle one year earlier, are wary of strangers. They prepare to kill Abraham and Carl on the spot, with Princess Anna giving the orders, but are interrupted by the vampire brides on a mission to kill the final Valerious. In the process, we finally get a good look at how hot the brides are. Unfortunately, the price is the loss of Josie Maran far too soon in the movie (and with one of the worst CGI effects I've seen in a while). Killing Josie, or Marishka, as she is called in the film, earns V.H. some respect, though he is still not accepted with open arms. It is expected now, that the vampires will be more violent than ever.<br /><br />The two remaining brides return home to Dracula's secret castle, where we are reintroduced to the count, in color this time. He mourns the loss of his bride for about two seconds, walks around on the ceiling, does some ranting, gently reprimands the hideous Igor(played by the always fun and creepy Kevin J. O'Connor) who is torturing a werewolf behind a curtain, and then we're back to Anna and Van Helsing. In Anna's castle, Van Helsing and the princess toss their tactics at each other while flaunting sexual tension. Unfortunately, they don't come to an agreement, resulting in Van Helsing spraying Anna with some wicked cool knockout Binaca in the hopes that she'll have no choice but to use his plan of waiting till morning to hunt. I guess it wares off too soon though, because Anna wakes up and gets to work. Van Helsing catches up with her just in time to chase off her brother, the new werewolf, before he could do any harm during a failed attempt at warning her of Dracula's plans. Van Helsing goes after the beast, but instead has a brief run in with Top Hat, the creepiest guy in town. While Abraham attempts to kill Velkan the werewolf, Anna catches up with him, and the two have it out about people shooting at her brother... After some bonding, the monster hunters soon find themselves heading in the direction of Frankenstein castle to help Velkan and put an end to the Count. While snooping around within the castle walls, they uncover Dracula's secret plan. He has been trying to use Frankenstein's machine to bring his children to life; hundreds of hideous, gargoyle-like babies, born dead and hanging from the ceiling of the castle in slimy pods! Using mortal humans as power conductors has been fruitless, so Dracula begins to experiment on Anna's werewolf brother, Velkan. The creatures are suddenly brought to life, and Dracula sends them out to feed with his brides teaching them. As Van Helsing goes after Dracula and Anna goes after her brother, the little Dracula babies swoop down and attack the village below. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but instead of celebrating, the two heroes find themselves fleeing Frankenstein castle, outnumbered by vampires, werewolf Velkan, and the creepy Dwergi, Dracula's goblin-like henchmen.<br /><br />Van Helsing Rule Number Two: Silver stakes don't work on Dracula.<br /><br />Van Helsing Rule Number Three: Crosses don't work on Dracula, but they do burn.<br /><br />Well, after that fun little adventure, Van Helsing and Anna stop for some wooing over a bottle of absinthe, both having learned something from their recent experience. Van Helsing has learned a bit more about his mysterious past, Anna has learned that the best thing for her brother is a quick death, and all the vampire babies exploded from an insufficient electricity supply, so no major characters are worse off for the visit. In fact, Carl even gets a little action from a villager girl whose life he saved! Typical friar... Anyway, while reflecting on the events of the previous night, Carl makes a significant discovery in the Valerious home. The young friar accidentally finds a hidden clue: a magical painting depicting two knights in battle, one transforming into a werewolf, the other into a bat-creature. Simultaneously, Anna and Van Helsing make a discovery of their own. While discussing the mystery of how to kill dracula and swigging back green liquor in the ruins of the old, burned down windmill, Anna and Van fell through a weak spot and landed in the middle of the Frankenstein monster's secret hangout! Yes, that guy is still alive! Now that morning has come and the two have regained consciousness, they find themselves face to face with the man-made man. He is in no mood for polite conversation, so Van Helsing knocks him out with a blow dart. V.H. seems to love knocking people out. Before the creature passes out, however, he manages to reveal to them the secret of his existence. He is the key to life for Dracula's children, and there are thousands more waiting to be given life in Dracula's own hidden castle. Suddenly, Van Helsing's mission is not only to destroy Dracula, but to hide and protect Frankenstein's monster from the vampire's evil clutches, or else the whole world will suffer under the frenzy of Dracula's thousands of hungry offspring!<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, Van Helsing is a "popcorn flick." Much like "The Mummy Returns," "Van Helsing" is a thrill-ride of a movie. It's a special effects laden action-adventure based on the icons of Universal Studios horror. The point of a film like Van Helsing is to have a good time while watching it, and on those grounds, it's a huge success. Now, I'm not one to praise computer animated characters in live-action films. I confess, a great many of my favorite recent films rely heavily on computer generated characters, but I would almost always prefer audio-animatronics and other real-life effects over CGI, especially with werewolves and other horror related subjects. Why? Well, because I very rarely encounter CGI effects that aren't obvious, and how can you get a chill from something you KNOW isn't there? CGI effects are best when used simply to enhance real elements, and it's always better when the real outweighs the CGI. "Van Helsing" is different though. Yes, there are computer effects in this film that bother me, the death of Marishka, the mouths of the vampires (I prefer the old-fashioned kind), etc...., but these were a few points in a movie heavily laden with CGI. In a film with so many computer effects, it almost becomes more like watching a painting, making the CGI characters seem much less out of place than they appear in a film like "An American Werewolf In Paris." With Van Helsing, so much of the backgrounds and effects are CGI that the pure CGI characters seem to blend in so much better than something that is merely pasted over a world completely real in every other aspect. Thanks to Stephen Sommers' obsession with "Sommersizing" every aspect of his films, the CGI creatures are far less distracting and far more believable. And, one has to admit, you just can't get great werewolf moves like that with costumes or animatronics. These things are fast and fierce, and the coolest looking werewolves I've ever seen. Their transformations usually involved ripping the human flesh off their bodies, which was actually cooler than I ever thought it would be (probably because it wasn't done in a gory way). And, though I don't love this new breed of werewolves that climb walls and columns like a panther or something, at least that was kept to a minimum here.<br /><br />Effects issues aside (since you either can take CGI characters or you can't), this film is top notch for what it aims to be. The cast is perfect. Who doesn't love Hugh Jackman? I've already raved about my two favorite vampire ladies, and Shuler Hensley was such a noble monster (I'd love to see his performance as Jud in "Oklahoma" sometime). Everyone in the cast was a perfect compliment to Hugh Jackman. I've never been big on Kate Beckinsale, but this is one of those films where you can't help but be charmed. And, oh, the music! Alan Silvestri is just awesome! Definitely, a movie for the collection. Not high art, but a perfect choice for a carefree evening of fun and adventure! I sincerely hope a sequel has not been ruled out!<br /><br />Van Helsing is available on a great DVD (fullscreen and widescreen versions, be careful which you buy) with two commentaries (no, neither feature Hugh or Kate), a tour of Dracula's castle, outtakes, other behind the scenes treats, and a nice little look into the character of Van Helsing, the rival of Dracula since the two personalities were first cooked up by Bram Stoker in the 19th century. You can also buy Van Helsing on VHS, or get an Ultimate Edition DVD that includes the original Universal classics "Dracula," "Frankenstein," and "The Wolf Man," along with a couple of extra bonus features. There's even an animated DVD prequel to Van Helsing out entitled: "Van Helsing - The London Assignment." I believe it deals with the story of Van Helsing going after Mr. Hyde. I definitely need to pick that one up someday!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>"Van Helsing" (2004) should have been an enjoyable homage to the classic Universal horror films of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the finished product is an overblown, effects-laden disaster. Not even Hugh Jackman can redeem this sordid enterprise. It's enough to make Bela Lugosi and Edward Van Sloan (the ORIGINAL Professor Van Helsing) spin in their graves.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Any fans of movies like "The Mummy Returns", "Hellboy", "The Shadow", and "Fearless Vampire Killers" might enjoy this movie. I enjoyed watching Van Helsing take on Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, Dracula, and werewolves. Hugh Jackman gives a fine performance as the hero for mankind. Anyone that wants a serious horror movie may find this silly. It was meant to be outragious but I certainly didn't think it was silly. This is more fun to watch than several horror movies I have seen. Plenty of action and CGI effects make it visually great. The acting is decent and the directing and music are okay as well. All-in-all a good action/adventure that has a good pace, wonderful effects, and a good story. I certainly plan to add it to my DVD library long before "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" or "The Hulk".</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>Two of my favorite screen talents, Hugh Jackman (The &quot;X-Men&quot; films) and Kate Beckinsale (&quot;Underworld&quot;) team up in the thrilling box-office extravaganza, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! I saw the movie about a couple of days after it was released, and to me, the film was nothing short of extraordinary! Like portraying Wolverine in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Hugh Jackman brings a sheer intensity into the role of Van Helsing. Surely, Jackman's best since &quot;Swordfish&quot; and &quot;X-Men 1 and 2&quot;! Kate Beckinsale's performance, however, was dynamic and brilliant! Basically, her flawless performance in this film, which is her best performance since &quot;Underworld&quot;, shows us once again why she is Kate Beckinsale! The direction of Stephen Sommers (&quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;) was intense and utterly magnificent!<br /><br /> &quot;Van Helsing&quot; takes place in 1887 and focuses on famed monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). After hunting down Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in the streets of London, Van Helsing is assigned to travel to Transylvania, a mysterious region that is overrun with dangerous creatures like werewolves and vampires. Joining Van Helsing is his bumbling assistant, Carl (David Wenham, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films). Once there, Van Helsing must fight the tyrannical ruler, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;), his blood-sucking brides (Elena Anaya, Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca), and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp). During the mission, Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), a woman whose royal family is suffering under an age-old curse that can only be broken when the infamous count is put to death. Van Helsing also forms an alliance with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to prevent Dracula from hatching his bat-winged progeny, thus wreaking havoc all over the world!<br /><br /> With &quot;Van Helsing&quot; having so much good-humored action, suspense at every twist and turn, a great cast, and mesmerizing special effects, you're guaranteed to be both thrilled and exhausted by the time the 10-minute end credits roll at the film's end! The film is loud, obnoxious, and filled with revisionist horror folklore (especially with the fact that Universal is paying homage to the classic horror monsters, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Wolf Man). Nevertheless, this colossal monster mash (including Mr. Hyde, just for kicks) will never, ever bore you. All I have to say is bring on &quot;Van Helsing 2&quot;! In conclusion, if you are a avid horror fan, or just a big Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale fan, like I am, then look no further than &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! A DVD must-have when released!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>A very good cast is wasted in this ridiculous mess of a movie. While the production values are great, and the story is actually terrific, the outcome is horrible. Incredibly amateurish dialogue and overuse of CGI ruin what could have been a great film. This was originally planned as a sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, with Anthony Hopkins set to reprise his role of Van Helsing. Perhaps some of the quality of that original film would have benefited this absolutely pathetic attempt. Entertaining because of how bad it is, but truly forgettable. The audience was laughing for all the wrong reasons and that's never a good sign. One star for the plot, and another star for the casting.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>The Straight:  Unless you have the mentality of a seven-year-old going in...this movie is a big, noisy, expensive pile of festering rubbish.  Sure, there's a story...but it only pops up between flashes of CGI and a bombastic score.  For that matter, the special effects are very average, at best; horrible, at their worst.  There were also frequent moments during the film that conjured up images of an even worse film, "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."  I was distracted enough by the excruciatingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale to make it to the end of the film.  But the plotting is piece-meal and erroneous, taking a backseat to the pretty lights, fast camera shots, and Kate's gorgeous eyes.  The main characters should've died numerous times during the film.  They are not X-Men, after all.  When one of them does expire it happens in a manner that is feeble compared to what was endured earlier.  Having "Frankenstein's Monster" wax intellectual was also extremely ridiculous.  This film is nonsense, even for a fantasy yarn.<br /><br />The Narrow(or how to make it to the end of this film):  Get a labotomy.  Go in thinking this movie is going to be incredibly dumb and it might elevate itself to mediocrity.  If Kate Beckinsale hadn't been in this movie, I would've thrown unspeakable, rotting things at the screen.  Try very hard to suspend your disbelief...if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>This movie,sucked, not in a vampirical sense, but in the wet sucking sound a toilet makes on an airplane going down in flames. There were so many things wrong with it. Dracula had a draconian mullet pulled back in a banana clip in a world where we have come to know dracula as a smooth talking, handsome smart coffin dweller, this one must be a distant cousin who crawled out of the compost heap behind the trailor park, Hello he has to kill all the Valarius family and doesnt just take them out when they are sleeping at night? The CGI was laughable, Dr Jeckl was supposed to be, according to the "behind the scenes" guys the "most realistic CGI ever made" AHAHAHAHA, they have got to be joking. They dont explain why Draculas nasty little children who reside in Gremlin rip off sacks of goo, need to be electrified to live. Hugh Jackman is a talented actor as well as Kate is a great actress but both of their characters wouldnt stand a chance against the Awesome personalities of Selene from underworld or Wolverine from X-men. I guess they had to work with the crappy juvenile script they were given. Van Helsing is a wreck all around, reinventing myths and ehem sucking the life out of great characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>I was once tortured by a show on the lives of horses, and mostly because portions of that involved "mucking stalls." In  it they spent around thirty minutes showing guys in masks as they carried shovels for said thirty minutes, and the end of that made me wonder why the extra "steam shoveling" was added to the mix. When I watched Van Helsing I thought the same thing, wondering why the movie had to keep going and going when I thought it should have ended. Still, that didn't stop it from playing on and on or me from almost following my urge to fast-forward.<br /><br />As far as a premise, the movie started off pretty well. I liked Hugh as Van Helsing, and I liked his little run-in with Mr. Hyde as an introduction. I also liked some of the weapons he carried, and the fact that he was a flawed character when it came to methods of "killing." It honestly had some humor to it. I also liked the way the movie started out, working in a variety of monsters into a B-movie frame, and how some of the effects made a few of the monsters look good. That, however, didn't make up for the problems that the movie had.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, there were some real flaws in the story and the characters. First, there was the inherent weakness in the "strong female" persona, and mostly because she wasn't strong. She was touted as someone that could do some damage, but most of the movie involved her running into trouble and Helsing bailing her out. Blah. If I needed that stereotype, I could tune into so many other shows. Second, there was the plot that started to drag in the middle of the movie, got really old at about the three quarters mark, and actually bored me enough that I thought about turning it off when the "climactic battle" took place. It had so many stupid things gearing up and running parallel to one another, and that jumble did the movie a disservice by fragmenting what was once interesting and making it dull and lifeless.<br /><br />I've heard different people with different notions on the movie, and some of my friends actually enjoyed it. So, perhaps there is something in it and I just expected to much out of the showing. I didn't think so, not really thinking there would be more than a B-movie with a budget, but who knows. Then again, one of those people was the same one that kept making me watch the show with the horses and wouldn't turn it off, so i know where that got me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>When one watches "Van Helsing," one experiences an adrenaline rush as if riding a roller coaster or bungee jumping off a high bridge! The action sequences are breathtaking, and those are the best things about the movie. The story, sad to say, borrows everything from old horror stories like "Dracula," "Frankenstein," "The Wolf Man," and "Jekyll and Hyde." But the plotline is more similar to the many James Bond adventures, especially the fact that Van Helsing (a "Bond-ish" performance by Hugh Jackman) works for a secret agency run by the Vatican assigned to take out monsters, complete with a Q-like Monk named Carl (David Wenham of "Lord of the Rings" fame) and an M-like Cardinal. The cast do what they can in the film, with Kate Beckinsale (be she ever so fine) giving the film's best performance. The story is unoriginal, but when the action sequences occur, "Van Helsing" is one wild ride!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Loads of slick special effects.<br />*Good cameramanship.<br />*Good production quality (good sets, costumes, designs, etc).<br />*Despite all the stereotypes and bad accents, the acting is passable.<br />*Storyline works and leaves much room for lots of upbeat adventure.<br />*There is a good number of nifty gadgets.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The main monster characters are not very well developed, and conform more to their given stereotypes.  Dracula acts much like he did when Bella Lugosi played him.  Frankenstein is a total drama queen.  Wolfman is somewhat cool, but still shallow.<br />*The human characters are also not very well developed, and have incredibly hoaky accents.<br />*Van Helsing himself is a shallow Indiana Jones type character, and has very little to do with the original character from Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula."<br />*Everything is extremely cheesy.<br /><br />The concept is corny in itself; a combination of the top three movie monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman) in one big brawling adventure.  As a story, it's mildly interesting.  The characters are very lacking, showing nothing beneath their cliched surfaces.  This film doesn't do any justice to the actors or the characters.  The best thing is simply the action and special effects.  It's simply better to turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy the eye-candy.  Probably best viewed during Holloween.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>When you want to make one more film on Dracula who counts several hundred films already, both as assets and as drawbacks, you have to be original. No problem ! Let's patchwork together dozens of allusions to other films and create the first ever vampiristic salad. So Dr Frankenstein and his creature will be there. The use of the lightning to get electricity like in Back to the Future 1. The use of strange weapons halfway between Back to the Future 3 and The Lord of the Rings. The costume, dress, apparel of Van Helsing looks like Clint Eastwood's in a spaghetti western, and at times like the main hero's in the Matrix trilogy. The cows in the village are similar to those in Salem's Lot 2. Even the dance scene with the vampire reflected in a half empty mirror is borrowed from Dance of the Vampires. I would need a volume to quote them all. So what's left after all that composing of tidbits? A superhero Van Helsing who kills Dracula's three fianc&eacute;es, the thousands of baby vampires that look like upside down Aliens in their suspended pods, and Dracula himself. And all that on the order from the Vatican, the Pope and the good old godly Catholic church. That's a counter-allusion to the Da Vinci Code. The film then is more dictated in its plot by the brand new topnotch state of the art digitalized image processing of the modern world than the reverse. So the plot is a vast ballet between mountains and from abysses to cosmic skies. It is thus an amusing entertainment as shallow as the Thames River twenty kilometers before its spring. Or is it the Mississippi river?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>When I first saw this movie, I was flabbergasted at the non-stop action, the INCREDIBLE art direction, (which will boggle your mind!) and some of the acting and writing, specifically Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and the women playing his "brides", who truly seem to relish their roles.<br /><br />However, I can tell you that this movie does NOT hold the same impressiveness on successive viewings. It, in fact, looks like a crazy quilt of CGI work, furious jump-cutting, and a constant aesthetic that is WAY too grim after seeing it only the second time! There should be some respite from all the ghoul-chasing so that a good contrast can be set, instead of a steady diet of lab-OR-atories, gothic architecture. lightning bolts and bloodletting. This worked with "Ghostbusters" and "Aliens", it should have been used here.<br /><br />That said, it does have some redeeming aspects, not the least of which is the wizard art direction, which must have driven the miniature people bazoomies! The intricate castles, furniture, room embellishments, and various devices that Van Helsing uses put you in mind of a high-budget version of the "The Wild Wild West" meets "Indiana Jones" meets "The Name of the Rose" meets "Ghostbusters". The writing, too, warrants some kudos....Jackman himself speaks a litany of James Bondian wisecracks all through the movie, but it is Roxburgh who gets the really good lines, along with David Wenham, playing Van Helsing's friar sidekick.<br /><br />I think I'm beginning to notice a pattern, though, in Hugh Jackman's movies....In X-Men 2, Deathstrike, a Japanese mutant that has a duel with Wolverine, played by Jackman, meets a GRUESOME death at the hands of the feral X-Man, having molten lead forced through her body by a berserker Jackman. In THIS movie, the Kate Beckinsale character, Van Helsing's potential love interest through the whole movie, dies....AT VAN HELSING'S HAND!! Granted, he was a werewolf at the time, but STILL...!! What does Hugh Jackman have against young women, anyway??<br /><br />Still this movie is going to come in awfully handy at Halloween, a season that it was made for!<br /><br />And as far as a ghoulishly-themed movies are concerned, you could do LOTS worse in today's market.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of Stephen Sommers, and Alan Silvestri.

I knew it was connected marginally to "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", (where they mention Van Helsing's name once, I think). To say the least, I was very pleased with the movie overall, from the plot to the special effects.<br /><br />Van Helsing, (Jackman), starts the movie by doing in Mr Hyde, after which he is sent by a secret church order to Transylvania to help the beautiful, perhaps equally deadly, princess of an old gypsy family, (Beckinsale), save her family from Purgatory by eliminating Count Dracula, (Roxborough). Monsters from just about every classic book are in this movie from Frankenstein's creature, werewoves, and more.<br /><br />The action sequences are stunning, and the special effects used to achieve them are amazing. Van Helsing comes fully laden with lots of nifty goodies that are not so nifty for monsters. There are also moments of suspense in places that keep you on the edge of your seat for a bit of time. The balance between plot development, suspence and good, old-fashioned action has been well struck, and suits the movie well. It hardly feels like a movie that is over two hours long.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is very suave and cool in the role of Van Helsing. Jackman brings a very real sense of style to the role, bringing out the intense pain of a man that is tortured by a past that he doesn't remember and a life that he seemingly has no control over. Little wonder the makers were set on Jackman from the start. Kate Beckinsale is truly sultry and beautiful as Anna Valerious. She truly carries the driven and almost fanatical feel of the character well, and she really lets the viewer see the intense emotions of a woman driven by loss.<br /><br />There were only two points on which I would criticise the movie in a small way. First, was that the love interest between Anna and Van Helsing was a little bit predictable and unnecessary to the plot overall. Having said that, I have to also concede that the tension between the two provided some needed light relief from the overall darkness of the movie. Secondly, is Roxborough's Dracula, who seemed a little non-evil. In contrast to people like Anthony Hopkins, (Hannibal Lector in "Silence of the Lambs"), who can just ooze brooding and malevolent evil of the deepest kind, Roxborough seemed a little like a school boy try-hard succeeding in only reaching "mildly bad". Dr Evil in "Austin Powers" might term him "diet evil".<br /><br />If you can, the twin DVD set is an excellent buy and worth the money for the added features. They have an extensive section on the effects, which is incredibly interesting. I found it noteworthy that the actor who played Frankenstein's monster, also doubled as the human model in the scenes with Mr Hyde, so that Jackman had someone to look at before they inserted images of the computer Hyde into the shot. I also thoroughly enjoyed the sections on the making of the film, which provided some very cool background to the movie, and the bloopers, which were quite amusing.<br /><br />For a monster movie full of action and gadgets, "Van Helsing" is hard to beat. I loved it, and have seen it a few times without getting bored. The criticisms above are relatively minor and should not discourage you from enjoying what is a classic tale with lots of action. A fantastic movie, indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>With Vampires being a mythological character that many adore and admire, and many film versions of the Dracula story has come to be.  This film is not one of the top Dracula fims that has been made.  Were, we have a plotline that follows Van Helsing going around the world trying to save it from all kind of beasts and demons for the catholic church.  However,  the movie does a poor job on portraying the character Van Helsing as a heroic character and as a savoir of humanity.  The character of Dracula is spinned off into a new direction of coming to be a vampire, its not from hatred of the catholic church because of a lost love as in the book.  But is made a vampire because he made a deal with the devil for immortality as long as he serves the devil on earth.  Which is not to enticing of a character storyline but still ties into the movie in general.<br /><br />  Kate Beckinsale does a horrible job with her eastern europe accent but still manages to make a decent attempt at acting as the movie love interest/co-hero of Van Helsing.<br /><br />  Furthermore, this movie is driven by the special effects that so many big budget movies are.  Which in turn, like so many before it,  lack a true plotline.  Where the characters are bound to the typical actions of a hero storyline.  Although there are a some well timed humor and decent acting from the main characters, that make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.<br /><br />  The Special Effects in of themselves are actually really good.  With amazing footage and computer generated scenes makes the movie into a great spectical.  It does capture the goth life style that was prominate during that time period and setting the mood for each scene.  For that this movie gets an A-minus.<br /><br />  The Directing of this movie was well thought out and done beautifully but could not save this film enough to make it a classic film or even a good film.  Although it is an entertaining movie to say the least.

The werewolves in the new Harry Potter movie are scarier and more "realistic" than the ones in Van Helsing. Dr. Jeckel looked more like a bad copy of the Hulk than anything menacing.<br /><br />The film certainly has its moments -- some good dialog/repartee and a good cast.

There is very little down time for the viewer to catch his breath.  While that would be good in a shorter movie, at 135 minutes it is a bit tiring.

The `cgi' effects were average, but seriously, they were on par with most that are going on in film these days and I doubt Lucas Film could have done much better.  The reason this movie was enjoyable at all was the truly funny dialogue by director Stephen Sommers.  He knows that no one in their right mind is going to take this movie seriously - it's just for fun.  Some of the best remarks come from Van Helsing's side-kick Friar.  Many come from the monsters themselves and there's a great one from Egor.  He is overheard mumbling and complaining, "Egor get this, Egor get that!" Or the good Transylvania princess who tells one of Dracula's brides just before she kills her, "If you're going to kill someone, stop talking about it and just do it!"  If you want serious good action movies, you won't find it here, but you'll never be bored.  The dialogue keeps right up with the action and there are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained.  After all, Sommers only limit was his imagination and he lets all hell break loose.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>Any review that tells that you must love this film BECAUSE its absolutely stupid garbage is a joke. This movie is a joke. A very unfunny two hour joke. The cast, the acting, the action, the script, the direction, the special effects. Its 200 million dollars thrown down the toilet. This is not camp. Camp is intentional. This is a complete mess. A ship worthy of going down with the Titanic. A waste of Hugh Jackmans talent and time. If you must lower your IQ to enjoy a film, that is a sad state of affairs. This is why hollywood continues to give us garbage because there are those that eat it and call it candy. <p>But hey you must love it...because its stupid and terrible. But thats why its good, right?<p>(...)</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to this all year long.  What a great premise for a film.  And with one of my favorite actors in it, Hugh jackman, how could they go wrong?  Unfortunately, they do.<p>Jackman produces a fairly good character in Van Helsing.  He's likeable, a bit brooding, and mysterious.  Unfortunately, we don't know anything about him.  How strong is he?  How can he fight monsters when other humans can't?  This isn't explained in the film though.  Just one of the MANY plot holes that make up this movie.  And this movie is filled with them.  Director Stephen Sommers tries to build a romance around the two main characters, but literally waits until the last 5 minutes fo the movie to start.  There is not a single spark of interest between the two characters before then.  They might as well have both been male for all the romance there was.  There are numerous other relationships that are hinted at during the film but never explained.  Not small relationships, but seemingly major plot developments that are not explained.  They're not even set up appropriately for a sequel.<p>But Van Helsing doesn't appear to be about a good story.  After all, it's a summer blockbuster.  I can be content with a good popocorn movie.  "The Mummy" was horribly written too but it was enjoyable to watch in the theater.  Van Helsing isn't.  160 million on this film.  Where did it go?  Certainly not in the special effects.  The CGI is decent in some parts of the movie, and in others just plain absurd.  It looks unfinished, and there are effects that I could have done a better job making with a flipbook and some crayons.  <p>If you watch Van Helsing, be prepared to suspend your belief in the laws of physics.  At one point, a team of 6 horses jumps almost 100 feet over a chasm.  They actually show this effect from a distance, which further emphasis the absurdity of it.  It might as well have been Santa's sleigh because that's exactly what it looks like.  And this is just the most obvious flaw.  Characters jump 20 feet in the air, climb up walls like Jackie Chan, and accomplish other feats only possible with the help of computers and a bad script.<p>One of the most atrocious aspects of this film is the acting.  Tremendous melodrama from Dracula and his brides.  He might as well have been wearing a cape, rubbing his hands together and saying "mwahahahaha."  Jackman and Beckinsale are the only actors who don't do a horrible job with the already horrible script they were given, although beckinsale is close.  And don't get me started on Van Helsing's trusty sidekick, Carl.  This guy is a dictionary of bad puns and one liners.  They could have replaced him with Shaggy from Scooby Doo and you wouldn't have noticed much difference.  Heck, the animation would have even looked better.  This character should have been cut from the film completely.<p>Overall, a film I wanted to enjoy, but just couldn't.  The novelty aspect of all of these monsters together didn't even hold up for me.  If you like mindless action and don't think too much about movies or care about the realism of them, and if you are a fan of "The Mummy" and "League of Extraordinary Gentleman," you might enjoy Van Helsing.  But for the rest of us, there comes a time when you can't just sit back and ignore a crossbow with a never ending supply of amunition or a team of flying horses.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Obviously this movie got mixed reviews. Either viewers loved or hated it. I cannot understand the hate.<br /><br />First of all, this was a typical Stephen Sommers film - you take a film classic and remake it with sarcasm, better effects, and you poke fun at the campiness of it all. Apparently some people were expecting something more Gothic, or serious, or historically accurate. Well, guess what? That has been done to death - no pun intended. What Sommers does here is far more entertaining: he takes these great characters of European Folklore, and he attempts create a nineteenth century world where they actually live, and attempt to intermingle with civilization. It's an amusing concept, or like Dracula says "Why can't people just leave us alone? We never kill more than our share!" I think, actually, the humor in this film and its actual folkloric parallels may have been over the heads of many viewers. Based on the reviews, those that hated it obviously did not understand or grasp the humor. I do feel that this film presents the best performance of a Dracula character. No, he is not a brooding Gothic figure; rather he is an egotistical, sarcastic, obviously flawed individual whose eternal life in the dark fog of Transylvania is beginning to get to him.<br /><br />Bravo to Richard Roxburgh for his treatment of this character! Anyway, if you enjoy a higher-developed dry sense of humor coupled with parodies of folklore (or have any back ground in the actual myths regarding the characters of this film) then you will truly enjoy this film. Mind you, the action scenes stretch the bounds of reality, but then again, so does the existence of a were-wolf, or the Frankenstein Monster.<br /><br />I do enjoy the exchange between Dracula and the were-wolf, who in the form of a man is a noble chivalrous soul, and upon hearing of Dracula's plans declares that he would "rather die!" Dracula's response? "Oh, don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies." If you like vampire-monster movies, you need to add this to your movie collection! Enjoy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is the very definition of style over substance. In fact there ultimatly is no substance whatsoever that I could find. A dull parade of special effects wrapped around over acting and pure juvenile silliness. Hugh Jackman is great in the X-Men movies but he should have left this script out on the back porch and let the sun eat away at the pages, come to think of it that would probably have made a better movie than Van Helsing turned out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>Into the macabre world of classic horror monsters brought back to life in this quaint film, where, not since Mad Monster Party, the three primary icons in Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankentein's Monster reunite - here to do battle in a rather ingenious plot wherein Dracula desires to bring his progeny life, but needs Frankenstein to complete the experiment.<br /><br />In the beginning, Mr. Hyde makes an impressive cameo appearence, although this seemed a bit unecessary, and could have been saved for a subsequent film, along with perhaps The Mummy - even with the other monsters for that metter. Unfortunatey, the characters in this depiction are rather one-dimensional, and the scenes move by much too quickly - the overall impression of this presentation seems more like an action-adventure fight movie, rather than a horror film, so the true fear element is absent here, but is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />I enjoyed the impressive aesthetics of The Wolfman, done to perfection in My opinion, although Count Dracula could have been better cast, but the brides are exquisite in their beauty and ferocity.  I thought it adorable when the "draclings" were released from their cocoons, flying down to feed upon the villagers below. Frankenstein is a tormented creature here, inspiring pathos in his apparent selfless nature and terrible desolation.<br /><br />Van Helsing himself is presented in a more contemporary manner, wielding remarkable weaponry, particularly the rotary crossbow and the shiroken-like blades. He is commissioned by The Vatican to purge these 'evils' from the world, and during his travel to Transylvania, meets with a gorgeous brunette warrior-princess, who joins him in his quest, whose brother just happens to be the wolfman. Eventually, Van Helsing is infected by The Werewolf curse, that proves to be a key ingredient in his battle with the demonic Dracula. I did like that idea - that The Count tranforms into a magnificent Vampire-Demon  - a decided improvement on his humanoid counterpart.<br /><br />CGI effects abound here {sometimes too much}, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the credits are actually quite creative as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>When I first saw the trailers for Van Helsing I was not very impressed with what I saw; it seemed overloaded with action and had no story.  Out of curiosity, I saw the film and enjoyed it.  I think that this is a film that one better appreciates after viewed more than once.<br /><br />The film is a hi-tech version of the old Universal movies from the 1940's that featured Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman; such films as The House of Dracula and The House of Frankenstein.  Much of the criticism of the film that I have read ignores that it is a parody of horror films, and meant to be fun.<br /><br />Van Helsing has the loudest soundtrack that I have yet hear with a lot of loud drum pounding.  The story is flimsy: monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania.  But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment.  It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is perfect as Van Helsing.  I don't think that another actor could create the same presence. Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious even if her accent sometimes seems forced.  It was interesting to see David Wenham as Carl after his role as Fairimir.  He brings off the part nicely, even if it takes a little to get used to seeing him as a frisky friar.  An equally interesting part is Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster, who makes the creature into a credible and sympathetic personality despite the heavy makeup.  As for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula, it took a little while before I could see him in the role.  He may not be as obviously sinister as some vampires but he has a menace that fills the role when required.  The Brides are well cast and the special effects when they are flying are probably the most spectacular of the film.  Kevin O'Conner, who as Benny in The Mummy, is equally good as Igor.  His half-weary delivery of the line "Yes, Master" is a comic part of the movie.  And Samuel West, in the small role of  Dr. Victor Frankenstein, does a good imitation of Colin Clive saying "It's alive! It's alive!"<br /><br />So, I can recommend Van Helsing for the unashamed piece of entertainment that it is.  Why analyze such a movie? The story of bringing to life unborn vampire offspring is patently fatuous.  What rules does a movie have to follow just to entertain you?  If you are fast forwarding or are moaning that your favorite monsters are being "misinterpreted" you have missed the point.  This is a movie to sit back and watch for the ride not fault it for something it was never intended to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>After the huge success of his THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS, writer/director Stephen Sommers was given the green light to tackle some of Universal Studios' prime horror creations.  I refer, of course, to Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, who all raised thrills and chills in the classic films of the 30's and 40's.  The result is an over-the-top thrill ride that will please some, while making others roll their eyes at some of the absurdities that abound.<br />The movie basically uses Bram Stoker's classic vampire-hunter, Van Helsing, as its hero.  However, instead of the elderly professor of the book and previous films, he is a younger, mysterious and dynamic version played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine of the X-MEN films).  Aided by a lovely gypsy (Kate Beckinsale) and his ingenious assistant, Carl (David Wenham), Van Helsing must foil the plans of the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to populate Transylvania with new-born vampires.  Complicating matters are the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp and major CGI effects).  Along the way, Van Helsing learns some vital clues to the secret behind his dark past.<br />For the most part, the acting ranges from solid to almost laughable.  Hugh Jackman is spot-on as the title character, perfectly embodying the vampire-hunter's drive to defeat his foes. Unfortunately, the character is almost completely grim throughout the film, making him hard to relate to at times.  Much better in that regard is David Wenham's Carl.  Coming off as a monkish version of "Q" in the James Bond films, Wendam easily gets his share of the film's laughs.  He is almost matched by Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor, who helps out Dracula.  Despite being buried in gobs of make-up, Shuler Hensley makes for a decent and sympathetic Frankenstein's Monster.  On the other hand, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula and Kate Beckinsale's Anna seem to vie for the title of "most over-wrought accent", with Roxburgh getting the nod here.  However, Beckinsale looks great as a gypsy and she handles most of the physical stuff pretty well.  Will Kemp's performance is non-existent as most of it is done by his CGI alter-ego.<br />The CGI effects and stunts are top-notch, and you almost can feel worn-out by the high energy of the production.  In fact, that can be said to be this film's main flaw.  The plot is simply an excuse to zip from one action scene to the next.  Also, unlike the MUMMY films, there is no "twinkle in the eye" or sense of joy in this flick.  As a result, one finds it very hard to relate to any of these characters.<br />Still, this is not a bad film.  If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the film for the amusement ride it is, it is definitely worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>About halfway through a silent screening of "Van Helsing," a boy in the theater, about ten, moaned to his mother: "This movie's not very good!" <p>If you can't nab that target audience, the adults are going to be about as penetrable as the Great Wall of China. <p>The movie is indeed atrocious: A flat, candy-coated monster mash that's about as scary as reading the back of a cereal box. <p>Universal gave writer-director Stephen Sommers ( the "Mummy" series) $150 million to pack the studio's classic stable of villains - Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman -  into a quick, presumably fun flick. Sommers returned with more than two hours (!) of plot-filled dirge that focuses on the origins of its drab, amnesia-riddled hero (Hugh Jackman, apparently on anti-depressants) and his relationship with a buxom, plucky sidekick Anna Valerious, in a performance by Kate Beckinsale that belongs in the pantheon of bored, unphysical performances. <p>Beckinsale, however beautiful, is a slight, tiny little smoky-eyed girl; how in the world she got cast in "Underworld," then "Van Helsing," then some spy movie to follow in the next year, is a worthy homework assignment. And yet she surpasses, two times over, the work of Richard Roxburgh, who throws all drama to the winds and camps it up as a high-pitched, effete Dracula. If Johnny Depp channeled Keith Richards in "Pirates of the Caribbean," Roxburgh channels Robin Williams after he's had four goblets of apple wine on Disco Night in South Beach.<p>Dracula is only real villain of the picture - Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley, under there somewhere) is just a pawn in the count's elaborate scheme to bring his pulsating sacks of bat babies to life, while Wolfman is actually Anna's brother under a wicked spell. <p>"Van Helsing" features a series of showdowns, the best of which probably involves Jackman and his machine gun crossbow vs. Dracula's three winged brides. The special f/x aren't awful, just nonstop and, therefore, inconsequential. A relentless soundtrack booms underneath the picture. And Sommers, whether he ever makes another good popcorn movie or not, will never be known for fluid filmmaking. <p>But some of the blame has to fall to Jackman, who lacks wit, humor, playfulness - everything that made Depp's performance in "Pirates" carry that film to unexpected, giant box office returns. Jackman seems plugged in as Wolverine in the "X-Men" films and static outside them; remember his straight-man act in "Swordfish?" He's not even Brendan Fraser. Beckinsale - who was good as the ice queen in "The Last Days of Disco" for a reason - is no tart herself.

Dracula acts much like he did when Bella Lugosi played him. Frankenstein is a total drama queen. Wolfman is somewhat cool, but still shallow.<br />*The human characters are also not very well developed, and have incredibly hoaky accents.<br />*Van Helsing himself is a shallow Indiana Jones type character, and has very little to do with the original character from Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula."<br />*Everything is extremely cheesy.<br /><br />The concept is corny in itself; a combination of the top three movie monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman) in one big brawling adventure. As a story, it's mildly interesting. The characters are very lacking, showing nothing beneath their cliched surfaces. This film doesn't do any justice to the actors or the characters. The best thing is simply the action and special effects. It's simply better to turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy the eye-candy. Probably best viewed during Holloween.<br /><br />The one-disc version has a few featurettes, a feature that allows you to explore the set, and some outtakes.  The two-disc set includes all of the same plus a few more featurettes (and for anybody who cares, some movie money for the next "Mummy" film).</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Me and my four friends saw this movie at a theater cause we thought we'd see some action.

Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is busy in Paris battling a nasty but large Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame Cathedral. Meanwhile across Europe, and in a little country called Transylvania, a brave and daring heroine (Kate Beckinsale) has hopes of saving her brother from life as a Wolfman. All of the greats are represented here (minus the Mummy) and the story is both interesting and classically told.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers has made a visually beautiful and classic monster film paying fantastic tribute to all those who came before him. The special effects are quite good and you will find yourself transported into a really good video game that allows one to discover something different every time this film is seen. Jackman is the perfect hero as the title character being handsome, strong and silly all at the same time. Kate Beckinsale brings the typical frail heroine into a new light as the strong and feisty Princess Anna. The main nemesis is Dracula, played humorously by Richard Roxburgh. Dracula's brides are sexy, evil and quite vicious. Will Kemp plays the Wolfman and looks great out of costume! Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to life with the perfect blend of humor and snide remarks but sadly no flies and finally the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) finally has a voice and uses it well. Altogether the cast in this film is highly entertaining and the storyline quite interesting. Of course the special effects in this film often override true human talent but they are well worth your time.<br /><br />This film is fun, entirely entertaining and beautiful to watch unfold while at the same time being a wonderful tribute to all of the classic monsters. A great film for the family that doesn't take monsters (and fighting them) too literally. Sommers has mastered the ability to take traditional monster movies and spin them into a new form while paying proper tribute to the original. I suspect Van Helsing will emerge as the new hero of modern monster films and foresee a sequel ready to be bolted into life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>The special effects are very good but the effort to blend Dracula, Frankenstein, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 'The Brides of Dracula', the Wolfman and 'Dracula vs. the Wolfman' [or is it 'Frankenstein vs. the Wolfman?] all together does get a little confusing.<br /><br />Frankenstein's Monster is kind of a good guy and Dracula, although every inch a bad guy, is fascinating.  Igor is a real jerk.  Dracula's brides are really quite something although I don't know why they are nippleless.  Maybe it's because their goblin babies are hatched dead already and need human blood rather than milch.

Seems that, over the years, my ill will towards this film has waned some, to the extent that I actually enjoyed watching this action horror film, just now, just now. And I've always thought this film was less soulless than, say, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, perhaps Sean Connery's most irredeemable flick. Anyway, this is a mixed message sort of review.<br /><br />Some say he's a holy man. Others paint him a murderer. I guess even Bram Stoker got it wrong. What this Van Helsing is, is a legendary monster hunter, and he works covertly under the auspices of the Vatican. His latest mission dispatches him to the remote fastness of Romania, the Mecca for frightful supernatural beasties. There, Van Helsing will hunt his most formidable quarry: Count Dracula. He also meets lovely Anna Valerious, the last in line of a damned family that had sworn to kill Dracula and barred from Heaven until that deed is done. Cue the spectacular action and CG. Cue the dreary plot. And if you can justify the cohabitation of the cool action with the plodding story, then good on you. I have lowered the bar, I've learned to adjust, and I do like the film better now. I still can't say the same for Connery's folly.<br /><br />On one hand, if you've enjoyed those old-school Universal horror flicks featuring Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Werewolf, one draw may be that this movie strives at an homage to them. Each of these terrifying monsters plays a role. On that same hand, if you like your Kate Beckinsale, well, she's here and sporting a funky Romanian accent. On the other hand, the nerve-deadening storyline puts a damper on things; it trudges along. And dear, winsome Kate - while she does her best - could only do so much with her underwritten role. She and Hugh Jackman exhibit the rapport of two dandruff flakes languishing on a poor sap's shoulder.<br /><br />I mentioned that the action is spectacular, and it is. But even the action in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was pretty cool. VAN HELSING is so determined to jump from one CG-driven action spectacle to another that it abandons good storytelling in its wake. VAN HELSING is flash and style with not much substance, pulse-pounding stunts with no refinement. And, yeah, I know, sometimes it doesn't matter that the script is weak because the f/x and the fighty fights are just that good. But, man, when the script is this weak and ponderous? And, I guess, it comes down, too, to the acting performances... and I'm eyeing Hugh Jackman now. This guy has shown natural charm and wit before (his awesome opening number at the Oscars is just one example). But, as Van Helsing, Jackman is so relentlessly dour and wooden, we don't get a chance to glimpse his true personality. So, to boil it down, this flick is Van Helsing pretty much tangling with the usual rolodex of feature creatures, and there's also a half-formed romance with Beckinsale. If you like your fighty fights, this'll do ya.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought that Van Helsing's assistant, Carl, was a fun character. Carl is pretty much the sole fount of humor here.<br /><br />There are some pretty robust special features on this DVD: 2 feature commentaries; "Explore Dracula's Castle" takes you on a 360 degree tour of several of VAN HELSING's sets; "The Legend of Van Helsing" is a rundown of the character as portrayed in films; "Bringing the Monsters to Life" focuses on the Industrial Light & Magic folks, as they, thru pencil sketches and digital composition, reveal how the monsters were crafted; "You Are In the Movie" grants the viewer the actor's perspective, thanks to strategically placed miniature cameras; "Play the Van Helsing Game" - the DVD pops into your Xbox and allows you to play the game's first level; the movie trailers; and 5 and a half minutes of goofy outtakes ("I give you...Van Halen!").</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>The idea of throwing all the 19th Century "monsters" (Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves) into one flick was done to better affect in the goofball Abbott & Costello movies.  Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny.  If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br /><br />Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects.  The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film.  There are some fun bits but the movie's definitely not worth the purchase price and maybe not even worth the rental price.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Before saying anything else, let me state that this was a fun film to watch, though not much involved real human actors.  Stephen Sommers is clearly one of those directors so enamored with CGI technology that plot and acting get lost in the mix.  The two 'Mummy' films were very similar to 'Helsing', in that effects ruled them rather than storyline.<br /><br />The plot is literally all over the place, with monsters, characters, and geography passing by without much audience notice.  Hugh Jackman really is a fine actor, but you hardly get a chance to see it in this film (wonder how he felt about doing  virtually no acting in the final climactic battle sequence ?); he does a few weapons tricks and some one-liners-that's about it.  Kate Beckinsale looks great (how could she breathe in that corset?), but seems lost among all the flying wirework; like Jackman, she has minimal dialogue.<br /><br />The effects work in 'Van Helsing' is spectacular, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets an Oscar nomination in that category.  However, this along with the bombastic soundtrack crowds out what really makes for a good movie: good acting and a competent plot.  The irony is that Sommers eagerly states how much he 'enjoys' writing screenplays for his films (in the extra features).  I just don't see it here or in his other big movies.<br /><br />Nevertheless, 'Van Helsing' is a fun if uninspiring way to spend two hours...</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn?t expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there?s a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.<br /><br />The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein?s monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God?s work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There?s nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family?s lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own ? he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein?s monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There?s only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn?t a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil ? not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clich?d at moments, surprisingly it wasn?t so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.<br /><br />No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker?s Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn?t been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn?t much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer?s intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh?s go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that?s laughable and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula?s Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.<br /><br />Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that don?t leave you clamoring to see them again nor are they features that you would detest repeating, if they were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There?s nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn?t the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem with the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren?t just entertained by a few mere explosions and (...) flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>With all that cheese, that is. Cheese out the wazoo! The special effects were truly awesome and on a number of occasions I was truly startled by the sudden appearance and/or sound of one of the ghouly creatures.<p>When Bela Lagosi addressed Van Helsing by name in the 1930s Dracula film, the actor was a Sigmund Freud-like older distinguished gentleman. In this 2004 rendition, Van Helsing is a young, fearless, monster-butt-kicking machine, and quite a bit easier on the eyes.<p>He is seen first in the movie in a battle with Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyl's counterpart) - rendered unlike I have ever seen in any film. He is truly larger than life - an enormous hulk who is more agile than a spider monkey.  In the 1880s, before lycra and spandex, one has to wonder where a guy who could use Andre the Giant as a Q-Tip gets pants. He certainly couldn't wander the streets of London and amble into a tailor's shop to get measured.<p>Tongue-in-cheek humor is peppered through-out the film, but is so cheesy, it is not potent enough to evoke more than a chuckle. A friar who accompanies Van Helsing in his quest to vanquish Dracula and his vampire harem is a poor copy of Martin Short. His presence is needed as a comedic element to keep the film from being too dark. He's supposedly a mechanical &amp; chemical engineering genius, making all sorts of fascinating weapons and explosives, but he's otherwise portrayed as a joking bafoon.<p>Not only is the CGI flawless, the way in which the vampires, wolfmen and Mr. Hyde are depicted is truly innovative and unique. The last member of a cursed family (Kate Beckinsale) is the romantic element for Van Helsing. Even though the action is supposed to take place in 1888, this Transylvania princess is dressed like a modern day sex kitten, clad in leather pants, fashionable suede boots and a Glamour Shots ? hairdo that looks flawless even when she's swinging from a rope.<p>The vistas are beautiful as the viewer is taken across grand mountains in Europe, great plains and lush forests. For all that is in this film, it's sad that it wasn't better. Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable flick, but solely because of the extraordinary CGI and butt-kicking. <p>There are a number of scenes that are total rip-offs from &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; which made me laugh out loud due to the insultingly overdone cheese.<p>The ending is a Hallmark moment that will make anyone nauseated... not to mention it's a close rip-off of the ending in Return of the Jedi - Darth Vader's body on a funerary pyre, the spirits of Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda smiling and nodding to Luke, and the festive song that plays in the background. Please do not make me sick to my stomach, Van Helsing!! <p>The ending credits are truly an amazing feat - and just listing who was starring in the film - those ending credits probably cost a lot more than my house. If there is an Oscar? category for ending credits, Van Helsing has it coming - but for the rest of the film, it's a candidate for a Razzie.<p>For the vistas and CGI, it's worthwhile watching on the big screen - once. I never have to see this cheese-fest again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>I'm a Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror nut. I love the genres ...as long as they're done right. And the only thing that I can see that was done "right" in this film was the CGI effects.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot:<br /><br />First, Van Helsing is no longer the lovable old guy who is constantly on the trail of Count Dracula. Here we have Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, X-Men) as a kind of dark arch-angel who works for a secret society in the Catholic Church who's charge is to protect society from abominations (i.e., Mr. Hyde, Ogres, etc.), thus helping Christianity and goodness flourish across the planet.<br /><br />About 15 minutes into the film, we finally see Van Helsing being assigned to the Dracula legend in Transylvania. He has to save a young woman (Kate Beckinsale) from the dastardly clutches of the blood sucking fiend. If he doesn't, doom will encompass the countryside.<br /><br />Here's how the rest of the film goes: Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and losing. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning.<br /><br />The plot --- if there is one --- is basically to kill Count Dracula. But there are so many other things going on (the struggle of Frankenstein to "exist" --- which I thought was the best side story of the entire film ---, the development of baby-vampires --- don't ask ---, and a slew of other terrible ideas) that I felt completely and utterly wasted as a movie viewer.<br /><br />Other problems:<br /><br />Umm, this is supposed to be about saving people from Dracula and saving Christianity, right? So what was with the burning funeral pyre at the end of the movie (isn't that a Pagan thing?)<br /><br />The film starts off in black-and-white in the late 1800's, giving the viewer the understanding that the action during this time took place long ago. And then we jump ahead an entire ...YEAR! and switch to color. Wow. That was lame.<br /><br />I can't begin to tell you how horrible this film was. There's more horrors to be told, but I have to head to the bathroom. I feel ...oh no! ...GHACKKK!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is an action-packed film that crosses a number of genres: horror, comedy, and adventure. It has a stellar cast and a fairly interesting story line. It also has some stupendous special effects but therein lies the rub. The director has not learned that less is often more. Some of the special effects are spectacular and some are buffoonish/cartoonish and end up being jarring, rather than enhancing, to the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is excellent as Van Helsing, the mysterious monster killer who is subsidized by the Catholic Church, as the Vatican operates  a secret laboratory run by clergymen who perfect sophisticated weaponry for Van Helsing's fight against evil. In 1887, Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to assist the noble Valerious family of Transylvania in getting rid of the pesky Count Vladislaus Dracula, drolly played by Richard Roxburgh. By the time Van Helsing arrives, accompanied by his trusty sidekick, a friar named Carl (David Wenham), the only member of this vampire fighting family who is left alive is the athletic and lovely Anna Valerious, played with single-minded dedication by the  wasp-waisted, newly Barbie breasted Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />There, they all end up battling the brides of Dracula, a werewolf, and Count Dracula himself, with a little assist from Frankenstein. Let the games begin! The flying brides of Dracula are my favorite special effects, but even there the production cannot refrain from being unsubtle, which is too bad. There are some scenes that are spectacular, such as the battle between the werewolf and Anna and her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), which takes place before the arrival of Van Helsing. Those special effects are terrific, as are those involving the brides of Dracula upon Van Helsing's arrival in Transylvania and the subsequent battle between them.<br /><br />The film also manages to blend a certain amount of humor and camp, making it quite funny, at times, and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. As for the romance between Van Helsing and Anna, I am sorry to report that there is little, if any, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Moreover, the film is consistently uneven. While the opening black and white scene in which the towns people, carrying torches,  converge upon Count Dracula's castle is very atmospheric, its effect is vitiated by the ludicrous scene immediately following in which Van Helsing  battles Mr. Hyde (of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde fame). Unfortunately, Mr. Hyde resembles nothing more than a video game monster similar to the Hulk, minus the green hue.<br /><br />Despite some of the issues with the film, it is definitely an entertaining, action-packed film that is worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>The movie "Van Puke" a/k/a "Van Helsing" is a total joke and a total zero.

He turns out to be on a first name basis with Frankenstein's monster and a mysterious order of Catholic knights. And yes, "Van Helsing" suffers from an obvious LOTR-Excalibur complex.<br /><br />I liked the cow, though.<br /><br />Two stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Hugh Jackman stars in this exciting movie as Van Helsing,a former priest who is sent by the clergy to Transylvania to save the final surviving members of a family who have been fighting Dracula for four centuries.  These surviving members will be doomed to extinction unless Dracula is destroyed before the last family member dies.  So Van Helsing and is trusty sidekick Carl (David Wenham) set off to face Dracula with an arsenal of weapons to aid them, including a cool repeating crossbow.<br /><br />One in Transylvania, Van Helsing and Carl meet Anna Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale. It is her family that has been trying to destroy Dracula for so long.  Now, the three must band together to kill Dracula before it is too late for Anna.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, and the special effects are some of the best that I've ever seen before.  The beginning of the movie was my favorite part.  The black and white scenes of the attack on Castle Frankenstein reminded me of the Frankenstein movies from the 1930s with Boris Karloff.  Even the scene in which the townspeople burn down the windmill with Dr. Frankenstein and his monster trapped inside is carefully reproduced from the original film.  The monsters in the movie are really scary as well, especially the werewolf which attacks Anna's brother.  Dracula's "wives" flying and attacking the townsfolk while Van Helsing shoots at them with his crossbow is exciting to watch, as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and David Wenham give excellent performances, but Richard Roxburgh's portrayal as Dracula is the best performance of the movie.  Shuler Hensley does a fine job as well as Frankenstein's monster.  Watch this exciting and thrilling movie and see the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula all together in the same film.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>One of the things that I thought was amazing about the early reviews were they seemed to miss the fact that this is was a PARODY, a take off of cheesy monster movies from the 50's. Like Frankenstein vs the Wolfman, or Zombies Ate My Neighbors.<br /><br />The movie is about Van Helsing. A man who is being employed by a secret service like organization to hunt down supernatural menaces. In his first encounter he is hunting down the evil Mr Hyde, and to try to get Dr Jeckyl back alive. The order is a mixture of priests and monks of seemingly every faith on the planet, all banding together to save humanity from dark forces.<br /><br />He is paired with an inventor and a monk named Carl(David Wenham, Faramir in LOTR). Though he can swear and womanize since, he is not a monk yet. They are sent on a mission to Eastern Europe, which not only suffers from Werewolves but Vampires. He brings a host of odd high tech weapons to fight the supernatural with. They are in the steam punk genre; automatic crossbows, crank powered saws, etc....<br /><br />It turns out that there is more than they expected. Count Vladislaus Dracula is working on animating his children, thousands and thousands of them, who lie dormant. He uses lightening, but for some reason the energy given to them is never quite right, and they die soon after. There is also some tie between him and Dracula, one that goes far back that he doesn't remember.<br /><br />This movie was so ridiculous it bordered on genius. The plot makes little sense, the acting is over the top and at times purposefully bad, and the plot devices are shamelessly obvious. In other words, it is the movie you watch with beer and lots of junk food.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a sequel</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>Since my viewing of Underworld, I thought Van Helsing was going to stink just as bad as that did.

It's actually so boring I haven't seen the end of the movie yet, and I don't care who wins, who dies, nor how...

VAN HELSING, based on a character plucked from Braum Stoker's "Dracula," is a visual onslaught of Transylvanian proportions that never--ever--lets up.  The movie looks good, especially with its opening black and white sequence depicting Frankenstein's castle under siege by enraged peasants, and certainly delivers enough thrills and chills to satisfy any ghoul lover.  Yet, after awhile, all the chaos and mayhem become as long in the tooth as the fangs on the vampires.<p>The story itself is surprisingly lame: Count Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster as a conduit to bring to life legions of<br />little vampire/bat offspring to wage war on mankind; the evil Count also uses werewolves to wipe out the last generation of a rival family; Van Helsing is dispatched by a secret Vatican society to clean up the mess.  With vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and even a brief dose of Jekyll and Hyde, this movie has as much on its plate as a five-gallon tub at a buffet.  Pardon the pun, but VAN HELSING bites off more than it can chew.<p>Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is your typical one-dimensional, unemotional superhero.  David Wenham is the film's comic relief, although I liked him much better as Faramir in "The Lord of the Rings."  Richard Roxburgh as the scheming, diabolical Dracula reminded me of Bela Lugosi with a ponytail.  And femme fatale Kate Beckinsale can tap me on the shoulder to tango any time she wants.<p>Don't get me wrong:  I was entertained by this movie.  I particularly liked how the vampires would dislocate their jaws to depict sprouting fangs like mushrooms sticking out of a pile of manure.

All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in "dark-o-vision"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here.

Like Jan DeBont and McG, Sommers is one of those types that likes to throw in as much visuals as humanly possible and BAM! A great movie. Problem is, it doesn't always work. Richard Roxburgh's bad-accented Count Dracula is overly-camp, and while Hugh Jackman is seemingly doing something different, he's really just redoing his Wolverine shtick: Shady guy who dispenses ample amounts of violence and one-liners along with obligatory memory problems.

This film, which is described in the Amazon product description as being made for gamers (because of terrible graphics) and eight year olds because of the weak plot, was a total dissapointment to me.<br /><br />Since so much has already been written, I won't waste the magnetic ink on this very poor film and just say to all fans of the old Universal horror movies, rise up and storm the studio!<br /><br />I am not a traditionalist and you can check my voting record to see how I voted on new vs old horror films.  This movie was an insult having no integrity and not taking itself or horror films "seriously".  Lots of computer graphics and motion capture went into making this giant movie which came off looking like a cartoon.<br /><br />By the way, the voting distribution was clearly bi-modal with a maximum of both five stars and a single star.  Clearly, some of us loved and hated this film. In such circumstances the mean (~3 stars) is somewhat meaningless.<br /><br />Although not granted any points for readers thinking my article was useful I am happy to see that 166 have voted this terrible film only a single star to date!

It's a great thrill ride that is just fun to watch. I wouldn't mind it if they made Van Helsing II. It was great.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>When "Van Helsing" came out in theaters I was pretty harsh. I don't know what I expected certainly something different than this campy popcorn movie. That was probably part of the problem. "Van Helsing", like "The Fearless Vampire Killers", packages camp, classic horror, satire and action all into one seamless package. Is it the worst film of the world? Well, yes if you were expecting enlightenment or something deep and meaningful. But if you were expecting adventure, humor and a startling mix of traditional special effects and CGI to support some truly looney and over-the-top performances, you'll have a blast with "Van Helsing".<br /><br />Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man with no memory. Working for the Vatican to rub out evil throughout the world, he faces his most difficult task--facing Dracula who has been supporting Dr. Frankenstein's research into creating life for his own nefarious reasons. Van Helsing also has to save the souls of the family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. Anna the latest in a long line of vampire killers is in danger and Van Helsing is directed to help her. Playing Q to Van Helsing's James Bond is Carl a Friar who comes up with all the wonderful toys Van Helsing must use to dispatch evil.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers' monster hit movie was completely misinterpreted by most critics and, yes, by lots of moviegoers. It's not a perfect movie but it's perfectly entertaining. There's always going to be mindless fun movies created for the 12 year old in all of us. Sommers' movie is an attempt to recreate that feeling (which he, no doubt, had as a kid as well) for adult movie audiences as well as kids.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD varies a bit. While the colors are vivid throughout most of the movie, the beginning of the film looks particularly soft with a lack of sharp detail. It does improve, however, as the movie progresses. My guess is that it's due both to the transfer and the large amount of detail in the images as well as the compression. Some of the sequences are startling clear and are among the best I've seen on DVD. The sound has tremendous presence. Sommers and Ducsay his producer/editor provide a delightfully informative audio commentary as do three of the main actors from the film Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp.<br /><br />The big difference between the two region one editons as simple--1 extra disc. Both editions have outtakes, "You Are in the Movie" (which tries to create the impression that you're part of the production crew on the set), "360 Degree Tour of Dracula's Castle", "The Legend of Van Helsing" (which discusses the character as portrayed through films), the first level of the "Van Helsing" Xbox game (which can be played on your DVD player) and the "Bringing the Monsters to Life" featurette.<br /><br />The extra disc has a number of features not included on the disc disc set. An interactive map, "Darkness Falls: Dracula's Lair is Transformed" which looks at the production end, a short documentary "Van Helsing: The Story, The Life and The Legend". Most importantly for old horror movie fans is the inclusion of three classic Universal horror movies Todd Browning's "Dracula"(1931), James Whale's "Frankenstein" (1931) and George Waggner's "The Wolf Man" (1940). "Dracula" is essentially the same as the first disc in the "Legacy" series with commentary, trailers and a short documentary. "Frankenstein" and "The Wolf Man" arrive bare bones with just the feature films.<br /><br />The big question will be whether or not the deluxe edition will be worth it? Only if you don't have the three Universal classics included. The featurettes and extras on disc three aren't all that impressive overall considering the price. If you don't have the three classic films and only want those (vs. ponying up for the "Legacy" boxed sets), then this would be the way to go. It's a pity that this editon doesn't have a "Director's Cut" (if one exists) along with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale's commentary on the film.<br /><br />Overall, "Van Helsing" is a great movie to watch on Halloween (and there's only one minor bad word that I recall hearing and it's pretty minor)with kids 6 and older. It's a way to revisit the classics you grew up enjoying without having your kids get bored watching old black and white movies that with pacing from another era.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Stephen Sommers can make a darn good movie.  He proved it with 1999's "The Mummy," which was a refreshingly light yet thrilling update of the old Mummy movie-monster.  "The Mummy" balanced outstanding special effects with some sparkling chemistry between the two leads, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, and employed the perfect comic timing of sidekick John Hannah and the definitely creepy presence of villain Arnold Vosloo.  Not a great flick, by any means, but a darn good one.<br /><br />"Van Helsing" is an attempt to regenerate exactly the same combination, just with a different script.  But instead of updating one classic movie monster, "Van Helsing" takes Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll, and even the influence of the "Alien" movies and throws them into the PG-13 blender.  But where "The Mummy" emerged from the creative oven as satisfying (and as nutritious) as a perfectly decadent Philly cheesesteak sandwich, "Ven Helsing" comes out like a stale Big Mac - overly processed lard without much flavor.<br /><br />It's a dratted surprise, too.  Hugh Jackman is an excellent actor, even in ridiculous movies, but here he is largely wasted in a non-sensical plot as the titular monster-hunter Van Helsing.  His back story, which is hinted at, is never explained . . . even during one of the script's many exposition-only speeches.  Kate Beckinsale is largely in the movie to look ravishing and bring in the audience from her vampire-wolfman "Underworld" movies.  As in most PG-13 movies, both Jackman and Beckinsale can be punched in the face hard enough to launch them clear across rooms, yet only emerge with an attractive trickle of blood on the cheek - sturdy stuff, these Hollywood stars!<br /><br />Perhaps that's the main problem with "Van Helsing" as opposed to "The Mummy" - it cheats on the violence.  Whereas in "The Mummy," the villain was updated with lots of magical powers that were thrilling and gruesome without being overly gory.  Dracula and the Wolfman, however, are in the ugly business of tearing out throats and rending limb from limb.  It's hard to do that correctly on-screen and still keep your PG-13 rating, which is essential for major box office.  So as a result, the villains in "Van Helsing" really come off as lightweights.  The less said about Richard Roxbrough's non-scary spin as Dracula - who comes off as snotty Euro-trash more than Evil Incarnate - the better.<br /><br />In addition to some pretty impressive special effects showing the brutal mountainscape of Transylvania, the movie's only other real charm is David Wenham's turn as Carl, the Vatican's gadget-guru and nebbishy sidekick to Van Helsing.  After seeing Wenham for the first time as the noble Faramir in Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" movies, it was hilarious to see him play the nerd with such brio.  His performance kept the movie's tongue planted firmly in its cheek, and he saves the movie to the extent it can be saved.<br /><br />Do not watch "Van Helsing" if you are looking for anything resembling thrills and chills or if you are putting together a retrospective of any of the participants' work, other than the artistic folks and Wenham.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Wow...I'm exhausted!  Hugh Jackman is wonderful; you cannot fault him, though you do chuckle - again, he is a man with power who cannot recall his past.  And Kate Beckinsale is really showing her stuff.  When you look at Cold Comfort Farm, Underworld and now Van Helsing, it shows there is little this lass cannot do and do well.  The action is non-stop - literally.  It must have more near escapes than any ten - make that twenty - movies put together.  The sets are moody and properly monster movie Gothic.  And you get Vlad Dracul, his brides and a horde of baby vampires - the children of the night - that Drac is trying to bring to life.<br /><br />But that is only the start.  There is Dr. Jekyll and Robbie Coltraine as Mr. Hyde - as an appetizer.  You mustn't forget a werewolf or two and Frankenstein's monster.  Oops, almost forgot Igor!  By this time, you are ready for Bobby "Boris" Pickett to break into The Monster Mash!  The same bunch that did such a bang on job with The Mummy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, does this.  Only someone needs to tell Stephan Sommers often less is more and more is just too much.  This movie is a perfect example of so much going for it - too much going for it - that it overwhelms you.<br /><br />Van Helsing (Jackman) is an immortal who has memories at being at Masada.  The Church sends him out to hunt down evil and smote it by any means needed.  After taking down and dispatching Jekyll/Hyde, they send him to Transylvania to handle Drac the naughty vamp.  Seems Dracula and his three brides are making a nuisance of themselves at a local village, and only thing keeping them and the werewolves in line as the ancient family Valerious, but they are now down to a brother and sister.  Anna Valerious watched as her brother battles a werewolf.  The brother saves her, but goes over the cliffs, later to become a werewolf.  Van Helsing and Carl, his religious sidekick, arrives on the scene, but the villagers are not so happy to see them.  Seems the vamps only want one or two villagers a month, not too bad, they think.  Carl please note is David Wenham (Faramir from Lord of the Rings!), in case he seems familiar.<br /><br />Van Helsing, Anna and Carl join forces and the villagers attitude soon changes as they learn the Dracula is trying to bring his thousands of bat babies to life.  The key is Frankenstein's monster, very sympathetically portrayed Shuler Hensley.  It comes down to a battle of the titans between Dracula and Van Helsing, (they second time they have gone down this road) and this time the town ain't big for two these two; one has to bite the dust or each other!<br /><br />The is no pace to this movie, it's totally pedal to the metal the whole way, where The Mummy movies see slow in comparison!  Shame.  This could have been one really great movie.  The cast was right.  Great special effects, it was just you feel like you have been beat over the head with every cinema monster ever to lumber through Universal's backlot.<br /><br />Obviously, this is left open for a sequel.  And despite this disappointment, I will be eagerly watching.  Maybe if they look at this one and see what they did wrong, second time around they might get it right.  Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi this ain't; it's not even the classy stylized battle of Lee and Cushing.  But they I didn't want it to be.  I just wanted a few moments to catch my breath.  The ending is very beautiful filmed and the emotions reach you, almost poetically.  Shame more of that could not have be sprinkled into this rest of the script.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>In 1999 director Steven Sommers presented the hit movie THE MUMMY to movie audiences (which opened to an amazing weekend take of $43 million May 7th). With so much success a sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001) was inevitable.<br />Sommers, a big fan of the classic Universal monster/horror movies made the movie as a homage to the earlier Universal movies and in 2004 he paid tribute to the other staples of the genre -Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's monster - all in one movie. The movie VAN HELSING even had Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde in a cameo role at the outset of the movie fighting famed monster hunter Van Helsing - portrayed by Hollywood star Hugh Jackman.<br />Ignore what you may have read or heard about the movie, it's a thrill ride of a rollercoaster of a movie that owes more than a tip of the hat to both the Indiana Jones and James Bond franchises. The movie never lets up, traveling along at breakneck speed right to its tumultuous, suspenseful, wrist-clenching climax.<br />The movie opens in 1887 and follows legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing as he travels to the mysterious land of Transylvannia - home to his most famed opponent Count Dracula and a land that has been overrun by werewolves and vampires.<br />Prior to his departure we have a scene unabashedly influenced by the Q-scenes from the James Bond series. Equipped with such `futuristic' weaponry and gadgets as an automatic `machine gun' style crossbow, Van Helsing, with comic relief Carl (played by David Wenham) as his bumbling assistant in tow, heads to investigate the reports coming out of eastern Europe.<br />Upon arrival Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (played by the impossibly gorgeous Kate Beckinsale). Valerious is the last member of a family that is under a curse that can only be broken by the death of Dracula. After some initial mistrust Valerious realizes that Van Helsing shares her goal of defeating the evil count and the two enter into an alliance.<br />I admit that my initial interest in the movie was sparked by the involvement of Beckinsale. A fan of the British actress since I noticed her alongside Clare Danes in BROKEDOWN PALACE, I have enjoyed a number of her movies (SEREDIPITY and UNDERWORLD) and had to endure some terrible movies (PEARL HARBOR and TIPTOES). Thankfully VAN HELSING falls squarely in the positive column and ranks unquestionably as my favorite Beckinsale movie to date. She gives an excellent and stirring performance as a determined fighter of the monsters that inhabit her land.<br />Opposing Van Helsing, Carl and Valerious is one of the all-time best screen portrayals of Dracula in Richard Roxburgh. Roxburgh is simply superb and steals every scene he is in with his deliciously evil rockstar take on the character. Aiding Dracula are his three vampire brides (Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca and Elena Anaya) who fly around the country doing his bidding - the interplay between the three I found to be constantly entertaining. Also under the spell of the count is Wolf man (Will Kemp), a character Van Helsing has sworn to kill, but one which causes some emotional drama for Valerious and an interesting subplot for the movie.<br />With a budget of $148 million, Universal really threw a lot of effort into this movie and it shows. A total of 980 special effects accompanies some well honed action scenes, amazing stunts and sumptious costume design in a movie that really delivers the goods. It's an incredible trip that will leave you breathless until the end credits roll.<br />This movie was criticized widely for its improbable script. Yes, it's a B-movie script but then it is supposed to be. It's a homage to the black and white Universal classics. That's what you go expecting to see, only with updated special effects and a larger budget. In those respects this movie is a triumph. Sit back and enjoy and remember those wonderful Lon chaney and Bela Lugosi movies of yesteryear. This movie isn't one that works if you try to overthink it. It's fun and played to be fun.<br />Delivering possibly two of their best performances is Jackman and Beckinsale and I really felt a chemistry between the stars, easily more so than Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the two MUMMY movies. Sommers sets his story against a spectacular scenic backdrop that worked for me as far more breathtaking than  the desert vistas of Sommers most famous earlier work.<br />VAN HELSING is an achievement and my favorite movie of 2004. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the widescreen anamorphic DVD on Oct. 19 in a release that Universal has understandably seen fit to shower with special features. Including two audio commentaries, a 360-degree tour of Dracula's castle, You are in the Movie, the tantalizingly titled `The Legend of Van Helsing' and (perhaps most enticing) some deleted scenes, October cannot come soon enough.<br />I'm hoping for a VAN HELSING 2, but even if one doesn't get made at least I will have this immensely entertaining movie to enjoy.<br />Well recommended.<br /> Be aware that the studio will also be releasing an Ultimate Edition DVD on the same day. This three-disc set will also include the classic horror movies DRACULA (1931), FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and THE WOLF MAN (1941).<br />Other special features included on the Ultimate Edition are: 'VAN HELSING, THE STORY, THE LIFE THE LEGEND'; 'TRACK THE ADVENTURE: VAN HELSING'S MAP'; 'THE MUSIC OF VAN HELSING' and 'DARKNESS FALLS: DRACULA'S LAIR IS TTRANSFORMED.'<br /> Which ever version you pick up, the regular edition or the Ultimate Edition be assured that you will be well pleased with the movie itself - a must-own!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This Movie is awesome. i love this film and all the characters in it. i hope they make a sequel. Van Helsing is a joy to watch so if you have not seen this movie than you should</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The movie was fantastic. Van Helsing is a great ride, lots of action, very entertaining movie. I recomend this movie to everyone who wants to go out and have some fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like "Van Helsing," especially after reading various interviews with the director who acknowledged that he was inspired by his love for the Universal horror classics. Unfortunately, he comes closer to recreating the mediocrity of 1944's "House of Frankenstein" than one of the studio's superior horror classics from the 1930's.<br /><br />There is a lot to like about "Van Helsing." The sets are impressive and the special effects can not be faulted. There are plenty of impressive action sequences that can make you gasp. In the end, though, it proves the old adage that "less is more."<br /><br />The movie is positively stuffed from end to end with breathtaking stunts and special effects, leaving little time for character development or story. That's unfortunate because there are, indeed, several novel twists worth exploring, such as Dracula's financial support of Dr. Frankenstein's experiments. But this is simply mentioned then quickly discarded in favor of stunts and effects that grow monotonous because they are so plentiful. There's never time to catch your breath. For some viewers, these complaints may sound more like recommendations. Rest assured, if it's action you want, this movie delivers . . . and delivers, and delivers.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is okay, but his Van Helsing is closer in spirit to Indiana Jones and James Bond than the character created by Bram Stoker and played to perfection in other movies by such actors as Edward Van Sloan, Peter Cushing, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. As Dracula, however, Richard Roxburgh seems too intent on channeling Bela Lugosi and too often brings to mind Al Lewis, Grandpa on "The Munsters," instead.<br /><br />Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde also put in appearances, but nothing really progresses beyond the surface level. Too bad. The premise is great. The effects are superb. The action is well-staged. The story, however, falls short.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>I have noted some bad reviews, and few stars but I really liked this film and I am keeping mine.  When this first came out, I was very impressed, but even then I thought that some of the CGI was over the top.  If you suspend disbelief (and / or have a margarita), the movie is very visually appealing.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale, alone, gives the movie a high rating, IMHO.  There are some aspects of the film which are hokey, silly, or overdone, but overall I liked the movie enough to watch it a few times.<br /><br />I recommend watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80S">Bram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUH6">Underworld (Unrated Extended Cut)</a>, then watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVUKM">Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>All the greats, Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolve, even Jecke & Hyde make an appearance in this film.  The movie is dark and sometimes the plot seems a little thing, or the director introduced something but never returned to it.  The movie is good basic entertainment, if you are looking for a high-grade movie or classic, you should probably look elsewhere.  This was great for entertainment, but I didn't add it to my library.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Well, not really.  But at least the main idea, the main plot, was more realistic than Dracula just trying to take over the world, or England, for no reason.  Here, Dracula, played by the wonderful Richard Roxburgh, just wants to give his children LIFE.  That gave him a emotional touch, a shadow, a relic, from his human side that many other vampire characters in other movies have lost.<br /><br />Also, I enjoyed many of the scenes, I liked how they really brought out the beauty of Kate Beckinsale as well as the Brides -what nice outfits!  Thou I feel sorry for them - they had to wear almost nothing in very cold enviroments.<br /><br />Why only three stars?  Well, first off it was hard for me to see the character of Abraham Van Helsing as a homdsome, butt kicking, action hero.  A, as somebody else pointed out, James Bond for the Church.<br /><br />I liked the Mummy movies but I did't know much about the legends or myths behind the Mummy movies.  I DO happen to know a lot about vampire myth and fiction.  In other words, the very people who might wish to watch this movie, vampire lovers, might be the very ones who will spend the whole time shaking their heads and wondering what the heck they're watching.<br /><br />IF you watch it with the understanding that you will see werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, Mr Hyde and lots of vampires than you might enjoy it.  Don't compare it to ANY other movie - it is within a class by itself.  It is, after all, a Stephen Sommers movie.</p></br></body></html>

A spectacularly original screenplay, based on Pierre Boulle's brilliant book, is fleshed out with pitch-perfect intensity, and  snaps you to attention.  Charlton Heston, holding on to his noble qualities  of old, is placed in circumstances that astound and surprise you; the  underlying political messages here actually have real resonance in today's  divided world with perhaps even more forcefulness than they did then.  The  musical score captures the essence of a terrifying new place with wit and  originality; and the often-copied finale, should you be a virgin viewer,  will rock your world.  This is a masterpiece of true science fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>So how do you give a star rating to a film series of such varying quality?  Well the films almost speak for themselves.  Chances are you have seen at least some of them before...  If you have, then be prepared to see them as spruced up as possible, with some genually informative extras.. if not, prepare for one of the most unique movie franchises out there.. in fact, the franchise that really set a trend in having merchandising and tie-ins, before Star Wars came along and ran with the concept.  What's fascinating now watching these, along with the short documentaries accompanying each movie, is the discussion around the issues of the day which influenced, and maybe even spawned, the movies themselves.  The writers of the screenplays wanted to use a fantasy world to explore issues of race and civil unrest that they might not otherwise get to tell... so while you can take these movies as adventure fantasies or action movies on one level, it's looking at them obliquely that one gets the roundest experience of them.<br />That said, the quality of the movies is most definitely variable.  Planet of the Apes (*****) is the classic one here even if the effects and style have somewhat dated, and comes with a plethora of extras in the form of stills, trailers, the 2 hour documentary narrated by Roddy MacDowall which explores the whole world of Planet of the Apes through all the movies and TV series, games, vintage documentaries and more.  Charlton Heston plays the astronaut who was happy to go on a long term mission since he is cynical about Earth's chances of survival anyway, only to find himself on a world where the social order is upside down - apes are the intelligent species.. man (and not forgetting Linda Harrison as woman) is mute and the inferior species.  The commentary however comes more often than not through the ape hierarchy and how they treat each other, than how they treat man.  Certainly, watching it again will remind you what an ill conceived exercise Tim Burton's remake was. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (**) benefits from at least a cameo from Charlton Heston, with James Franciscus gamely trying to hold his own, against a script which falls woefully short of the first one, eschewing the subtleties of message for a blatant anti war tone.  Its tale of a weird society of mutant humans worshipping an atomic bomb, climaxes in a nihilistic ending which fails to shock or involve in anything like the way the first did.  Charlton Heston adds the only element of class in the exercise.  By the time of Escape from Planet of the Apes (***) came along the following year, the production values were a shadow of their former glories, but despite an uneven tone moving from broad humour in the first half through to serious and bleak in the second half this story works surprisingly well, as Roddy MacDowell and Kim Hunter return from the first movie, having escaped the planet in Heston's spacecraft (some of the ideas are best just accepted rather than thought about too hard..) and gone back in time to `current day'.  The change to ape being the odd one out in a human society adds a needed fresh twist.  Ricardo Montalban in a small role is a treat.  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (***) suffers from lowest of all the budgets, and darkest least family friendly in its levels of violence as we chart the beginning of the Apes rise to supremacy as they start revolution.  However, given the budget they had, they did a good job, with MacDowell giving arguably his best performance in the series, and the alternative directors cut here not only restores some of the cuts made for violence (don't expect too much, it's just more tomato ketchup on display), but restores the original bleaker ending, which fits the tone of the movie and indeed the movie series much better than the studio enforced more hopeful ending in the theatrical version.  Battle for the Planet of the Apes (**) at least brings the story full circle, but is so watered down and lacking a coherent narrative drive or underpinning idea, it is the weakest of the series, and it is probably good they stopped where they did - on the big screen at least.  The second * is based on goodwill carried over from the previous movies more than anything.  Look out for a cameo from John Huston, if you can recognise him. And if nothing else, it's fun debating the meaning of that final shot...<br />All in all, as a package this is not as `must see' as it once was, but good entertainment with enough issues woven in to give it an additional dimension. There's a nice 20 minute to half an hour documentary exploring personalities and themes of each movie on each disc.  Worth capturing at the bargain price it is currently available at.  Go Ape, and treat yourself..</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>Take your paws off me you damned dirty ape! lol man that scene will always stick with me. I love planet of the apes. i couldnt stand the marky mark version. I cant say for sure that this movie should have been left as it was with no follow up because there were so many rocks left unturned but there was never that special touch that the first movie had in any of the others.  I must say as the series goes on you really begin to wonder "what was better, the humans or the apes" because i know even in the first one when taylor begins speaking his distaste for the human race.  In the first one Dr. Zaius comes off as being way worse than he does in the other ones except for one scene in the second film where i truly couldnt stand him.<br /> if you are a fan of sci fi or even just someone who loves to watch things that make you think, this movie is one of the best investments you can make in your video collection. there was truly never again anything like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>That's the first of a long series of films. At first you think you are in some kind of Star Trek series with a little bit less gadgetry, or maybe a new Space Odyssey. Then you think you have been thrown into a remake of George Pal's Time Machine, adapted from H.G. Wells. But you realize very fast it is quite another story. Instead of implementing Darwinism within a Marxist vision of industrial society, here the very Darwinian evolution that man produced man as superior to apes, we have exactly the world upside down and apes are superior to man.<br /><br />It is an inverted story of human fundamentalist Christianity or any fundamentalist religious belief in the hands and heads of an ape rather medieval society. Some humans arrive in a very long distance NASA flight and they are at first confronted to a wild human species and then hunted down by an ape superior species. That's the beginning. Of course the parallel with H.G. Wells stops here and we shift to another story.<br /><br />The aim is to reveal the absurdity of a fundamentalist belief that one species was created by God to dominate the world and another to be the Devil's spies and pawns. It is not racism since the apes and the humans are not members of the same species. It is what we humans practice everyday on earth, the absolute domination of all that nature contains. What is surprising is that these apes hunt humans, capture them, kill them but do not eat them. In H.G. Wells the Morlocks hunted the Elois in order to eat them as meat, proteins.<br /><br />The next surprising thing is that this dependence, inferiority has erased the capacity to speak in the humans whereas their superiority has granted the apes the power to speak and write. That is surprising since humans do have the physical ability but they lost the know-how. The film is surprising in its ending because it is the triumph of force over reason. The last surviving Earth man and his human female wild acolyte escape enslavement by using force, and the chief scientist and chief religious authority escape truth by using force.<br /><br />The end is all the more surprising when the Statue of Liberty jumps up out of nowhere on this extremely distant planet. Fascinating anachronism. I think they call that, in the intellectual critical milieu, a "mise en abime". Of course we know it is the door to the sequel, but even so it is slightly moving to see her in there. Quite out of her normal environment. Maybe some myth is attached to this lady, so strong that on September 11 they attacked the Twin Towers instead of the Statue of Liberty. Surprising indeed what force a mythical being can take in human minds.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>stumbled upon this wonderful set like new (flawless) in a buy , sell and trade store here in certal florida . only 15.00 bucks . man what a deal .

Such was the case with me for Planet of the Apes. From its hideous VHS cover to that classic Simpsons parody ("I hate every ape I see, from Chimpan-A to Chimpan-Z"), the ending was spoiled long before I even watched the movie. And it didn't help that the film is often listed on classic movies everybody watched such as Psycho, Gone with the Wind and the Godfather. Well even if the ending was spoiled, I found the film incredibly enjoyable regardless.<br /><br />4 astronauts crash land on a planet, one being killed during the crash. Very desolate and seemingly void of life. However, there exists a primitive era race of men who are hunted by intelligent apes. An oppressive society against men, the apes have little tolerance of man so when one of the astronauts, Taylor, manages to surprise them by being able to talk and reason, he becomes public enemy number 1.<br /><br />Like I said, the twist was spoiled long before these eyes watched the film so as I'm watching, I was actually surprised by how obvious it seems at times. There's a doll, horses, automatic weapons which made me think "people were surprised by the ending?" However it is quite an effective ending and the image of the...thing is quite poignant. It's probably best if you were living in a cave, or you're 13 and never saw the movie, been spoiled...or seen that episode of the Simpsons.<br /><br />While it does have the occasional action, its really surprising the film completely draws you in simply by talking. Similar to walking in someone's house and feeling the need to browse, you get interested and drawn in by the ape-run world. The only minor distraction is that the apes tend to be fairly similar to the next one and their mouths aren't exactly the most articulate but again, minor distractions.<br /><br />It's definately worth a watch and you should check it out and the 35th Anniversary seems appropriate...that is if Fox decides on a 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray/HD-DVD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>Humans have been moved too the bottom of the social chain.  All humans are mute with the exception of Taylor.  The monkeys and apes have an order also.  The Chimpanzee are the scholars, scientist; the Orangutans are the government officials and religious guardians; and the Gorillias are the military soldiers.  The Gorillias hunt humans and consider them a pest which feed on their corn and food supplies.<br /><br />HONORIUS: "Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?"<br /><br />Zaius is both the defender of the faith and the minister of science.  Zaius maintains a secret. He knows about the forbidden zone, World War III, the nuclear holocaust, archealogy in the forbidden zone, and evidence that man was superior to ape.  Honorius faith is that ape is more compassionate to each other: no ape has killed another ape.  The law giver was an ape and he warned in their articles of faith not too trust man.<br /><br />Zira and Cornelias befriend Taylor and their scientific findings are consider unauthorized and heretical.  The council when confront with evidence of man's superiority will not hear the evil, see the evil, or speak the no evil of such a contemptous idea.  Taylor is not allow to speak in his defense because he is not recognized as having any rights by the court.<br /><br />Interesting Taylors argument is one of evolution.  The Orangutans are religous animals and this Taylors ideas of evolution are ridiculous; the sacred scrolls teach nothing about monkey evolving into man; the Orangutans can not comprehend Taylors claims.  Second, Taylors claim that they cross the forbidden zone does not seem possible.  The council knows no living creature could cross that great distance of desert and barreniness and live.  Third, Taylors companions can not collaborate his story, since two are dead, and the third one, Landon is surgically altered too prevent him for ever speaking again.<br /><br />Zira must speak for Taylor.  Zira begins her argument asserting, if Taylors claims are false then he must have sprang up from the apes.  In other words, Taylor is a naked ape.  Zira further argues that she can find no physical evidence too indicate why humans can not speak.  "An upside down world", perhaps, zoologist today and trying to teach monkeys to speak, form sounds and symbols vocally that could be construed as speech.  Zira says, "Their voice organs are adequate. The flaw is in the brain"  Cornelius rises up and says, "Yes! Behold this marvel, this living paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain!"  Man is the missing link.  Cornelius claims contradict the sacred scrolls and the court will not hear his arguments.  "Silence you have gone to far!" Cornelius is treatened with a charge of subversion which would destroy his carreer and bring harsh penalities on him.  "An indictment is in order. Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy."  The ape government positions the religous order, the law, and political power in the hands of the state.  The state is role is too protect the interest of the these three domains.  This sets the stage for an oppressive government and an unjust government and revolution uprisings threaten the government.  The state will use violence to suppress this uprising and consider Taylor a threat too their idealogy.  Therefore, the apes must contain this liberation attempt and return order.  The apes consider the new discovers a social disease rather than a great scientific discovery.<br /><br />'Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed. Yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is the harbinger of death'</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>Planet of the Apes is a great "What if" tale. There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state. But when "Apes" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake! Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here. The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely. In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place. They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well. Monkey racism I guess you'd call it. That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).<br /><br />The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place. Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.<br /><br />As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed. You just want to know why the monkeys are talking. Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy. The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers. The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.<br /><br />There are a lot of extras here.  Good stuff, not the stuff they threw on the floor while making the film.  The documentaries are interesting to watch as well as the creation of the facial makeup.  The process was brutal.  Once the makeup was applied, the actor had to stay in it until shooting for the day was over.  If they wanted to eat, most of what they ate had to be sipped through a straw.  There are cast interviews and Roddy McDowalls home movies as well.  Lots of fun stuff here.<br /><br />You must have this dvd.  Get it now!</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Pierre Bouelle's novel was good; the rest of the movie series ranged from okay to abysmal, and the remake was adequate (and arguably more faithful to the novel). But the 1968 version of _Planet of the Apes_ is just one of those _great_ moments in SF film history that nothing else can touch.<p>Charlton Heston is magnificent in the first of his three well-known 'last man' movies (the other two being _The Omega Man_ and _Soylent Green_, which are also nonrepeatable classics). The makeup is excellent, especially for 1968. But it's the brilliant script (for which Rod Serling shares a co-credit) that raises this film to its iconic status.<p>This is the sort of thing that 1960s cinematic SF (including the original _Star Trek_ series) tried to pull off and rarely managed to succeed at. This film is a carefully constructed drama, a meditation on human nature, and a two-hour morality play -- backed by a wonderfully evocative Jerry Goldsmith score. The 'science' in its science fiction is nothing to write home about, but its digs at human culture, religion, and species-centered pride work every bit as well today as they did in the latter portion of the turbulent '60s. <p>On the off-chance that there's somebody out there who doesn't know how it ends -- despite the fact that (duhh) a shot from the _final scene_ appears on the DVD cover -- I won't describe the Big Finale. But man, oh, man, even when you _know it's coming_, Heston still pulls it off. The closing moments _never_ fail to grab me.<p>And this mind-wrenching ending was specifically created for this film. It's not in the book and it's not in the remake.<p>The widescreen-format DVD is nicely done. If it's not in your collection already, get it at once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>&quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; is the second and most whacked-out film in the &quot;Apes&quot; series. It's somewhat successful due to sheer psychedelic madness, despite a budget cut that forces some of the players into ill-fitting and really dopey-looking masks. <p> James Franciscus works hard as Brent, the human this go-around. He gets a bit deranged by his experiences, but recovers in the bizarro third act where he reunites the lovely Nova (Linda Harrison) with Taylor (Charlton Heston again) beneath a ruined New York while the whole ape army storms the place. <p> Unfortunately, this movie began the series' flirtation with camp and heavy-handed social commentary. You get to hear a gorilla general (effectively played by James Gregory) preach genocide, and witness a mini-recreation of the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention right there on the streets of Ape City, as chimp peaceniks try a little nonviolence; the gorilla police don't take to hippies, either. <p> Still, it's a lot of fun and features some funky hallucinations and freaky special effects- especially when the mutant humans pull off their masks and reveal their skinless faces while worshipping an atomic bomb. And not just any atomic bomb- but a special one that'll destroy all life on earth. Well, you get the idea. Check it out and have some trippy fun some night when you don't have anything better to do. Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans return from the first film; this is the only &quot;Apes&quot; movie without the fantastic Roddy McDowall, who would subsequently the series' central figure with his winning chimp portrayals. Comes with the added bonus of having more Nova action than the first, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Let me be up front in saying that the very reason I believe this movie works may not be the same 2 reasons you think it does. Jerry Goldsmith is the first. Never let it be said &quot;sound doesn't matter much&quot;. Because it does. In fact this may be the best enhancement yet a movie has received from a quality sound track, this side of Halloween. The second reason this movie hits on all cylinders is Maurice Evans. His work as Dr. Zaius lends such an antagonistic credibility as to be UNFORGETTABLE, one for the ages. You can never have dramatic moments unless you have believable characters and though the entire cast IS stellar, it is Evans who I believe is the most noteworthy here. <p>In conclusion, I would like to thank FOX for including the trailers for the other Ape movies. If ever there was doubt that I should have purchased the whole box set, I can watch the trailers and know the balance of the Ape movies are rubbish. Sure, I would have liked to have the bonue disc, but I wouldn't want it at the expense of sacrificing this movies intengrity by purchasing the whole set. I feel I would be supporting ridiculous sequels, and I would rather have my self respect than a 2 hour documentry. The Lost World? UGH! Episode 1: The Phantom Menace? BAH! Few series get better as the series progresses and the Apes saga is but one of many casualties on a road to greatness. If you don't have The Planet Of Apes and you love sci-fi, you will appreciate the loving hand of the first movie, but the rest are like a menacing backhand.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I vividly remember having seen this when it came out.  Heston was phenomenal as an action hero, and a wonderful actor to boot.  While the sequels lost me, this I always thought was a great film.<br /><br />So I got a copy for my kids.  We viewed it together and greatly enjoyed it.  They were full of questions and observations - always a good sign -  but also enjoyed the action.  My son (7) talked about it for the following week.<br /><br />As I have not seen it in about 35 years, I was surprized at how much I liked it.  Usually, on viewing a sci-fi oldie I enjoyed at 6 or 12, I am disappointed at how flimsy it seems in terms of plot and realism.  Happily, this is hard sci-fi in that it is at least not impossible, and there are interesting characters:  Taylor the cynic, Dr Zeias the guardian of orthodoxy, and the scientist/intellectual chimps as well as Cornelius, the rebellious young one.  The story hangs together well and has a startlingly fresh conclusion that is not happy.<br /><br />Warmly recommended for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is my least favorite of the Apes stories. Still, it provides an important link in the story loop. Yes, it is a loop. After all, when you blow up the entire planet in the second film, you've got to do something strange to create a third. But that's next Tuesday.<br /><br />This one opens with Astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) bending over the dying body of his commander beside the burnt body of their space ship. They had followed the pathway of Taylor in order to rescue him and his crew if possible. They don't know at first that they are on Earth, but they do know that they are way far ahead in time; some 2,000 years, as a matter of fact. Right after he buries his commander, he sees Nova coming toward him on a horse, and tries to communicate with her. In the process, he discovers that she is wearing Taylor's dog-tags. He seems to have made her understand that he wanted her to take him to Taylor, and she tries.<br /><br />Problem is, Taylor disappeared into thin air and she has no way to tell that to Brent. So all she can do is take him to Zera, the kindly chimpanzee veterinarian who had helped her and Taylor escape from the apes. That was what Taylor had told her to do if she lost him: find Zera. So Brent and Nova are hiding in the bushes near the town plaza while the Gorilla general declares they must go into the Forbidden lands and take them over to make up for the crops the humans had destroyed in the last round-up. He knows there's someone living out there, but it's not at all clear how he knows that.<br /><br />So Brent and Nova sneak into Zera and Cornelius's house (they've been married in the interim, apparently), where Zera patches up Brent's wound and helps them get away from the city. The rescue is a clever one, but I won't ruin it for you. Suffice to say the pair are free in the badlands, but there are gorillas hunting for them. They hide in a cave and discover it is actually what's left of the New York subway system. So now Brent knows where he is.<br /><br />He overhears the soldiers mention that they were told to hunt for them until they find them, and so Brent decides they will follow the subway tracks and go further underground. Eventually they discover an underground "civilization" made up of what are nominally humans but have some powers we don't. And they have a bomb, the Doomsday Bomb. They worship it.<br /><br />Brent is questioned and tortured by the underground people, who consider themselves very peaceful. They don't kill their enemies, they get them to kill each other. Sure enough, Brent is thrown into a prison cell with Taylor, and the two are forced to fight. I won't tell you how they get out of that mess, or indeed anything more of what happens, except as I say, the Doomsday Bomb is detonated.<br /><br />I couldn't help hearing "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when . . ."</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Interesting that each film seems to have been written with the idea that it would be the last one, but this one is referred to as "an action-packed finale", although we know there is one more. Perhaps they mean climax.<br /><br />At one point in the "Escape from" movie, an explanation for how things got so terribly turned around between humans and apes was offered. A plague killed off the dogs and cats, and humans needed pets. So they made pets of monkeys. But when they found how smart they were, and how easy to train, they soon turned them into servants and then slaves, bought and sold just like in the antebellum south. And just like in those days, abused due to their similarity to humans.<br /><br />Remember Milo, the baby Zira and Cornelius left in the care of the circus owner played by Ricardo Montalban? Through an unfortunate set of circumstances, he was sold to the governor who allowed him to choose his own name out of a book in a tradition he says started with his wife. Milo put his finger on the name Caesar.<br /><br />So this is the story of the revolution led by Caesar, still the only ape that can speak and read and write, but by no means the only one that can understand. In fact, Ape Control has disturbing reports of (1) higher intelligence tests in apes all the time, and (2) deliberate acts of disobedience. Once the apes have won, and vengeance seems inevitable, Caesar persuades the mob that they will rule by kindness and understanding, and show themselves to be better than their former masters.<br /><br />Of course, it's not hard to be better than brutes who are so obviously over-drawn characters that they were SS-like black uniforms and jack-boots. I was expecting them to do a stiff-armed salute any minute.<br /><br />It is an interesting link in the chain that circles round to the original movie, but I'm looking forward to the last one the most: that's the only one I have not seen before. Up next.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Finally, we have come round full circle. Oh, there's undoubtedly room for one more between this one and the original, but it was never made. As mentioned before, they all seem to have been made with no implied promise of another episode.<br /><br />This is just a few years after the revolution from "Conquest." Or rather, it is a flash-back to that time, because the opening scene is the Lawgiver reading to a group of children, both ape and human, about the early days, and Caesar the hero.<br /><br />Caesar's son was still a child, but since we can't say how quickly these kids grow, it's hard to say exactly how long it's been since the revolution. Caesar and McDonald, the black man who helped in fomenting the revolution (with several comparisons to the days when his people were slaves, too), together with a peaceful group of apes and men (and women) have created a rather primitive communal village where they all work hard and live in peace. But the proud General Aldo (he insists on the title) thinks learning English is far less important than learning riding and weapons and so on.<br /><br />Because Aldo is so temperamental, he stirs up problems within the community. He clearly resents Caesar's rule, even though everyone except the gorillas seems to have accepted his leadership without question. That's champanzees, orangutans and humans. But Caesar himself stirs up far more trouble without intending to when McDonald suggests that they could go to the Forbidden City and see the tapes of Caesar's mother and father that were presented to the presidential commission. McDonald's brother was head of the archives, and he knew where the tapes were.<br /><br />The city is radioactive, but they take a Geiger counter and count on getting out as quickly as possible. But there are people living in the underground portions of the city, people who are mostly suffering from radiation poisoning. These, then, provide the link to the "Beneath" episode.<br /><br />But Caesar's curiosity will cost them all plenty. Because now the humans know that there are apes who survived the nuclear war, and that they have a village somewhere nearby. So they gather together what vehicles and weapons they can muster, including a pitiful old school bus, and head out to conquer the ape village.<br /><br />No, I'm not going to tell you any more than that. Due to the circular nature of the time sequence of this series, you know the ultimate results already, if you've watched the earlier episodes, or even just read the earlier reviews. And it is worthwhile to see the entire series in sequence. Go ahead; go ape!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, 1972 film<br /><br />The story begins with a mov of red-suited apes who perform the jobs that ordinary Americans won't do. [No green cards needed?] These immigrants are legal. Armando leads his trained ape. "That's better." The authorities warn about apes gathering in the streets. [Don't they seem almost human?] A mysterious disease killed all the dogs and cats, so humans adopted apes as pets. Then they put them to work at simple tasks. There are protests over the conditions. The police club the protesters. Armando explains where Caesar can hide - among his own kind. The humans want to exterminate any intelligent ape given the unrest of the ape population. [Are there political overtones to their speech?] The chimps are fingerprinted, then given treatment and treatment.<br /><br />Armando is questioned. The chimps are trained to do useful work. Some are selected for special tasks. Chimps are auctioned off to buyers. [A job fair?] The Governor buys one to serve drinks. Caesar is given another job. Will the authenticator get the truth from Armando? Will there be an accident? Later a chimp acts up. So do others. The Governor orders the arrest of chimps. Will Caesar be on the list? The only way left to the chimps is revolution to gain power. A dragnet will be ordered to round up all unaccompanied apes. A electric shock makes Caesar talk. "He's dead." "It's over." Or is it? The chimps revolt against their rulers. Can they succeed? Flames keep them back for awhile. They advise citizens to keep indoors. They will shoot to kill any rebellious chimp. "Do not panic!" The chimps splash a liquid from red cans. "No! Go home!" "Back!" Gunfire creates panic.<br /><br />Riot Control reports the apes have broken through. More police are called in. The chimps throw Molotov cocktails, they run wild. Can they overwhelm the police? Is this the end of civilization as we know it? The apes raid stores for guns! It's the human's worst nightmare. "How?" "They don't have the intelligence." [Could it be evolution?] The Governor meets Caesar and explains the reason for his policy towards apes. Should the apes show humanity? It's too late. They have plans for their future. Today Los Angeles, tomorrow the world? There is a surprise speech to end this story.<br /><br />Will there be a sequel to this movie? The ending sort of promises one. This is a some what better and more dramatic story than the earlier movie. Were the apes meant to represent the rebellious students of that era? It is true to say they will take over the Earth in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Escape From the Planet of the Apes, 1971 film<br /><br />The story begins with a helicopter over the ocean. They see a craft near the beach, soldiers arrive to pull the craft ashore. "Open it up." Three travelers step out and remove their helmets! The visitors are locked in the zoo infirmary. We hear their explanation of events. "Don't take any chances." The female is tested and shocks the examiners. Something bad happens to a visitor. "We mean you no harm." There is another shocking statement! "I like you." The news shocks the scientists. The Presidential Commission meets to learn the facts. They speak the language of their ancestors. They come from a distant planet system. "We came from your future." The audience applauds. What did they see destroyed? They can't tell all the facts.<br /><br />Cornelius and Zira are taken to a hotel and shops in Los Angeles. They are shown the sights (like Disneyland). Zira speaks out. "Beastly" says Cornelius. Zira faints. "Grape juice plus." "In vino veritas"? What about the future? "Convince me." Can we alter the future? There is a philosophical discussion about the two apes. The Presidential Commission makes a decision - they will go to Camp 11 and be questioned. How did apes arise? It began with a great plague. Apes are smarter than dogs and cats. After a few centuries they learned to change their conditions. They want to give a drug to Zira and then question her. They did it for "science". Experimental surgery on humans? Will the apes be "humanely destroyed"? Or will they escape? Can they find a refuge? Yes, and Zira gives birth to Milo. The search is on for the two apes. Armando says farewell. They can hide on an abandoned ship. Lewis gives Cornelius a revolver "just in case".<br /><br />The scientists talk about problems like the population explosion or the threat of nuclear war. They find the clothes of Zira by an oil well. They search the area. The scientist who wants to kill the pair approaches their hide-out noisily. Other armed men arrive. There is a shoot-out. [Who are the savages?]And so their story ends. There is one last surprise. "Mama."<br /><br />This is a lower budget film that is part satire and part adventure. It is not too dramatic, as if the story had to be toned down. Think of the implications if the lower classes forgot their place and showed they were equal to the rulers of society. That could mean liberty and justice for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>Fox Finally did something right.<br /><br />The case opens up to a detailed timeline of Ape events.<br /><br />The case opens further, providing a 200 page full colour, glossy imaged retrospective worthy of any collection.<br /><br />The presentation of each film is beyond reproach. It is still this reviewer's opinion that anything being released on this scale on BD should be released in 7.1 digital sound. Each film presents its own harsh review of humanity and some on the purported truths thereabout.<br /><br />The BDs themselves are mounted on hard board backs by what amounts to pegs of gorilla glue (natch). These discs come away with a twist of a turn, not the man-handling we mere humans are accustomed to.<br /><br />It's too pretty (and too big) to fit with my present collection of BDs, but it doesn't belong with them per say. This is a collection treated dearly and presented as it should be: a milestone in cinema, sociology, and dystopic science-fact.<br /><br />These movies should be required viewing for all whom claim civility. This set deserves centre seat in any BD collection</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Although rarely if ever mentioned whenever sci-fi classics are discussed, "Planet of the Apes" deserves a place on the same pedestal as Classic Trek, Forbidden Planet and even Kubrick's 2001 as an original and very thought-provoking story that also serves as a great social satire for the times i.e. U.S. in the late 60s.  This blu-ray version certainly does not let the great content down as the picture quality although not perfect still looks very good in 1080p despite the fact that there are a few poorly preserved frames here and there throughout the film.  The sound quality though in DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is very good albeit the mostly front heavy nature of the original source means we don't get to fully appreciate this audio option.  The special features are good but not great but overall this is the best version of this great film that is currently out there.<br /><br />Being a big fan of Rod Serling and his Twilight Zone series I could see the Serling influence in the screenplay which he co-wrote; certainly the surprise ending is truly Twilight Zonish in nature not to mention the satirical references to prevailing social issues of the time which is another Zone trademark.  This is a great film but the many follow-up sequels are not and they fall far short of the brilliance that this the original film achieves.<br /><br />No sci-fi film buff should be without this film in their video library and this blu-ray release is currently the best version of the film that is out there.  Get this but ignore the sequels.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>That one was supposed to come and we waited twenty years for it to come, but it came of age and here we have it at the tips of our fingers on the DVD console. This tale is so simple that it is in a way emotionally overwhelming. How can we accept to see some humans mistreating their servants and home pets that they have turned into slavery. Let's revisit America and the auction block and the electric shocks and the torture and the humiliation and the sex on command and the procreation for a profit. Dirty old town indeed, if it is Los Angeles, well the angels are having nightmares right now. It is amazing how romanticism may still inspire our rather weak minds. The point is that we feel sorry for these poor souls that are mistreated and victimized but at the same time we do not see and don't want to see what may and will and shall happen if that goes on too long. Sooner or later there will be a big bang somewhere in our social constellation. And the film tries to be factual about a revolution of unarmed apes taking over the city against machine guns with just a little bit of wit, massive participation and determination. The flaw of our romanticism confronted to that blunt violence and the words of it can only make us afraid. Let's fear what we cannot control and let us kill ahead of time all those who may possess the words of that revolution. How sad because this film could have been a lot more powerful in drama and tragedy. No death on any one side of a revolutionary battle is acceptable, even if it is the tyrant that has just been ousted, even if some kind of a trial has been organized in the urgency and emergency of the moment so that there will be no discussion when the steam has come down. My time be long, my time be short tomorrow or today unjust causes always come to an end, and all causes that do not respect everyone, including one's opponents, not to speak of one's enemies, is doomed to come to a sad and cruel end and the defeat is at the end of the road, even if you get out of it without any remorse. Without any remorse, my foot. This film is remorse building for you humans who are not even able to accept what god has decided to do. We are nothing, we are nothing, we are nothing, nothing but a smite of dust in the sunshine of the Lord.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>It all starts as the funniest comedy ever. Three Chimpanzees escape the holocaust on their planet in their time in Taylor's spaceship and land in California.<br /><br />The first half is the meeting of those three apes with Americans who do not want to believe they can speak but are fascinated and under the charm of the extraordinary thing it represents. It is hilarious because every single sentence has a double meaning when we shift from man's point of view to the chimpanzees'.<br /><br />But that funny atmosphere turns sour very fast because the men who interrogate them, namely the CIA, believe them and see the future in their tale, a future of total reversal of the world order, of the natural order, the apes at the top and human beings having regressed to the bottom.<br /><br />And it is the hunt and the killing. That ending is like the proof that what the apes have said is going to be true. There is really no future for man on this planet and in this life. Apart from that this film is kind of sad.<br /><br />It represents a strange world, the world of 1973 of frightened human beings who cannot see things the way they could be but only the way they should be according to their own desire of domination. The President could be different but he is impotent and no one obeys him anyway.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>This set is wonderful!  All 5 films plus a bonus documentary hosted by the late great Roddy McDowall, Behind The Planet Of The Apes is a 126 minute  making of which shows the origins and the ideas that lead to the filming of  the saga which began in 1967, thru the rest of the films 'til 1973 as well  as the two television series (live action and animated) and the rereleasing  of the films and marketing.  But you have to buy this set soon because  after the first 100,000 are sold, the next sets will not, I repeat, will  not include the Behind The Planet Of The Apes documentary, which, to me, is  the best special feature you get with these movies.  The lowdown on the  films is this:  Planet Of The Apes is a classic.  Trust me, if you don't  like this one you won't like the rest.  The ending is historic.  Beneath  The Planet Of The Apes is a good second effort.  I just wish Charlton  Heston would've starred in the entire picture instead of the beginning and  ending. (note: the trailer for this film is different from the one given on  the VHS version (you can still see parts of that one on the documentary)).  Escape From The Planet Of The Apes is a very original installment which  takes place in the past circa 1973.  This one is lighter and more fun up  until the end.  Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is the most underated of  all the Apes films.  This is the only ape film that recieved a PG rating  for violence and deservedly so, but what makes this one unique is Roddy  McDowell's understated performance as Ceaser, the ape who would lead his  brothers and sisters to victory over the humans who have enslaved them.  This is the darkest of the set and, to me, deserves better recognition.  Battle For The Planet Of The Apes is a decent 5th installment.  This film  was made primarily for the kiddies, so, bearing that in mind you should  know what to expect and even so, this film is still quite entertaining.  None of these films were a boxoffice failure.  They all made money. So go  ape and grab this set, which includes the trailers for all 5 films, a photo  gallery for the first 2 films and of course, the documentary, Behind The  Planet Of The Apes.  Don't dawdle, grab this set soon.  You don't want to  give up the documentary.  It's a perfect companion to the rest of the films  that gives you some great insight and will be highly collectable in the  near future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>Rarely does the restoration of deleted scenes added back into a film work to its benefit.  The Extended Edition of Battle for the Planet of the Apes (available previously only as a Japanese laserdisc) is one of those rare exceptions. The fifth and final chapter in the Apes theatrical series is generally regarded as its weakest link.  It had the lowest budget of all of the films in the series and it painfully shows and looks more like it's a made-for-TV movie.  In fact, it feels almost like a pilot for the Planet of the Apes Television Series.<br /><br />The film  begins in the year 2670 and is bookended with John Houston as the revered ape Lawgiver reading from the sacred scrolls like a bedtime storyteller, "In the beginning, God created beast and man so that they could live in harmony and share dominion over this world..."  From here the story is told in flashback and the viewer is left scratching their heads by the befuddling logic.  Events not clearly explained are left to the viewer to make assumptions or draw conclusions about the contradictory order of events.  It must be assumed that a nuclear war had devasted the Earth immediately after the ape uprising in Conquest and somehow only a decade afterward the ape society had unbelievably evolved their verbal powers of speech and intelligence.  These facts are inconsistent with Cornelius' explanation of the apes' evolution in Escape in which he explains that the plague that destroyed all cats and dogs occurred some 200 years later than it did in Conquest and that Aldo was the first ape to utter human speech when he said the word "No" which was spoken by Lisa in Conquest,  and that Aldo led the revolt against the humans which was led by Caesar.  We can only conclude that the incongruent events in Conquest and Battle are the events of an alternate timeline forged by the creation of the temporal paradox from Cornelius and Zira's arrival in Escape.  The apes also adorn costumes similar to the fashions of the ape society from the first film which had evolved over several thousand years but again this is only a decade after their revolt against the humans (one explanation could be that since this story is told as a flashback to ape and human children we are seeing it as depicted by their imaginations as a point of reference).  Caesar has a son named Cornelius which might initially confuse the uninitiated viewer into mistaking this to be the young Cornelius from the first film which lived several thousand years into the future until it is made obviously clear late in the film that it is not the same Cornelius (I actually spent a better part of the film pondering how Caesar could paradoxically be both the son and the father of Cornelius).  Also, MacDonald in this film is not the same MacDonald who was the Governor's Adjutant in Conquest but rather his brother which is confusing since Caesar appeared to have found a human sympathizer and ally in the MacDonald from Conquest and the only reasonable explanation for the deliberate change of character is that MacDonald is played by a different actor this time, but if you aren't paying close attention, you are likely to miss that inference.  Ape City is located in a very lush and hospitable forest area within miles of the inhospitable desert wasteland of the annihilated Forbidden City.  Automobiles such as jeeps and school buses still work somehow and were not rendered inopperable by the EMP of the atomic detonation.  Radioactive half-life apparently only affects the surviving humans living within the irradiated remains of the Forbidden City (again, this takes place a mere decade after the war) and the apes can somehow sustain bombardments of high levels of radioactive fallout for a few hours while they search its archives for a videotape of Cornelius and Zira which also amazingly happened to not be vaporized or magnetically degaussed by the atomic blast. The mutated humans all wear skull caps for the purpose of (take your pick): A.) protecting their craniums from high radiation levels B.) to hide the fact that their hair has completely fallen out due to radioactive fallout C.) to enhance telepathic reception of their now-suddenly mutated telekinetic minds or D.) All of the above.<br /><br />The newly restored scenes with the human mutants and the Alpha-Omega bomb at least help to make some sense of the rather weak narrative and gaps of logic and provide some continuity to the rest of the series.  In the first scene, Governor Kolp unveils the Alpha-Omega bomb and instructs his assistant Alma to use it to annihilate Ape City should he not return from battle which is exactly what happens in the final scene where we see Mendez and Alma playing a game of checkers when Sargeant York returns and declares the defeat of their army and waves his arms in the air signalling an explosion just before he collapses.  Alma says "Then I know what I must do."  Mendez says  "But wait for Kolp's signal," Alma's response is "I have just received it."  Mendez, implores her not to carry out Kolp's original instructions making the arguement that its destructive power should be protected and even venerated and that they should become its guardians because it was one of their ancestors that made them what they are.  This scene is significant because it shows the mutants beginning to hone their developing telepathic powers  and it establishes the fundamental doctrine of their quasi-religious sect that will worship the Alpha-Omega bomb in future generations.  It almost feels more like a direct prequel to Beneath now.  Why this subplot was excised is almost as baffling as the film's logic but one reason perhaps is the fact that the film ended with a more optimistic outlook suggesting that the timeline of events were changed when Caesar united the apes and the humans and that the crisis of Beneath may have been averted but it is left open for the audience to decide from the ambiguous tear of the weeping statue of Caesar suggesting that perhaps the fateful events of the future cannot be avoided after all.<br /><br />Battle is definitely the worst of the five apes films but compared to most low-budget sci-fi shlock I've seen, it's really not as bad as it's made out to be, but judged against the superior standard set precedent by the first film it is a quite a disappointment.  In addition to the restored scenes, there are few highlights that make the film worth at least a viewing if you have enjoyed watching the other films in this series at all.  Of particular interest are the sets of the melted down post-apocalyptic Forbidden City that are just visually interesting to look at, even if the obvious matte paintings were composited into the background.  It gives the film a future-coda feel in a way that evokes images of James Cameron's The Terminator but pre-dates it over a decade.  If nothing else, Battle (and the rest of the Apes saga) was at least influential in inspiring other science fiction films in the genre and was the template for subsequent franchises and was more than influential to George Lucas and his Star Wars mega-merchandising empire that would follow only a few years later and the Planet of the Apes series would forever be buried under its apocalypse and reside in the realm of Saturday afternoon and late-night television broadcasts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I rank the original "Planet Of The Apes" series very high among the plentiful output of science fiction movies of their era.  Although the special effects are not brilliant by today's standards (compensated for somewhat by the quality designs of what they were trying to capture, even if the execution seems somewhat hampered in retrospect) and the action sequences are occasionnally rather low-impact, the strengths of the series - a great, thought-provoking and memorable story that weaves through all five movies; solid and impressive characters among both human and ape; a nice job on the photography; and mind-blowing endings to most of the movies; make up for any shortcomings.<br /><br />  The endings have become legendary, especially the finale to the first movie (which I'm certainly not going to give away here, in case anyone reading this is among the 22 or so people on the planet who don't yet know it; they even used to have the final shot on the Cover of one of the editions of the boxed set, for crying out loud).  The secrets of the conclusions to "Beneath The Planet Of The Apes" and "Escape From The Planet Of The Apes", however, aren't nearly as well-known by people who haven't seen the movies yet, which is good, because it gives one a chance to have some of the surprises unhampered by foreknowledge.  The end moments of "Escape", in particular, are haunting, the kind of thing that can give one chills just remembering it.<br /><br />  It's hard to talk to much about the latter movies in the saga without giving away far too much.  The original, "Planet Of The Apes" has Earth astronauts making an emergency crash-landing on an unknown world, where it turns out that apes, not humans, are the dominant species.  Captured, the humans - indigineous to the planet but very primitive, in addition to the more scientifically advanced spacefarers - find themselves imprisoned in wooden cages (rudimentary equivelents to the barren metal cages of old, pre-'simulated natural habitat' zoos?).  The apes of the world are diverse - there are some who view the human population as mindless beasts without rights, while others are sympathetic to the humans's plight.  There is also considerable friction between the three races of apes - gorillas, orangitans, and chimpanzees (notice quite a few real-world parralells yet?).<br /><br />  The series - which continues through "Beneath...", "Escape...", "Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes" and "Battle For The Planet Of The Apes" (disc 6 in the collection is a behind-the-scenes documentary) has some recurring characters, continues to introduce new ones, introduces new concepts and layers and twists to the concept.  By the 4th and 5th entries, the series is admittedly losing some steam, but judged on their own each of those is still a good movie.  Great price, too.  Any fan of adventure movies, science fiction, or movies that offer volumes of fodder for thought and dream, should consider picking this set of classics up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>When I was a kid, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; merchandise flooded the stores.  Action figures, puzzles, guns, masks; we had it all.  Unfortunately, we had to rely on the scheduling whims of network executives in order to watch the actual films that spawned this kitschy bonanza.  The Age of Cable, VHS and DVD has dawned, and now we have the movies to enjoy whenever we want to time travel to a world where apes dominate.  It's a decidedly downbeat and pessimistic world, but one that continues to fascinate. <p> And this DVD set contains the entire 5-film series, so you can watch the devolution from highly-original concept into low-budget mediocrity.  Fortunately, though, the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise was almost always entertaining, even as inspiration ran low.  Let's look at the films in order, shall we?  Set controls for the year 3978... or 3955, depending on the movie. <p> Planet of the Apes:  The original, which over the years, has picked up some only marginally justified camp baggage.  Charlton Heston plays a misanthropic astronaut who, ironically, becomes humanity's sole defender.  Maurice Evans persecutes him as orangutan Dr. Zaius (who knows more about ape history than he lets on), and Roddy McDowall (soon to become synonymous with playing chimps on-screen) and Kim Hunter (and Oscar winner for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;!) portray Cornelius and Zira, his chimpanzee defenders.  With the lovely, fur-bikinied Linda Harrison as Nova, Heston's mute main squeeze.  A genuinely thought-provoking and thrilling classic, despite a few heavy-handed attempts at humor.  Worthy of special note is Jerry Goldsmith's dynamic, percussive score. <p> Beneath the Planet of the Apes:  The bizarre, somewhat inferior, sequel, which suffers from a lower budget (witness the really poor ape masks on the extras, and a few gorilla soldiers in flimsy outfits).  James Franciscus crashes to earth to find Heston, and instead finds Ms. Harrison and the apes.  Everyone's back from the first except McDowall (this is the only ape film he missed).  As a special bonus, James Gregory (&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;) plays a war-hungry gorilla general with gusto.  Features some interesting vistas of a bombed-out New York, and a memorable mutant unmasking scene.  A veritable camp-fest, and a lot of psychedelic fun. <p> Escape from the Planet of the Apes:  An inversion of the original concept, and quite a bit closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel.  McDowall returns, and with Kim Hunter and Sal Mineo (&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;), journeys back to the present day United States, only to run afoul of a sinister government scientist.  Vivacious performances by McDowall and Hunter salvage it somewhat. <p> Conquest of the Planet of the Apes:  A more violent entry in the series, but tame by today's standards.  McDowall plays his own character's son, a chimp named Caesar who is destined to overthrow humanity.  And that's pretty much what he does.  Ricardo Montalban performs admirably, but the series was beginning to fray with lower and lower budgets.  The final visuals will chill you, though. <p> Battle for the Planet of the Apes:  The final film.  McDowall attempts to divine the future, but invites the wrath of disenfranchised humans.  A miniscule budget (evidenced mainly in the final, underwhelming battle scenes) devastates this one, although the script's not too bad.  Claude Akins makes a fine villainous gorilla, diminutive singer/songwriter Paul Williams has some memorable lines as a wise orangutan, and director John Huston portrays the legendary Lawgiver in the framing sequences.  Award yourself a banana if you can spot &quot;Animal House&quot; director John Landis as one of the humans. <p> The complete DVD set includes a 2-hour documentary, hosted by Roddy McDowall himself.  It's fun for the serious &quot;Apes&quot; fan.  It features a lot of trivia, and talking head interviews with the major players, including Heston, make up artist John Chambers, and producer Richard Zanuck.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>That's true both in terms of the sequels (Beneath, Escape, Conquest, Battle) as well as compared to the Tim Burton remake.<br /><br />A groundbreaking film (it won an Oscar for best makeup before there was even such a category), I can only imagine the audience's reaction in theaters at the film's final reveal!<br /><br />Just one question: How in the name of all that is good was this film rated G? I know the ratings system has changed over the years, but even the classic line, "Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!" should have bumped it up to PG, no?<br /><br />Charlton Heston was at his best in the "last man" role, and is perfect here. (creepy laugh and all) And was there a more beautiful woman in 1968 than Linda Harrison (Nova)? She had been a beauty pageant winner and runner-up in the 1965 Miss USA. She must not have spoken well or else surely she would have found more work in Hollywood.<br /><br />I've been tempted to purchase the 6-disc collection, although it can be had for quite a bit cheaper on the UK amazon, where it's called the The Planet of the Apes Collection (6 Disk Box Set). In the meantime, the one I'm reviewing is the one to have. It comes with three commentaries so I can't understand why anyone would pay more than twice as much for the more recent 35th Anniversary Edition:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TPA4C">Planet of the Apes (Widescreen 35th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>The fourth movie in the "Planet of the Apes" series is a decent albeit no-frills affair.  Roddy McDowall once again stars, this time as Caesar, the son of Cornelius (who he played in earlier films) and Zira.  Caesar is the only talking ape on Earth, although he's been hidden by circus owner Armando (Ricardo Montalban).  When Armando takes Caesar into public for the first time, he relates to Caesar how apes came to become the #1 pet in the country, which also serves as narration for the audience.  Apparently, a plague from space killed all the dogs and cats in the 1980s, and Americans turned to apes and other primates to replace them.  By 1991 when the film is set, though, humans essentially have turned primates into slaves, forcing them run errands, clean their homes, and even work as waiters in restaurants.  However, all of that will soon change once Caesar is discovered by the fascist Governor Breck.<br /><br />"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" is weaker than the prior three movies in the series.  The final battle, in particular, is kind of ridiculous and suffers from the film's low budget; unfortunately, the weakness of this section undercuts the social message of the movie.  Another debit is the lack of explanation regarding how the US had become an oppressive society so quickly since the last Apes movie.  Incidentally, if you haven't seen the first three films, you probably will be totally lost, as "Conquest" is quite dependent on the Apes mythology.  Despite these weaknesses, "Conquest" is a relatively enjoyable movie.  What I found most interesting was how the makers of these movies managed to make each one different in plot and tone - "Conquest" wasn't just a rehash of the prior entries, preventing the series from falling into predictability.  Although I found "Conquest" to be rather lackluster, it was good enough to make me want to see the fifth and final Apes film, "Battle for the Planet of the Apes."</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Near future for the 1970s, that is.

The sequels, well.......they are kind of stupid, but I can't help but like them any way! I grew up with them and when you're young you are willing to let little things go...like continuity,inane dialog and unbelievable and contrived story lines. The first film is in a class all by itself. The make-up is great for the time and I still think for the most part holds up today. The sets are cool and Roddy,Kim and the rest of the main apes play there parts to the hilt! Heston is Heston and he can make anything seems like it is real! The 2 disc set has a really nice transfer and a load of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>As with most Rod Serling stories (he co-wrote this with Michael Wilson), a fundamental twist in the nature of things opens the door to pointed social commentary. The ruling apes exhibit the same fears, ignorance and prejudice as we civilized humans, only it stings a little more when you're on the wrong end of the whip. The film is gorgeously shot and briskly paced by director Schaffner, who'd go on to do "Patton". Kudos to 20th Century Fox on the quality of the restoration, as watching this pristine DVD felt like a whole new experience. Heston as the cynical Taylor makes an appealing hero, and Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter excel as kindly chimp couple Cornelius and Zira. That "wow" surprise ending is justly famous. Avoid the Wahlberg re-make.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>Planet of the Apes is a legendary SC-FI masterpiece, that made film history & was another smash hit for the legendary Charlton Heston and thats not all, it was followed by 4 sequels spanning across time of ape's place on the planet. Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes & Battle for the Planet of the Apes" all 5 classics boxed in one legacy collection to go ape over. The films star Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Linda Harrison, Ricardo Montalban, James Franciscus & Maurice Evans. If you're a SC-FI fan, this is must have collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This movie may not be the best in special effects, but there is something about it that makes you like it.  Charlton Heston and Roddy Macdowell do really well.  The plot is very interesting, and original.  The atmosphere the movie brings is unlike anyfilm.  The planet is like earth, but very out of this world.  See the film.  Is a must see for any adventure fan.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>It is quite a small irony that Charlton Heston (Moses) is the star of this movie.  He builds the franchise well as Taylor the self-absorbed commander reduced to animal in a cage.  He plays the role well but has plenty of help.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall (one of the most underrated actors who have been)and Maurce Evans do their best to steal the show.  (Particularly Evans who's proves the screen presence of a great stage actor cuts through any amount of makeup.  The passion and interaction of the characters as they argue their cases mirrors the arguements of the times which is one of the movie's strengths.  Well shot and quite a spectacle considering the scale of the movie.  The franchise that follows never comes to this level and the amount of parody it has spawned doesn't cut it.  But this one is a winner.  It only remains to see if the remake can match it.</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>It's all in one box.  You can not get any better than that.  All five movies are here and brought back to life with a fine transfer, excellent  sound and in widescreen as well.  As you may have heard and have read only  the first 100,000 box set editions will include the AMC original: BEHIND  THE PLANET OF THE APES, a two hour retrospective produce by and for AMC  when they hosted the showing of the remastered APES films.  The special is  more than worth the price of the box set alone.  Well produced, documented  and hosted by the late Roddy McDowall (FRIGH NIGHT), it's gives everything  you ever wanted to know about the APES movies and more.  As for the films  themselves... they still hold up.  As far as bells and whistles and extra's  - each individual DVD has little to play with.  Previews of all five films  are present on each DVD and that is about it.  It may not seem like much,  but the AMC special is worth it.  I recommend the box set, a very worth  addition to any DVD collection.  Do not let this one pass you by.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>After the total annihilation of earth I wasn't really sure where this series was going to lead. I thought the idea of three apes traveling back  in time was great. The roles of apes and humans were reversed from the  first film, but in this case they were whined and dinned, until certain  people thought that they should be eliminated. We find out at the end of  the film that Zira's baby wasn't the one that got shot but was left behind  at the circus, which obviously sets up the next picture. All in all i  thought this movie was great.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>This movie is a very good second film in the Planet of the Apes series. In this movie, the whole climax is that of total annihilation of earth. This  in itself is a great plot for a movie, but this film pulls it off great. I  did find some of the plot points confusing, like they didn't really explain  how the mutant humans came into being, maybe that was the &quot;Holy  Fallout&quot; they were talking about. Besides that, I really loved this  movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>"BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES" (1973)is the fith and final entry in the "PLANET OF THE APES" series. It is directed by J. Lee Thompson.<br /><br />  Set in flashback to the turn of the 21st Century, this sequel focuses on the ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), about ten years after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, "CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES." In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. Gorilla leader Aldo (Claude Akins), however, wants nothing to do this, as it reminds him of his former enslavement, so he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom, as do a band of mutated humans from their former city of the last film who want to reclaim Earth and destroy the entire ape society.<br /><br />  Towards the end of the movie, however, Aldo and the human mutants are overthrown. The apes and humans then decide to coexist with one another and they begin to make a new society.<br /><br />  It turns out that the story is being told by an elderly ape (the Great Lawgiver, played by John Huston) over 600 years later to a group of young humans and apes. It is left ambiguous as to whether the ape-dominated society as in seen in the first film, and the eventual destruction of Earth as seen in the second, will actually come to pass. However, as this film takes place after a nuclear war has nearly wiped out civilzation, at least one major element the first film still comes to pass.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Fox once again invites fans to go "ape" with the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of all five of the films in the "Planet of the Apes" series. The good news is that we get exceptionally good looking transfers for all five films AND we get the extended "International cut" of "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" with its original more downbeat ending. Audio sounds quite good but keep in mind that this these films were shot and released anywhere from 40 to 33 years ago so they aren't going to sound like "Transformers".<br /><br />It looks like almost all the extras from the previously released DVD boxed set released about a year and half ago EXCEPT the live action TV series and animated TV series (both of which should have been included to make this definitive even if they were in standard definition). These were included with the DVD limited edition set. We also get new featurettes on each film and its production featuring the authors of PLANET OF THE APES REVISITED book among others. Additionally, we get a couple of vintage featurettes on the production of the films, stills galleries, isolated music tracks and an excellent commentary track on "Planet of the Apes" featuring a variety of the original cast (most of whom have passed away)and crew. Sadly, the three people that would have been most important to hear on the commentary track passed away quite some time ago--director Franklin J. Schaffner, producer Arthur Jacobs and writers Rod Serling & Michael Wilson. Still, its an intelligent and informative commentary track.<br /><br />The most annoying and unnecessary extra here is the introduction by a poorly rendered CGI of "the Lawgiver" character that John Huston played in the fifth film "Battle for the Planet of the Apes". It's not that it's necessarily a BAD extra just that it is unnecessary. It is an example of a good idea at the time that clearly no one really had any idea as to how to use it effectively.<br /><br />We also get a deluxe hardcover book which has plenty of terrific looking photos (some of which have never appeared in print before)and text giving us background on the production of the films. Additionally, the cardboard fold outs of the "box" have timeline for the films, where they fit and what occurs in each. ALthough the book is nice and the packaging makes good use of all the extra cardboard, fans will probably find this a bit cumersome to store with their other DVDs or Blu-rays. Additionally, the films are held in place in the set with little pieces of clear rubber that will eventually fail allowing the discs to float around inside and become damaged. Again, this is an example of a idea that seemed good on the surface but was poor in execution. I would have preferred to have one Blu-ray holder like we saw with "Blade Runner". This box could easily have been redesigned to hold that AND the book making better use of the extra space of this boxed set.<br /><br />Overall, this is quite a nice set--the images are sharp and crisp for the films. The book is an excellent glimpse behind-the-scenes and the timeline welcome. Just the packaging for the films themselves is lacking and the box a bit too big and cumbersome.<br /><br />In "Planet of the Apes" astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew arrive on a planet where apes are the dominant species and man is a mute animal. He befriends Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell)two chimpanzees who help prevent Dr. Ziaus (Maurice Evans) from carving up Taylor to protect their society. Five stars.<br /><br />"Beneath the Planet of the Apes" has a different astronaut named Brent (James Franciscous) sent to discover what happened to Taylor and his crew. He and Taylor are caught in the middle of a war between apes and human mutants. Three stars-Working with a diminished budget Ted Post makes the best of his resources.<br /><br />"Escape from the Planet of the Apes" focuses on Cornelius (McDowell), Zira (Hunter)and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo)who travel back in time to 20th century Earth using Taylor's recovered spacecraft. They pose a threat to the future of humanity in the eyes of Dr. Hesslin (Eric Braedon). Four stars-Clever "fish-out-of-water" variation on the first film.<br /><br />"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" stars McDowell as Cornelius and Zira's son Ceasar who forments revolution. It seems a plague has wiped out cats and dogs. Humans have adopted domesticated apes into their homes as pets and servants. Four stars particularly for the "International Cut". A pity J. Lee Thompson didn't have a bigger budget to make this the epic it deserved to be.<br /><br />"Battle for the Planet of the Apes" was the last film in the series (although there was a single season TV series that also starred McDowell as well as an animated TV series both of which are NOT part of this set). Caesar rules over a city where humans are second class citizens. When a conflict with the human survivors of his war occurs, Caesar must rally humans and apes alike to fight together for their survival. 2 stars-The weakest of the film series didn't was crippled by a weak screenplay by Joyce and John William Corrington ("The Omega Man")and a nearly non-existent budget (a little over $1 million--essentially almost making this essentially a TV movie in terms of its scope).</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>20th Century Fox released the film previously on DVD by itself and in a box set with the rest of the Apes films plus a bonus DVD of extras. Now, for those who just want the first (and best) film of the series and all of the extras, Fox has released an excellent two-DVD special edition of Planet of the Apes to celebrate its 35th anniversary.<p>The DVD's extras get off to a shaky start with the two lackluster audio commentaries. The first is by legendary composer, Jerry Goldsmith, and the second by actors Roddy McDowall, Natalie Trundy, Kim Hunter and make-up artist John Chambers. Both commentaries could benefit from some extensive editing. There is way too much dead air that one has to sit through to get to the few interesting tidbits of information. The DVD producers should have edited down these commentaries to only the scenes in the movie that are actually commented on, like with the audio tracks on the Glengarry Glen Ross and The Right Stuff DVDs.<p>The text commentary by Eric Greene, author of Planet of the Apes as American Myth, redeems things by cramming a ton of interesting factoids on the screen in the form of subtitles. It's scary when the text commentary is better than both audio commentaries combined.<p>The second DVD contains the bulk of the extra material. The first section, &quot;Exploring the Apes,&quot; contains a comprehensive, two-hour documentary entitled, &quot;Behind the Planet of the Apes.&quot; Hosted by Roddy McDowall, it takes a look at the entire Apes saga from the films to the cartoon and TV series with an emphasis on the first (and best) film. Fans of the Apes films will be delighted to see all the major players from the films back for new interviews done exclusively for this documentary.<p>Also included in this section is the make-up test reel with Edward G. Robinson that convinced the 20th Century Fox brass to pony up the money for the film. There is &quot;Roddy McDowall Home Movies&quot; taken while making the first Apes movie that shows the step-by-step application of his ape make-up. There are 19 minutes of dailies and outtakes from the film.<p>There are also two vintage featurettes from 1968 and 1972 respectively. They are nothing more than superficial promos but are now fascinating time capsules of their times. Finally, there are two brief featurettes that showcase footage of directors Don Taylor and J. Lee Thompson shooting a scene from the Apes films that they worked on. These last two extras feel like unnecessary padding.<p>The &quot;Publicity&quot; section contains theatrical trailers for all of the Apes films, two glowing reviews for The Planet of the Apes and a collection of movie posters from all around the world.<p>The &quot;Galleries&quot; section features sketches by costume designer Morton Haack and a small stills gallery.<p>Finally, the &quot;Ape Phenomenon&quot; offers a brief glimpse into the vast Apes merchandising empire with a gallery of action figures. Also included is a collection of costumes and make-up from the films.<p>This new two-DVD set does justice to this landmark science fiction film. The transfer is amazing clear and free of any artifacting. The movie also hasn't sounded better with a crystal clear 5.1 surround soundtrack. While the audio commentaries are a let down, the two-hour documentary more than makes up for it. This is well worth picking up if you are a fan of the first film and want all the supplemental materials included in the box set without having to pay the extra money for the inferior sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Beneath the Planet of the Apes is the second movie in the series and my personal favorite.  Probably the darkest of all five movies, the story begins with Taylor and Nova riding through the Forbidden Zone where the first one left off.  Taylor mysteriously disappears, but Nova is able to find Brent, the only survivor of the crew sent to rescue Taylor.  After seeing Ape City, Brent and Nova go into the Forbidden Zone where they find an underground city of mutants who worship an atomic bomb as their god.  Meanwhile, the Apes are planning an attack on the Forbidden City.  The story is very good and also examines the prejudices of the Apes that are so similar to the ones of the humans they so despise.  This is not the happiest movie, especially the ending, but it is still a great movie and the ending does fit.<p> James Franciscus plays Brent, the astronaut who survives the crash, and plays it very well.  His performance is similar to that of Charlton Heston's in the first one, and at some points they even look alike.  Charlton Heston does make a brief cameo in the beginning before disappearing and then comes back in the last twenty minutes to help Brent.  Kim Hunter reprises her role of Zira while David Watson takes the role of Cornelius instead of Roddy McDowall who was busy working on a different project at the time.  Maurice Evans is great again as Dr. Zaius with James Gregory giving an excellent role as General Ursus, the leader of the armies bent on destroying anything they come across in the Forbidden Zone.  Linda Harrison is gorgeous as Nova, and she even gets to say something in this one.  Fans of the series will love this movie even if the budget was less than the first one, which is very obvious in some scenes.  The Planet of the Apes is offered on DVD but each individual film is not offered seperately.  Too bad, because these are great films.  For fans of the Ape series, check out Beneath the Planet of the Apes!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>Following the cataclysmic finale of Beneath the Planet of the Apes, there was only one logical direction for the series to go---> back to the future.  The result is an illogically conceived and satirical prequel that will amuse and delight and ultimately devastate with its bleak Shakesperean tragedy.<br /><br />When Taylor's spacecraft unexpectedly splashes down in 1973 and is retrieved by a military envoy, the three astronauts that emerge from the capsule are not revealed to be Taylor, Landon and Dodge, but rather the astonishing simian ape-o-nauts Cornelius, Zira and Milo... the third of which is a completely disposeable character who is appropriately killed off very early by a caged zoo gorilla who was probably jealous that the talking simian chimpanzees were getting all of the attention.  With Milo out of the picture, the story focuses on the relationship between Cornelius and Zira in ways that were not afforded the opportunity in the two previous films and is filled with tongue-in-cheek episodes inspired by Pierre Boulle's original novel as Cornelius and Zira go around "aping" 20th century human culture (a subtle and clever mockery of our own) in an attempt to make themselves fit in to our society.<br /><br />While Cornelius and Zira make themselves at home as cultural "celebrities" they are being carefully monitored under the watchful auspices of the nefarious Dr. Otto Hasslein played by recognizable character actor Eric Braeden (of Young and the Restless fame) who listens with great interest to what the talking chimps have to say about where they came from during a Presidential Inquiry and how they managed to arrive in Taylor's spacecraft as Cornelius explains that it landed on their seaboard and was repaired by Milo -- an implausibility which is the film's glaring continuity error since Taylor's spacecraft immediately sunk into the depths of the Forbidden Zone it is a far fetched conclusion that they somehow managed to not only find, retrieve and repair it (even if they had repaired Astronaut Brent's crashed spacecraft from Beneath) with engineering far in advance of their own intellectual ape intelligence (which Milo only "half-understood" as Cornelius describes it) but managed to do so and escape within a very small window of time before the planet was obliterated by the shockwave of destruction catapulting them backwards in time and arriving at roughly the same destination and era as Taylor's original point of departure (it could be argued that these narrative discrepancies support the theory of "Hasslein's Observed Time Curve" which suggests that a predestination paradox created alternate intersecting timelines as illustrated by the incongruent timeline of events that occur between Conquest and Battle).  Nevertheless, once you get past the narrative gaps and just go with it, Escape is a fun and dramatically intense film but is my least favorite second only to the weakest link in the evolutionary Apes chain; Battle For The Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />When Zira announces that she is pregnant, the film takes a dark and conspiratorial turn when the government realizes the consequence a race of intelligent talking apes will have on the future of our human civilization.  In an effort to protect their newborn (the ape who would become Caesar), Cornelius and Zira find refuge with Armando, a sideshow circus entertainer played by the extravagant Ricardo Montalban who gladly welcomes the simian family with open arms, but it isn't long before Dr. Hasslein picks up the fugitives' trail and hunts them down in a tragic and inevitable climax that sets up the paradox of the entire Planet of the Apes chronology.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>This sci-fi movie has something unique- no special effects but it is a classic. A testiment to this are the numerous follow-up movies and the recent remake. If you have not seen it you must even if youare not a sci-fi fun. The story is unique and actually very anti-war and potrays a  (remote) posible future of mankind.  The casting and directing are excellent. See it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>Adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 French novel, director Franklin Schaffner's Planet of the Apes stars Charlton Heston as a "spaceman" named Taylor, who, along with two other astronauts, finds himself on a mysterious planet run by intellectual apes. After eventually escaping the confines of the apes' prison, which still holds one of his earthly companions captive (the other is the local museum's latest addition), he ventures out into the planet's uncharted parts, where he makes a dire discovery that will make your stomach churn.<br /><br />Planet of the Apes is a time-standing masterpiece of sociological complexities that gleams with on-screen beauty, lavish sets, brilliant costumes (which garnered an Oscar nod in '69), and enough action to appease a popcorn-movie hound. It is considered a vital piece of the sci-fi movement and preceded four sequels and a remake in 2001, none of which compares to its ingenuity. Still, none of the aforementioned qualities amount to its mind-blowing conclusion, one of the most eerie endings in film history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Following the rise of the apes and some sort of man-made catastrophe (probably nuclear war) a community of apes and humans live together in peace. It's the evil human survivors of the nuclear war who still live in New York City who have an issue with the situation and all sorts of hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Probably the weakest film in the series it is also the one that really requires the viewer to have a strong grasp of what went on in the other movies, especially Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Still, it IS good sci-fi!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the fifth movie in the PLANET OF THE APES series. It's a decent movie, but could have been much better with a bigger budget.<p>The movie takes place several years after the ape revolt and after mankind has almost destroyed itself by nuking cities around the world. Caesar has established an ape city several miles outside of what was once New York City. In Ape City, apes and men coexist but not as equals. Men are subservient to apes and Caesar says it will stay that way until he can trust the "race of man", not just a few individual humans. The climax of the film occurs when mutants attack Ape City in an attempt to restablish human supremacy.<p>The movie itself is an average 1970s film. The movie illustrates how the apes were just as destructive as humans. However, this latest edition of BATTLE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES tries to rewrite the Apes mythos by leaving out a crucial scene. This version of the film leaves out the scene where the remaining mutants begin worshiping the Doomsday Bomb that destroys the world at the end of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. This version of the movie ends with a scene of The Lawgiver teaching to a group of ape and human children leaving the viewer believing that history had been changed, when in actuallity it had not.<p>Overall, an average movie, but the weakest of the APES movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>People often ask me what my favorite movies are, which is never an easy question, but what remains even harder is listening to their pondering one of my answers with the question, &quot;Why is that one of them?&quot; Such is the case with &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; the 1968 classic science fiction film that has become a milestone in moviemaking. As I am not an avid fan of the genre, it bewilders people to learn that such a film ranks so highly in my opinion. But this is no ordinary science fiction film we're talking about, either. <p>Despite numerous sequels, a short-lived television series, and a modern reenvisioning of the film that might as well be a different movie all its own, the first and most appealing &quot;Apes&quot; film captures everything that is great about film in a single two hours of pure, unmitigated brilliance. From its psychedelic opening sequence to the final, hard-hitting shot, the movie works a silent spell on its audience that remains with the mind long after the experience has ended. It's nuanced plot provokes thought and consideration, and its smart sense of reversal is simply stunning. <p>The movie is based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, beginning with astronaut Colonel George Taylor making preparations for a sleep that, to him and the other three members of his crew, will last a few mere hours as their space ship travels thousands of light years into space, leaving Earth behind for a new planet on which to begin a new civilization. They soon find themselves on a barren, seemingly uninhabited planet, with the sole female of the crew deceased and three days supply of food and water for the remaining three astronauts. <p>Their trek across the desert terrain leads them to an oasis, flowing with fresh water and inhabited by humans, who are seized and taken as prisoners by the dominant apes that rule the planet. Taylor is also captured, taken to their colony, where he discovers that apes have taken on the role of Earthly humans, and humans are the lesser species. He makes impressions on all who encounter him, from Dr Zira (Kim Hunter), the animal researcher who is perplexed by his intelligence and speech capabilities, to the high council, whose ignorance causes them extreme fear in the face of the new arrival. <p>But rather than just provide simple answers to the question of where Taylor has landed, the film examines more thought-provoking issues, from the harsh treatment and prejudice of the humans by the apes, to the ways in which science is viewed by the apes, whose government and belief system are much like that of humans on Earth. Dr. Zira and her fiance, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), provide arguments for the existence of Taylor on their planet that also carry small clues as to what the movie is building up to, while also enforcing the film's theme of ignorance in the assembly's unwillingness to accept their theories.  <p>As we try to decipher the many twists and clues provided us by the characters, the movie is at work diverting us from the big picture, keeping us at bay. Even still, it is the film's final shot that remains the most effective, and sells the film on everything its plot argues. It's a revelation that makes clear all that we have been pondering during the course of the story, but it is also a cold look at the possible future that lies ahead if man continues on his current path. This warning is no less meaningful today as it was then, and it proves that &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is one of the most effective science fictions films ever made. <p>The casting department scored big points in acquiring Charlton Heston for the lead role. As Taylor, Heston is the actor we have come to know and love, hitting us with a performance full of power and true emotion, something many actors of today fail to possess. Heston successfully conveys the wide variety of emotions needed to pull his character off. <p>It must also be said that this is one of the most visually arresting films ever made. The opening shots just before the craft crashes into the sea are complex and mind-blowing, setting up the tone of unease that will palpitate throughout the film. The setting fits the material entirely, evoking the harshness of the planet with its parched desert and dry, arid appearance. <p>To call &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; a strictly science fiction film is unjust, as there is more to its story. There is a meaningful lesson to be learned from its unfolding events, which carry with them universal truths that will remain recognizable by the future generations who see it. Its production and cast are remarkable, but what remains its most effective aspect is its ability to mystify the audience, leading us to believe one thing until we realize its something entirely different.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>I decided to buy this movie more or less for a change. I don't usually watch or like movies which are older than I am, but this is one of the  exceptions. I had never actually seen the whole movie, just bits and pieces  every once in awhile, plus the film is such a huge part of popular culture  I was already familiar with the whole story. After seeing it in full I  can't help but love it. Sure the acting is sappy, but its a thirty years  old. I thought Fox did a great job with this dvd version. The picture is  crisp and clear, plus most of the sound throughout the film is very good  and not choppy, which is often rare with films of this age.<p>I won't get  into telling the whole story, as many other reviewers have done so already.  For me though the story was very intriguing and I really got into the  movie, plus, this film has one of the best endings that I have ever seen,  if only more films ended like that :) Anyways, if you haven't seen this  movie ever, or in a long time, I recommend picking up this DVD release, it  won't get any better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>when i was a young kid a was not a big fan now i love this series.  all of the original movies.  there is also a special disk for behind the scenes.  a box set to get for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I've always liked movies and try to see as many as I could. I remember in the early 70s a movie called "Planet of the Apes" came out and was highly regarded by some critics. Well, the whole premise was just nonsense any way you looked at it. But it seemed to get high marks and even won an Oscar. Well, who knows what will win an Oscar. In any case, it was a highly acclaimed science fiction movie and had a lot of followup movies. Go figure.<br /><br />Well, I spotted "Planet of the Apes" on the 5-dollar Wal-Mart bargain rack and dropped it into the cart. Last night I viewed it. Just as I figured in the early 70s, this thing was just pure nonsense in every way. The setting didn't look like another planet at all. It looked like the Colorado Plateau and the "lake" was one of the large reservoirs. Trust me.The story was more of a comedy than serious science fiction. Well, I'm probably too critical and it was rather entertaining viewing. Nonsense, but entertaining nonsense I suppose you might say.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is the third in the series, but it jumps back in time by about 2,000 years. Not too surprising when you remember that the last movie ended with the Doomsday Bomb. We did not learn until the start of this movie that Zira (Kim Hunter), Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) had retrieved Taylor's space ship from the lake he had originally landed in, repaired it, and escaped just before the planet blew up. They land in the US circa 1973, and of course astonish everyone with their ability to talk, and their civilized ways.<br /><br />But things are not all just diplomatic receptions and amusements. One doctor, an adviser to the president, gets Zira drunk and gets her talking about their lives in the distant future, and concludes that he must alter the future by not allowing the child that Zira is going to have to survive. This sets up a chase and rescue plot line that leads to a circus run by Ricaldo Montelbaum. Toward the end, Zira mentions that she only learned to trust three people in the time they were there. Presumably these were the two doctors from the zoo to which they were first taken, and Montelbaum.<br /><br />What's fun about this movie is that it completely reverses the focus of the first two. There, apes were everywhere and only a very few humans could talk. Here, humans are everywhere and only three (two, once Dr. Milo is killed by a gorilla) are able to talk. One of my favorite scenes is watching Cornelius and Zira get outfitted in top fashion clothing, apparently from Rodeo Drive.<br /><br />Just in case there are two or three people out there who have not seen the whole series, I am not going to tell you the ending, and how it sets up the next film's plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>The first film is BY FAR the best of the lot, but the other films are fun to watch nonetheless.

Each was different and had a central theme to it. this ones theme is more of a straight continuation of the first movie and it succeeds; but to be honest it's not near as good as the first one but then that was something altogether new!. Still it's got alot of cool stuff going on here and the ulitmate seventies disaster doom ending. Which was a strange thing to do , as they could have kept the story alive in that time! But it allowed them to create a really good drama in the next one. The blu ray looks great on this one and the others too and I have them all so I should know!

The first one was the best, hands-down, but unlike so many sequels today which turn out to be complete swill, the four sequels are all fun and interesting on their own.<br /><br />The case itself looks nice, with the logo and the ape picture on it.

That's the end of the saga and the beginning of the myth. The strangest thing in it is that it is in a way the sequel of what precedes but since it is supposed to be what precedes what was shown at the beginning there is a gap that is un-understandable. It ends with apes and humans being equal and living together but in the first film, one thousand years later the humans had run wild, had lost the power to speak and were nothing but fun game for the apes or decoys for the gorilla ape army. In other words the loop does not close, we are missing one link, and a big one. Too bad this series of five films will have no extra episode to explain the shift. There sure is a remake but that is for tomorrow. Why has that film, or those films had such a tremendous success since the Planet of the Apes has become a sibylline and enigmatic motto in the minds of those who believe in the regression of man and in the progress of all animal species? It probably has to do with the period when it was done, the last 7-8 years of the Vietnam war, the time of the near impeachment and final resignation of a President, the Watergate scandal, the doubt and the uncertainty of a giant that had let's say transit problems and could not find the proper coal to pacify it. The questions are serious but the treatment of them is simple, direct, understandable even by children. It is a series of film done for families and that could be enjoyed, including in its simple humane principles, without real heavy discussion or thinking. Simple principles of liberty, equality, pursuit of happiness, and life. Simple principles and objectives like education and science and trust. And those who did not like the symbolism of the apes could not even derisively laugh at it because then they would appear narrow minded and bigoted. So they can only make it into a motto that is at least double entendre and has at least double meaning. "That's like in the Planet of the Apes", with a sneer or a smile, a giggle or a laugh and a big slap in the back or a tap on the shoulder, and everyone gets the meaning they want in the catchphrase, punch line or rebuttal without ever really knowing what is the meaning the person who uttered the sentence actually wanted to mean. That's why it is interesting to watch these films again because they are the lasting testimony to a past period in history and because they are still rather arcane and inscrutable. Enjoy this last episode before the remake, and if you have patience get the DVD of extras and watch them all. 126 minutes of documentary.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>After the success of the first two APE movies, ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES was unleashed.

These odd folks have psychic abilities and a "god" that looks all too familiar and is definitely dangerous!

Now, Taylor is with his mate Nova when he mysteriousely disappears. Nova somehow manages to find Brent, another astronaut who crashlanded onto earth. Together Nova and Brent go on a search to find Taylor.<br /><br />This movie has a lot of action and has great acting. I enjoyed watching the original Planet of the Apes much less this one. More apes chasing humans and all that. The ending is also pretty good. I was pretty impressed with this movie. If you enjoyed the original, I definitely recommend this to you!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>Now it's the apes who can talk in a human society as three of them fly to the United States from Earth's far future.<br /><br />An interesting story, it uses the only two likeable characters from Ape City to deal with humanity. Lots of laughs and social barbs but not one of the best of the series. The plot device that gets the apes to the past is pretty weak too. A must-see though, if you've watched the other movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>The second film in the Planet of the Apes series is a reasonable sequel, but really lacking most of the originals zest and panache. Charlton Heston briefly reprises his role as Taylor, and in fact the opening to the film, is a reprise of the ending of the original, which is the best bit of the film. Heston reappears in the last 15 mins as well.<br /><br />With the surprise element lost (because of the ending of the first film), the sequel is mostly formulaic and limited to occasional good scenes. But none have the impact of Hestons first words to the Apes, or the impact of finding the Statue of Liberty on the beach in the original film.<br /><br />The special effects retain the same high standards as the first film for the apes, but the matt paintings used in the underground scenes now look obvious and dated. Brent as played by James Franciscus is effectively a Charlton Heston/Taylor look-a-like except he doesn't have the screen prescence that Heston brought to the Taylor role.<br /><br />So overall this is a decent film. Its a lot better than some of the later sequels, but not a patch on the original. Buy if cheap, or get it in the boxed set of 'Ape' films if the price is right.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>This movie is a social/political satire of the human race, transferred to a planet of apes.

The primitive mute humans are just...well, animals.<br /><br /> Charlton Heston and crew crash land on the planet, and are captured by the apes. Heston befriends a pair of chimpanzee scientists who eventually help him escape from captivity.<br /><br /> One detail easily missed is during the trial of the chimpanzees by the orangutans, when the 3 orangutans cover their eyes, ears and mouth in the classic &quot;see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil&quot; when they are being told things they do not agree with.<br /><br /> Whether you like the movie or not, the ending scene of the movie is one of the best in the history of cinema.<br /><br /> The DVD has numerous extras, but in fact all three commentaries are hugely disappointing as they are quite sparse, and much of it is repeated verbatim in the included and good 2-hr documentary about the movie and all the sequels.<br /><br /> Spectacular scenery, oscar-winning makeup, great score, great story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Not as good as the first and the only one in the series that did not have Roddy McDowell.

Nevertheless the original still resonates in ways that even now does not lose power after multiple viewings.  Director Franklin Schaffner took a literate script from Rod Serling, who in turn adapted the monkey planet tale from Pierre Boulle, and brought to the screen a world turned upside down.  In both the novel and the script, an astronaut (Charlton Heston) crashes his spacecraft on a world that he believes lies hundreds of light years from earth only to discover that it is apes who rule and human beings who serve.  The plot, which details Heston's attempt to understand how this monkey ruling society could have evolved, allows Director Franklin both to entertain and to instruct.  The entertaining aspect is connected to an often biting and humorous didacticism that pokes a not so gentle thrust at an anti-war, post-hippie society that was contemporary with the film's release date of 1968.  The tri-part ape society of gorilla, chimpanzee, and monkey correspond to the pro-war military, the educated elite, and the silent majority respectively.  Just as human society was rent by internal dissent during the Vietnam War so is simian society equally divisive due to the heavy handed way the gorillas run roughshod over the chimps and monkeys.  The impact of PLANET OF THE APES inheres in a very nearly seamless melding of sight to sound.  At the start of the film, Heston and two other earth astronauts are forced to wander this new world and are greeted first by an inhospitable desert, then by thieving humans, and then finally by brute gorillas who round up the humans in images of white slave catchers recapturing runaway black slaves.  The scene involving the imprisoning of the humans still shocks in intensity, even after more than three decades.  Later, other and similar scenes set up the beach finale that indicates at what point human society began to wither and simian society began to be ascendant.  Much of the dialogue is rife with irony and wit that when spoken by apes about humans richly suggests the folly of ethnic egotism that is apparently not limited to humans alone.  <p>Heston's supporting cast is capable and even classically trained.  Maurice Evans as the ape leader mouths platitudes with the certainty of a wounded Lear as he tries mightily to grasp why his own kind are taking the side of the humans.  Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter are kindly scientists who can see that Heston is far more than the mutated freak that the gorilla leaders hold him to be.  And then there is the obligatory piece of female eye candy, fetchingly played by Linda Harrison, as Heston's love interest.  What PLANET OF THE APES points out is that if our contemporary human society suffers from mutually assured destruction, then the survivors may be indistinguishable from the brutish laws of a future ruling simian one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, tells the story of an astronaut named Taylor (played by Charlton Heston), who lands on a planet where talking apes rule and human beings are mute savages.  Taylor struggles to survive and uncover the secrets of this strange world.<p>POTA is truly one of the seminal classics of sci-fi cinema: it gave birth to a genuine franchise (sequels, TV series, a high profile remake, etc.).  But the film truly stands on its own as a complete and compelling piece of art.  It's a rousing blend of sci-fi adventure and social satire, supported by an intelligent script and superb performances.  It's full of iconic images and unforgettable lines.<p>Every element in the film is crafted with care and intelligence: costume design, sets, etc.  The stunning visuals are perfectly complemented by Jerry Goldsmith's eerie, unearthly score.  All these elements come together to create a world both oddly familiar and truly alien.<p>Heston is perfect as the sarcastic, misanthropic Taylor, who wonders if something better than man exists in the universe.  He has great chemistry with his &quot;simianized&quot; costars; his verbal sparring with Maurice Evans (as imperious orangutan Dr. Zaius) has real bite.  Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter provide the film's warm heart as chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira.<p>POTA is a true classic: one of those films you can watch again and again, savoring every memorable moment.  The film offers memorable perspectives on science, religion, authoritarianism, the nature of humankind, and the quest for truth.  After all these years, POTA still packs a real punch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>Originally intended as a project for Blake Edwards, the film version of Pierre Boulle's semisatric sci-fi novel came to the screen in 1968 under the directorial guidance of Franklin J. Schaffner. Charlton Heston is George Taylor, one of several astronauts on a long, long space mission whose spaceship crashlands on a remote planet, seemingly devoid of intelligent life. Soon the astronaut learns that this planet is ruled by a race of talking, thinking, reasoning apes who hold court over a complex multilayered civilization. In this topsy-turvy society, the human beings are grunting, inarticulate primates, penned-up like animals. When ape leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) discovers that the captive Taylor has the power of speech, he reacts in horror and insists that the astronaut be killed. But sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) risk their lives to protect Taylor--at to discover the secret of their planet's history that Dr. Zaius and his minions guard so jealously. In the end, it is Taylor who stumbles on the truth of the Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />  Scripted by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, "PLANET OF THE APES" has gone on to be an all-time sci-fi classic. It won a special Academy Award for John Chambers' convincing simian makeup. It spawned four successful sequels, as well as two TV series, one live-action and one animated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>"CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES" is the third sequel to the 1968 science fiction film "PLANET OF THE APES". It continues the exploration of the fictional future history of mankind set out in the previous film, "ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES," and considered to be the most violent of the Ape sequels. The film is directed by J. Lee Thompson.<br /><br />  Building upon the description given by Cornelius and Zira before the Presidential Committee in the previous film, a terrible disease has killed off the world's cats and dogs, leaving humans with no animals to keep as pets, except apes. In time, humans notice the apes' capacity to learn and adapt, thus they are taught to perform menial household tasks. By the year 1991, human society has become a sterile and more oppressive culture, with apes enslaved by humans.<br /><br />  Armando (played by Ricardo Montalban) and his ape Milo, visit Central City where Armando details how the apes became enslaved. He also warns the young chimpanzee to be careful in the city, should anyone find out he is the offspring of the two intelligent apes from the future, it would to lead to their deaths. As they walk through the streets of the city and are disgusted by witnessing the apes cleaning streets and delivering packages, witnessing the atrocities done to the apes when they don't comply. Seeing and ape beaten and drugged, Milo shouts "Lousy human bastard!" Armando quickly tries to take responsilbilty by explaining to security that it was he that shouted. As the crowd around them get agitated, Milo runs away, followed by Armando.<br /><br />  Hiding in a stairway, Armando says that he will go to the authorities and try to smooth things over by bluffing his way out of the trouble they're in, explaining that his ape had escaped. In the meantime, Milo must hide among his own kind, among the apes that are being trained for slavery. He goes through the violent conditioning process and is sold to Governor Breck. Breck, knowing only the ape's assigned number, uses and old family method to give him a name: taking out a dictionary, he allows the ape to flip through it, thereby naming himself. Milo's finger comes to rest on "Caesar". So christened, Caesar is then put to work by Breck's subordinate MacDonald, a descendant of slaves himself, making him sympathetic towards the apes.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, Armando is being interrogated by the authorities who believe the circus ape may be the offspring of the two evolved apes from the future. Putting him in a machine that forces people to tell the truth. Rather than being forced to tell the truth, Armando throws himself out of a window, resulting in his death. Seeing the death of his father figure, the only human he loved, Caesar loses faith in human kindness and begins to plot and ape rebellion.<br /><br />  Caesar secretly teaches the other apes the art of combat (although orangutangs are not seen fighting or even with the rest of the apes), as well as having them gather weapons such as knives, guns, flame throwers and grenades. However, at this time, Breck discovers that the manifest of the vessel that delivered Caesar lists no chimpanzee aboard. Suspecting that Caesar may be the ape the authorities have been looking for, Breck brings Caesar in and connects him to a torture machine, forcing Caesar to speak. Once he does, Breck has the machine turned full power killing Caesar, or so they think. MacDonald has tampered with the machine, secretly allowing the ape to live and return to the rebellion.<br /><br />  Caesar leads and ape revolt on Central City against their human keepers. The apes riot against the human forces and emerge victorious. Caesar has Breck marched out, planning to execute him. MacDonald appeals to Caesar's humanity to show mercy on his former persecutor. Caesar doesn't listen, and in a rage, details how from this point on, apes everywhere will repeat what has happened in Central City, dominating the Earth after the downfall of human civilzation, and instructing apes enslave the humans that are left. Caesar immediately rethinks his position and orders the apes to put down their weapons. "If it is man's destiny to be dominated, then it is God's will that he be dominated with compassion and understanding," says Caesar. The humans' slavery of the apes comes to an end, and the world has seen the birth of the Planet of the Apes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>The preceding film, "BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES", ends with a nuclear weapon destroying all life on the apes' future Earth.<br /><br />  "ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES" begins by establishing that three apes (Cornelius, Zira, and Dr. Milo, played resepctively by Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Sal Mineo) escaped Earth's destruction. They have managed this by repairing astronaut Taylor's spaceship(which crashed in the first movie) and piloting it through the same rift in time that took the astronauts forward in time from the 20th Century to the 40th. This is a retcon from the previous movie, in which it was a combination of the rift and time spent in suspended animation that allowed the astronauts to survive in the interim centuries.<br /><br />  The apes arrive on present-day Earth, splashing down on the Pacific coast. The Navy hauls the ship to the beach, and the apes remove their helmets. They are quickly transported to seclusion for examination and are later moved to a secluded are of the Los Angeles Zoo. Milo is killed by a mean-spirited gorilla agitated by an argument, leaving the two remaining apes under the observation of two scientists, Stephanie and Lewis. Both discover the apes' power of speech. The apes then are brought before the Presidential Commission, where they reveal publicly their ability to speak, and are welcomed as guests.<br /><br />  The apes at first become celebrities, but they are soon watched by a scientist, futuristic consutlant Dr. Otto Hasslein (Eric Braeden), who discovers Zira is pregnant and fears for the future of the human race. He is determined to force the issue, gets Zira drunk to get information out of her, and convinces the Commission to have the apes taken for proper questioning. Both are questioned under numerous means, and Hasslein learns for himself how the human race will eventually meet its downfall and be dominated by simians, and will eventually lead to Earth's destruction.<br /><br />  The government and the U.S. President order that the unborn child's birth be "prevented" and that both be sterilized, though Hasslein prefers they die. But after the ape Cornelius kills and orderly while imprisoned (the orderly teased Zira), Hasslein uses it as an illustration of the future danger the apes present, thus calling for the apes' murder. Running for their lives, Cornelius and Zira (assisted by Stephanie and Lewis) find shelter in a circus run by Armando (Ricardo Montalban), and there Zira gives birth to a son whom she names Milo.<br /><br />  Hasslein, knowing Zira will imminently give birth, orders a search of all circuses and zoos. As a result, Armando must let the apes go. The drama climaxes aboard a derelict ship in an abandoned shipyard. Hasslein tracks the apes down. He shoots down both Zira and the infant ape she carries. Cornelius and Hasslein end up in a shootout. Cornelius kills Hasslein, and in retaliation a police officer returns fire and shoots Cornelius in the heart. Stephanie and Lewis watch in horror as Cornelius gasps a final breath before falling three stories. Then Zira tosses the baby over the side of the ship before crawling to lay with her husband.<br /><br />  The survivors, however, are unaware of the real fate of the infant ape; Cornelius, Zira, and Armando switched babies before their final escape. Armando now watches over the infant Milo, who will grow up to become Caesar, the main character in the third and fourth sequels, "CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES" and "BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES". The film ends by showing the baby Milo sitting in a cage, plaintively speaking the words "Mama? Mama?" with the voice of a human child.<br /><br />  Trivia: (1)The ending of this film was purposefully written so that the writers would have something to work with, in case Fox wanted another sequel.(2)This movie marks the first appearance of Dr. Otto Hasslein. The character was referred to in both previous "PLANET OF THE APES" movies, but was never seen until this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>Some after the events of the first 'PLANET OF THE APES', the climax of which is repeated frame for frame at the beginning of this sequel, another set of astronauts arrive on the far-future Earth that is the titular planet. This time it's Brent (James Franciscus) who survives the crash landing and learns that evolved simians have taken over the wolrd, post-apocalypse. After hooking up with Nova (Linda Harrison), the mute, fur bikini-clad beauty who spent the first film being squired by astronaut Taylor(Charlton Heston), Brent confers with Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson), the ape scientists whose adherence to scientific principles makes them friendly to the possibility of intelligent human life. Something of a military coup has taken place among the apes, who dispatch an army to the desolate "Forbidden Zone" where Taylor has coincidentally disappeared. With the apes and the humans both rooting about in the ruins of 20th Century civilization, it's only a matter of time before they all find out what happened to the other survivors of the nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />  Trivia (from imdb.com):(1)The only film in the original series of five that does not star Roddy McDowall. Roddy McDowall was unable to appear in this film because he was commited to another project. He can, however, be spotted briefly in the opening dialogue, even though another actor playes the role of Cornelius later in the film. McDowall is often pictured on video and DVD packaging for this film.(2)James Franciscus was cast as Brent due to his resemblance to Charlton Heston.(3)This was the first appearance of Natalie Trundy in the "Apes" series.

Most become trekkies and Star Wars fanatics, and all those schmucks can have their Jean-Luc Picard cheesewheels, coz I'm a proud member of the Planet Of The Apes camp.  And I'm not monkeying around!  I absolutely love these films and have almost all my life.  Sure, as the sequels go on it tends to get a bit corny(especially when J. Lee Thompson takes over), but never becomes a joke.  The first one just can't be surpassed, but the second is a great followup and pretty damn dark.  Who as a kid wasn't creeped out by the telepathic humans even before they removed their masks?  Escape's concept seems like a bit of a stretch( like the apes could have salvaged Heston's ship from 300 feet of water and repaired it.  How the hell did they even know where it was?).  It also starts changing the rules that were established in the first film(the whole existence and downfall of intelligent man was kept a secret from the ape society, yet in this film it's common knowledge.  There's even an ape holiday like the 4th of July celebrating the apes' independence from humans.  This contradicts the first film and takes away from the corruption, paranoia and mystery of Zaius' charcater.  It's still a cool film that flipflops good guys and bad guys and has one hell of a downer ending.  By Conquest  it becomes a little easier to chuckle at the films, though it's still cool as hell.  Same goes for Battle.  The dates tend to get mixed up a bit too after the first film.  The rescue mission sent to find Heston lands about thirty years before Heston's landing in the first film!  I'm getting all nitpicky, but the fact is that these things are quite easy to overlook and are rather forgettable.  The documentary is a great two hour film that covers almost everything you wanted to know.  It's bizarre to think that up until Conquest they were trying to make "family" pictures and they all received G ratings(Conquest received a PG coz of some bloodless gun battles that were considered nonstop gore).  It's cool to think that in those days, seeing a guy killed by machine gun spray, talk of mating and castration, swear words, bare buttocks and skinless mutants were acceptable family entertainment.  This is a good set with a great treatment given to the films.  If you've got your eye on the big ape head set, let me offer some advice.  It's actually cheaper to buy all three sets individually if you find them for a decent price.  That way each disc is in it's own keepcase(which I prefer personally), and you don't have to feel like a schmuck with that rotten Tim Burton film sitting in your home.  I guess it's all a question of if you want the big head or not, which does look cool.

BUT it does improve the movie considerably.  This isn't incidental cutting-room footage, but rather very integral material that is vital to the entire "POTA" story arc.  I won't spoil any potential surprise if you haven't seen or heard about the restored footage, but it deals with the mutant humans and the doomsday bomb.  I can't imagine why this material was ever cut from the theatrical presentation!<br /><br />As for the rest of the set, well the real reason to upgrade is the 16:9 transfers and the 5.1 Dolby Digital mixes that the sequels all have.  You can get the extended "Battle for..." separately if the better transfers and mixes aren't essential for you.  But if you look at the cost of the individual "Battle" disc and the cost of buying this new "Legacy" box, you might want to just take the plunge.<br /><br />I love the Apes series, but I balked at the Ape-head mega set.  I HATE the Tim Burton doo-doo version.  I already have the live-action TV series.  Originally there were plans to make the animated series available separately, but that release was pulled.  I've never seen the cartoon series, maybe someday they will release it on it's own.  The Ape-head package looked sweet, but for the cost I'm fine with the upgraded films in the Legacy box.<br /><br />I just wish they had produced a new documentary, the "Behind the POTA" has been reissued to DEATH (even though it is good, enough's enough!  Who (that actually wants it) doesn't have this release in some form by now??).</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>This is one of Charlton Heston's last great performances. The film, though filled with action, also has an intelligence to it, and a slow, methodical style that is characteristic of the good science fiction movies of the era that ended with Star Trek II. Space explorers crash-land on an unknown planet, struggle to find food and water, and then encounter a band of mute humans, and then the dominant species on the planet: apes. It was a mirror to race relations in the 1960s, and also a reflection of the clash between scientific and religious thought on the origin of our species, and finally also a speculative tale of man's own fate, should mankind not master the worst parts of its nature.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>After the spellbinding revelation of the original Planet of the Apes, the sequel (and subsequent sequels in the landmark series) seemed critically doomed to suffer from substandard mediocrity in the wake of its apocalyptic aftermath, yet Beneath the Planet of the Apes endures as one of the most reverent science fiction films among faithful fans of the series.  A seriously flawed, yet brilliantly misunderstood masterpiece that remains as an important testament to behold. What could not be topped by Planet of the Apes' unsurpassable climax, could only be subverted by going beneath it... literally.<br /><br />After Charlton Heston compromised with producers to only briefly reprise his role as Taylor in the sequel, James Franciscus takes the lead as Astronaut Brent.  While Franciscus gives a very strong and worthwhile performance, his character still suffers at the expense of being a poor-man's Taylor.  The first half of the film reiterates a lot of the exposition of the first film to bring Brent's character up to speed as he travels with the beautiful Linda Harrison as the mute slave Nova into the Forbidden Zone to find Taylor who mysteriously vanished into a mirage at the beginning of the film.  As Brent and Nova begin their descent beneath the subterranean caverns of a post-apocalyptic city, the film takes a much darker and cerebral turn that is both disturbingly bizarre and brutally nihilistic.  Brent, while under the telepathic mind-control of the under-dwelling society of mutated humans, shockingly tries to kill innocent Nova... twice.  The malevolent Mutants reveal themselves to be a cult of hideously deformed worshippers of an atomic bomb who give praise to its awesome destructive power at an eerie mass in their tabernacle as they prepare for the inevitable confrontation against the surface-dwelling Simians who have ruled over the planet ever since it was ravaged by the inferno of nuclear holocaust two millenia prior and the final battle for control of the Planet of the Apes will be determined by its prophetic Earth-shattering outcome.<br /><br />Beneath the Planet of the Apes detonates with a shockwave of suspense that reached its apotheosis at the end of the first film and radiates unstoppably towards an inexorable conclusion at the end of the second. A brilliantly twisted and hauntingly cerebral sequel which may have proven itself to have been too intense and intellectual for its G-rated audience who were simply engrossed by the film's adventurous fantasy and captivated by the ape-like wonder of its characters.  It would be almost impossible today for a major studio to gamble on making what was considered to be a franchise-killing installment because of its powerfully subversive imagery and socio-political narrative which ironically gives Beneath its characteristically unique dynamic not only as a worthy and important follow-up to its classic predescessor, but a relevant and enduring testament of historic science fiction cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>ESCAPE... set up, with wit and cleverness, this very good sequel, which delivers on the promise of Planet I and Planet III.  We actually experience the development of the apes as members of society, and the screenplay  handles deftly and with outlandish, bold strokes, both racial and societal  issues.  It is colorful, interesting and features once again the delightful  Roddy McDowall as Caesar, son of Cornelius and Zira.  As a teenager, I was  captivated by this story, and this movie turned my world upside down.  As  sequels go, this one stands up on its own: with a new vantage point, the  original story provides more than enough steam to let this story cook all  by itself.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / BD+ / Seamless branching / High Profile 4.1<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />Disc size: 36,66 GB<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3060 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3060 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  2560 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 2560 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Mandarin / Cantonese / Korean / Spanish / French<br />Number of chapters: 21<br /><br />Version: Unrated<br />Running time: 1:27:22<br />Movie size: 23,39 GB<br />Total bit rate: 35.69 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.10 Mbps<br /><br />Version: Theatrical<br />Running time: 1:26:41<br />Movie size: 23,20 GB<br />Total bit rate: 35.69 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.12 Mbps<br /><br />#Featurette: From Riots to Revolution (HD - 21 minutes)<br />#A Look Behind the 'Planet of the Apes' (1972) (SD - 13m:42s)<br />#J.

To protect her child from human treachery, the baby chimpanzee was switched with a normal zoo chimp by his mother, and grew up under the protection of his benevolent human master Armando, the extravagant sideshow circus entertainer ironically played by Ricardo Montalban from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  Having been given a taste of freedom by the compassionate Armando, the talking simian chimpanzee Caesar (played by Roddy McDowall who had the unique opportunity to play the son of his character Cornelius) becomes disillusioned when Armando brings him into the city only to learn that his ape brothers and sisters have become "domesticated" after a plague brought back from space in the year 1983 wiped out every dog and cat on the planet.  Because of their adept intelligence and human-like faculties,  the apes quickly became trained to serve their "superior" human masters.  In 1991, human civilization is controlled by an oppressive authoritarian government fearful that a race of talking apes will inevitably rise up and destroy human civilization as foretold by the arrival of Cornelius and Zira.<br /><br />Now the apes have supplanted humans as working class slaves distinguished by the two dominant ape species... the smarter chimpanzees wearing green worker overalls and the stronger and more aggressive gorillas in red, not unlike the delineation between white and blue collar human laborers.  When Armando and the son of Cornelius witness a cruel public display of torture against a helpless ape worker, the emotionally enraged talking simian lets loose his tongue and makes the fatal mistake of publicly shouting out an obscenity against the human oppressors.  Armando, accepting responsibilty for the outcry,  is taken into custody for questioning after he helps Caesar flee capture.  The fugitive ape conceals himself by infiltrating a cage of "immigrant" ape orangutans imported from Indonesia and is taken to a worker conditioning center where apes are harshly trained to become subservient to human domination.  He is soon sold at a slave auction to the Governor's assistant MacDonald, who ironically is an Afro-American.  MacDonald brings him before Governor Breck, played by the melodramatically camp Don Murray,  who suspects that he is indeed the talking ape that they are searching for and is given the opportunity to name himself by choosing a name randomly from a book.  The intelligent ape points to a name which not only surprises but reaffirms the Governor's suspicion and thus, Caesar is born.<br /><br />Caesar is put to work in an operations center where he can be closely monitored.  When Caesar overhears that his master Armando was killed trying to flee interrogation, he becomes outraged and communicates non-verbally with his ape brethren to be defiant against their masters and the seeds of discontent are sown.  Caesar organizes the apes into an uprising against their human captors that erupts into a full-blown ape revolt akin to Che Gorilla --- a sly reference to the Cuban revolutionary guerilla leader Che Guevara for which Caesar emblematically bares an uncanny symbolic resemblance to and has even been parodied as such in pop-culture. Roddy McDowall gives a rousing and unforgettable dramatic performance that surpasses his characterization of Cornelius in the three previous Ape films.  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes explodes into a riotous and violent action packed climax that inevitably sets the stage for the entire Apes Saga and the birth of The Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />Conquest is the fourth film in the series and it is my second favorite.  It is brutally violent and was the first Apes film to earn a PG rating after explicit scenes of graphic violence were cut.  I would love to see an uncut version released on DVD.  It is filled with so many socio-political themes that are just as relevant (if not more so) today as they were back in 1972.  While the ape revolt was patterned directly after the 1965 Los Angeles Watts Riots, it could easily parallel the racial Alabama and Chicago civil protest riots of the 50's and 60's or the L.A. riots of the 90's.  It's themes of working class oppression not disimilar to the current issue of Immigration Reform which saw demonstrations of protest in major cities across the country by tens of thousands of immigrant workers who perform low-paying laborious and menial jobs, as exemplified by the scene where Caesar witnesses the temperament of a snobbish blonde woman having her hair done in a salon by a chimp named Zelda.  The Government is portrayed as oppressive and paranoid and is an interesting examination of how the need for social constructs like Ape Management (i.e. Homeland Security) can easily deteriorate into an oppressive state of authoritarian control.  Conquest is a political-charged cautionary allegory of how society breeds contempt.  Viva la Revolution!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Of the five "Planet of the Apes" films only the first one and its sequel "Beneath" are truly great and worthwhile. The three prequels devolve in quality: "Escape from" is decent, "Conquest of" is okay (barely) and "Battle for" is horrible.<br /><br />"Beneath" (1970) is the only actual sequel, hence, both the original and "Beneath" should be digested as one long story.<br /><br />THE PLOT: An astronaut, James Franciscus, lands on the ape planet in search of Taylor and his crew. He makes contact with a primitive babe who knew Taylor (Nova, played by Linda Harrison) and then embarks upon a quest to find him -- leading first to the ape city (where he discovers that apes rule the planet) and then to the "forbidden zone," a holocaust-ruined wasteland where psychic mutants dwell underground.<br /><br />Growing up I always favored "Beneath" above the original. Why? Possibly because "Beneath" has a lot more action (especially toward the end) and the concept of the underground psychic mutants was both eerie and captivating. As an adult, however, I've come to appreciate the original in increasing measure; it's deeper than "Beneath," more intellectual. I now believe that each film has its strengths and weaknesses and they both compliment eachother very well.<br /><br />Many criticize James Franciscus as a weak Heston (Taylor) clone. Although this complaint holds some validity (Linda Harrison described Franciscus as a smaller version of Charleton Heston) and Heston is indeed inimitable (so don't even try), I personally never had a problem with Franciscus in this film. He does a fine job in the role of the stranded astronaut on a planet of madness. His character, Brent, isn't disillusioned with humanity like Taylor, so he has less of an 'edge' or pizzazz, but Brent is a fine generic 'everyman' that we can all relate to.<br /><br />All the great main characters in the first film are present in "Beneath." Aside from Nova and Taylor, the story features Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius. Unfortunately Roddy McDowall wasn't available to play Cornelius so they brought in David Watson for the part, which isn't a problem because you can't tell beneath all that ape make-up and Watson does a splendid job mimicking McDowall.<br /><br />A new, equally great character is introduced and that is Ursus, the gorilla general, played by James Gregory (remember him from the original Star Trek episode "Dagger of the Mind" as Dr. Adams?). Who could ever forget Ursus' motivational speech "The only good human is a DEAD human!!" ?<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE MUTANTS] It is revealed in the story that the psychic mutants are human caricatures who literally worship the doomsday bomb (a bomb capable of destroying the entire planet). Evidently, human beings need something to worship even in a wholly devolved state -- truly, humankind is incurably religious. This may be a negative reflection on dead religion, which is the human attempt to connect with God ('religion' means "to bind back"), but it certainly isn't a negative reflection on biblical Christianity, which concerns God Himself connecting with humanity through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the subsequent life-birthing power of the Holy Spirit. In any event, the perverted religious nature of the psychic mutants is nothing less than fascinating (albeit a bit laughable at times, e.g. "the holy fallout"). [END SPOILER]<br /><br />There are numerous great scenes and images, for example, the gorillas marching in the forbidden zone and the gigantic appearance of the revered ape Lawgiver with a bleeding face, ultimately collapsing into a desert inferno.<br /><br />Some criticize that the first half of the story is merely an inferior repeat of the first film (astronaut crashlands, discovers that apes rule the planet and ends up in ape city), but -- you know what? -- it was great the first time around, why not experience it again with some slight nuances? (especially since "Beneath" was released 3 YEARS after the original). Hey, I admit that this section of "Beneath" isn't as great as the original, it's even kind of boring (that is, after seeing the first film), but WAIT till Brent and Nova escape ape city and discover the underground lair of the psychic mutants; the film becomes ultra-captivating from then on.<br /><br />One beef I've always had with "Beneath" is that Leonard Rosenman's blaring score is mediocre compared to Jerry Goldsmith's original. It properly mimics the original but can't cut it. Why didn't they just re-use Goldsmith's score?<br /><br />On a technical level, "Beneath" isn't nearly as good as the original due to obvious budget limitations. The subpar score is one example; another would be the all-too-obvious pull-over ape masks. But these are fairly minor cavils; they never prevented ME from wholly enjoying the flick. Still, I could see why some would some would view the film as 4/5 Stars or even 3.5/5 Stars for these reasons.<br /><br />The climax is KILLER -- and I mean that literally -- as Brent ultimately finds Taylor and the gorillas invade the mutants' underground turf. Some great action entails and then... well, I can't give away the ultra-downer ending, can I? Let's just say that it should be appreciated by fans of death-obsessed bands like Type 0 Negative and My Dying Bride.<br /><br />I always loved the ending; in its own way it's just as great as the climax of the original.<br /><br />Needless to say, "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" is MANDATORY viewing. I wouldn't even take calls from film fans who don't have "Beneath" in his or her video library and hold it dear.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is the fifth and last installment in the POTA's series or at least in the movie theater series. I must say this again....I am a big fan of the series and I have watched them in my home theater with the new transfers now. This film isn't bad, but a bigger budget could have helped.<br /><br />If you are going to watch these movies, please throw out all sense of reality! I hate when people pick apart things they feel are unbelievable in movies. We're talking about "talking apes" here! I will however have to question basic continuity in these films. Every installment has continuity problems that will split your brain in two just trying to make sense of it! I will give you one example ..... this film takes place in 2670 and the last picture was in 1991.....lets do some math here. That would make Caesar 699 years old Considering he was 20 years old in "Conquest" I guess the Caesar in this picture is his great, great, great, great grand son?? If that is true how is the Governor's aid's brother still alive? They don't really explain this.<br /><br />I am not trying to tear these films apart,but there are loads of little tidbits of information through out the series like this. As long as you are watching the films with the right mind set, this is a good film that should have been better, I know the studio making budget cuts to the sequels and gearing them for a younger audience had a lot to do with it. The DVD transfer is very good and the extended edition helps a bit. My rating for the series is<br /><br />1) POTA  by a mile! 5 stars<br />2) Beneath from POTA 3 stars<br />3) Escape the POTA 3 1/2 stars<br />4) Conquest for POTA 2 1/2 stars<br />5) Battle for The POTA 2 1/4 stars<br /> The sequels are so close it really is a toss up with them.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>Planet of the Apes is a great "What if" tale.  There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state.  But when "Apes" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake!  Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here.  The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely.  In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place.  They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well.  Monkey racism I guess you'd call it.  That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).<br /><br />The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place.  Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.<br /><br />As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed.  You just want to know why the monkeys are talking.  Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy.  The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers.  The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.<br /><br />I suggest that if you are not familiar with the entire series that you just start with Planet of the Apes for now.  At least that way if you're disappointed you can stop there and you won't have wasted money on the rest of the series which many consider to be substandard.<br /><br /> Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) is nowhere near the quality of the first "Apes" but it's box office success lead to the relase of Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) which is a little better storywise.  Then came Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and finally Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).  If you're a collecter then you should have all the Ape films.  If you're really planning to watch them for entertainment value then Planet of The Apes and Escape from the Planet of the Apes are your best bets.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Once you get past the preposturous and serious flawed opening of the movie, you have a great story  (in the first film we saw the damaged ship sink in the water.  This film supposes that Cornelious and Zira somehow retrieved the ship and repaired it and were able to fly it back through time.  All this was done in the short time from when Brent left their camp in the second film till he reached the mutant camp, which at most was a day).  This was probably the best acting for Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter in the series.  The movie makes us question the scientific use of animals in research.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Embedded within the deep layers of what appears to be a simple science fiction flick from the 60s, Planet of the Apes delves into the issue of existence and evolution without turning into a documentary. One must marvel at Franklin J. Schaffner's ability to make something this scientific and controversial work on the big screen. <p>One of the great aspects of the film is the slow build up of tension at the film's outset. Taylor (played by Charlton Heston) is aboard a spaceship with a few other explorers as the ship careens slowly through space. The gloomy outlook that Taylor possesses on existence (he says mechanically &quot;I feel lonely&quot;) is only outweighed by the mysterious existence of time travel. The ship lands in the year 3978 in the waters of some land, and those who survive are left to discover exactly where they are and what time they are living in. <p>Although it is a physical journey, there is also a philosophical journey for Taylor. He adopts the standpoint that &quot;life is meaningless&quot;, appearing rebellious against the human spirit. Seemingly, he is not only escaping time but, in his bitterness, looking for something better than mankind. <p>The progression of discoveries in the first part establishes a mood of slight creepiness. This is not a movie that rushes the critical points of background information so it can cut to the chase; instead, the viewer is experiencing the journey of a new land with the travelers. The crew begins to find small existences of life (waterfall, plant life, footprints). Ultimately, they discover that humans are there, but this discovery is truly ironic. <p>We eventually discover that there is a twist to this society. The role-reversal is that apes rule people. Not only are humans ruled, but also kept captive and treated as the inferior race (&quot;beasts&quot; is what one of the apes says when referring to a human). Apes believe humans are dirty. The apes are doctors, scientists, guards, philosophers and leaders while humans are lacking intelligence and the ability to speak (except for Taylor). Also within this topsy-turvy world many of the expressions are reversed to fit the apes' world (&quot;Human see, human do.&quot;). <p>The question of origin is the movie's main subject. Cornelius, one of the apes, announces to one of the leaders his theorem that &quot;ape evolved from man&quot;, based on his findings in The Forbidden Zone (a land that is seclude from society of apes). This viewpoint is naturally construed as ridiculous and impossible by many of the apes. Taylor searches for a way to escape, and, at the same time, tries to come to terms with an understanding of how society evolved this way. <p>In one form, the movie is a commentary on both evolution and individual and societal identity (or lack thereof). Taylor's ultimate discovery is a subject of irony and devastation, his destiny being his ultimate fear. Masterfully put together, Planet of the Apes mixes a blend of sci-fi, action, creepiness and commentary that not only produce a good movie, but an intelligent one as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>What's so scary about this movie is that on one level it's entertaining and yet so true about society. The humans have the apes doing all the work in a society where dogs and cats were wiped out by a virus. Something that could very well happen today.  The apes were domesticated and introduced but very soon made slaves. <p>Ricardo Manltaban was the circus trainer that teaches Ceasar to intergrate into human society. I wish they didn't finish his character off so easily.  He didn't get credit for his small but important role in the film.  <p>Well, to make a long story short Ceasar tells the apes they are being used! They get mad as heck and won't take it anymore!  Riots and violence result and the humans take second billing on the planet called Earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>In the authority chain, you may distinguish the clear diference between the apes too.<br />One spacial navy suddenly falls in a hole time and it's carried hundred years after. The landing in a unknown planet, carries to these man and it shows them a world ruled by apes who dictate its own rules and have established the official story.<br />The man is under them in the evolutive chain. The men have lost his speaking capacity and they only make gutural sounds. Their state is something less than pitiful.<p>George Taylor is wounded in his throat and that's why he can not articulate even a single word.<br />The dramatic sequences in the same point he pronounces the first word,(Do you remember the miracle worker and the wild child?) creates a true revolution among the ape scientist. This behavior are against the rules. The law is the law.(The island of Dr. Moreau)<br />And so, Taylor is involved in a constant fight for surviving. His friends can not help him anymore , one is dead and the other suffered a lobotomy.<br />The dramatic ideas exchange between Taylor and the master science of the ape comunity include hilarious bits and obviously undeniable conflicts between the science and the faith. Forget all you learned about Darwin and please watch the mirror image. All the concepts are reverted and so the anguish and the poor human condition is less than zero.<br />Finally our hero &iquest;wins? and he can carry Nova his only possibilitie for sow the next human seed generational, but he will find out the astonishing revelation.<br />Since its release, this film involved just once more the fever for new concepts and ideas. Fahrenheit 451 (1967) and 2001 was released the same year and the world was in a decisive turning point. The man conquers the moon and the screen must be part of this decisive event.<br />So the people turns back over Asimov, Bradbury, Boulle, Stanoslav Lem and will  read over and will find out new universes, bitter nightmares spacials. In a very close state the fifties had a coommon behavior. The ancient films of sci fi were released, and others were remade.We had to expect four years for Solaris directed by Tarkovski in 1972.<br />In this sense, you can not forget the political behavior in many countries in that age. There were many dictators all around the world , and the figure of the ape was a clear methapor of them.<br />Undoubtly, you may be find the film , thirty years after, a little bit aged, but the dramatic implications that a nuclear conflict involves, still feed the imagination of many people.<br />Charlton Heston was a true icon of rthe anti hero in the fifties (with his religious films) and in the sixties (with historical roles), then he would make another war films but keeping always that undeniable majesty for make prevailing the truth, no matter what's the prize you pay.<br />Sensational direction of Franklin Schaffner and arresting sequences, like the human chase and the scape from the jail (or the concentration camps) .<br />Another cult movie and the best of its following entries.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EAI4948TW53X.html">A2EAI4948TW53X</a><br/><p>What could be cooler than an ape running down the street with an M16?

Charlton Heston is not one of my favorite actors; he's too heavy-handed as a rule, but he was never better than in the role of Taylor, the astronaut who is returning home from space with two crew members (a third dies en route) and finds that they have landed on what looks like a totally alien planet.  The few humans they run into look as though they have reverted back to a stone-age existence, but what really blows him away is when he finds that the apes have taken over the planet and have placed the humans in servitude.  How does it feel to be treated like an animal for a change?  The ape society is riven with dissensions as the more liberal-minded simians and the soldier apes clash over how their captives are to be treated; and Taylor eventually escapes... but to what?  The mind-blowing scene where Taylor discovers the rust-eaten remains of the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's been home all along is one of the classics in film-making; it's pure Rod Serling, right out of the twilight zone, and it still wows us after all these decades.  The POTA spinoffs went downhill from the first film; the sequels were uniformly awful, but the original is still the champ.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Whenever I watch the original "Planet of the Apes" movie (and I've done so at least 5 times), I am struck by how it truly personifies the genre of science fiction.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, the movie focuses on a group of American space explorers led by Taylor (Charlton Heston) who have been floating around the galaxy for thousands of years.  When they crash land on a strange planet, however, they find out that the evolutionary system is backwards...with apes evolving from men!<br /><br />The hallmark of this movie is that it can be so serious within its ridiculous parameters.  I mean, I think that even most die-hard "Apes" fans will admit that the presentation of the different types of simians in this film is utterly hilarious (from the walks all the way down to the facial expressions).  If you are a person with no imagination, you would be rolling in the aisles, so to speak.<br /><br />As such, the fact that this movie contains such pertinent political/social satiric themes with such a crazy "Apes" backdrop is truly the epitome of science fiction.  Some people like their film drama in real-life, some like the Old West, and others like fantasy or cartoon worlds (along with countless other genres).  If you prefer your drama to be of the thinking variety and with shades of science built in, than this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I also won't ruin the ending for the one guy living under a rock who hasn't already heard (!), but suffice it to say that the ending provides the perfect explanation on such a social-satire type of film.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Planet of the Apes" to be one of my favorite films of all-time.  It takes some imagination to enjoy, for sure, but if you can open your mind to a little craziness you'll be prone to understanding the film's simple, yet bitingly accurate, social themes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This second film is even more pessimistic than the first one. The apes turn military and war-minded because the gorillas take over and for them the only good human is a dead human. We already know that, well nearly that. From an ape general it is not surprising that he apes a certain colonel or is it general too? At least in the end he was a general, but then his horn was too little to be big enough for his appetite. As a matter of fact a second NASA rocket arrives with some more survivors looking for Taylor. But Taylor had literally disappear into thin air when trying to enter the forbidden zone. The newcomer, a certain Brent, recuperates the poor abandoned Nova who takes him back to the Ape city. And from there with a war on their hands they run into the forbidden zone to escape the gorillas. And they descend into the underground destroyed city of New York. There we are back, but with an enormous twist, to H.G. Wells, though the city of the apes is stratified in three classes that are three different species of apes. That sounds a little bit like a Brave New World. But the underground destroyed New York and its survivors have nothing to do with Terminator and the rebellion against the machines. They are pacifists who make their enemies kill each other in couples, and yet are not able to defend themselves since they have no weapon, or nearly no weapons. They have their God nevertheless and their God is a fully operational Doomsday Bomb. And that will be a big bang in the universe when it goes boom. Don't ask why and how all that found itself on a planet that is two thousand years away from the earth. Details, details, my dear Watson. And in the jungle you must presume, my dear Livingstone. And we presume. But a nuclear disaster on the earth brings humanity down, then apes take over and reverse the famous Darwinian evolution, and then war becomes inevitable and the human survivors of that cataclysm are pacifists who refuse to defend themselves except by calling for the help of their God, the nuclear auto de f&eacute; that destroyed them in the first place. No hope for these humans. 1970 was the year when all hell broke down, out and up in Vietnam and Cambodia and Indochina. There was no other alternative than a nuclear war for some and this film tries to reflect that mood, but certainly not to enlighten us with any hope. Die man die hard man that is your final and inescapable fate. I am still all shivering with the recollection of that 1970 year. Gosh it was bleak.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Planet of The Apes is Wonderful,I never thought much of it before.But Charlton Heston Does An Knockout Job,and the Moment he talks The Movie got better.Sure It's Quirky, Humans Being Below from The APES,Below the Animal it's crazy but a Good movie and compared to other films from it's time a breath of fresh air.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Not a bad sequel, and one of the better films of the film series.

Then Bret finds Taylor and you really hope that the two of them can escape or something,because i think the movie need a happy ending.But that is not what we got.In fact they all died.Which spoilt the entire movie.<br />I mean all the trouble Bret went through to find Taylor and a brief bit of joy before,managing to escape the cage,and then they all got shot in my opinion was a very bad ending.<br />Being that said it still is quite a good movie,and exciting,but sometimes i flick through certain parts i like and don't bother with the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>A survivor of a spaceship crash named Taylor (Charlton Heston from THE OMEGA MAN and SOYLENT GREEN) finds himself in a world of intelligent, fully socialized apes. The ape society has three classes or groups- The gorillas are the military group, chimpanzees are the scientists, and the orangutans are the religious / political leaders. In this evolution-gone-mad morality tale, Taylor must resist those apes who consider him a threat to their society, politics, and religious beliefs.

To the east lies an ocean.  On the landward side, it is surrounded by an endless wasteland known as the Forbidden Zone.<br /><br />Living in this paradise are apes and humans.  The apes are the dominant life form; the humans are second bananas.  These humans have lost the capacity of speech.  They are uncivilized.  There lives are short, not because of disease, but because the apes are hunting them to extinction.<br /><br />The burgeoning simian society is made up of three classes.  There are the gorillas; their main activity is to hunt humans.  Those not killed are used for research and target practice.  Their General sent scouts into the Forbidden Zone; only one came back.<br /><br />Then there are the chimpanzees; they are the intellectuals, scientists, and veterinarians.  Although the gorilla's believe there is nothing to be learned by studying humans, they do allow the chimpanzees to examine and experiment on them.<br /><br />And lastly, there are the baboons; they are the administrators.  Most prominent, Doctor Zaius is the Minister of Science and The Chief Defender of the Faith.  He is privy to secret scrolls that, if revealed, would expose the truth about man and destroy the apes age of innocence.<br /><br />In the first movie, Taylor's starship crashes; he is captured, but then escapes with Nova into the Forbidden Zone.

I saw this film at the movies when it came out. That being said......I'm sorry folks, but this is not that good a movie! The first part is OK, but when they go "beneath" and once the religious hoopla starts, it is a complete snore fest! There is too much mumbo jumbo for this type of film and too quick a resolution! It is however essential to own, if you are going to watch the rest of the series. I am a fan of all the ape films, but this one is boring as H E L L in the middle!

THE PICTURE IS BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND THE SOUND(CONSIDERING THE ERA ITS FROM)IS CLEAR AND RICH WITH NUANCE. I HAVE VIEWED "BENEATH" MANY TIMES BUT NEVER WITH SUCH CLARITY. ITS GREAT. I ACTUALLY APPRECIATED THE FILM MORE BECAUSE OF THIS.<br />  AFTER "BENEATH" THE APE FILMS WENT DOWN HILL AND ARE NOT WORTH GETTING INTO. "BENEATH" IS CREATIVE SCI-FI ALL AROUND. ALL OF THE POST APOCOLIPTIC WORLD SCENES STILL HOLD UP ALTHOUGH DONE WITH A LESSER TECHNOLOGY. I NEVER THOUGHT BRENT GOING BACK TO APE CITY WITH NOVA WORKED WELL BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR THE LATE SIXTIES AUDIENCE WHO STILL HAD TO "GET IT'. A BIG TRIVIA POINT IS THAT IT IS CLAIMED BY BRENT ACCORDING TO HIS SHIPS CLOCK THAT IT IS THE YEAR 3955. IN THE ORIGINAL, TAYLORS SHIP'S CLOCK READ 3978. COULD BE A MISTAKE OR A GEEKY TIME WARP EXPLAINATION FOR THAT. I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYONE EVER COMMENT ON THAT.<br />  THE COMBINATION OF UNDERGROUND MUTANTS, THE SUBWAY, JF'S INTENSE ACTING, THE BARREN WASTELAND, APES ON THE MARCH AND HESTONS SOLID ENHANCEMENT TO THE FILM SAVE IT FROM ANY MAKEUP SHORTCOMINGS, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY AT TIMES IT HAS.

The lovely thing about DVD is that my faded, scratched, spliced, and commercial-interupted memories of this film (and its sequels) are completely erased by a vivid, remastered version.  It's really a nicely made film.  I think the ape makeup survives today in this era of CG characters.  The story is solid.  I was surprised to see Rod Serling's name credited as one of the screenwriters!  I'd never realized this.  Then, as I proceeded to watch the movie, I began to see it as a feature-length TWILIGHT ZONE episode.  (*I mean this as a compliment!)  The movie introduces its human characters, strands them on a strange planet, then shocks its audience by revealing the apes 1/3 of the way into the story.  The film's final image is pure TWILIGHT ZONE, with an O. Henry twist to the whole story.  Brilliant!<p>The DVD looks great.  The sound is done well.  I wish there were more bonus items -- it's too bad that the APES documentary is only available by purchasing the entire set.  I'd love to get a gander at the makeup men and the set designers.  The look of these films is spectacular.<p>Watching APES again was a walk down memory lane.  Who would've known that Fox could get such mileage out of the APES concept!  5 films!  The original is the best.  And this DVD presentation does it justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>any kid worth his salt growing up in the 70's watched as on friday nights cbs ran the planet of the apes movies, i know because i was one of them, and because they were rated high on the t.v. charts.<br /><br />"planet of the apes" (1968) began the whole saga as taylor(charlton heston) crashes his spaceship on a desert planet some 2 to 3000 years into the future. after a sureal trek through a desert they find plant life and water,and human life . the humans are caveman in type and don't talk. taylor and his friends are just thinking about what to do next when an unearthly hunt call sends the humans running and the bigest suprise of all,<br /><br /> apes on horse back and with guns are hunting the humans. once seen the hunt will never be forgotten. as his friends are killed taylor is hurt and we learn that the apes rule this world. this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made , as taylor fights for his life and a reason for a planet ruled by apes. in the end he finds his reason in one of the greatest endings ever put on film , and if you haven't seen it i'm sure you have heard of it.<br /><br />  "beneath the planet of the apes " takes place just after the first films ends and adds another spaceman brent to the mix as he is sent to find out what happened to taylor, not as good as the first but still fun and action packed. and it looks like the end of the series.<br /><br />  "escape from the planet of the apes" shifted the time line to modren day(read 1973) and put the apes in the forground as the ones we care about. a fun almost remake in reverse of the first it ends very downbeat but paves the way for the next in the series.<br /><br />" conquest of the planet of the apes" takes place in the future(the 1980's) as a plague has killed all dogs and cats on earth and people have taken apes as pets,buthave found they make better slaves than pets.enter the son of the apes in "escape" as he leads a revolt and takes over the earth. this one is pg instead of g because of the dark nature of this one shot trip into a dark event. maybe the best of the whole series.<br /><br />  "battle for the planet of the apes" the last in the series and the least of the films follows the apes after the revolt and sees their last fight against the humans that want to control them.<br /><br />" behind the planet of the apes " tells the story of the making of all the movies and anything else you could want to know about the movies and is hosted by the late roddy mcdowell and is just great.<br /><br />this is the best collection of any movie serise i have seen. if you love this series you need this set. you'll go ape for it.

The film has a coherent narrative which was definitely lacking in Tim Burton's version.  The world in which the apes inhabit is richly imagined.  The basic premise of man's inhumanity to itself and other creatures may be heavy-handed at times but not overly so.  The ape make-up is breathtaking and does not impede the actors sporting it.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner has assembled a first-rate cast with Charlton Heston solid as the astronaut, Taylor, Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter give superb performances as the sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius and Zira and Maurice Evans appropriately crotchety as head ape scientist Dr. Zaius.

Thanks to those who do this.  No thanks to those who say a Blu-Ray has excellent audio/video quality, when it doesn't.<br /><br />After reading all of the reviews (for this UK version and the USA version) saying the video quality is excellent, I am disappointed.  I thought the first movie had very good video quality.  In fact, I thought it looked great.  After putting in the second movie, I immediately saw that the image was not nearly as good as the first.  There was grain, and I didn't remember seeing grain in the first movie.  I thought the 3rd, 4th, and 5th movies looked better than the second, but not as good as the first.  I rate the movies between 8.0 (the second movie) and 9.0 (the first movie) on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />All five of the movies have an aspect ration of about 2.35:1, and have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.

I did notice more surround sound in the 4th and 5th movies.<br /><br />The first movie lasted about 2 hours.

It is the tale of a misanthropic astronaut, and his three comrades, sent on the first interstellar flight, somewhere towards Alpha Centauri. The tale follows Heston's character, Colonel George Taylor, and his two surviving male underlings, Dodge and Landon, after they crash land on a seemingly deserted Earth-like world. The female member of the crew, Stewart, has died due to an air leak in her hibernation capsule.<br />  While they think they are in a different solar system, and have traveled over two thousand years into the future, it not too slowly becomes apparent that they are back on Earth. The willful suspension of disbelief is needed, of course, because the chances that astronauts could not tell that they were under our sun, moon, and constellations- even a few millennia hence, is unlikely. Then there is the terrestrial flora, then the encounter with mute humans (how unlikely is that?), and then being captured by English speaking gorillas on a hunt. I mean- they speak English, and American astronauts cannot piece things together? Yet, if one can give in to that initial act, all the rest of the film- and subsequent series, unfolds with quite a bit of logic, although at times seeming at odds.<br />  Dodge ends up killed and stuffed in an ape museum while Landon is lobotomized so he cannot speak. Taylor cannot speak, initially, because he has been shot in the throat by a gorilla. He is mended by two chimpanzee scientists, Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell), an archaeologist, who believe he is `bright.' She calls him Bright Eyes. They are under the tutelage of Dr. Zaius, an orangutan bureaucrat who knows the secret that his world is earth, and that taking humans once ruled it.<br />  Eventually, Taylor regains his voice, after being put on by trial with Zira and Cornelius, who are charged with heresy, and one of the film's many signature moments comes when Taylor is netted and captured after escaping, and rails to the apes who catch him, `Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!' Yet, by the time that line is uttered the viewer has so bought into the film's suspension of disbelief, that when we see the shock on the faces of the apes, upon hearing a human speak, it mirrors the viewers' shock. Later, at the trial comes the great sequence where the three orangutan inquisitors will hear no more, and cover their eyes, mouths, and ears, in the classic see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil pose.<br />  What some forget, in all the manifest political analogies the film and series put forth- such as the three ape races corresponding with the three main Classical stocks of Man: Negroid/Gorilla, Caucasoid/Chimpanzee, and Mongoloid/Orangutan, is that Planet Of The Apes was also a devastating critique of organized religion and its deliberate deceits. Zira and Cornelius, with Zira's nephew, free Taylor, and he and Nova (Linda Harrison)- the female human given to him as a mate, escape with them to The Forbidden Zone- the desert where Taylor first landed. Zaius and the gorillas follow, on horseback, and Cornelius shows proof that humans preceded apes on the planet, including a human doll that could speak. Taylor asks if an ape would make a doll that speaks. They also find dentures and an artificial heart valve. The gorillas attack and Taylor takes Zaius hostage, gets food, water, a rifle and ammo, and he and Nova are allowed to escape along the shoreline, after scorning the man with a citation from Ape scripture: `Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.' Zaius then blows up the cave and the secret of human history predating ape culture.<br />  One might think that Taylor should have pieced things together by now, but the film ends with him finally linking things up, when he comes across the deteriorated upper half of the Statue Of Liberty, and curses his ancestors. Whether the statue has been blown up or simply buried in sand is unclear. What is clear is that it is not only a great twist ending to the film, thought up by the film's original screenwriter, Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone fame, but an iconic political image- and the most devastating of the 1960s to come from film. Here is Heston, the embodiment of intelligent macho American goodness- far more so than the more one dimensional icon of John Wayne, on his knees and wailing, pounding the sand impotently, as all that was America is in ruins. Given that this was released not long after the Tet Offensive showed that America was losing in Vietnam, its impact was enormous.<br />  The film was one of the two great science fiction films released that year, which made sci fi a more respectable subject for serious drama. The other, of course, was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose iconic imagery was on a par with this film's. Serling's original script, which more closely followed the novel's futuristic themes, was redone by Michael Wilson, who for budgetary reasons had to primitivize the ape society. The film won three Oscars- for best score, by Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Makeup- an honorary award specifically for the film's historic impact. It is the truly otherworldly and spooky score by Goldsmith that- along with Serling's original screenplay, make the film such a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>First of all, if you can find it, you should buy this two-disk edition (the one with the silver cover), rather than the edition that seems to be more ubiquitous on Amazon:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESEO">Planet of the Apes</a>, since that one doesn't have all the goodies this has.  Unfortunately, I think the two-disk one is going out of print.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I don't think I'll be watching it again:  I know you're supposed to suspend your disbelief before you pop in a movie like this, but watching it in middle age, I couldn't get around the plot holes.  They were simply too enormous.  Sure, I know it's a classic movie and all.  And sure, when I was a teenager this really fired my imagination.<br /><br />But this time around, the only thing I marveled at was how hoodwinked I had been before at such second-rate entertainment.  In this case, the plot-hole that triggered my dissatisfaction was the fact that Heston wasn't struck at all by the fact that the apes spoke English.  At least in Boulle's book, they spoke another language which he slowly had to learn.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a minor matter, but once you start to notice that, a whole lot of other things seem to go wrong, until the point where you're just rolling your eyes instead of taking the movie on its own merits.<br /><br />Another thing that seemed completely off was the direction:  think of the crashing-to-earth scene.  I realize they had a limited budget, but that has got to be some of the most inept direction I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A5QE86H97FDJA.html">A5QE86H97FDJA</a><br/><p>The third film, &quot;Escape...&quot; was a complete joke. They must have made this on a shoe-string budget because there were no special effects and they probably used the masks from the first two films. The plot was idiotic and I weep at thought of this nonsense.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Even if you are not an APES series fan, this movie grows on you.  It is easily the most intentionally comic of the series, and features a cleverly plotted mix of real drama and sci-fi, and placing the action in  then-present day Los Angeles gives it a peculiar point of view, one that  succeeds almost brilliantly.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall inhabit their  roles so completely that you believe utterly that they are apes, and that  their peril is real.  Since I love the twists in a movie that give it  gravity and an enduring quality, I love the strange sense of doom and  tragedy that pervades this movie, even when it is at its most humorous.  The final moments remain chillingly effective, and paved the way for the  many, many copycat plots featured in movies yet to come.  Forget BENEATH...  -- go directly to this movie; you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Since most people have seen the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" (multiple times, I might add) this review is not so much intent on introducing the film to new viewers but rather provoking people to re-discover it, as I did recently.<br /><br />THE PLOT: George Taylor and two other astronauts experience some type of time warp in space and crashland on a distant planet over 2000 years in the future. They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained "animals."<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like "Ben-Hur" and "The Ten Commandments," I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.<br /><br />The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitive humans and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation of the intelligent rulers of the planet. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive "cavemen" speak? Who planted the crops of corn?<br /><br />When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its ultra-captivating sense of awe. But, no matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.<br /><br />The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.<br /><br />It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct "races": The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutangs are the respected elders & religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a spendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.<br /><br />The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved: Nova, the animal-like cavegirl, played by the beautiful Linda Harrison. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.<br /><br />Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as sort of a villain or antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the utmost reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power (by way of the returning gorillas on horseback) to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an "animal" no less!<br /><br />Also, consider this: Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to "breed in great numbers." Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. ("You can't HANDLE the truth!!")<br /><br />The climax is incredible: Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the "planet of the apes" is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming out curses at humanity.<br /><br />Lastly, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky. I suppose the above "jarring shift" could also be viewed as a negative point.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: I've seen "Planet of the Apes" numerous times over the years and previously saw it just two years ago. You would think that I'd "know it all" and nothing would surprise me, move me, teach me, etc. Yet, after just viewing it again, I am reminded of why this is such a great science-fiction film, even though it's forty years old. Some things I re-discovered but others I "saw" and experiecnced for the first time! Who woulda thought? I should also point out that "Planet of the Apes" is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure. So those who need constant explosions to maintain their juvenile attention should steer clear (not that there's anything wrong with that -- heh, heh).<br /><br />Lastly, this film and its sequel "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (which is technically the only sequel in the series; the others are prequels) should be viewed as ONE long film/story. "Beneath" suffers from budget cuts, etc. but it is, in its own unique way, almost as good as "Planet."</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>In a magnificent performance, Heston plays what he considers an "existential" character... He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of "something better than man."<br /><br />Heston tries to make sense of this "upside-down" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...<br /><br />Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases...<br /><br />"Planet of the Apes" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...<br /><br />The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...<br /><br />The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb...<br /><br />"Planet of the Apes" also gives us something else:<br /><br />-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!<br /><br />- "Bright Eyes" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words ("Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!"), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...<br /><br />- The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic "hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...<br /><br />- When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: "Allright. But you're so damned ugly!"<br /><br />- The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, "You may not like what you find!" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock...<br /><br />Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, "Planet of the Apes" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly... It is a superb exercise in fantasy, a fine suspense adventure, an exciting and provocative entertainment...</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Franklin Shaffner's 1968 adaptation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Bridge On The River Kwai')science-fiction satire still makes audiences ponder on questions of human nature even after almost 40 years with its brilliant script and great special effects.<br /><br />The story follows George Taylor (Charleton Heston) and his 3 crew mates who've been travelling the stars at light speed in suspended animation.  The spaceship is programmed to land back on an Earth that is centuries older but something goes terribly wrong: a system failure leads their ship to land in a desolate sea on an unknown planet.  As the crew members salvage what they can from their sinking ship, their hopes of ever returning home go down to the depths along with their ship.  After some exploration, the disoriented astronauts realize that they aren't alone.  On this new planet, apes are the only intelligent life while human hunter-gatherers live like flocks of mute sheep.  Captured by the apes, Taylor speaks out and sends shockwaves through the ape society's scientific community.  Securing the friendship of two chimp scientists named Cornelius (McDowell) and Zera (Hunter), Taylor seeks to save his life and that of his new silent soul-mate Nova (Harrison) against the fanatical Dr. Zeuss (Evans.)  Will he escape this world gone ape?  What will he find if he does?<br /><br />With a brilliant script written by the legendary Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame, the audience is plunged into the depths of this political/social satire.  The film explores the concepts of human nature and its fallacies manifested in social institutions such as religion, science, and government.  The film is an attack on preconceptions as to human nature and its place in the universe. Although the film significantly deviates from Boulle's short story, it is far superior to Tim Burton's recent bubble gum adaptation that offers a true satire as opposed to a mindless and generic sci-fi action plot with no theme.  Also, the make-up and costumes in this version are actually more convicing than the glossy and static CGI enhancements in the new film.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the rare instances where the film is better than the novel that inspired it.  Boulle's novel is short and leaves the plot somewhat lacking as to it characters just as much as the film lacks more detail as to the ape society Taylor finds himself in.  The film somewhat wins over in this comparative deficiency by developing Taylor's character.  Also, the characters in the film being professional astronauts make more sense than Boulle's eccentric scientist and his crew of amateurs.  Focusing the story on Earth instead of another planet and changing the final scene in the film has a greater thematic impact than the one in Boulle's novel.  An interesting fact that both the novel and film seem to ignore is the disparity in physical strength between humans and apes.  If apes would indeed socially evolve to replace humans then humans would be at a serious disadvantage as apes are much stronger in terms of physical strength and so the scenes where Taylor is wrestling free from the clutches of several gorillas is pretty much an impossibility.  The film making the apes less evolved than in the novel also seems to work better.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film that, despite its changes, conveys most of the theme in the novel and actually does better than the novel in its plot.  A timeless film to be enjoyed by all ages.</p></br></body></html>

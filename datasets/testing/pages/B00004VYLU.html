My brother kept saying, oh you gotta see goodfellas have you seen it, so I watched it, and was enjoying deniro and liotta, and up until one of the most nauseating scenes I had to shut it off for time out. (And believe me, I am NEVER phased when it comes to gruesome murder in movies.) But I did not expect it at all. It was when the goodfellas were all wacking each other, and they were sitting in the car with the fat guy who talked too much, and it's a frontal view and you first see the fat guy shaking in his seat and he was gurgling in pain and dying. I knew they were gonna kill him, but I just was not expecting something that brutal and sick. And it showed joe pesci pull an ice pick slowly out of the back of his head, (after digging it around in his brain) and all he said was I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SHUT UP. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, like I was going to faint. That never happened to me before. We all know the mafia is well known for their vicious and brutal murders, but why couldnt they just pop him in the head quickly with a silencer gun. It basically made pesci's character even more of an unremorseful, cold blooded killer, and it was not even a problem for him. I think why it was so disturbing is it is a true story. It's sickening that the mob is having drinks one minute as buddies they've known their whole lives, and then sticking knives in each other's heads the next. I'm wondering if anyone stomached that scene well or not. Or is it just me? It's just a bit too much. Blah!</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.  We all love to see films about the bad guys and even root for them at times (what's up with that anyway?).  Martin Scorsese gives us an insider's peek at the way gangster life is.  It's full of realisms that you may not find in other crime dramas.  While this film is full of violence, it does not glorify violence but shows you what happens to those who lilve that life.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.<br /><br />Goodfellas could have been named The Rise and Fall of Henry Hill.  This film is based on his recollections of his former life.  You actually get to see Hill and hear him speak of those days in the special feature section of this dvd.  He does not look at all the gangster we see portrayed but looks are deceiving are they not?<br /><br />Paul Sorvino is positivley deadly in his role here even though you never see him lift a finger to anyone.  He states that he wasn't comfortable with the role because he wasn't sure how to portray a killer the way he needed to portray him for this film.  The outward appearance was easy but the inside of the man was more difficult.  After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.  It was then that he found the look of a killer he was seeking.<br /><br />Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.  Pesci's character is especially disturbing because he is violent and 100% grade A nuts!  His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.  "What's so funny about me?  What the @#@#@# is so funny?  Do I amuse you?  Everyone is frozen with fear because they don't know what to expect from this lunatic.  It's a very intense, powerful scene.  Finally, Hill laughs because he realizes that it's a put on and then everyone laughs.  In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film.<br /><br />Goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.<br /><br />It's a must see for those who love the genre.<br /><br />Parents please be advised that this is not a movie for children.  There is a lot of violence and foul language.  I advise a viewing age of at least 18.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>GoodFellas immerses you in the strange, violent world of armed, ignorant thugs.  The Mafia depicted here clings to no pretenses of civility.  Everything is about money and power, and no one--not even &quot;made&quot; Mafiosi--are immune from a bullet to the back (or front or side) of the head for just about any reason.  Walk a little funny?  Get shot.  Talk back?  Get shot.  Bust someone's chops?  Get shot.  GoodFellas, in fact, spirals into a blood bath of gangster killing ganster for reasons ranging from revenge to keeping mouths shut permanently.<p>The story is told from the perspective a young Irish-Italian boy who becomes an errand runner for thugs who hang out across the street from his blue collar home.  The money, power, and freedom of being above the law are too much for him to resist, and, soon, he becomes a young, murderous thug himself.  Ray Liota, who plays this central character (and provides splendid narration), follows this path to its natural conclusion--a cocaine-addled, unfaithful, narcisstic mob informant.  The transformation is spectacular to watch, particular in the scenes leading up to his final arrest, complete with overtones of paranoia, a mysterious helicopter that seems to be shadowing him, the creation of an elaborate meal, a remarkable scene between the drug-snorting Liota and his junkie mistress, and a cranky, crazy drug courier-baby sitter.<p>A word of warning: GoodFellas is brutally violent.  People are dispatched, graphically, with guns, knives, and ice picks.  Frankly, the story wouldn't be as gut-wrenching or honest without the casual brutality of these animals in full display.  It makes the ease with which they kill all the more bizarre.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the 1970's director Francis Ford Coppola treated audiences with possibly the most accurate, yet somewhat romanticized, depiction of life in the mafia with his brilliant films "The Godfather" and "The Godfather 2". Ever since those two movies, no other movie has come close to touching the quality that is displayed in these two films for this genre, some have tried and come close ("The Godfather 3" being chief among them), but none have succeeded. That is until director Martin Scorsese released his biopic on the life of mobster Henry Hill with "Goodfellas".<br /><br />"Goodfellas" follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a small-time hood who happens to participate in a robbery with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), calm and calculating individual, and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), a psycho with an incredibly short fuse. Little did Henry know that this robbery would place him on the path to becoming a 'made man' in the very mafia family that Jimmy Conway eventually becomes head of. As Henry Hill rises through the ranks of 'La Cosa Nostra' he manages to find some peace and stability when he meets a young Italian woman (Lorraine Braco) that he marries and has a few kids with. However, the excesses of mafia life eventually begin to get the better of Henry, as he begins to unravel due to heavy drug use, and making matters worse his one-time friend and Don, Jimmy Conway believes Henry may be a threat to him and plots to 'whack' him. With his life in possible jeopardy, Henry has two choices, one stay true to the family and face possible execution, or two, become a government informant and be placed into Witness Protection, becoming a rat in the eyes of the 'family'.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese's work here is by far some of his best. His gritty, realistic approach to this true story, really shows the audience the great wealth and success (if you can call it that) that mafia life can have, while at the same time showing the pitfalls that can occur in that same life. The cast that Scorsese has managed to bring together for this film is truly excellent, and the performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta are so powerful, and at times scary, that you can really appreciate the great talent that these actors possess. The supporting cast is equally talented, and just as worthy of praise as the three leads. An interesting note is that for his role of the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci improvised some of the more extreme moments the character has, earning him great critical praise and somewhat typecasting him in this type of role. The story is an excellent cautionary tale on what can happen when your choices lead you on the wrong path, even though it's the only path you ever dreamed of. The movie is probably just as strong as "The Godfather", maybe even stronger due to it's even greater authenticity and lack of romanticizing life in the mafia. For those moviegoers that enjoy mafia themed movies, but have never seen this gangster classic, you must do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />"Goodfellas" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>THis is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  While it makes much of the violence seem funny and natural, the overall impact of the film is to show how empty and dangerous the mob life really was.  I have watched this at least 15 times, and have enjoyed it every single time as more detail comes through.  The characters are extremely subtle and the acting is absolutely first rate.  You get a historical snapshop of organizaed crime as well as a cautionary tale:  the dreamlike quality of "the life" gives way to the ugliest of realities.  While certain of the characters are composites, such as Tommy, the story is essentially true.</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This movie really has 3 stars in it not 1 three<br /><br />Ray Liotta , Robert De Niro , and Joe Pesci are great in this movie you really feel a conection between the characters that they are really close and not just some hot shot actors doing what they are told the acting is excellent Especially De Niro and Pesci you feel a big bond between them<br /><br />This is one of the top mob movies I can only see the Godfather in front of this thats about it<br /><br />This is a classic and I have watched it so many times I cant count and or remember<br /><br />Highly Recomended</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>"Goodfellas" was recently named in a British magazine as "The Greatest Film Of All Time". While that is up for debate, there is no doubt that it's up there. Brutal, shocking and true, "Goodfellas" is cinema at best.<br /><br />Martin Scorcese directs and Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci lead the pack of an amazing bunch talented actors in this tale of notorious gangster turned rat Henry Hill (played with a quiet ferocity by Liotta). As a kid, Hill become caught up in the world of the mob. Working for reputed mob Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), he does some small jobs before moving into the big league. He meets veteran criminal Jimmy "The Gent" Conway (Robert De Niro) and the wacko Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, who was brilliant). The three hook up for a series of violent crimes over the years. Henry also goes through a tumultous marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco). As the years go on, the stakes get higher, these Goodfellas come closer to getting caught every day. Eventually, justice reigns, and the price is paid. And if the ending is disappointing, don't forget that all of this happened.<br /><br />This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone. This is a film that everyone should see at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Soon into this movie about New York mobsters. there's a long tracking shot: a young hood (Ray Liotta), flush with money and entitlement, escorts his date (Lorraine Bracco) into the Copacabana through a side entrance; the couple navigate corridors, a restaurant kitchen, and enter the crowded club; there, a waiter sets up a table for them just as comedian Henny youngman opens his act with "Take my wife, please!" Its a bravura sequence by an artist who knows how to make movies better than most.<br /><br />That artist, director Martin Scorcese, is confident enough to cast in supporting roles his own mother and no less an acting legend than top-billed Robert DeNiro. Clearly, he has his priorities straight.<br /><br />Liotta stars ingratiatingly as a youngster/adult who aspires to gangsterism under the guidance of the local capos (DeNiro. Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci). Bracco strings along, enjoying the good life and raising their kids. All goes awry when Liotta falls afoul of the law and agrees to turn state's evidence against his former mentors, landing them in jail and he and his family in the witness protection program. The real man Liotta plays here wrote a best-selling book about all this and Scorcese collaborated with him on the script.<br /><br />Scorcese shows us the daily operations of a morally corrupt group of temper tantrum sadists, murderers and thieves who nevertheless dote on family, value loyalty, and protect their own. Pesci perfects the first of many psycho killers he's played in other movies. Francis Coppola moved the narrative in a stately manner in his "Godfather" films, while Scorese drives his briskly here. "Goodfellas" isn't yet ranked in the same league, but that the comparison even comes to mind suggests its inevitablity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It's a cinch to see why this classic deserves every bit of its stature; five times and I still don't tire of it. Kudos to Scorsese's visceral cinematic style, for this could quite easily have been your garden-variety gangster tale.<br /><br />The rough and tumble world of mafia can be intoxicating, as we follow our protagonist Henry Hill's rise through the ranks in the underworld (Liotta has yet to equal this incredible early performance). His voiceover permeates the entire film, breathlessly, in awe of the things he gets away with.<br /><br />He slowly ingratiates himself in this hood, first as a gofer and then to become a mid-level "family member." The appeal of the good life is summed up brilliantly in the simplest terms possible, "I was a part of something."<br /><br />It's both shocking and fascinating to watch these guys work. There's even an unexpected tinge of sardonic humor along the way, albeit the gallows kind.<br /><br />But between a constant cavalcade of Italian cheese and wine we soon discover that there's a reverse side to getting the best seats at plush restaurants and walking scotfree because cops are on dough. No one in this crowd seems to have a conscience, and eventually Henry begins to look over his shoulders even with his closest friends.<br /><br />His higher-ups include a hitman who is feared and respected in the organization (Robert DeNiro in an understated by chilling performance), a volatile loose canon who may make you laugh one minute and blow your head off the next (Joe Pesci), and the local kingpin who lets others do his dirty work and to whom respect must always be paid. Danny DeVito rounds out the studded star cast.<br /><br />Goodfellas has attracted flak for taking a sympathetic look at violent criminals, but let's face it, Hollywood is hardly to blame for the allure of the mafia. Plus, if anything, Goodfellas demonstrates better than any other movie on the subject how fleeting that heady charm is.<br /><br />It's the most ruthless depiction of the underworld I've seen apart from Scarface, an absolute catnip for mafia movie aficianados but a pretty good watch for the rest of us too. Get a DVD for your own collections, this'll stand up to repeat viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Scorsese delivers a realistic portrayal of life as a gangster in the tough city of New York, spanning three decades, mixing the glamour and violence to create a world that both gratifies and disgusts the viewer. As you learn that violence and murder was no big deal to these people, it was the only way people stayed in line.<p>Robert De Niro, plays Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway. who acts as mentor to Ray Liotta's, Henry Hill, guiding him through the cheap steals and hijacks that fund their way of life. Along with Joe Pesci's psychotic portrayal of Tommy and the ever-looming, Paulie, as the boss; you cannot help but like them.<p>There is no real honour in family of gangsters, it is all about money and once Henry goes behind his boss' back to partake in cocaine dealing with his Pittsburgh connections, it sets off a chain of events that coincide with the end of the gangster era.<p>Joe Pesci delivers a superb performance, which he deservedly won an Oscar for. His temper and natural violence detracts attention from his diminutive size, who can only be controlled by De Niro, in a quiet but effective character role. I believe that Liotta does a good job as the lead character, his voice-over helping define scenes and situations.<p>Scorsese is the real master behind the film, through his camera work and plotting to tell a story about a group of people he both detests and admires.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>But I can't stand how this is 2 sided dvd.  I thought it was Widescreen and Fullscreen, but yet it was side A and side B.  The viedo only had 1 casset, and this just pissed me off.  Getting that aside, this is one of the greatest mob movies ever made.  It explains how a kid hung arounnd a cabstand, and grew up to become a made gangster.  Ray Liotta(Henry Hill) did a real good job in the movie as the man, and a good job as the narrirator, Robet Deniro(Jimmy) delivers one of his greatest acts in his carrer as a man who did mob hits since he was 16.  And Joe Pessi(Tommy Diveto) deserved best supporting oscar for his role as a low temperd man who wouldn't take no ....  This movie shows three decades of the mafia, than began the good times, but ended in bad times.  This movie will keep your eyes glues to the screen to the very end.  Trust me, if you loved the godfather, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love this.  But don't buy the DVD like I did.  Avoid that mistake, and get the video.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster." -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.<p>Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. "Goodfellas"--based on true events--exploits the life of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his "career" throughout the film.<p>As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mafia boss Paul Sorvino; and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster, and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. <p>Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to Henry starting to take and deal drugs, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.<p>"Goodfellas" is one of the best films I have ever seen. There really is no plot per say, as you can see above, other than following the true life story of a gangster. But what makes the film is a witty script, intelligent, deep, and for the most part likable characters; a great director, great actors; the list goes on.<p>Robert De Niro isn't in this movie a whole lot--I'd estimate an hour and a half out of the three or so hours the film is. But when he's on screen he gives a terrific performance.<p>Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in "Goodfellas," while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.<p>Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. "What do you want, ...." the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.<p>Martin Scorsese, one of the most overlooked directors when it comes to Oscars and other such awards, beautifully directs this gangster epic; with some of his latest films being slight flops ("Gangs of New York"--I haven't seen it yet, but I heard it's average), I think another gangster film is in store for the future.<p>"Goodfellas" has got everything you go to the movies for: Witty dialogue, great, three-dimensional characters; excellent directing style, and some great actors. "Goodfellas" is an offer you can't refuse.<p>By the way, I think it is appropriate to put a bit of a disclaimer on this review: I would not recommend "Goodfellas" to those that have a problem with violence and/or language, and "Goodfellas" is definitely not one for your kids to watch--it contains extremely strong, pervasive language, and a great deal of strong, realistic violence. I only put this because I am sick of parents taking children to see R-rated films that are not appropriate for children. And this is definitely one of them. <p>Anyway, "Goodfellas" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen.<p>5/5 Stars -</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>After &quot;The Godfather parts 1 and 2&quot; were released, it was hard to believe that Hollywood was ever going to produce a gangster movie that would even equal the quality of those two Hollywood gems. Enter director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. These four made a film that not only expanded on the qualities of the first two &quot;Godfathers,&quot; but also provided different characters and situations not seen in gangster movies of old. Needless to say, it was an instant classic. The four have gone on to become film legends (though DeNiro was already there) and the film is a cherished gem in Hollywood that is still not even 20 years old. Many people cite this film as Scorcese's best, although &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was a bit more poignant. But no one denies that this is an excellent film with imagination, scope, and a take-no-prisoners attitude. One of the coolest films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Some films achieve moments we remember.  Others manage to evoke a time or a place through the careful marshalling of details. The real achievement of GoodFellas is that it does both things so well and so consistently. The amazing visual imagination of Martin Scorsese is the engine that drives it, sculpting one dazzling sequence after another into a cinematic whole. Unlike lesser directors, Scorsese manages to make the visual pyrotechnics look organic; emerging from the material itself, rather than merely being flashy.<p>Henry Hill (Ray Liota) grows up and comes of age in New York during the 60's and 70's.  He is a product of Pop Culture Pressure - if you drive the right car, wear the right clothing, and use the right cologne or mouthwash, you too, can take part in the American Dream and become one of those smiling people in the magazine and TV ads.  The problem is that few of us can legitimately earn the money to fuel that kind of lifestyle and still have enough time to enjoy it. That's the real allure of being a Wiseguy, of being &quot;in the mob&quot;, or &quot;part of a crew&quot;: if you're willing to live (and possibly die) by their code, you can pretty much have it all.  Or so it seems.<p>Of course, Henry learns - as do we - that there is a great price to pay for living high without actually earning it.  Henry gets most everything he wants - a lovely wife (played by Lorraine Bracco), some kids, a couple of houses, and the camaraderie of his &quot;coworkers&quot;; he also gets strung out on cocaine, investigated, arrested, and very nearly &quot;whacked&quot;.  By the end of GoodFellas, Henry Hill should also have learned what becomes obvious to us - that Wiseguy honor is an illusion; that the close-knit mafia &quot;family&quot; of the The Godfather is a literary fiction.  Then again, he probably does know it.  He just doesn't care.  The lifestyle is, itself, a drug that exerts a powerful hold.  Only mortal terror can lure him into the Federal Witness Protection Program.<p>The large ensemble cast features exquisite work by Paul Sorvino, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci, who is given the most memorable scene in the movie - the famous and chilling &quot;You think I'm funny?&quot;  bit.  Rarely mentioned but just as effective is Chuck Low as the hapless Morrie, a guy who just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut.<p>The big disappointment in the DVD edition is that it's lacking in special features.  It's also a "flipper" - you have to turn the disc over halfway through the film to finish watching it.  I would love to see it reissued by Criterion in a dual-layer version with a commentary track by Scorsese himself.  That one would get five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>This movie is just excellent. I love the style of this movie, where the main character does a dialoge talking about his life experiences and then the scene acting them out. The casting for this movie couldn't of been  better, and the acting itself was just great. This is a movie that i enjoy  watching over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>GoodFellas is on top of my "best films of all time" list.  I was one of the people who had bought the previous DVD edition, the infamous "two-sided, no features" release that had been one of the first generation of DVD releases, before the medium evolved into what it is today.  I had been counting the days until they would re-release this film, so I was first in line to get this new edition.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though this edition is much better than the previous one, it very much pales alongside most modern DVD packages.<br /><br />The package aroused many suspicions in me that this was a rush job.  Among my dissatisfactions:<br /><br />- There's no booklet, leaflet, film histories, or printed material of any kind which generally supplements a two-disc release like this;<br /><br />- The film is long, but still under the three-hour mark, and the second disc has three short (eight to 20 minutes), unremarkable documentaries plus a storyboard-film comparison.  Wouldn't all this material have fit on a single disc?  Dragon:  The Bruce Lee Story had three times the media and was only a single disc.  If they didn't have enough material, why did they put up the illusion that there are two discs' worth?<br /><br />- There are only two commentaries, and one of them isn't even complete.  The "Cop and Crook" commentary is interesting, applying the great idea of bringing back Henry Hill (on whose life this film and its source book Wiseguy were based) and the prosecutor who had sponsored his Witness Protection Program, Edward McDonald.  It's not a very illuminating commentary, but it's still good to see what Hill is like today.  However, the "Cast and Crew" commentary is suspect.  Not only does it not cover the entire film, I actually suspect it was not recorded as a commentary, but edited from fragmentary interviews.  So rarely do the cast and director on this track comment on the specific scenes, the way a commentary should, that I don't think they were watching the film as they were speaking; I think the production company simply mixed the sound louder and created the illusion that this was a commentary track.  I don't know for sure if this is the case, but if it is, I consider it very dishonest marketing.  Don't call it a commentary unless it is one!<br /><br />- I found absolutely no new insights into Martin Scorsese or the film from the additional materials.  The "making of" documentary is the usual "heap praise upon the director" baloney.  Come on, do we actually *need* you to tell us that Scorsese is great?  How about giving some anecdotes and insight into the film instead?<br /><br />All of the above adds up to a very underwhelming DVD release of a film that's possibly the greatest American film of the last 20 years.  However, there is still one incentive to own it -- the entire film is contained, without interruptions, on one disc.  So unlike with the old DVD release, you can actually watch the whole film now without having to turn the disc over.  So this is still the best available version of the film out there.  However, I remain displeased.  After years of waiting, and being disappointed, why does this edition fail to satisfy?<br /><br />I can only hope that the impossible would happen -- that Warner Bros. would let The Criterion Collection take a stab at this film, and do it justice.  It will never happen, but the very idea does whet the appetite.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Of all of the "mob" movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, "Goodfellas" most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the "definitive" mobster movies.  Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling "based on a true story" nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.<p>"Goodfellas" is a powerful film based on the true life best seller "Wiseguy" by Nicholas Pileggi.  More specifically, it's based on the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liota), who along with his pals Jimmy "The Gent" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film.  Needless to say, the performances by these actors, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are nothing short of superb.<p>The premise:<p>Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, "Goodfellas" tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them.  After all, how could anybody resist a life in which if you're part of the "organization," there is nothing that you cannot have and you have the fearful respect of everybody around you, as long as you're continuing to make money and not stepping on any of the important people's toes.<p>As the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.<p>From the opening frame to the final credits, "Goodfellas" is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies.  Fair warning though, this movie "is not" for the faint of heart or the squeamish, for it is fairly graphic at times, which serves to enhance the nature of this film but is not too good on the eyes.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>This DVD was released in 1997 as one of the early transfers, therefore it's not loaded down with an exceptional amount of special features, which is fine because it's all about the film.  I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re-released as a "Special Edition" with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.<p>What is does have:<p>- A remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Production notes<br />- Two theatrical trailers</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Claimed by many as one of the greatest films of all time! The grestest movie of the 90's! And, one of Martin Scorses's best films to date! I have to say, I'm inclined to agree with ALL three statements. Martin Scorsese is one of the few filmmakers who has a true &quot;ear&quot; for dialogue. His movies have characters that are &quot;real&quot;. You know that the way the characters are portrayed in the film, is probably the way the &quot;real life&quot; characters act and speak. But this is something that has always been said about Scorsese. His talent for making characters that seem &quot;real&quot;. The screenplay written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese himslef, is truly Oscar worthy. The acting by Robert De Niro (&quot;Jimmy&quot; Conway), Ray Liotta (Henry Hill), Joe Pesci (We should all know by now, he won an Oscar for this role playing Tommy DeVito) Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill), and Paul Sorvino (&quot;Paulie&quot; Cicero) is amazing to watch! Every detail about this film is perfect. This is a movie all movie fans have to watch. There really isn't to much more I can say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. Just buy this movie, sit back and enjoy a film you'll never forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Henry Hill died this week. He is the 'Goodfella', that this film follows. Henry, somehow, he survived all the 'wiseguys'.<br /><br />'Goodfellas' , is thought by most people, to be in the top ten films ever made. It is the best memoir or rememberances of life in the Mafia. I watched it again, and like always, was startled by the violence, the money, the greed, the attitude of non-chalance for the human life. Ray Liotta plays Henry, and this was a performance of a lifetime. He shines, this role is him. What a handsome guy, where is he, now? Robert de Neiro plays  Jim Conway, who loves to steal, that is how he gets his highs. Paul Sorbino plays Paul, the don. Joe Pesci plays Tommy, violent temper, a real psychopath . This is the grown up team, the Mafia in action. They steal goods, everything that was easily disposed of, lobsters and fish went quickly to restaurants ad eaten just as quickly. Razors, anything that did not have a method of tracing. They collected money from merchants and strong armed them. What they did not do was sell drugs until late into their lives.  Later Henry' was the drug man and big money was made, and even his wife, Lorraine Bracco, who plays Karen was addicted to the drugs, the money, the greed.<br /><br />The story is told by Henry, his love of the gangsters, always from an early age. His story is one of working his way up the ladder. Karen tells the story of the wives. It was a closed group. You saw no one else, knew no one else. Friday nights were for girlfriends, Saturdays for wives. Both were brought to the Copacabano, where the best was theirs. Through the years money slipped through their fingers. Jail was just another environment like home, but you couldn't go out. Everyone was paid off. And, then the time came when the drugs became too much and Henry and his gang were arrested. Henry turned stool pigeon and he went into the witness protection racket. He survived.<br /><br />Fabulous film by Martin Scoresese, It was written  by Scoresese and Nicholas Pilleggi. Pileggi wrote the book, 'Wiseguys', from which the film was taken. Superb, loved every minute. Well acted, directed and filmed.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-16-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RR0">Martin Scorsese Collection (After Hours/Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore/Goodfellas/Mean Streets/Who's That Knocking At My Door?)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RP2">Mean Streets (Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>If you like a good "Mafia-slaughtering-everybody-film," then you'll discover that this is the very best one ever made to date. I seriously doubt that Hollywood will ever yield a better one.<br /><br />The story is one of the Mafia glitz and how they were, to a man, ruthless murderers that we love to glorify because they got to do all the stuff we couldn't afford to do, either financially or legally. Only the best for these guys. The setting is the 50s, 60s, and early 70s.<br /><br />The top character is played by Joe Pesci, who loves to shoot and stab any fool who gives him the slightest bit of verbal guff. He's a diminutive figure who is out to prove that a hunting knife and a .357 Magnum manifest all the equalizer he needs to become a "Made Man".<br /><br />So this pack of Mafia scoundrels steal from, hijack, rob, and assault all whom are unfortunate enough to enter the circle of their realm and this even includes a number of their own brotherhood when the FBI begins to turn up the heat, generating an insider snitch here and there. The old conflict about some mafia members not wanting to enter the dope business also raises the stakes.<br /><br />This is a violent and graphic film in terms of language, murder, and darn near everything else.... and I loved it all. The soundtrack is equally incredible. Political correctness be damned!</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Quite simply one of the best films ever made, and now its available on a proper DVD (i.e. not double sided).<br />Based on the true story of Henry Hill it covers his life as gangster from young lad to middle-age. The film has everything, the script and direction are perfect and the performances from the cast are outstanding. For a film that 2 hours and 19 mins long, not a moment is wasted.<br />Scorcese peaked with this film and although he has made worthy and noteable films since, none match this one. Scene after memorable scene occurs, the killing in the bar, entering the nightclub (the famous long shot) and perhaps best of all the 'funny guy' scene.<br />Scorcese frequently refereneces other films and I wonder if the scene where Henry attacks the guy with the butt of his gun is a direct reference to The Godfather when Sonny beats up his sisters boyfriend.<br />In an interview Scorcese said that at the end of the 80's there were a lot of films coming out with fast cutting, and this film was his response "you wanna it fast - lets make it really fast". Nowhere is this felt more than near the end when the pace of the film reflects Henrys high on cocaine.<br />The extras on the special edition are pretty good, but you shouldn't be buying this film for the extras. Go treat yourself, a film like this doesn't happen very often and its an essential purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>This is one of those rush rush get it out jobs and you can tell. The movie isn't even all on one side. There's no commentary and this is one of those DVDs that tries touting the selection menu as one of the "special features." Unless you can get this at a discount, wait until the real DVD with real extras comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>This is the best mob film ever. Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances. Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as he does in every other Scorsese film. New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.<br /><br />Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas? "I say Yes." There are three reason's why I think this is true. 1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end. 2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with different stories.<br /><br />I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen. I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.<br /><br />Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's 1990 epic mob film on the real life Henry Hill (Ray Liotta.)  Probably one of the greatest mob films along with Coppola's 'Godfather' films bringing all the action and drama of life with the Italian mob.<br /><br />The film follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates played by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci gives probably one of the most memorable performances in his career and the film as the sociopathic Tommy DeVito: "You think I'm funny?"<br /><br />I can't find a single defect in this gripping film. Every aspect of the film was done with the traditional brilliance of Martin Scorsese.  Great script, direction, and acting make this film one which you can watch over and over without ever getting tired.  Definitely a film that should be in every wiseguy's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Interestingly, I rewatched Goodfellas, #94 on the AFI top 100, right after rewatching A Clockwork Orange, #46 on the AFI top 100. Both are about an enthusiasm for violence. Both tie music into what is going on with the plot. Watching them back to back, even accepting how "groundbreaking" A Clockwork Orange is with its alternate universe and its invented language, I still think Goodfellas should rank far higher than it. The acting, the plot, and the insight in Goodfellas is simply phenomenal.<br /><br />First, we start with the actors. In A Clockwork Orange there is Malcolm McDowell, and while he's good, I'm not sure one person alone can stand up to Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and the many other fantastic actors that are everywhere you turn in Goodfellas. Every single person is simply amazing. Even the "bit parts" like Michael Imperioli's "Spider" character get you interested. You are watching the very best of the best.<br /><br />And what they are playing is a real life story. This isn't an invention or fantasy. This really happened. These characters, their intrigues, their lies and deceptions and lust for violence, all of this was real. The men joking around with the mistress while the wife went to the family functions, the assumption that violence could happen at any time, this was the life they lived in.<br /><br />The music here is simply phenomenal. It sets you into the timeframe, and you can literally watch as the years unroll. It's not just the music, it's the hair styles, the cars, the decor of the rooms, everything. You can feel yourself reliving the decades and the feelings that they brought.<br /><br />The characters evolve over time. They rebel and feel angst and come to accept and then embrace what is happening around them.<br /><br />It's interesting because there's the same lust for violence here as in A Clockwork Orange. The characters enjoy pummeling another person. When Lorraine's character is roughed up by a neighborhood slick-guy, and Ray goes in to teach him a lesson, Ray *wants* to beat him up and put him in his place. When Joe feels disrespected in the bar, he wants to beat the guy into a bloody pulp, and he does. The violence is a normal, natural part of life.<br /><br />The women, unfortunately, hold the same be-used-and-often role in this movie as well. Women are there to be wives, kicking out kids and attending functions, or as mistresses, proving sex. In both cases they are supposed to be good natured, appreciate their part, and not attempt to change anything. A woman who complains at all about the small portion of life she's allowed can be beaten or worse.<br /><br />Still, I do at least give Goodfellas credit for giving part of the story through Lorraine's eyes. We see how hard it was for her, as the wife, to know there was a mistress around, that she "lost" her husband for days a week into that woman's arms, and that there was nothing she could do about it. She couldn't divorce, she couldn't complain. She just had to take it. The only other women she could ever talk with were other mob wives in the exact same situation. All the advice she got was "at least he's not in jail".<br /><br />However, in terms of the Bechdel test, it fails. The women rarely talk with each other, and when they do, it's about their men.<br /><br />A powerful look into a very real segment of society - and as much as it glamorizes how nice it was at times to be in a mob environment, it also shows the darker underside of it. While it might be fun while it lasted, it didn't necessarily last long.<br /><br />A great, powerful, well acted film. Well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a great movie that is suppose to be a true story. Movies like Good Fellas and A Bronx Tale put me in a fantasie of being married to an Italian mobster. I know it's not the greatist life to choose from. I know there are a lot of dangers being married to the mob. But I think it is exciting. And would love the life of popularity and respect.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>Just watched this on AMC the other day on a small old 27" and after maybe 20 times, STILL I rate this film as phenomenal in script, acting, directing, set design, etc. Typically one can find inconsistencies and other issues after many viewings, but this one stands the test of time.

I was not really interested in seeing it until a friend mentioned "it is a classic - a must see, even if it if violent and graphic - it is based on a true story."<br /><br />After seeing it I realized this was the story the  popular TV Series, The Sopranos,  is based on. Mundane tasks of everyday life with family and friends are framed next to the violence of mob life.  The stark contrasting brings the mob in focus. It follows the life of Henry Hill; the movie is narrated by him throughout and later by both him and his wife Karen.<br /><br />The first line in the movie is "As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."  This is from a young pre-teen named Henry Hill in 1955.  He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn with an abusive father,  an overwhelmed mother and four siblings.  He did not care about being President, he worshiped gangsters and wanted to be one with every fiber of his being.  He saw shady transactions at a cab company across from his building.  He knew blackmail, kickback's, gambling was going on - this was his escape from boredom.  He wanted excitement and idolized the mob.  Somehow he got a part-time job parking their Cadillacs and waiting on them hand and foot.  He was paid well and made more money than the kids in his school, plus had "respect."<br /><br />Once the movie started, it engrossed as well as shocked.  The brutality and killing was "part of the job" .  Even though the mobsters acted tough and cool - you could feel the stress of the job was with them.  Scenes showing how the secrets were kept, how limits on communication, avoiding "witnesses", and the irrational "blowups" over nothing ended innocent people's lives.  It relieved their stress for a short period of time, but caused more stress hiding bodies.  Mobsters liked the excitement of what they did, but watched constantly over their shoulders for a snitch, as well as paid high fees for "protection."  The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.  Lorraine Brocco, who played Karen Hill was great.  (She looked so familiar - then I realized she also plays the psychiatrist on the TV Series of the Soparanos.)<br /><br />Martin Scorsese did a brilliant job with the directing and camera work.  The rock and roll music from the 60's was a good "place setter of time."  The script moved well and the characters were well developed, believable and real.  It was a great mob movie.  Ray Liotta was fantastic as well as Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro - all a "cut above."  I understand why this film was recommended as a "must see" -if you can stand the violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Goodfellas is a good movie, destined to stamp its mark on the modern age. It is a sort of ersatz Godfather - tighter, easier, more accessible than the great Coppola Trilogy (or rather, parts I and II). Scorsese uses a fast paced, dialogue heavy, boiler plated filmic style to tell the story (based on the true one) of mob informer Henry Hill. Perhaps because he uses a real story as his base, it has an oddly lopsided narrative structure - the film ascends to a nasty and brilliant climax two thirds of the way through, culminating in the famous 'Layla' scene - the Jim Gordon piano the musical background to a number of 'whacked' bodies turning up all over town. But by the end the pace has fizzled a little, and the last third is fairly thin fare given the explosive might of what has gone before.<br /><br />The film is gangster lite - the customs, routines, tropes, jargon are explained frequently by a rather intrusive voiceover. None of the dark roiling of the great gangster films - brutal killings with no explanation. Still, it is a great cast and the movie is brilliantly filmed. Liotta looks a little overwhelmed at the role he has landed, but De Niro is sublime, and Lorraine Bracco is beautiful, brash and vulnerable as Hill's no nonsense Jewish wife from the five towns.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about. Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about. There's no shortage of outstanding scenes but the film becomes increasingly repetitive as it underlines and escalates its variations on a theme until it feels like it's all style with nothing more underneath than a two-and-a-half hour episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous.<br /><br />Good extras on the two-disc version, but it's hard to buy into all the hype for the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Hadn't seen Goodfellas in years, last night's screening reminded me how close to perfect this movie is.<br /><br />Scorsese and company really hit it out of the park here. I actually think Liotta is better than DeNiro, who is tremendous. As are Pesci and Bracco. Everything feels authentic; these folks clearly grew up amongst real wiseguys and convey the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br />What really lifts this flick above, however, is the perfect pacing and editing. The story moves tightly and quickly forward, with few wasted moments despite its length.<br /><br />It's also quite funny at times, though I always question whether making truly evil folks humorous (some of the real old-school wiseguys were not very funny) is a smart idea, but it's art, so each to his own.<br /><br />One thing for sure: the Sopranos pulled at least half their cast from this movie! Why mess with success?<br /><br />I disagree with Amazoon's own reviewer who calls this as good as the Godfather, though. As excellent as Goodfellas is, the first two Godfathers achieve a level of greatness and gravitas that few other movies ever have.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Goodfellas is a complete classic. If only all movies moved this well and looked this good and had this many memorable performances...</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A long film about "Italian" crime in New York in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in  prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Scorsese's mob masterpiece, which he co-scripted with Pileggi, is an intimate, insider's glimpse into the rise and fall of the Mafia from the 1950's onward. Period music, costumes, and a bold, intrusive shooting style help evoke a heady, secret world of crime without consequences, a world bound to implode. Liotta is strangely sympathetic and all-too-human as Hill, DeNiro frighteningly combustible as Jimmy, and Pesci electrifying as the savage, psychotic Tommy (he nabbed an Oscar for this). Quite simply one of the best crime movies ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>What a wonderful inspiring film-making by the only director who could possible make the film, the undisputed classic.

The film is based on the real life gangster Henry Hill.<br /><br />This film is very memorable by top class performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but Ray Liotta steals the show. There are only two movies on organized crime that you need to see. The Godfather and Goodfellas. Goodfellas brilliantly and according to many real goodfellas, accurately depicts mob life. In my opinion,  this is a true 5 star film. From the screenplay to the acting to the directing, it's a masterpiece of filmmaking. It just seems as though everyone in the movie is custom fit to their role. Very, very few films achieve that. So many memorable lines and scenes, its too many to list.

Nearly perfect in terms of casting, acting, directing, and so on, this is director Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Raging Bull) at his finest.  Revolving around the life of mobster turned rat Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, perfectly cast), we bear witness to his rise in the mafia.  His wife Karen (a pre-Sopranos Lorraine Bracco) is along for the ride as she discovers more and more of Henry's "other family" which both frightens and excites her.  Liotta and Bracco are excellent, and the rest of the cast including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role are the stuff that film legends are made of.  Scorsese perfectly captured the time period, and his use of music in certain scenes could not be more dead on.  I still don't know if this is indeed the best mob movie ever (it's tough to top the Godfather), but if it isn't, it's pretty close.  Look for Samuel L. Jackson in a minor role, as well as pre-Sopranos stars Michael Imperrioli and Tony Sirico.  Warner Bros. finally decided to give Goodfellas the DVD treatment it deserves, and the commentaries by Scorsese and crew and Hill himself are worth the price of admission alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>One of Scorcese's best, better then casino, about as good as gangs of new york.

It's based on the Nicholas Pileggi true crime book about Henry Hill, a low-level hood in the Lucchese crime family in the 60s and 70s.  Tracing his rise from fetcher for local mafiosi in his  50s Brooklyn neighborhood, the film tracks Henry to the end of the line: the Federal Witness Protection program.  Along the way Scorsese stages some great scenes, charting the dangerous, thrilling, and ultimately miserable life of a mob hustler.  Ray Liotta has a perfect sleaza factor working as Hill.  However, he is almost too nice to be convincing as the same guy in the source book.  The real Henry Hill comes off as a real lowlife in the book, a guy who deserves no sympathy.  Ironically, years after leaving the program Hill now runs a website, writes wiseguy-related books, and calls into Howard Stern, though he's still watching his back.  <p>The cast is Classic Mafia Cast.  Robert DeNiro plays the greedy and devious Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway, Joe Pesci plays Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning role(!) that basically defined the Pesci persona for life, and Paul Sorvino plays a portly Mob captain who has an amazing scene where he emotes while frying up some tasty sausages, tears in his eyes, handing Henry a massive wad of cash.<p>The film can't be recommended enough.  It was robbed at Oscar time, criminally losing to Dances With Wolves, but it doesn't matter.  This has sealed itself as one of the ultimate guy films of all time.<p>Unfortunately, the DVD is absolutely appalling.  You actual have to flip the disc over in the middle of the film to finish it.  This is simply unacceptable.  I haven't seen another like it, I mean, why bother with the DVD format?  The film looks and sound just fine, it's great, but how about some extras?  This film was highly praised and will hold up for a long time, so how about something?  <p>Not sure if Scorsese can be bothered or has not been asked to do special edition discs of more of his films.  The Taxi Driver DVD is very nice, for instance.  Goodfellas has a trailer, whoopee, and again, it's two-sided.  Lame.<p>Buy if you've never seen this, else if you have a widescreen VHS this DVD won't offer you a whole lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This film is based on a book written by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy) as was Casino based on another of his books (Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas). Both were directed by Scorcese and two of the major characters in both films are portrayed by DeNiro ("Ace" Rothstein and Jimmy Conway) and Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro and Tommy DeVito). For me, these are the only significant similarities between the two film classics. True, Scorcese effectively employs a number of documentary techniques in both (especially during the first half of Casino) but the setting of GoodFellas is essentially a neighborhood whereas Casino examines the gambling culture of Las Vegas, represented by the Tangiers which is owned by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. Moreover, the character Henry Hill (portrayed as an adult by Ray Liotta) is used as a device by which to explain rites of passage into the local crime world whereas the focal point of Casino is Rothstein as he becomes (in effect) the COO of a major casino and quickly establishes total local control of its operations, then (for various reasons) makes personal decisions which eventually place him and his absentee bosses in harm's way. One of the several reasons I admire Scorcese so much is his talent (indeed genius) for creating so-called "minor" but nonetheless memorable, indeed unforgettable characters. For example, Paul Cicero (portrayed by Paul Sorvino) in this film, a character which may have had some influence on the creation of another character, Tony Soprano. Cicero embodies menace precisely because his personality is so understated. His selective use of a paternalistic posture (reminiscent of Johnny Friendly's, a less-subtle character played by Lee J. Cobb in On the Waterfront) belies his absolute determination to sustain absolute control over his crime operations. Comparisons and contrasts of this film with Casino are probably inevitable. I think both are classics but for different reasons. The former is anchored in local experience, somewhat "small-time" crime if you will, whereas the latter examines the culture of an entire industry in which the scale and impact of crime are far greater. (The same point could be made about Godfather I and Godfather II, although I much prefer to view them in a chronological sequence.) Even in Casino, however, Scorcese constantly locks in on two or three characters in a specific situation. He is at his best when dramatizing the dynamics of verbal and physical violence in small scale (e.g. Raging Bull and The Gangs of New York). In my opinion, like Tolstoy, Scorcese's vision may be "epic" in certain films but the impact of his art is best measured in quite human terms...scene by scene, juxtaposing statement and response, action and reaction.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>It's hard to pick what Martin Scorsese movie is the best.  As a matter of fact, "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" were the best movies of the previous decades.  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was brilliant.  Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like "Citizen Kane".  Probably the best gangster movie of all time!!  And without question the best film of the past decade.<br /><br />UPDATE!!  I just purchased the Two disc DVD set of Martin Scorsese's finest work.  Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film. There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob. But my personal favorite is the "real" Henry Hill and the FBI agent who help him turn in Jimmy Conway and Paul Cicero giving their observations on the DVD extras. This is a must-have for fans of the movie.<br /><br />Note: I still get a kick out of many of the actors in this film who would appear later on in "The Sopranos".</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>I was very young yet know how to speak english when this movie came out but when I noticed it's present I watched it from front to back and over and over again!

There are probably over millions of reviews of this film and I am the last one to be writing one but his is A MUST OWN for any DVD library owner because someone atleast once in your lifetime will ask you about the film Goodfellas!

This film contains raw language, graphic violence, and drug use.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese has the unique talent of making a scene beautiful and disturbing at the same time. One sequence, probably one of the most memorable in all cinema history, is the "Layla" scene. For those who have seen it, no explanation is needed. What one sees on the screen is repulsive, disgusting, but at the same time, it is beautiful. The movie has too many cuss words and too much violence, but all of that can be forgetten because the director keeps such intensity that one is simply swept off their feet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is one of the best films of all time everything in this movie is good. But the DVD is not nothing speciel. The violence is not as bad as what people have been saying its bad. But if you think this is violent take a look at Meance II Society or Casino which are far worst in that. Anyway good movie but not so good DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Martin Scorcese has directed many cinematic masterpieces, with Goodfellas being the best in his storied career.  Based on true story of mobster turned snitch, Henry Hill, the movie moves from Henry's teenage years as a fledgling to his rise in ranks to his ultimate downfall.  Shot at a frenetic pace and mixing violence and a weird sense of humor, the film takes us on a roller coaster ride.  Ray Liotta play Henry and he narrates the film along with his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Mr. Liotta plays Henry as guy whom simply loves the life he leads.  What could be better than being in the mob, the money, the women, the drugs, the respect.  He can't understand how anyone could work in a boring 9-5 job.  Ms. Bracco is annoyingly good as the nagging wife from a Jewish family who is thrown into the Italian culture.  Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito who is another hood.  Tommy is basically a psychotic killer and Mr. Pesci plays him with a manic humor.  Robert De Niro is Jimmy Burke, who as Henry says, just loves to steal.  He ends up becoming paranoid after committing the biggest heist in history.  Paul Sorvino is Paulie, the family's leader and he plays him with the attitude and walk of a man who is worthy of the immense respect he gets. No movie has ever incorporated music into scenes as well as Mr. Scorcese does here. Whether it's Donovan's &quot;Atlantis&quot; playing during the beating of a man or the piano coda from &quot;Layla&quot; played when bodies of people Jimmy had knocked off are found, the music truly sets the scene.  Again, as it did ten years prior, the Academy gave the best director award to an actor turned first-time director.  This time Kevin Coster won for the overbearing Dances With Wolves and Mr. Scorcese was deprived of an award he so richly deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>If my title seems like hyperbole, you obviously haven't seen this movie.  With all due respects to Mr. Coppola, &quot;Goodfelleas&quot; blows away even &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in  the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the  most creditble crime story ever told.  Unfolding over the course of three  decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid-level mobster who  only turned state's evidence against his fellows after he had no other  choice.  The movie is bursting with memorable characters; Joe Pesci as the  hotheaded mobster, Robert DiNiro as the cold blooded killer-thief, Paul  Sorvino as the head of the family.  If these guys don't put a chill through  you, nothing will.  This is the best movie from one of America's greatest  directors.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>This is the best mob film ever!A true standout among the genre(maybe better than GODFATHER).Soundtrack kicks!

While not my favorite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies.<br /><br />As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatized and glamorized to a certain extent, the essence of this film in my observation is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.<br /><br />The sham of the Mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a "wise guy", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organized crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish.<br /><br />The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, is fantastic. Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never loses sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on his usual top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the "stars". Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but says a lot through his expressions.<br /><br />This film draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film. 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>"Goodfellas," #94 on AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time, is widely regarded as the best mob movie ever made by critics and audiences alike. Written by Nicholas Pileggi and based on his book "Wiseguy", "Goodfellas" charts the meteoric rise and catastrophic crash and burn of tough guy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Hill was a small time thug whose involvement with the mafia paved the way for the most daring narcotics ring ever established in the U.S. Hill's teaming with the very dapper, very savvy, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the very foul-mouthed Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) is at once fortuitous and frustrating as Hill watches Conway and De Vito rise to great heights within organized crime while he remains the front runner of lowly accord. The trio's mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) befriends Hill but the association is short lived after their latest heist goes horribly awry. Brutally violent and viscerally disarming, the first time viewing experience of "Goodfellas" is very much like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn - particularly in the latter half when Hill's own drug addiction leads to a manic and paranoid existence.<br /><br />As for the quality of this newly minted DVD, there is a marginal improvement between this disc and the original flipper from Warner.  Flesh tones are overall accurate but there continues to be a reddish tint in certain scenes. A murky haze continues to be present during the early scenes.  Digital anomalies are completely absent for an overall smooth look that is appealing. Fine details, black levels and contrast levels are bang on. The image quality will surely NOT disappoint.<br /><br />The soundtrack to "Goodfellas" is a very finely wrought 5.1 presentation. Dialogue is perhaps a bit more front sounding than one would expect - though no less bold and ironically crystal clear. The effects and music tracks really pack a wallop.<br /><br />Extras include commentary tracks, plus a host of featurettes and a thorough documentary on the making of the film. Overall, this is a great edition to any home theater aficionado's library and it comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Goodfellas" is the story of boyhood friends who grow to become hardcore criminals. The depth of their ventures range from drugs to cold blooded murder, yet their own success gradually divides them as a unit. Treachery doesn't even spare those on the throne of criminal royalty, as the battle to avoid prosecution and jail time leads to sell outs for the sake of self-preservation. It is a graphic and entertaining gangster film.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990)<br /><br />I hated Casino when I went to see it back in 1995. I now understand why; Casino was Scorsese's attempt to remake Goodfellas, but like Brian DePalma attempting to remake Curtis Hanson's L. A. Confidential in The Black Dahlia, the later film ended up somehow being both a shadow of the original and, if unintentionally, a parody of the original as well. Everything about Casino that ended up awful was fantastic in Goodfellas.<br /><br />Based on Nicholas Pileggi's autobiography, Goodfellas follows three guys--Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), and Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)--who all want to be mobsters. (Granted, as Tommy is the only Italian in the bunch, they don't have much of a chance.) From the outside, we're perfectly aware that they, and their band of assorted outlaws, are mostly comic relief for the actual made men in the area; they're well-meaning, but usually either not forward-looking enough when planning things, or simply inept. But they're exceptionally-drawn, all three of them perfectly-done pictures of what my in-laws are wont to call "bags of neuroses". We, as the viewers, are alternately amused and horrified by their doings. Meanwhile, when they're not out doing flunky jobs for the mob or trying to get ahead with side jobs of their own, their private lives are even more of a mess. It stands to reason that even the most thick-headed flunky will eventually get tired of riding on someone else's coattails and find some way to push the envelope. When it happens, it's pure screen magic. Then comes the denouement, and Scorsese proves himself a master of pace--the denouement is longer than the buildup, and if anything, even more compelling, as the three of them take different directions towards either redemption or self-destruction.<br /><br />Simply put, an amazing piece of moviemaking. If you haven't seen it, do. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>The definitive mob movie. Scorcese is the master of the genre.

Some movies, very few, are technically better. Some may hold a plot better but none combine the two aspects as effectively. Every character is meticulously developed and the camera work belongs only to Mr. Scorcese. Women may not love this movie as much as men however, Ms. Bracco has given us a strong and important female lead. If you love movies and haven't seen this movie... see it.  This is a great movie, telling of Henry Hill's 30 years in organized crime.  I get teared-up thinking about how amazing some of the scenes in this film are: Joe Pesci asks if Ray Liotta thinks he's funny, Ray drives around in a drug haze, Ray and his girlfriend walk through the kitchen at a nightclub, Ray pistol whips his girlfriend's date who was &quot;all hands,&quot; Ray shows off his new TV, Ray's wife tries to break down the door of his girlfriend's house, Robert DeNiro receives upsetting news on a payphone. However, a great movie like this deserves at least a better DVD. I am hoping that Warner Bros. will release another version with an anamorphic transfer and - oh yeah - the movie all on one side of the disc.  However, the movie is so good, it overcomes the DVD's shortcomings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>NOTE:  THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE DVD, NOT THE MOVIE.

Why does the movie have to be on two sides???  I don't get it.  Yeah, it might be a long movie, but they were able to fit "Casino" all on one side.  So what's up with that?<p>There better be a special or collector's edition coming out soon, because this movie needs one bad.  Not just because it's a classic and a masterpiece, but because it needs to be on ONE side!  When I buy a DVD, I expect just that.<p>Other than the movie being on both sides, the DVD really lacks in special features, the picture quality is so-so, and the sound could've been improved in some parts.<p>Again, "Goodfellas" is a masterpiece in my mind, and it deserves 5 stars.  But the DVD is just awful.  In fact, calling the DVD "awful" is being too polite.<p>Warner Bros.:  Come out with a special edition, for crying out-loud!!!<p>If you love this movie, don't get the DVD.  Just get it on VHS and wait until a better version comes out.  TRUST ME on this one.  Unless they have updated the movie and placed it all on one side.

BUT THE DVD WAS GIVIN' ONE OF THE WORST TREATMENTS. I BECOME APPALLED WHEN I'M WRAPPED UP IN A HELLA GREAT MOVIE LIKE "GOODFELLAS" AND I'M INTERRUPTED BY HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD LIKE SOME 1980's LASER DISC. I AM SURE THAT A SERIOUS UPGRADE IS COMING SOON. NOW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF... IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE IN 1990. GOODFELLAS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES... GREAT PERFORMANCES ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN A SCORSESE'S PICTURE, NO EXCEPTIONS HERE. ROBERT DE NIRO, JOE PESCI & RAY LIOTTA ARE THE LEADS AND THEY ARE ALL IN TOP FORM. THE SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES BY LORRIANE BRACCO & PAUL SORVINO ARE ALSO VERY CREDITABLE. SAYING THE LEAST "GOODFELLAS" IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I SUPPOSE THIS DVD WILL DO FOR NOW. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF STARS BASED ON (HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD). SCORSESE'S FILM IS A LEAGUE ABOVE PERFECTION AND SHOULD NOT HAVE IT'S AVERAGE LOWERED BASED ON PACKAGING OR POOR CHOICES ON HOW THE DVD WAS DESIGNED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's greatness as a director would be established if this was the only film he ever made. How does one even begin to praise this masterpiece that simply has no weaknesses?  The casting and script writing of &quot;Good Fellas&quot; are near perfect, and the story based on the true life experiences of Henry Hill provides us with a brutal and unsentimental view of a social milieu that is both treacherous and violent.  These are not men of honor, but ruthless back stabbers who don't hesitate to betray close friends for a few pieces of silver.  Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money.  Those like Jimmy Conway (Robert Di Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) befriend Hill in their own dubious manner.  Hill looks upon them as brothers, but it seems they merely perceive him as a fellow party animal who aptly carries out his responsibilities to the group.  Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill is a woman who marries her man knowing full well about his dangerous side.  Hill introduces his wife to drugs and often places her in harm's way.  Their marriage is a never ending dysfunctional disaster.  It totally redefines the meaning of family values.<p>This is not a film for someone seeking a romanticized depiction of organized crime. These people are monsters who prey on their fellow citizens.  Scorsese refuses to pretend that they have many redeeming qualities.  Their virtues are few and far between,  and one only regrets that it takes so long for the authorities to put them behind bars.  Hill's later entry into a federal witness protection program is hard to swallow.  &quot;Good Fellas&quot; is hard hitting and honest.  I easily place it among the top one hundred movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>This is a good movie it's show life inside the mafia, but the GODFATHER got into more detail.<br />I rate this dvd a 4 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to.<br /><br />The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about "Goodfellas," it may very well be Eric Clapton's "Layla" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.<br /><br />Without a doubt, "Goodfellas" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This film is certainly one of Scorcese's best although to say it matches the calibre of Coppola's work on "The Godfather I &/or II" would be stretching it.  It's a good film though that's based on a true story and succeeds admirably in portraying a no-holds-barred story of what life in the mafia is like and is like a good adjunct to the whole "Godfather" franchise.<br /><br />This dvd version though isn't perfect as although the sound quality is good and sounded like it was a Dolby 5.1 Surround setup on my system but the picture quality hasn't been restored leaving a lot of frames with those irritating white spots.  I note that a Blu-ray version has been released and so here's hoping they took the opportunity to clean up the picture quality a little bit more.  No special features of note here as well but overall, if you don't mind the few picture imperfections and if you are not into the making-of documentaries or cast interviews then this dvd version should suffice.<br /><br />My recommendation though is to get the Blu-ray version but if you need to get the standard version, this dvd will do if you can do without the extras.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is definitely an improvement over the dvd release I reviewed above but as far as comparison with other blu-ray releases that are out there this ranks as average.  The good thing is that they got rid of virtually all the white spots although the vertical scratch line on De Niro's face is still there but overall at least picture quality-wise we get a vast improvement over the dvd.  Sound-wise the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is still good but not a great deal better than the dvd release.  The Special Features section is vastly improved over the dvd with making-of documentaries and even a short interview with the real Henry Hill.  Overall this is much better than the dvd release but it is not perfect and hopefully they will release a future blu-ray version in a nifty digibook format and a more perfect picture quality soon.<br /><br />Verdict: mixed bag but definitely better than the standard dvd release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Maybe it was all of the hype that this movie has as baggage, but I just don't think of this movie as better than the Godfather (and there are people that do). Don't get me wrong, I thought it was really good, but it has some problems. I couldn't believe the continuity problems this movie has. For example, when Ray Liota is in prison, his kid's toy blocks keep appearing and disappearing or they are in different positions. That is just one scene, and I can remember at least two other times when it happens. It is just really distracting and pulls me out of the movie. The movie also has some slow spots and is best during the second act. Overall, a good film, but I actually like Casino more than I liked this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>Everyone knows the movie, so which is the home video version to own?  The HD-DVD, of course, but only by a slim margin.  The differences between this HD edition and the standard edition are not quite the leap of other releases.  Yes, this movie does benefit from the higher resolution.  It just does not pop off the screen like so many other HD releases.  Perhaps it is not meant to shine as brightly when you consider the artistic intent of the cinematographer.  Still other HD editions of dark films such as Million Dollar Baby and (to a lesser extent) Ray, I still think that more could have been done from the encoding side to cring out more details.  Perhaps the length of the movie played a part...who knows.  In any case, my purpose is to review this edition.  Surely it is still the one to own, beating all other home video presentations to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>man, goodfellas is one of the best, and stays real on the mafias way of life. no beating around the bush, gives it to you strait. the whole story, the drugs, the profanity, the beatings, the betrayel. beautifully done. scorsese out did himself on this one. he's a great director and this was just a masterpiece. brilliant putting robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci together. they were terrific. they just bring that mafia vibe, to the table. robet de niro is the man in just about every movie he does. it shows you the all the good: money, sex, drugs, and the power, along with all the bad: betrayel, crime, addiction, and death. you can't trust nobody, and you can't let this stuff get to your head. if you can't stay true your finished. it feels so good when you're on top, but when you fall there's no turning back, you get what's coming to you. great movie, perfect as it is, and wonderful potrayel of this underworld.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Martin Scorcese's epic tale of the rise and fall of small-time Mafioso Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates is riveting storytelling that is often as densely packed with information about the details and culture of mob life as a documentary.  As a boy, Hill aspires to the power and wealth of the wiseguys he sees around the neighborhood.  As he rises through the ranks, accumulating money, power, and a beautiful wife (Lorraine Bracco), Scorcese shows us how seductive this lifestyle can be.  Yet he never flinches from its basic brutality and the thuggish mindset that money cannot change.  In the end, the concept of honor among theives is shown to be a lie, a self-aggrandizing fiction that lasts only as long as it coincides with self-interest.  This is perhaps Scorcese's best film and benefits enormously from complex, important supporting performances from long-time Scorcese accomplices Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Joe Pesci won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his part in GoodFellas, a film nominated for six Academy Awards overall including Best Picture. And every accolade attributed to this film is well deserved. With an all-star cast of performers, GoodFellas is one of director Martin Scorsese's greatest productions. Based on the true story of former mobster Henry Hill, GoodFellas begins with his famous quote, "As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster..."<br /><br />GoodFellas follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian American who becomes involved in organized crime at a young age. Quickly rising in stature as a small time gangster, Henry wins the heart of a local Jewish girl, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), despite her parents' objections. Karen, though frightened, is fascinated by Henry's life of crime. He has many friends - rich friends, powerful friends. And nobody messes with him. When they get married, Karen is forced to adjust to the life of a typical mobster's wife...<br /><br />Meanwhile, Henry's best friends (he and Karen only associate with those connected to the mob) in crime are Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) - two fellow wiseguys with their sights set on bigger and better jobs. When Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy pull together a team that executes the biggest heist in years, their reputations rise fast within the mob hierarchy. But things begin to fall apart when the incompetent and undisciplined men with whom they worked start flaunting cash from the robbery. The three friends are forced to kill off several members of the team in order to avoid raising the suspicions of the police.<br /><br />But eventually, Henry becomes arrogant and reckless, landing himself in jail. When he gets out, he's careful in his business dealings due to the fact that local mob boss Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) has his eye on him. Paulie doesn't want Henry to do anything stupid and land himself in jail again. But in the end, Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy get more than they bargained for when Tommy kills an annoying barfly - unaware that the man he killed was a "made man". Now, each man must figure out for himself which direction his life will take...<br /><br />Raw and blunt in its pronouncements, GoodFellas easily holds its own with some of the greatest films of all time. Like any good story, it brings the audience into an unknown world of mystery and seduction. The audience begins to feel the tension along with the characters in the film. That's the mark of a great movie...<br /><br />Liotta, Pesci, and De Niro all stand out in this epic drama about one man's life as a professional criminal. Through each man, the audience views the perks and the pitfalls of life in the mob as well as the perpetual feeling that one is always looking over his shoulder. GoodFellas doesn't glamorize life in the mob by any means, and those who enjoyed The Godfather will appreciate its contemporary slant on the drug trade to which Don Corleone so vigorously objected. When taking an objective view, GoodFellas stacks up as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and it certainly merits the designation of must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>Finally the DVD treatment this classic film deserved, 2 disc special edition with 3 new documentaries-getting made:how a movie classic hit the streets, made men:the Goodfellas legacy, film maker's comments on the movie's influence, and the working day gangster which looks at the less glamorous side of mob life.

One thing sets it apart from the other gangbanger films: it is based on fact--the life of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a half Irish, half Sicilian punk from New York City who associated himself with the local mob at an early age.<p><p>From a run-of-the-mill street punk, Hill graduates into bigger scores, and eventually into dealing drugs.  To save his neck he turns government witness, through the Witness Protection program, and burns everyone who has ever known or been associated with him. The feds get him placed in Seattle with his wife and kids, but once a punk, always a punk.  He falls back into his old patterns, and his wife divorces him and he again gets entangled with the law.<p><p>All pretty predictable.<p><p>The big boys that he ratted on end up doing time, of course, and so everthing is made acceptable, except... Somehow, we end up with the feeling that justice has not really been done.  He should have been locked up as well.  At least, that's my reaction.<p><p>The film is of course well done.  But, I thought the filthy language was overdone and gratuitous.  I think a good film could be made, and still get the idea across, using language more acceptable to a general audience.  You wouldn't want to view this one in company with your mother (or any other person you respected.)  That's too bad.<p><p>We've come a long way since Gable cussed mildly in Gone With the Wind, and everyone gasped in dismay.

This movie is based on the life of Henry Hill, a notorious mobster.  He starts off slow with small, petty crimes but quickly earns the trust of the higher ups.  All of the actors in this movie are excellent, especially Robert DeNiro.

Director Richard Linklater, a major fan, dismisses those who instead champion "Raging Bull." With "GoodFellas," he says in the DVD extras, "You are in the hands of a master. Enjoy the ride."<br /><br />"GoodFellas" anchors Warner's "Martin Scorsese Collection" of five films, including the gangster film's thematic predecessors "Mean Streets" and "Who's That Knocking at My Door?"<br /><br />The double-disc "GoodFellas" offers two worthy commentaries -- one with the actors and filmmakers; another with Henry Hill, the movie's real-life anti-hero, played with considerable verve by Ray Liotta.<br /><br />Hill shares the commentary with the lawman who turned him into a federal witness, but the semipenitent mobster does most of the talking. Hill is a great storyteller in the Italian street tradition -- it's fascinating watching the movie with him. The film "was all based on the rhythm of Henry Hill's language," Scorsese says.<br /><br />The cast-and-filmmaker talk includes almost all of the key talent, whose comments are carefully placed and tightly edited. Some chapters are automatically bypassed during the commentary.<br /><br />"GoodFellas" fans love to cite some of the film's jaw-dropping scenes: Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker dissect three of the best.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes a quartet of freshly minted featurettes, but most of the action is in the commentaries.<br /><br />Audio and video are superb, blowing away the previous Warner DVD, which dates back to the format's Stone Age. Aspect ratio is 1:85.1, as shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>In 1990, Martin Scorsese made a movie about a real life gangster by the name of Henry Hill, who rose to power inside a mafia mob family during the 1950's.<br /><br />Ray Liotta stars as Henry Hill, and the story revolves around him and his experiences at living at the top of his world, only to come crashing down due to drug use and illegal operations that led to his arrest by the FBI. This movie also stars  the brilliant Robert De Niro and the equally fascinating Joe Pesci as Hill's fellow mob family members.<br /><br />The first 5 minutes of the movie guarantee that you will never know what to expect, as a regular car trip by the three friends leads to a shocking violent ending to a man in the trunk of their car. I will say that there are more violent acts just like that, but that only adds to the raw, real story of the plot, which was a true story I might add again.<br /><br />Liotta gives a great performance, having him narrate gives us a look at what Hill might have thought as his life continued to grow better as he met the mob bosses and their families, and how he became a slick young man with a wife, a girlfriend, and 30,000 dollars in cash that he pulls right out of his pocket.<br /><br />The movie also shows us the cruel side of the gangsters, as they repeatedly attack their victims who don't pay money owed to them. But then they are shown as a family who always looks out for their family members, even if they aren't even related. Thats where the term Goodfellas come from: That they only invite Italians to become with them, because they were "Good fellas"<br /><br />Scorsese clearly shows just how different the families can be, going around showing the guys with their girlfriends, how the wives come together to gossip, and how just how rich Hill and his friends are when they take their girlfriends out on dates.<br /><br />Jimmy Conway, and Tommy De Vito, played by Robert De Niro [Conway] and Joe Pesci [De Vito] are shown as Hill's best friends, it was when Hill was a kid that he first met these two and they had been unseperable ever since.<br /><br />De Vito was the one that grabbed my attention, he was in some of the most funny and most shockingly violent scenes in the movie. From the funniest scene in which he is telling a story to his friends at a club; to him pulling a gun on a kid who tried to stand up for himself. Definately a show stealing performance by that man.<br /><br />Critics of mob movies say that this is the greatest mob movie ever made. Once you watch this I guarantee you will agree with them as I did.<br /><br />The second disk of this two disk dvd set also has some great features as well:<br /><br />GETTING MADE: Shows the documentary on how Goodfellas was made by both cast and crew<br /><br />MADE MEN: THE GOODFELLAS LEGACY: The filmmakers, including Joe Canahan, The Hughes Brothers, and John Favreau, comment on the movie.<br /><br />THE WORKADAY GANSTER: This takes a detailed look on the downside of being a gangster, from taking care of people, to being stalked by the FBI. Really a great look.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Robert De Niro [Who I almost forgot to mention was great also] Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, or Martin Scorsese movies, this is one collecters DVD you can't afford to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's masterpiece Goodfellas has finally arrived on Special Edition DVD and boy is it about time.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a simple enough story to follow. Henry Hil(Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster. He has since he can ever remember and he gets his start at a young age.<br /><br />Henry starts as a teenager doing erands for all the local wise guys. He works for Pauly(Sorvino) who is the bigshot of the guys in town. He likes Henry and loves that the kid loves his work. Also in the business are the smooth Jimmy Conway(De Niro) and the ruthless Tommy DeVito(Pesci) who go along with Henry on this lifelong journey through the mob.<br /><br />We get to see the highs of Henry like when he marries Karen(Bracco) and starts his family. To the lows of the late 1970's where he finally gets busted big for his involement in drugs.<br /><br />This movie is incredible. Like Coppola did with The Godfather Scorsese pays attention to all the details in this movie. The cast is absolutely flawless. The script is perfect. The sets are all real and authenic as are the costumes. This movie is just incredible.<br /><br />Ray Liotta gives the performance of his carear. He was a perfect cast for Henry Hill. He plays the tragic character to perfection from his happy high points to his cocaine filled sad points. Liotta not getting at least a nomination by the academy for this role is a shame.<br /><br />Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are awesome in their supporting roles. Pesci won the Oscar for his role as Tommy Devito. He cracked me up in this movie playing the stero typical ultra violent wise guy. It really shows his depth and talent as an actor that he go do a character like Tommy and follow it up with a more family friendly charcter Harry in Home Alone.<br /><br />De Niro does his thing as Jimmy Conway. This guy is great with any charcter that he plays, but when he gets to be a violent mobster that just adds an exclamation point to it. I love his smooth talking and Jimmy is believable. Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role. All the performances are great in Goodfellas and props should go to everybody. This is one of the few movies that I've seen that has a perfect cast from the stars to extras.<br /><br />This is Martin Scorese's best movie. Like Coppola was born to do The Godfather and Spielberg was born to do Schindlers List this is Scorses's film. Nobody else could have pulled this off. The music the details it's all here. He should have gotten the Oscar for Best Director. Maybe he will finally get one for THe Aviator which is due later this year.<br /><br />You have to own Goodfellas. The DVD specials with documentaries are great. I loved the commentary from Scorese and Henry Hill. No serious DVD collection or movie collection is complete without this. Deep down inside like Hill I think we've all wanted to be gangsters at one point. I'll never be one, but I can experience the mob everytime I watch this. Go get Goodfellas now. You wont regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>The same year Francis Ford Coppola hit the skids with his flawed "Godfather 3," Martin Scorcese reminded us how well-made mob movies are done with "Goodfellas." Here's the story of the rise and fall of a mobster, covering a span of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although DeNiro gets top billing in this film, this is really a Ray Liotta movie all the way. It's surprising his career never took off after this movie, for his performance is really good. But while this film is undeniably a classic, the DVD itself is a bust. Although it is slightly over two hours, the film is divided on both sides of the DVD. I refuse to get up off my sofa to flip this disc over when the whole movie could be put on one side.  Plus, all we get for features is a trailer. No documentary, no commentary, or anything else.

When you get widescreen, you see 25% more to the left and right of the screen in the 1.85 widescreen format and 50% more with the 2.35 widescreen format. When you watch a widescreen film, you are not as close to the characters as you are with the fullscreen format. The only reason the black bars are there is because you zoom out everytime the black bars get bigger. The camera moves less in a widescreen film than it does when it's compressed to the fullscreen format.

Take our Main Character, Please. He can barely play a straight man let alone a gangster. Sorry writers, but a wimpy man with an affected accent telling us his life story is not a good movie. "Now let me tell you about Paulie." Sorry we don't give a damn. Next we have Robert De Niro, yep the man who played the Godfather got stooped into playing in this turkey. Sorry, Bob. At least his character is likable. Next in the trio is Joe Pesci, - after playing the villain in Michael Jackson's Moonwalker he got a big head and thought he was a real actor, sadly enough that role was Oscar worthy compared to this.<br /><br />If these guys weren't enough, enter our main character's girlfriend. She's ok until she starts talking, then its zero to tramp in 4.8 seconds. After about three consecutive scenes of this trollop in training I turned the movie off; and I've sat though some bad movies in my time. It'd be ok if this was supposed to be a comedy, but they try to pass it off as drama. Really, at one point we are actually introduced to a character named something like "Jimmy Two-times - because he says everything two times. Says everything two times. I'm not making this up!

He has made some of the best movies of the past 50 years, like "The Age of Innocence".  But the only good thing about "Goodfellas" is Lorraine Bracco's performance as a strong-willed Karen Hill (they should've called the movie "GoodGal"! Wink!).<br /><br />Joe Pesci won the Oscar for an overly-showy role (I think it was the "Whaddya mean I'm funny?" bit that won it for him).  The statue should've gone to Graham Greene in "Dances with Wolves", which rightfully beat "Goodfellas" for Best Picture and Best Director.  Marty deserved an Oscar for "The Age of Innocence" but unfortunately wasn't nominated that year.  Costner's movie was recognized as the heart and soul of 1990, while "BADfellas" became synonymous with the horrendous ordeal America was unwittingly about to endure:  The Clinton Administration.<br /><br />Lots of ink has been spilled over the violence in this movie.  Yes, it is violent, but Marty would outdo even himself with 1995's "Casino".  Remember, "Taxi Driver" was once controversial for it's violence, but these days any child over 8 can recite Travis Bickle's "You talkin' to me?" routine.  "Goodfellas" dubiously opened up the floodgates for heathens like Quentin Tarantino to turn the silver screen red.  My problem is, as with Tarantino's work, the violent acts in "Goodfellas" are celebrated.  The consequences are not explored.<br /><br />The other troubling aspect of this visually-interesting film is the cocaine that Henry Hill becomes involved in.  The second half of the film is obsessed with drugs, and practically endorses dealing narcotics as a valid way of making a living!  Scorsese should've known better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the WB DVD edition of "Goodfellas".....<br /><br />Based on the book "Wiseguy"(a true story) by Nicholas Pileggi, "Goodfellas" follows the lives of New York mobsters for over 2 decades of crime, loyalties, and settled scores. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Robert Deniro and Lorraine Bracco, it is an electrifying and innovative piece of filmaking.<br /><br />Scorsese gives us a remarkable and often graphic look at the lives of theses "Goodfellas" and their families. From the time they were young men working on the streets for the mob bosses in the late fifties, through more than 20 years of heists, murder, corruption, prison time and drug deals, it is a story that is truly captivating.<br /><br />Everything about this film is amazing.The film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. The performances by the actors are as powerful as any I have ever seen. Joe Pesci recieved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and well deserved for his portrayal of the explosive Tommy DeVito. A terrific Screenplay and wonderful Film Editing also got nods from Oscar, and the Soundtrack gives the feel of the time periods throughout.  It takes in everything from Tony Bennett to Sid Vicious and also the wonderful "Layla" by Derek and the Dominoes. Also adding their fabulous talents are Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Illeana Douglas and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />I thought the DVD was good transfer. The picture, presented in Widescreen was clear and sharp and the colors were very good. The sound in 5.1 Dolby Surround was not the best I ever heard, but it seemed to filter through nicely and the music and dialouge sounded good. There was the minor annoyance with having to turn the disc over and I also had a pausing problem with the first 2 minutes of Side B(This may just be my copy, as I have not seen any other complaints on that). Neither of these things effected my viewing pleasure enough to take a whole star off this remarkable film.No Special Features to speak of. There are some production notes, theatrical trailers and it may be viewed in French. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish for those who may need them.<br /><br />This is a film that may not be for everybody. There is quite a bit of graphic violence and language, but at only 13 years old it is surely already  a classic.<br /><br />So Warner Bros....how about a special edition, one that we don't have to turn over???(and some commentary from Mr. Scorsese would be nice on this one too!).....Thanks and enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Joe Pesci:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303219357">Jimmy Hollywood</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Many people argue about what's better - "Goodfellas" or "Godfather". I guess there's no point in discussing this question. Every movie is great. "Goodfellas" might not be as sophisticated as "Godfather" but it shows the dreadful reality of a criminal's life. The film is brutal, ruthless and clever. Director's work is brilliant, maybe one of the best by Scorcese, the cast is outstanding - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and many others (many of them you could later see in "The Sopranos"). Part of the film's charm is that many scenes were ad-libbed by actors as said in bonus features. You'll definately want to rewind and watch them again. What's also interesting is that the movie is based on actual events and on memoirs of the real mafioso Henry Hill (who is played by Liotta here). By the way the disc has a commentary track by Hill so you can hear how it all happened in real life.<br /><br />One of the greatest mob movies, one of the greatest movies in general. True example of a downward spiral for a man who has chosen the wrong path. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>Good Fellas is one of the greatest mob movies of all time, directed by one of the greatest directors, and starring some of the most talented actors of all time.  How could you not respect a masterpiece of this calaber?<br /><br />Good Fellas is the story of Henry Hill, the most famous turncoat in Mafia history.  At the tender age of 13 as a smartass kid in New York, he becomes an errand boy for his local mob club, to climb the ladder to spend 30 years on the inside.  His jealousy is obvious, as he, like Jimmy "The Gent" cannot be officially made because they have Irish blood.  But he copes and learns to never rat on his friends and keep his mouth shut.  Henry becomes greedy, as he delves deeper into cocaine addiction, lying to and cheating the very people who taught him everything he knew.  When he has hit rock bottem and realizes that his colleges are going to turn him in, Henry turns state's evidence and turns them all in.  He would spend the next few years in the Witness Protection Program, but emerged after seven years to become a pseudo celebrity.  He even has his own website now.<br /><br />What appeals to us so much about a movie about the Mafia is that there is no struggle against good and evil, it's all evil.  None of these people (save for the police) are the "good guys", and none of them are really "good fellas".  They spend their lives skirting the law, contributing to America's drug problem, and profiting off of otherwise honest people.  And yet they live like kings.  Snap your fingers and you have everything: money, women, power, prestige, material things, etc.  And at the end, Henry says the worst part is having to live like an ordinary shnook.  He shows no remorse for what he's done.  But then again, if we had that kind of life, would we?</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Along with the recent Oscar winner "The Departed", Scorsese has given us 2 great gangster thrillers along with his seminal "Mean Streets". Ray Liotta will probably never have a greater role than this since he has since fallen into doing B-movies or straight to video features. And Joe Pesci's Oscar performance as a psycho hood ranks up there with the best of Cagney. A little long perhaps but filled with juicy details of the mob and of course, DeNiros excellent performance. Also the HD DVD version of this classic adds a certain sheen to it all, though on Casino, it's even better</p></br></body></html>

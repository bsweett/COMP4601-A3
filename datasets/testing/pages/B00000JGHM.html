The film brings two of the most formidable actors of the last quarter century and juxtaposes them into a intense battle of good versus evil, right versus wrong, and life versus death.  The wonderful casting of Robert De Niro (playing the brilliant criminal Neil McCauley), and Al Pacino (playing no-nonsense detective Vincent Hanna) is perfect. What is so intriguing and entertaining about "Heat" is that it goes inside the lives of each of these men, showing us the personal feelings of Neil and Vincent, which adds much needed depth amongst all the flying bullets. We simply see their lives. It is as if we are watching two movies, about two different people, who happen to have a connection to the same crime.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is one of the best expert thieves around, bearing the philosophy  become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from if the situation arises. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino). But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter (Natalie Portman) is falling apart, and, as wife Justine (Diane Venora) says, he lives his life more among the "remnants of dead people." A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann (who also wrote the script) shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.<br /><br />Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose blemishes prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. Equally fine are Venora and Portman, while Amy Brenneman, is an equally strong companion of DeNiro.<br /><br />Michael Mann's direction of the film keeps moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly, switching between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. The action scenes are handles crisply but grittily, with the gunshots loud, the blood abundant, yet Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic, ensuring that the action never becomes more important than the drama. Intermixing an excellent musical score by Elliot Goldenthal, Mann adds a gripping, yet soft eloquence to the picture and enhances the cinematic chess game with each and every move.  Certainly hightly-respected and stupendously well-made for the genre, "Heat" is one of the most powerful, enthralling modern crime dramas of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Few movies from the 1990s have the energy, action sequences, or provocative depictions of men who are bigger than life than does this gorgeously photographed and brilliantly choreographed cops and robbers tale starring Robert DeNiro as a supremely competent heist-meister and Al Pacino as his indefatigable pursuer. The film, which opens with a robbery sequence involving an armored truck and a precision team that takes it down so professionally it makes one's head spin, has so much action and so much going on it sometimes skips into overdrive. Yet it is all done with such an entertaining verve that one stays with all that is happening as it floats from one situation to another. <p>There are a number of subplots, each involving one of the principles in elements of his personal life. But whether it be DeNiro trying to come to terms with a woman who offers him a chance at a more meaningful and satisfying life, or Val Kilmer trying to figure out how to deal with his high-maintenance life style and a wife with a roving eye (played wonderfully by Ashley Judd), or Pacino trying to essay his way through the wilderness of his own conflictions and how they affect his relationship with his wife, we see these as entertaining sidebars and not the main show, which is the inevitable showdown between DeNiro and Pacino.  <p>This is several movies in one; a wonderfully entertaining shoot-em-up action film, with more than enough pyrotechnics to satisfying the most demanding of fans; an absorbing character study of both DeNiro's and Pacino's contrasting characters and the ways in which they are very similar and at the same time very much different; and a morality play, in which we watch as DeNiro's figure has to make the choice between a life affirming and a life-extinguishing decision, one that then profoundly affects his own fate. This is a great movie, and one that confirms the fact that neither DeNiro nor Pacino have lost the magic touch; both are terrific here. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I inadvertently ended up watching Michael Mann's 1995 film "Heat" recently due to a DVD rental mix up. I was trying to get a copy of Burt Reynolds's film of the same name, and got this one instead. A bit miffed at receiving the wrong disc, even though I saw this film a few years ago and knew that it was good, I decided to make the best of a bad situation and just rewatch the thing before sending it back. No sense in wasting a rental charge, eh? After all, it could have been much worse; they might have sent me something like "Sex in the City" or a Meg Ryan film. Anyway, arguably the most memorable elements of "Heat" include the pairing up of long time veteran actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and the shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles that eerily foreshadowed a real event several years later. But "Heat" is much, much more than a vanity project or a footnote in the history of real life American bank robberies. This is a darn good action thriller that still holds up ten years after Mann wrote and directed it. The fact that Michael Mann plans on bringing "Miami Vice" to the big screen in the next year or so (groan) should in no way diminish what he's accomplished here.<br /><br />The film opens with a smoothly planned armored car robbery orchestrated by master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). Something goes horribly wrong with the job, though, when one of Neil's underlings guns down a couple of the guards for no reason. Although McCauley doesn't know it at the time, it is this event that spells his ultimate doom. Veteran homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) signs on to the case, and he's a cop's cop, a real go getter that grabs hold of a case with both hands and doesn't let it go until he's got his man. He foregoes everything in his life, his marriage to third wife Justine (Diane Venora) and his relationship to her troubled daughter, to pursue bad guys. Oddly enough, Neil McCauley does the same thing. He's so involved in planning and carrying out his next heist that his personal life is a vacuum. Even when he strikes up a relationship with the pretty Eady (Amy Brenneman), he can't let go of his work. Other characters in the film have the same sorts of problems, especially McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), who quarrel constantly about money and Chris's lifestyle.<br /><br />Hanna eventually discovers that McCauley and his goons are the guys behind the armored car heist, and McCauley learns that Hanna's on his trail at roughly the same time. In order to size his nemesis up, Hanna pulls over Neil on the highway and invites him to a restaurant down the street so the two can talk. It's an interesting scene, probably the best one in the movie, as both men dance around the other trying to get a feel for each other. They each come away from the encounter impressed with the fortitude of the other, recognizing that they both possess the same steely eyed determination to get what they want, but neither man plans on shying away from the coming conflict. That conflict comes when McCauley accepts a job requiring him and his gang to rob a downtown bank. They get out of the building with huge bags of money just fine, but Hanna and his "gang" of cops are right there to meet them. The resulting gun battle is breathtaking to behold, almost like a ballet of blood and bullets in the streets of Los Angeles. McCauley and Hanna escape the bloodbath to fight to the finish later on when Neil's failure to check his obsessive thirst for revenge leads him right into the detective's hands.<br /><br />The action scenes definitely grab your attention, but they play a minor part in the movie. "Heat" is all about the performances. It's astonishing to see this many recognizable faces in one film. Jon Voight plays a rough talking, pony tailed advisor to McCauley. Tom Sizemore turns up as one of Neil's reliable colleagues. Wes Studi, who also played a cop in Chris Eyre's "Skinwalkers," plays second fiddle to Pacino's detective. Look for Mykelti Williamson, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Jeremy Piven, Tone Loc, Xander Berkeley, and Bud Cort in major and minor roles. Wow! I'll bet Mann only had to say, "I'm making a film with De Niro and Pacino in it" to get people to sign on the dotted line. A few of these characters get their own minor stories that play out underneath the larger Pacino/De Niro confrontation, and Mann integrates them all masterfully. About the only problem I had with the film is that we don't get enough information on Kilmer's character's tumultuous relationship with his wife. We do learn enough to go on, that he's got money problems, but I wanted more.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the extras on the disc, mainly because there weren't any. At least the audio quality sounded great, particularly during that shootout. The gunfire was so loud coming out of my sound system that I'm surprised the neighbors didn't call the cops. The picture quality is good, too. They really ought to release a super duper special edition of this film, a version with commentary tracks, behind the scenes features, and deleted scenes. Clocking in at an impressive three hours, "Heat" is one of the better action films released by Hollywood in the last twenty years, a film that literally transcends the genre due to its intensive character driven plot. If you haven't seen it, better add it to your list soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>A professional and life long criminal, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is planning an armored car robbery and he has formed a crew to work with him in the planning and execution of the plan. Neil steals an ambulance to use as a cover for the robbery. One of his right hand men is Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) who is assigned the task of buying the explosives for the job. One hotshot on the team kills a guard and as a result the men kill all of the guards.<br /><br />The Los Angeles Police Department is in charge of the investigation of the robbery and Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the investigation. The robbers took bearer bonds worth over 1.6 million dollars. Hanna realizes the the men were top notch professionals who had a plan, a schedule, and knew how to use high-tech shaped bombs.....<br /><br />This is a movie that is extremely well written and an intellectual film. This is what happens when a smart cop meets a smart career criminal and they face off across the opposite sides of the law. Both men have a lot in common with disrupted and chaotic personal lives.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is simply outstanding and they play their roles to perfection. Not only are the male actors in the movie are the best, so are the women with Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd playing key roles. If you love suspenseful and well done movies with a great plot then this film is the one you want to see. I loved this movie and I recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Heat is a long yet beautifully and at the same time intricately plot mixed movie(which I don't appreciate for other movies this one YES). Michael Mann Did a Good Job unlike on The Insider and Later Miami Vice. Anyhow,De Niro And Pacino are great. (Unlike a later collabo which did not work for me) The Action is great,the vehicles,Corvette*sparsely in there*,Camaros*base models*,A Peterbilt,and other vehicles! Val Kilmer is surprisingly good,jon voigt as well, all the actors, it is a great cast and great action and story throughout the movie.One of the Best Movies out there.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Heat' is lauded as one of the greatest crime epics ever; a triumph of acting, directing and screen writing.  I personally wasn't able to see this film for the longest time.  I guess I shouldn't say `wasn't able'; I just never got around to it.  Finally, after all the poking and prodding from friends, I sat down to digest this supposed masterpiece and was able to draw my own conclusions on the matter.<br /><br />Very, very good.<br /><br />Notice I didn't say masterpiece; but it is very close.  I have a few issues with the film, mostly due to some aspects of the script and one particular performance, but for the most part `Heat' is extremely well done.  Michael Mann is probably one of our greatest working directors and this is his Mona Lisa.  He graciously allows the camera to flow through each scene, collecting important details that not only map out the visual feast of bullets and bodies, but he is delicate enough to allow us to come to know the characters intimately, painting a portrait of reality instead of a collage of carnage.  Sure, the films most notable sequence is one of bloodshed (the whole daylight shootout is spectacularly shot) but Mann is equally invested in the homelife of his anti-heroes which only adds layers to the films core.<br /><br />`Heat' tells the story of master thief Neil McCauley.  Neil is on the verge of retirement, but before he slips away he wants to make one more heist.  Lt. Vincent Hanna is desperately trying to nail him.  The film is basically a game of cat and mouse between thief and cop as they track each other.  Mann makes sure to get deep into the heart of both characters, as well as their partners; especially McCauley's right hand man Chris Shiherlis who is having marital problems of his own.<br /><br />My one issue with the script comes in the form of Eady, the love interest of Neil.  I personally found her character arc forced a tad.  It felt out of place even though it served as a major plot point in the films finale.  It just felt unnecessary to me.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is superb here.  De Niro was still making worthwhile films and delivering within them, so his portrayal of McCauley is the films major highlight.  He gives Neil a stark humanity that makes him someone we can relate to and feel for.  Val Kilmer does some impressive work (he had such promise) here as Chris, but his scenes are stolen from him by Ashley Judd who is more than phenomenal as his conflicted wife Charlene.  Tom Sizemore is always dependable in these type roles, and Diane Verona is flawless as Vincent's bitter wife Justine.  That brings me to Pacino.  Why does he feel like he has to scream about everything?  I mean really, he used to be one of the greatest actors of all time and then it was like all of a sudden he decided that he didn't have to try anymore.  He's more than annoying; he's frustrating.  There are glimmers here of his natural charm, but he muddles it up by trying to be `larger than life' and he just winds up being `beyond annoying'.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just picking, but whatever.<br /><br />Overall the film is a very, very good one; a great one at that.  I highly recommend it for the few faults are easily looked over for the many highlights.  Michael Mann has crafted a smart and engaging crime epic that is as beautiful as it is enjoyable to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Al Pacino and Robert Dinero absolutely SIZZLE in this film. Michael Mann adds his brand of visual seduction, as the film's "blue" look and atmospheric music and scenes add a spectacular feel to this film. The "cat and mouse" game is complicated by the fact that we learn about the personal lives of all lead characters, and it truly allows you to "cheer for the bad guy". The movie, minute by minute, is one of the best crime sagas ever created. Fanastic cinema, highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Though it's a bit tough to get to in one sitting (it's 172 minutes), Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama masterpiece "Heat" is ultimately one of the most satisfying film experiences one can enjoy. Starring two of the greatest actors in history (Al Pacino & Robert De Niro) sharing the screen together for the first time ever, backed by a great story and an equally fantastic supporting cast, "Heat" has been one of the last truly great movies to come out in the last 10 or so years, and it's truly a classic.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so I'll leave that this two disc special edition is the one to get. It's loaded with special features and has great picture and sound quality. A must-have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is arguably one of my favorite action flicks. With a cast to die for, and a director who just keeps turning out fabulous films, Heat has it all for some serious testosterone. Al Pacino plays a world weary LA detective who takes down sophisticated robbers. He is pitted against the a-team of thieves led by Robert De Niro as an incredible group of actors-criminals including, Val Kilmer and Michael Masden and an all star cast of crooks looking for that big score. The sub plots are well developed, and the suspense is fabulous, as Pacino and De Niro establish a mutual respect that leads to a fantastic creshendo of conflict and action. I can't say a bad thing about this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>A truly amazing film, and too good to ruin by writing a novel sized review. Cast: Among the best ever assembled. Action: Riveting all the way through the three hour movie. Plot: Cop vs Robber, but it is much more then that. The Bank Scene: One of the best action sequences in movie history. The Action: Raw and bloody, De Niro is calculating, fierce and committed, along side his nemesis and tireless rival Al Pacino. Conclusion: You won't know who you'll want to win or who you'll want to lose, brilliant and complex characters played by Oscar winners, what more can you ask for.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>10 years after the release of Michael Mann's epic crime tour de force, Heat is still an absolute masterpiece.  Originally a screenplay which sat on the shelf for almost twenty years before being greenlit, Heat is the perfect character driven crime drama.  Mann pits Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a dueling cop and crook whose lives bear stunning resemblances to themselves.  Vincent (Pacino) becomes obsessed in his case to help escape the reality of his failing marriage, while Neil (De Niro) is a cool, calm, collected and disciplined master thief who, with his skilled team (including Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) are planning a heist which will change everyone involved forever.  This portrait of these people and their failing personal lives sacrificed for their obsessive careers makes Heat the best film to come from Mann, and undoubtadly the best big budget crime drama to come out of the 90's.  The face off between Pacino and De Niro is a film buff's dream, and the climactic LA shootout is possibly one of the best action sequences in cinematic history.  The rest of the cast, which includes Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Kevin Gage, Denis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, Tom Noonan, and Hank Azaria, does brilliant work.  Truly a cinematic masterpiece.  This new 2-disc Special Edition from Warner Bros. contains a great commentary from Mann and a few nice featurettes, but the deleted scenes are hardly worth watching and add nothing to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of my favorite actors.  So when I found out that they would be in a movie together, I was very excited to see it.  "Heat" is a crime saga masterpiece that mixes drama and film noir together.  Combine all of those elements together and you get one hell of a movie.<br /><br />Pacino plays a L.A. detective who is obsessed with his job.  He has dedicated his life to put away every single criminal in the state.  Much so that he has become obsessed with his job.  De Niro plays a criminal who loves to go on heists.  A professional he is, and he never gets caught.  Soon, the two's lives collide with each other and all hell breaks out.  Pacino becomes obsessed with catching De Niro.  He will not rest until he is locked up.<br /><br />That is only half of the story.  There are many stories in this crime drama that interact with each other.  Other great actors in this film include Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, and many more.  Every character is unique in his or her way.<br /><br />The director/writer does an excellent job of making us feel sympathy for the characters, even the bad ones.  He has created a very dark and gloomy world in which nothing is certain.  Problems lurk around every corner, ready to destroy each person.  Don't be mistaken, this isn't an action flick.  This is more of a film noir if anything.  It's dark, the tone is somber, and it doesn't have the happiest ending.  Although there is a bank heist scene in the movie that has to be one of the best action sequences in a long time.<br /><br />As much as I love Robert De Niro, and he does a great job portraying his character, Pacino steals the show.  It's one of his best roles in recent years.  He's vulgar, rude, offensive, and short-tempered.  But, he also has a heart, and you get to see that as the movie progresses.  As serious as his character is supposed to be, he has some of the funniest lines you will ever hear him say.  He definitely wins "best actor" in my book.<br /><br />Again, this isn't an action film.  It is very long (almost three hours), and it is very story oriented.  The film concentrates on character development the most.  This is a great film that realistically portrays these kinds of characters.  This is a movie about choices and consequences, and you're not exactly sure how the movie will end.  A very good movie that should've received more recognition.<br /><br />P.S.  I haven't had the chance to check out the special features on this DVD.  From what I remember, there isn't too many.  But that would be because the movie is so long, and it's all on one side.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film I was around 16 and wasn't that impressed mainly because I thought it was kind of boring. Now that I have matured I thought I would give it another try and I dusted off my DVD from my shelf and watched it for a second time tonight (four years later). I was blown away by the acting, screenplay, action, music, emotion, and the fact I felt bad for the "bad" guys. This film has it all and after this viewing it has moved up the ranks to my top 25 list of all time. Pacino and De Niro are magnificint to say the least. I can't believe this film didn't get a single Oscar. It should have been up at the very least for Best Picture and Director. This is one great film that took me too long to realize what I had been missing.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>After all these years and 2 hours after the movie it happens.... Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino talk face to face in a diner. I know it sounds stupid but for the past twenty years writers have thought of every stupid excuse to put these two heavyweights in a movie together but it never happened. Finally Heat has the two starring in the same film but both actor's are on different sides making this a true classic Crime Story. It's almost like one of those classic detective films but for this era instead with a sleek style and shiny criminals joining dirty ones to make big heists. Val Kilmer is in it and he's alright ... Anyways, the fact that this is the only movie that stars DeNiro and Pacino since the Godfather 2 and the fact that this time they are both in the same time frame so when the two talk to eachother it's something you have to see for yourself. You can tell the scenes where done almost surgically when the two appear on the same screen. Anyways this movie is good and it's an essential to any Action movie collector!</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>you will hear a couple of gunshots in this movie.  I remember that this is the first greast movie I ever saw.  It plays out like a tv show but manages to cut out all the excess fat perfectly.  Suer, you would like to know a bit more about the charaxcters, but even the people from the casting department admit tehy were still hiring actors up to the last day of shooting.  I have not seen such a star studded cast in a GREAT movei like thsi since True Romance".  The feeling you have for the characters is so strong, you will never see another movie like this. They spend pretty much the whole movie planning out the heist and when it happens, you are glad they waited.  Cops and robbers going at it just like a movie should be:)<br /><br />The special featrues are a bit short and has like a 100 minute running time.  It gives you a lot of good insight on the real story behind the movie.  And also michael mann and the rest of cast give good info.  And good stuff on how it was written to ne a tv show.  Teh commentary was pretty boring, but I like excitng commentaries, I guess I expect them all to be like Anchorman:)</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>After the commercial and critical success of The Last of the Mohicans, filmmaker Michael Mann made his most ambitious film up to that point in his career with Heat. He cast legendary actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as the leads in what would be their first the on-screen appearance together in a movie (they were in The Godfather: Part II but never appeared in the same scene). Mann returned to a 1986 draft of a screenplay that originated before he made The Jericho Mile. A few years ago, Warner Brothers released a bare bones DVD of Heat. To celebrate the 10th anniversary, Mann has revisited his movie and assembled an excellent collection of extras.<br /><br />Mann contributes a characteristically solid audio commentary. He provides a lot of details into the backgrounds and motivations of the film's characters. Surprisingly, there is very little overlap from the featurettes as Mann's comments start off strong but become more infrequent after the 90 minute mark.<br /><br />The strongest extra is "The Making of Heat," an excellent 54-minute retrospective documentary that can be viewed in three separate featurettes or altogether. Many of the major and minor cast members are back for brand new interviews and offer insightful comments, including Al Pacino, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore amongst others. This is in-depth look at how Heat was put together and provides the whole story for casual fans and fascinating insight for devotees.<br /><br />"Pacino and De Niro: The Conversation" explores the famous on-screen meeting between these two actors. Mann subverts our expectations by delaying their eventual meeting and then, when it does happen, it is at a diner over coffee and not what one expects with this kind of a movie.<br /><br />"Return to the Scene of the Crime" features location manager Janice Polley revisiting many of the locations used in the movie. Mann wanted to find locations in Los Angeles that had never been put on film before in order to create a distinctive look.<br /><br />Finally, there are 11 deleted scenes that include the most revealing excised bit of footage in a scene where McCauley and his crew get ready just before they enter the bank while one of his gang is interrogated by rogue psycho, Waingro that should have been kept in. There is nothing terribly earth-shattering about this excised footage but there are a couple of good moments.<br /><br />The scale and star power of Heat was unlike anything Mann had ever tried before and firmly announced him as force to be reckoned within Hollywood. This two-DVD set is a fitting tribute for this important film. The transfer and sound are very well done with extras that are substantial and plentiful, providing a really good look at how this epic movie was put together.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>...and what a match. These two consummate actors play cops in this riveting cops-and-robbers flick. DeNiro plays the master thief, while Pacino plays the experienced LA detective who intuits that cop and criminal lead similar lives: both are so fixated on the nuances of their respective professions that they allow their personal lives to suffer. These are 2 men obsessed with the desire to triumph over one another, no matter at what cost.<br />It's a looooong film, nearly 3 hrs, but not a minute of it could be cut without attecting the mood and pacing of this excellent film. It's a crime thriller of the highest order, dispensing equal parts of high thrills and true drama.<br />Not to be missed. DeNiro and Pacino are top notch actors in this top notch movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />The rating is for the movie...the dvd gets 3 and the blu-ray 2, if just for also including a good hourlong doc, Mann's commentary, 10 minutes of ok deleted scenes, and a picture that is mildly but not much better than the dvd. If you already love this film and are wondering about the blu-ray, wait for the double dip that you just know is on the way.<br /><br />That said, this really is a special film. Though not perfect---it's a little too long and has a few too many lingering shots of emotionally wraught faces caught in lovers' quarrels for my taste---those are quibbles, and the strengths far outweigh any flaws.<br /><br />The acting is the real highlight; both DeNiro and Pacino are at the top of their games here, and their scene together is truly one of the great tete-a-tetes of modern actors that I know of. They're both completely inside their roles in every scene, and Al's over the top moments work every time for me, not easy considering how far over some of them are. Bob's slow burn couldn't be more exact, and those two performances alone make this well worth watching.<br /><br />But then add in very nice turns from almost everyone else; Voight and Kilmer and Sizemore and Judd are all perfect, and in fact I can't think of one performance here that is less than good to very good. And there's a lot of acting from many folks, so Mann did what he's been able to do in almost no other picture: get solid, natural work from all of his actors.<br /><br />Mann himself is at his peak here; his best writing by far and also his most convincing direction. Less of the Mann trademark shimmering-lights-at-night vibe (but still plenty, he can't help it and why should he, it works) and more simple shots of good actors doing what they do best. He gets far better performances than usual from everyone here, no doubt due to Al and Bob being on set and making everyone step their games up to their limit; you don't want to suck with these two around you!<br /><br />The opening and late action/heist scenes are two of the best of the past 20 years for my money, and they contrast so well with the personal, emotional moments throughout the film. I could have taken a few less of those and more of Voight, for instance (who is excellent here), but all in all Heat delivers the goods and is likely to be seen as Mann's peak once all is said and done, followed perhaps by Thief.<br /><br />But just rent this one for now...a much much better transfer is due to show up soon, and a movie this good deserves no less.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>this is defently a movie to sit threw..pulls you in on everything....especially the end where Al Pacino(Simone) and Robert DeNiro(15 Minutes), probably two of the best actors out there collide for a short period of time..hey but its worth the wait...your just waiting to see them get together and duke it out...a lot, I mean a lot of great actors play in this movie...they are...Val Kilmer(The Salton Sea), Ashley Judd(Kiss The Girls), Danny Trejo(From Dusk Till DAwn), HAnk Azaria(Quiz Show), Tom Sizemore(The Florentine), Jon Voight(Anaconda), Amy Brenneman(Fear), Mykelti Williamson(Con Air), Ted Levine(Bullet), Wes Studi(MysteryMEn), Natalie Portman(Anywhere But HEre), William Fichtner(Armageddon), Diane Venora(the 13th Warrior), Henry Rollins(from the band Rollins Band), Dennis Haysbert(Tv's 24), Martin Ferrero(Jurassic Park), Xander Berkely(Tv's 24), Jeremy Piven(PCU), Tom Noonan(Knockaround Guys), Kevin Gage, Tone Loc(funky cold madina singer) and Bud Cort(Dogma)...written well and played out great...beautiful</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I read another review where someone slammed this film. Well, let me write this: that person thought Carlito's Way was a good film. Nuff said. Heat isn't for the fan of Hill Street Blues or even the Lethal Weapon series. It is a classy film with in-depth character development and a remarkable ability to make us root for the bad guys.  As for action? You won't be dissapointed if you're one for smart and well thought out robbery scenes. The cast is phenominal, a list that includes DeNiro, Pacino, Kilmer, Judd, Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Voight, among others. <p>Now, if you're a fan of Carlito's Way, I meant no offense but to say that Carlito's is a better film than Heat? Please. <p>Heat takes the cake(or should I say bank?) in terms of the cops and robbers genre.  The climax will have you on the edge of your seat. Surprisingly, there are some subtle messages in this film, one being that there isn't much that seperates the two lead characters, although one's good and one's bad. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>The crime film is not a new genre and it is not exactly lacking in quantity.  That makes the fact that this movie is towards the very top of the field even more significant.<p>There is easily enough to make this a good movie, especially a great story and fantastic shoot-em-up action.  What makes this movie move even higher is the duel of wits between Pacino's cop and DeNiro's thief.  These two men are pros with great respect for each other yet without the hesitation to foil the other.  This is a movie about smart people, and no one makes really stupid mistakes.  This means that success or failure is dependent on the nature of the characters and some traces of luck.<p>This is not a very emotional story and many scenes play out realistically, not dramatically.  In particular, the bank heist that forms the climactic moment of the story is coolly played out, with a minimum of situational music or strange cinematic effects.  <p>Michael Mann has directed a number of movies, but this is, to me, his magnum opus.

Somehow, I feel it had the potential to be really good, BUT IT WASN'T. I was bored through about half of it. It's a cop/robber movie that drifted in and out, sometimes thinking it was a socio drama. The melding of these two genres didn't work. TOO BAD!</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>I am completely ashamed to admit as an amateur film buff that I just watched "Heat" for the first time, 21 years after it appeared in theaters. I've caught bits and pieces on cable over the years, but have never seen the entire movie until now.  Wow, what a timeless masterpiece!  The criminal element and the investigative process converge in perfect movie harmony in the film on such an intimate level that the last moment is a genuine, flawless finale.<br /><br />The surprising aspect to the film was the intimacy revealed in all the characters, their relationships, and the consequences that occur when you violate your own rules.  There were at least six relationships interwoven into the heart of the movie adding power far beyond the criminal plot, but each essential to the story.  The resolutions of the relationships within the plot resulted in the film lasting three hours, but nothing could have been excluded.<br /><br />The acting was incredible.  The direction and cinematography perfect. If you have not watched "Heat," do so.<br /><br />Now, there are a lot of choices you can make to add "Heat" to your library. I purchased an inexpensive DVD Quad-Pack here on Amazon that included "Heat," The Devil's Advocate," "Insomnia," and "Seven."

Al Pacino is a cop trying to nail De Niro and his gang of robbers who are robbing banks. Pacino and De Niro are absolutely brilliant with two powerhouse performances. It's a rare thing to see actors this good in 1 movie. That alone makes it worth watching but the movie itself is a classic. It has one of the best scenes of all time in which a bank robbery turns into an amazing shootout. Bullets fly everywhere and lots of cops die in this classic scene. The movie is very long actually but even though it seems very long at times, 90% of it flew by for me. The ending is good but what you will remember is that awesome shootout!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars because of its length!</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>One of the best crime movies I have seen in a long time.

This Film just shows what happens when you get a great story and let it ride. Couple it with an outstanding cast, great photography, direction, scene location and a just wonderful music backup & it can't help but kick butt. A job well done to all hands!</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>Heat has been talked up for not only being a great crime drama but also because Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are finally together in the same film.  This is a great crime film but as far as the other piece of hype let me just inform you that DeNiro and Pacino are only in two scenes together and those 2 scenes are very short.  If you watch this movie expecting anything more concerning the pairing of these two giants of the film world then you'll be deeply disappointed.  If you can around that fact then you'll enjoy Heat.<br /><br />Pound for pound I have to say that DeNiro is the better actor.  Pacino has a tendency to yell and scream his lines in hopes of being more intense and dramatic.  DeNiro doesn't have to do that.<br /><br />Heat contains one of the best shootouts I've ever seen on film.  The street scene with everyone shooting at everyone else is realistic and some may think over the top but I say it's on target (no pun intended).  While the main focus is on the good guy trying to catch the bad guy, the other view is of these two men and their external relationships with others outside of what they do.  Note also that they secretly admire each other.  So much so in fact, that they agree to meet each other and state that they will do what they have to do to come out on top.  I've often wondered if they could really have been brothers and therefore, hesitant to kill one another.  Hence the meeting to warn the other man what might happen.<br /><br />Although there is plenty of action here, it's the story that drives the film.  It's not just a shoot 'em up.  I enjoyed seeing Dennis Haysbert (played the president on 24) here.  His role isn't that big but at least he gets to go out in a blaze of glory.  Somebody give this guy more films to do!!!<br /><br />As usual with these kind of films one tends to root for the bad guy.  Pacino's character, for me a least, evokes no sympathy.  He ignores his wife and stepdaughter for the sake of the job and his wife cheats on him because he won't talk to her.  You just don't feel sorry for him.  DeNiro's character on the other hand is a guy that never allowed himself to have all the trappings of a normal life.  He never wanted to feel tied down.  He wanted to be able to  pick up and take off at a moments notice.  That changes though and you want him to get away with this last crime and then settle down to be "normal".<br /><br />Val Kilmer is excellent as the cumpulsive career criminal/gambler that just can't let go of his life of crime no matter how much his wife (Ashely Judd) begs him.<br /><br />The final scene is wonderful.  Cinematography, scenery, characters and music all fit together so well that you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre then you must have this film in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Heat" is one of the great films of the 1990's.  Michael Mann has crafted a film that is intricate and deliberately paced but never boring.  One of the best ensemble casts of all time has been assembled for this film and, for the most part, these are fully developed characters.  Central to this film are the main stars, Robert DeNiro as the thief, and Al Pacino as the detective out to catch him.  Though appearing together in only a couple of scenes, there is an intricate cat and mouse game played by these two adversaries and also a mutual respect.  Essentially these two individuals live by a code of their respective trades and their adherence to these codes lead to a lonely existence.  As previously stated, the large ensemble cast(Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, etc.) is excellent.  The highlight of the film is an elaborately staged bank heist and the subsequent getaway.  This film also has great editing, particularly in the above mentioned scene, great dusky cinematography of Los Angeles, and good music.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Director Michael Mann's 1995 film is certainly the best bank caper movie ever made. In addition to having great character studies of both the criminals (De Niro, Sizemore, Kilmer), it also studies those of the cops (Pacino.) Without a doubt, this movie has one of the best shootout scenes I have ever seen in any movie besides a war film.<br /><br />Impeccable acting on the part of De Niro, who's looking to do one last heist before quitting the game. Although Pacino also delivers a powerful performance as the cop, I found it to be more of the same hysterics as in virtually all of his other roles (i.e. Scarface, Scent of a Woman, etc.) Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd also delivered a great performance.<br /><br />A very entertaining film with the right balance of drama and action to keep you on the edge of your seats. Definitely the crown of all bank heist films.</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>this movie has some of the best acting i've ever seen. the plot is great and the action scenes are also great. the dvd i'm reviewing now lacks extras, but a special edition is supposed to come out later this year. some might not like it being three hours, but i think the three hours i spent watching were well worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>Forget for a moment the acting, direction,plot and script,Heat is a film that has managed to pair two of the greatest actors of all time, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. No matter where you go around the globe, ask any person from any culture who his/her favorite actors are and two names will invariably always come up, Pacino and De Niro. To cast these two 'giants of method acting' in one film is a great achievement in itself, and makes Heat a film to be reckoned with.Surely Pacino and De Niro have been in the same movie before, Godfather 2, but as they played the young dad Don Corleone and the old son Michael Corleone, they never actually shared a scene in real time before Heat.<br />Now forget about Pacino and De Niro for a moment, and let us look at the film itself.<br />Heat is the best gangster movie I have seen since the two Godfathers, and this is despite the somehow over the top and sentimental ending which was slightly uneven compared to  everything that happened before in terms of style, plot and tone of the picture.<br />What works so well in favour of the film is a fine direction and script by Michael Mann, and great acting from all involved, Val Kilmer,Tom Sizemore, Ashely Judd, Jon Voight, Ted Levine and Amy Brenneman.<br />It has one of the best bank heist/street battle scene I have ever seen.<br />The plot offers much more than your average cat and mouse chase between cops and robbers: it is evenly focused on the thefts as much as on the drama,and the domestic life/problems of its characters. The characters in Heat have a three dimensional and deep personalities, so much so that you come to know the principle players so well, and whether they are good or bad, you can't not help but feel sympathy and concern for them.<br />The film is quite visual too and we get to see lingering and beautiful shots of LA, especially at night.<br />The bond that eventually ties cop and robber is very well written, two similar men but at the opposite sides of the law develop an understanding and respect for each other, and this adds so much to the film.<br />All these elemets make Heat a movie that should not be missed..one that will entertain you,involve you and delight you with its excellent direction, script and the meeting of two giants.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Two men on opposite sides of the law, both loners obsessed by what they do. Two of contemporary cinema's greatest actors, facing off for the first time in their 30+ year-long careers. A director with an impeccable sense of style. And a tremendous cast, whose every member delivers a truly stunning performance. These are some of the ingredients that elevate Michael Mann's "Heat" high above any average thriller.<br /><br />The film's mood is set from the very first camera shots, following Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) from a subway station to a hospital, to drive off with an ambulance he'll be using in his crew's next score. While we don't hear him speak a single word, his movements alone are unquestionably those of a leader; a man in absolute control of every situation. Like many of "Heat"'s crucial scenes (including the two lead characters' sole face-to-face encounters in a coffee shop and during the grand finale), the opening shots are set at night; and the hard contrast between almost black darkness and brightly shining neon lights thus established from the start is soon revealed as a hallmark of the movie's cinematography. One of the next shots shows McCauley's adversary-to-be, homicide Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) making love to his wife (Diane Venora). But afterwards there is no coziness; no conversation and no joint breakfast. Their relationship is disintegrating and, although fully aware that his obsession with his job is turning his life into a "disaster zone," it is ultimately Vincent who sacrifices it to that very obsession. Similarly, Neil has adopted a discipline of never letting himself get attached to anything he can't "walk out on in 30 seconds flat" if he feels the heat coming on: a discipline looming in the background even of his growing feelings for Eady (Amy Brenneman), with whom he has gotten involved against the instinct that told him to treat their encounter as a one-night-stand. Also troubled is the relationship between Neil's friend Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd); but there it is Chris who wants to hold on to their marriage, whereas Charlene, no longer able to cope with his gambling and immaturity, wants out, although she still clearly loves him.<br /><br />Vincent and Neil are pitted against each other after an armored car holdup of Neil's crew goes awry when a new man named Waingro (Kevin Gage), who will soon be revealed as a ruthless serial killer, escalates the robbery by shooting one of the guards. Knowing that they are now all up for first-degree murder, the gang don't hesitate to kill the other guards, so as not to leave a living witness. Yet, with the police on their trail they still plan two more scores; one at the Precious Metals Depository and one at a downtown bank, the latter of which in particular proves fatal when it ends in a shootout turning L.A.'s business district into a virtual war zone. Further complications arise out of Neil's attempt to sell the bearer bonds stolen in the holdup back to their owner, a shady businessman named Van Zant (William Fichtner), who ultimately pays a high price for underestimating him.<br /><br />Shortly before the bank heist, Vincent and Neil have a brief but crucial encounter in a coffee shop; and what has heretofore been mere respect developed from afar grows into a feeling of empathy and kinship when they discover their similarities. Yet, neither is willing to cross the lines: He won't like it, Vincent ultimately tells Neil, but if it's between Neil and "some poor (...) whose wife you are going to turn into a widow, brother, you are going down." Neil responds that on that coin's flip side, he, too, won't hesitate to kill Vincent if he gets in his way. And with their positions thus established, the action is up and almost never lets off again, until they meet again during their final chase over LAX's airfield.<br /><br />"Heat" is a self-described "Los Angeles crime saga," which by implication almost necessarily means that it's not characterized by down-to-earth realism; nor does it strive to be. Of course you do *not* walk away from a midday shootout with what looks like the better part of the LAPD's Central precinct (and unquestionably the movie's saddest unintended consequence was the real-life shootout provoked in imitation of this scene a few years later). Of course it's doubtful that guys like Vincent and Neil would ever sit down together over coffee - more likely, their encounter would have brought about Neil's arrest for murder, as Vincent by this time arguably had probable cause. Of course a real cop's loyalty would always be with his colleagues, and even respect for an adversary like Neil wouldn't propel him to hold his hand, after that same adversary had shot several of his fellow policemen. But all this is ultimately beside the point. This movie's entire dynamics are driven by the antagonism between its unexpectedly similar protagonists; and on that basis, their mutual feelings of empathy and even brotherhood are entirely credible.<br /><br />The pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino was a dream finally come true; for their performances alone, "Heat" deserves highest honors. While Pacino is his usual self as a supercharged bundle of dynamite, De Niro shows incredible (mannerism-free!) control, contrasting Pacino's bursts of temper with a chilling coolness that can nevertheless flip into ruthless violence in a split second, or into tenderness and emotion in his scenes with Eady. They are complemented by the stellar ensemble cast, also including, inter alia, Natalie Portman in her U.S. film debut as Vincent's troubled stepdaughter (after her very first appearance alongside Jean Reno in Luc Besson's "Leon"), John Voight and Tom Sizemore as Neil's associates Nate and Michael, Hank Azaria as Charlene's love interest and Mykelti Williamson and Wes Studi as Vincent's fellow cops. All in all, this is a truly outstanding production - and despite almost 3 hours' running time, not a minute too long.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XPPB">Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY5J">The Score</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305263248">Ronin</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I didn't want to see this film initially.  Its tagline was "A Los Angeles crime saga".  Michael Mann, the director of this film, created Miami Vice, and I thought this was going to be like that.  But after some prodding from my sister (who knows my tastes very well), she said I would love this film.  Lo and behold, it's a masterpiece.  It's an epic film (171 minutes), and it covers a hell of a lot of terrority.  The characters seem like real people, not just caricatures.  Films in the 1990's (Pulp Fiction for example) had characters in them that weren't very real, they were just there to mouth supposedly "cool" dialogue and kill indiscrimately.  Here there is a real, morally ambiguous vibe going on between De Niro and Pacino.  While they are different sides of the law, they are pretty much the same.  Their personal lives are royally screwed up, they're very lonely workaholics, and they are really 2 worried souls.  Pacino, luckily, doesn't overact too much, and De Niro is superb as usual.  And the supporting cast is just as good.  There is not one false note in this film.  The bank heist and shootout is one of the greatest action scenes ever, and its staging and execution are superb.  A film with great depth and character, very uncharacteristic of the 1990's.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>Was just checking up on the Blu to verify one of my favorite films was given a decent transfer.<br /><br />The picture quality was solid, grainy in a few of the night interior shots (Ashley Judd's scenes with the trap house & cops shows some actual pores but when out of focus looks very grainy). The famous shoot out sequence looks valid, but the TrueHD seemed a little muted. The best sound test was when Studi's character shotguns the hotel door - that rocked. Overall, the Blu only shows the shortcomings of original filming but the upgrade is worth it (for the first time I noticed all of the cameramen/crew in the window shot when Deniro kills Fichtner's character).<br /><br />The supplements are all identical to the special edition release. They show 10 subtitled languages and no region coding listed. I am happy with the cut, and it will play nicely for sharing just not the best for sound. 5 for film, clarity and supplements.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>***Spoilers within***<br /><br />It's difficult to hold the interest of an audience for almost three hours, especially in an age where people can't go five minutes without checking their text messages or tweeting about what's happening in a movie. Heat was made in 1995 when it was much easier to forget the outside world for three hours, and that's part of its strength.<br /><br />The most obvious thing to mention is that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appear on screen together for the first time, and it's the first time they two have appeared in the same film since The Godfather: Part II. Both actors are close to their best and their two meetings are memorable.<br /><br />Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) works for the LAPD. His job is his passion and he places it above personal relationships. He's on his third marriage and that is failing because he only gives his wife a fraction of his attention if he's home at all. Neil McCauley (De Niro) also has a passion, but he's on the wrong side of the law. He heads a group of thieves who are professional and extremely effective. Unlike Hanna, McCauley doesn't want any personal ties preventing him from being the best he can be.<br /><br />McCauley has a favorite quote:<br /><br />"Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner."<br /><br />The movie shows us how effective McCauley's crew is when they rob an armored truck early in the movie. One of the crew, Waingro (Kevin Gage), is a loose cannon. His behavior leads to three unnecessary deaths so McCauley decides to kill him. Unfortunately, a passing patrol car distracts McCauley and allows Waingro to escape. He's a constant source of trouble for the remainder of the story.<br /><br />McCauley's life changes when he meets Eady (Amy Brenneman). Instead of being a free agent, he's in danger of becoming tied down to a relationship. Will he abandon the idea that he can walk away from any situation in 30 seconds, or will she complicate things?<br /><br />What sets Heat apart is the strong characterization. Mann takes his time establishing all of the characters, even if they have minor roles. As a result, we feel as if we know these people. McCauley's strengths and efficiency are obvious and we learn the roles and abilities of the other crew members. Mann doesn't stop there. We see one crew member, Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer), interacting with his wife (Ashley Judd). Chris has a gambling problem and it's affecting his marriage. His wife questions whether they should even be together. This type of depth is present throughout the movie.<br /><br />Because we know the characters, it matters when something happens to them. Hanna's life is his job and he's essentially a hunter. McCauley is his current prey and we see Hanna using every available tool to find out what McCauley's crew is planning. As he learns more about McCauley, Hanna finds that he respects the man. They are similar in many ways and both are intelligent.<br /><br />The most notable scene in the movie happens after Hanna pulls over McCauley in his car. He's not there to arrest him, but simply asks if they can have coffee together. The scene shows the personalities of both men and it's brilliantly written. Hanna mentions that it's his job to stop McCauley and that it's nothing personal. McCauley replies with a warning that he would have to take Hanna out if he got in his way. These are not threats, but calmly-stated facts. The scene is based on a real exchange between McCauley and Chicago cop, Chuck Adamson. If you think the scene is unrealistic, it really happened.<br /><br />Heat is a drama more than anything else, but the brief action scenes are intense. The actors received training to make their shootouts appear authentic. Mann's focus on such details makes the whole story feel real. When we see people working at a crime scene, many are real forensic experts.<br /><br />I can't promise 170 minutes of thrills, but the final scenes are among the most intense I've seen portrayed within the genre. All of the acting is good, but Pacino and De Niro understandably dominate things. If you enjoy character-driven stories, Heat is well worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>I might of made a bold statement with my title but I fully stand by it and will defends it's position.<br />I have revisited this film multiple times and in different age brackets as well. As I get older though, I can't help but to extol this film more and more. It is not so often that a film can offer a stellar cast, a satisfying plot, powerful acting, realistic character interactions, and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />Michael Mann's Heat which went unnoticed somewhat in 1995 has finally garnered enough attention to warrant an anniversary edition (15th) which will be heading into it's 20th year shortly. (hard to believe) At any rate, this film is proving time and time again why it's receieving the attention it finally deserves.<br /><br />Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the homocide division of the LAPD and confronts the work of a highly skilled and methodical antagonist, Neil McCauley, (Robert De Niro) after a armored truck heist. Like Neil, Vincent is a master of his craft; dedicated, committed, passionate and just downright professional. It borderlines the point of obsession, or as wife succinctly puts it, "It is the only thing he is committed to doing." The only problem for Vincent is managing this demanding career and at the sametime reconciling the needs of his father/husband role at home. His emotionally disturbed step daughter, Lauren, (Natalie Portman) is quite the handful. Her emotional outbursts and not to mention a half way successful attempt at suicide is troubling indeed. Vincent's 3rd wife, Justine (Diane Venora) painstakingly and miserably fails to have her husband, and previous husband participate in Lauren's life.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a lone wolf; introverted, organized and very professional. He is a dedicated criminal and trusts his fellow crew members: Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) Nate (Jon Voight) Michael Cherrito (Tom Seizmore) Trejo (Danny Trejo) Waingro (Kevin Gage). During an armored heist, Waingro (a new crew member) is informed by Neil not to kill any of the guards in the truck as this is already established with the other crew members. Unfortunately, Waingro cannot handle the heat (No pun intended) during the operation and intentionally kills one of the guards before leaving the scene. Although the robbery is a success, an unnceccesary dead man is left behind for Vincent to start analyzing and fitting in the pieces of evidence.<br /><br />At a local diner, Neil and the crew know what must be done in terms of punishment for Waingro's misconduct during the heist. During their departure from the diner, Neil attempts to kill Waingro in the parking lot but is abruptly delayed from a local police officer patrolling nearby. As a result, Waingro escapes undetected but not entirely unscathed either. This sets up the 2nd chase between these two men. Waingro is not only a killer on the loose but a rapist too as we see later in the film.<br /><br />The chases between these characters are so well choreographed that the three hour run time seems like a 25 minute sit com episode. Michael Mann is successful at making the characters so real in their world. Moreover, he makes their interactions real and invokes such a genuine sense of familiarity with them. He invites you into their crime life, their family life, and their social life. No character in this film is belittled or made to seem less important when acting side by side with the main characters. Michael Mann treats every character with such equality; and, in effect, their emotional impact is significant and powerfully lasting.<br /><br />For example, Donald Breedan who plays a small role in this film (Dennis Haysbert) is a friend of Neils that just served time and is on parole working as a grill man in a local diner. Although his onscreen time is probably less than five minutes his interactions are so carefully crafted that his subsequent death as Neil's personal driver during a bank heist is quite sad, especially when we see his girlfriend's reaction to his death when shown on the television nightly news. In retrospect, Michael Mann creates realism to his environments. He familiarizes his audience with the characters, the landscape (Streets of LA) and everything in between. Nothing is left unscathed, Michael Mann is professional just like Neil and Vincent are.<br /><br />Some may not agree with me, but I would be more than happy to defend my statement above because I really haven't seen a film with Al Pacino or Robert De Niro that fulfills these aspects. But enlighten me, I am open to hearing differing opionions.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I am not a big Al Pacino or Robert De Niro fan but both play really good roles in this movie, Heat.  Very suspenseful with lots of action and keeps your attention well from beginning to the end.  There is a lot of violence as well and would not call it a family movie.  Even though it is 15 years old, it might still be one of the best combined action/suspense movies I have seen.  If you like mystery/crime films with a ton of action, then be sure to watch it if you have not already.<br /><br />Peter J.

Nothing is dated even 16 years later. The Michael Mann script is brilliant, as is the photography and the classic Michael Mann/Miami Vice score. The action is as good as the "romantic" moments, and the classic Pacino/DeNiro moment in a coffee shop is unforgettable. Lots of bullets and gore, but forgivable this one time only. I laughed because the actor who plays the psycho killer in "Silence of the Lambs" plays a cop here. Val Kilmer is top notch, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>If you want to test your Surround-Sound and accuracy under fire power (pun intended), Chapter 32 is a must-test case -- gunfire as it should be (also try &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;).

Its three-hour running time might scare some first-time viewers off, but don't be one of them.  This movie is tense, exciting, and meticulous in detail.  The first time I saw it was in the theaters, and its length was a bit taxing because I was tired before the movie started.  But subsequent viewings at home (and I have watched it A LOT) make me love this movie more and more.  It has high tech robberies, fierce shootouts in downtown L.A., and a wonderful soundtrack featuring Moby and others.  This movie sets the high standard for the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Two men on opposite sides of the law, both loners obsessed by what they do. Two of contemporary cinema's greatest actors, facing off for the first time in their 30+ year-long careers. A director with an impeccable sense of style. And a tremendous cast, whose every member delivers a truly stunning performance. These are some of the ingredients that elevate Michael Mann's "Heat" high above any average thriller.<br /><br />The film's mood is set from the very first camera shots, following Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) from a subway station to a hospital, to drive off with an ambulance he'll be using in his crew's next score. While we don't hear him speak a single word, his movements alone are unquestionably those of a leader; a man in absolute control of every situation. Like many of "Heat"'s crucial scenes (including the two lead characters' sole face-to-face encounters in a coffee shop and during the grand finale), the opening shots are set at night; and the hard contrast between almost black darkness and brightly shining neon lights thus established from the start is soon revealed as a hallmark of the movie's cinematography. One of the next shots shows McCauley's adversary-to-be, homicide Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) making love to his wife (Diane Venora). But afterwards there is no coziness; no conversation and no joint breakfast. Their relationship is disintegrating and, although fully aware that his obsession with his job is turning his life into a "disaster zone," it is ultimately Vincent who sacrifices it to that very obsession. Similarly, Neil has adopted a discipline of never letting himself get attached to anything he can't "walk out on in 30 seconds flat" if he feels the heat coming on: a discipline looming in the background even of his growing feelings for Eady (Amy Brenneman), with whom he has gotten involved against the instinct that told him to treat their encounter as a one-night-stand. Also troubled is the relationship between Neil's friend Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd); but there it is Chris who wants to hold on to their marriage, whereas Charlene, no longer able to cope with his gambling and immaturity, wants out, although she still clearly loves him.<br /><br />Vincent and Neil are pitted against each other after an armored car holdup of Neil's crew goes awry when a new man named Waingro (Kevin Gage), who will soon be revealed as a ruthless serial killer, escalates the robbery by shooting one of the guards. Knowing that they are now all up for first-degree murder, the gang don't hesitate to kill the other guards, so as not to leave a living witness. Yet, with the police on their trail they still plan two more scores; one at the Precious Metals Depository and one at a downtown bank, the latter of which in particular proves fatal when it ends in a shootout turning L.A.'s business district into a virtual war zone. Further complications arise out of Neil's attempt to sell the bearer bonds stolen in the holdup back to their owner, a shady businessman named Van Zant (William Fichtner), who ultimately pays a high price for underestimating him.<br /><br />Shortly before the bank heist, Vincent and Neil have a brief but crucial encounter in a coffee shop; and what has heretofore been mere respect developed from afar grows into a feeling of empathy and kinship when they discover their similarities. Yet, neither is willing to cross the lines: He won't like it, Vincent ultimately tells Neil, but if it's between Neil and "some poor (...) whose wife you are going to turn into a widow, brother, you are going down." Neil responds that on that coin's flip side, he, too, won't hesitate to kill Vincent if he gets in his way. And with their positions thus established, the action is up and almost never lets off again, until they meet again during their final chase over LAX's airfield.<br /><br />"Heat" is a self-described "Los Angeles crime saga," which by implication almost necessarily means that it's not characterized by down-to-earth realism; nor does it strive to be. Of course you do *not* walk away from a midday shootout with what looks like the better part of the LAPD's Central precinct (and unquestionably the movie's saddest unintended consequence was the real-life shootout provoked in imitation of this scene a few years later). Of course it's doubtful that guys like Vincent and Neil would ever sit down together over coffee - more likely, their encounter would have brought about Neil's arrest for murder, as Vincent by this time arguably had probable cause. Of course a real cop's loyalty would always be with his colleagues, and even respect for an adversary like Neil wouldn't propel him to hold his hand, after that same adversary had shot several of his fellow policemen. But all this is ultimately beside the point. This movie's entire dynamics are driven by the antagonism between its unexpectedly similar protagonists; and on that basis, their mutual feelings of empathy and even brotherhood are entirely credible.<br /><br />The pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino was a dream finally come true; for their performances alone, "Heat" deserves highest honors. While Pacino is his usual self as a supercharged bundle of dynamite, De Niro shows incredible (mannerism-free!) control, contrasting Pacino's bursts of temper with a chilling coolness that can nevertheless flip into ruthless violence in a split second, or into tenderness and emotion in his scenes with Eady. They are complemented by the stellar ensemble cast, also including, inter alia, Natalie Portman in her U.S. film debut as Vincent's troubled stepdaughter (after her very first appearance alongside Jean Reno in Luc Besson's "Leon"), John Voight and Tom Sizemore as Neil's associates Nate and Michael, Hank Azaria as Charlene's love interest and Mykelti Williamson and Wes Studi as Vincent's fellow cops. All in all, this is a truly outstanding production - and despite almost 3 hours' running time, not a minute too long.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XPPB">Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY5J">The Score</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305263248">Ronin</a></p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!<br /><br />This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a "landmark" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.<br /><br />As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on.<br /><br />Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.<br /><br />This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Inspired by a true story that occurred in 1964, Michael Mann's "Heat" reinvents the police action drama in the story of two men on opposite sides of the law who have respect for each other but, ultimately, must face off because of their roles in society. One a police officer named Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) the other a thief named Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) find they are flip sides of the same coin. McCauley hopes to pull off one big last score. His philosophy of life reflects that of a great thief; don't become attached to anything in life so that you can walk away. Pursued by an obsessed Hanna, he's driven only by the work and pushes his family away and pushes his men to capture McCauley before that last score goes down.<br /><br />A brilliant crime thriller where Mann reinvents the genre inverting the clich&eacute;s of the genre, the secret to "Heat" is the compelling story of duality that drives the characters and Mann's storytelling style and unconventional narrative that allows audiences to identify with both sides of the conflict. Stylish with rich visuals "Heat" captures Mann at the top of his game. "Heat" was, in fact, a remake of a film that Mann made for TV (as a possible pilot for a series). When producer Art Linson read the script he encouraged Mann to produce the original screenplay the way it was meant to be done with a top notch cast.<br /><br />Using the same transfer as last year's bare bones release, "Heat" looks positively beautiful. Mann's compositions and use of light and shadow immediately pull you into this urban tale of rivals on the opposite side of the law. It appears that this is the same anamorphic transfer that was done for the 1999 single disc release of the film. As with the previous edition the blacks darker than black coffee and the colors are solid. The only thing new here are the extensive extras and Michael Mann's commentary track. The audio makes nice use of the surround sound format placing sound effects all around the room where appropriate.<br /><br />A full disc of extras accompanies the film. Featuring 1 documentary divided into five parts which can be viewed in segments or all together, the first "The Making of Heat" features interviews with Mann and others from the production cast and crew discussing how Mann originally envisioned "Heat" (then called "L.A. Takedown") as the pilot for a TV series. The TV movie that Mann made in 1989 was an abridged version of the final script which, ultimately, became "Heat".  Mann had just completed writing "The Jericho Mile" (a TV movie) but no one was likely to approve him directing a major motion picture with the scope suggested by the script. Producer Art Linson read the complete screenplay that Mann had completed and told him bluntly, that it needed to be a feature film. Mann got his first choice for both major roles; both Pacino and De Niro agreed to do the film from the moment they were asked. Pacino discusses that his amped up take on his character was created because he envisioned that Hanna was on cocaine using it to keep him going so he could reach his objective of capturing McCauley. Pacino points out that Hanna is "a hunter"  and Mann states that he's "addicted" to complete the journey not so he can reach the end but just for the joy of catching the bad guy. In "Crime Stories"  the actors and production crew discuss how "Heat" has elements of a Greek tragedy as these two characters move towards their collision with no way out. Mann was interested in looking at the lives outside the story for each of these characters giving them depth and background.<br /><br />"Pacino and De Niro in Conversation" discusses the legendary showdown between Pacino and De Niro who meet together on screen for the first time. These two charismatic characters meet briefly in the film and that's the power of their meeting;  delaying their screen time creates tension. Both generate dramatic sparks on screen even though it's a low key conversation as they share their nightmares and their dreams. "Return to the Scene of the Crime" features the location manager and associate producer who discovered the locations for the film to revisit them and discuss how they found some of the unusual settings for the film.<br /><br />Mann's involving and intelligent commentary track really makes this worth getting by itself. While the documentaries are pretty good, nothing can beat Mann's insightful comments whether it be on Pacino's performance (and the background on the character that we never see but know from the actor's superb take on Hanna) to De Niro's meticulous working methods. It's one of the best solo commentary tracks I've heard.<br /><br />Sporting the same anamorphic widescreen transfer as the previous bare bones release from last year, the extras are what make "Heat" worthwhile. Mann's intelligent commentary and the second disc filled with documentaries and 11 deleted scenes make this worth picking up. My only complaint is that I wish the film had been released with a "L.A. Takedown" as a third disc. This would have made this the ultimate "boxed" set of a classic film. Well worth owning with incredible performances, strong extras and a detailed & thoughtful commentary from director Mann.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BFJFJRXMWXAX.html">A3BFJFJRXMWXAX</a><br/><p>Heat stands out as not only one of the five best films of the 1990s, but as one of the best thriller/action movies of all time.  Why?  Let me count the ways.  The apex of the the film is of course, the incredible bank heist and gun battle which follows it.  I have NEVER seen anything like it on film.  The camera work varies at times from hand-held to steady and that gives the entire segment an heir of hyper-reality if you will-as much or even more so than more famous later examples such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Michael Mann is one of the best film makers of the modern era, and in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, this is his best film.<p>It's easy to see how a film with both Pacino and De Niro would be great.  But there are many other ways in which this film towers above most others, many of them due to the amazing cinematography work and editing.  Observe Mann's gorgeous use of color and shadow; the blue tint as Pacino is chasing De Niro on the freeway at night, the beautiful balcony scene with Amy Brenneman (who is amazing), the final scene of the film, the color and tone of Pacino's home, the various restaurants etc.  The colors are brilliant-dark is REALLY dark.  Also, the pains that Mann and others have gone to in order to present the most realistic depiction of the crossing of paths and dreams; these are not cardboard characters, these are (mostly) fully fleshed out people with their own fears and goals and greed.  The film retains an undercurrent of menace and fear throughout, and the action is enough for any action film buff.  How nice to see such a well-rounded film these days.<p>As far as the DVD goes, it looks and sounds quite good.  I am not a fan of Warner Bros. DVD work in general-you know they could have put a lot more on the disc than they did.  But what is there is great-three different trailers for the film among other things.  My only complaint is that there seem to be a few scenes in the film that literally look grainy.  I swear I can see the change in the light and color on the screen as a switch is made between film and videotape elements.  I have not heard anyone else mention this.  An avid film viewer such as myself noticed it only after two screenings, so perhaps more casual viewers have not. <p>This is a film that everyone should see at least once, if only to raise the low-brow standards that so many in our culture have embraced.  Essential.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama "Heat," directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by "Taking down scores;" it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for "being" is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what "he" does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end.  In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&amp;P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what you know he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in "Cape Fear" was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character.  Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job.  Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity.  The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  "Heat" is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Heat is an absolutely top notch crime thriller, with fabulous action scenes, excellent character development, great subplots, and strong performances all around.

Even though both Pacino and De Niro had stared in the same film, Godfather Part 2, they were never in the same scenes. Here in Michael Mann's Electrifying Film "Heat" we get the honor of having them both together...though only for 10 min. Still there is so much more to the movie that will want you to revisit this film again and again.<br /><br />In Heat Pacino plays a cop, one that is so devoted to his work, that he barely has time for his wife and stepdaughter. The issue between his family is so grave that it's sinking him personally. To make matters worse, a professional thief (De Niro) has established a team to steal bearer bonds from a bank, and re sell them at a certain percentage, promising the bank that they will have a high investment. Pacino's character is so into this thief that he will do the impossible to take him down.  But wait, there is more, De Niro will prepare a smart maneuver to prepare what to me is the best heist in a movie.<br /><br />Heat is magnificently directed by Michael Mann, this is by far his best movie. the cinematography is so realistic and in your face. The action is choreographed and presented with out any flaws whatsoever. The Plot is crafted intelligently and by the book, with slick dialogue and clever editing.<br /><br />Unfortunately Heat is not without flaws, the movie has a double edge sword. The movie's pace can be at times very slow. I sometimes was eagerly awaiting for something to blow up...still that is what makes the picture so amazing, the pace...you need to listen and pay attention to the lines...its written so you can re-view the film and appreciate it more. The best part aside from the heist is the meeting between Pacino and De Niro at a restaurant. The dialogue is so well written. The best line by Pacino is "if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it. But I tell you, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down."<br /><br />This is definitely a movie to own by all means. The only thing I advice is to pay attention and to have patience with it. It can be slow, but the action is sure there, and it delivers, to the max.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I don't know I missed seeing this terrific film when it first came out, but somehow I did. It's a brilliantly written, beautifully acted, deeply involving cops and robbers story, starring Al Pacino as police Lt. Vincent Hanna, a loud-mouthed sleuth with an ex-wife (and a not-happy current spouse) who always gets his man, and Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, extremely skilled professional heist man. Both are rather thoughtful and analytical and there's a great scene where they sit down in a coffee shop and wax philosophical about their antagonistic relationship. The scene in which the good guys are surveiling the bad guys, only to discover that they are being examined through binoculars in turn, is also first rate. Val Kilmer plays a thoroughly scary shooter -- who, quite unexpectedly, appears to escape in the end. There are numerous interpersonal relationships, between Kilmer and his long-suffering wife (Ashley Judd) who warns him away, between Hanna and his wife and his messed-up stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), and between McCauley and a completely innocent bystander whom he comes to care for but whom he is also willing to leave behind on thirty seconds notice. All the numerous supporting roles are also very nicely done.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Pacino and De Niro were perfectly cast for this movie. Jon Voight is the guy who gives De Niro and his crew "the scores." Pacino is the cop who tries to nail De Niro's kind before they can "take down scores."  Great acting, great plot. Bad Guys vs. Good Guys. Bad Guys vs Bad Guys......<br /><br />The bank robbery shootout was a masterpiece. For once a movie portrayed the "professional bad guys" as actually knowing how to shoot.  And boy, do they hand the cops their BEE-HINDS in their hats. They basically kicked cop-butt. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore join De Niro with their assault rifles in the mayhem they lay out on the streets of L.A. This is the kind of movie that's get cops wailing and whining that they're out-gunned in the streets, when in reality, all you gotta' do is to practice shooting your weapon, and lay off the freakin' donuts.<br /><br />William Fitchner plays a double-crossing bad guy who gets his just desserts toward the end of the movie. The scene where his men try and double-cross DeNiro's crew in the abandoned drive-in was just another example of the difference between the pro's and the amateurs.<br /><br />The dialogue between Pacino and De Niro in the restaurant should have been an "Oscar" winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Theres not much I can add to what has already been said. However if by some miracle you've missed this film over the last 12 years then here is a quick overview of one of the best crime movies ever made.<br /><br />Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star as respectively dedicated cop and master criminal. Pacino as Cop Vincent Hanna is so dedicated that he neglects his family and his 3rd marraige is falling apart. DeNiro as Neil McCauley is a man who is prepared to walk away from any relationship in order to maintain his criminal lifestyle. A previous reviewer gave the acting honours to Pacino, which I'd have to disagree with. Lets be clear here both are excellent, and I like both actors, they are amongst the best ever. But for my money DeNiro steals it in perhaps his last great performance. Pacino just overplays his part just a little bit, which allows me to give it to DeNiro - but only just.<br /><br />The remainder of the cast are excellent and Michael Mann directs with his usual skill. Some of the action sequences in this film are brilliantly done. I recently saw Mission Impossible III, which has some impressive action sequences in it but they aren't in the same league as the ones in this film. Why? Because Heat does not rely on CGI effects and the camerawork is vastly superior. Furthermore action sequences do not need to contain explosions every 30 seconds to make them work!<br /><br />This is quite a long film at 164mins but you will find that it passes very quickly - always the sigh of a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Al Pacino and Robert Deniro never starred in a movie before this. Well they were in Godfatheer 2 together but shared no scenes together anyway. They chose the right movie to star in together with Heat that's for sure. They both are equelly good here. Pacino plays a cop on the trail of criminals who are great at what they do. Deniro plays the leader of the robbers.  Him and his team do a job that was just supposed to  be steal the money from a armered truck and leave. Deniro's character believes in killing only when you have to. Things go bad though when a new member of his team turns out to be nuts and kills the guards out of cold blood.<br /><br />  This movie has a great script and great director that both give Pacino and Deniro a chance to do some of their best work. It's original and smart. Is one scene where Pacino pulls over Deniro and instead of arresting him. They go get a cup coffee and get to know each other as people. You don't get that much in movies at all. What shortly follows that scene is an awesome robbery scene that's one of the best ever filmed. This film just has it all. Realistic human emotion, a great cast and one of the best endings to a movie I've ever scene. Elliot Goldenthal's great musical score makes the ending even more powerful and beautiful . Why this wasn't nominated for best picture is beyond me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The film, much hyped for the first onscreen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, opens with an only in Hollywood heist of an armored bank truck. The newest member of the gang- Waingro (Kevin Gage)- panics, which results in the murder of the 3 guards. De Niro's character, Neil McCauley, the gang's leader, attempts to kill the screw up, but he escapes. Meanwhile, Vincent Hanna (Pacino), LAPD homicide expert, takes over the case. Needless digressions include Hanna's failing marriage with his faithless wife Justine (Diane Venora) & suicidal stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), Waingroe's revelation as a serial killer of prostitutes, McCauley's contrived and sparkless romance with a lonely bookworm 25 years his junior, Eady (Amy Brenneman), & the backstory of the newest member of the gang. If the long and superfluous digressions are not bad enough, the implausible action scenes & character interactions are worse- this is an absolutely abominable screenplay, folks. Here are just some of the implausibilities: after figuring out that McCauley's thieves have turned the tables on him Hanna stops McCauley, who absurdly agrees to a cup of joe with him. This is the big `Clash of Titans' the film hypes, but is as realistic as John Ashcroft breaking bread with Osama bin Laden. Instead, we get insipid dick on the table banter as Hanna warns McCauley he just might have to `take him out'. McCauley counters, `Oh yeah? I just might have to take you out.' It would have been a hoot had McCauley replied, `You talkin' to me?', but no such luck....  In short, Heat is a mediocre movie at best- its visual style accounting for whatever props it deserves. It was only 2 years later that the brilliant L.A. Confidential came along & showed America what a truly great crime film could be. As for the DVD itself? It's no-frills- there's no commentary, 3 trailers, but the actual transfer of the film print is very clean, as is the sound quality. Curiously, the DVD package seems to recapitulate the making of the film: great attention paid to the shine, but a fairly hollow core.<br />  I waited years to see this film because it was so overhyped, just like I waited years to see the abominable Schindler's List. Heat is not that bad, but post-9/11 this sort of juvenilia all seems kind of unreal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Clocking in at almost three hours, Michael Mann's "Heat" is one of the most ambitious crime dramas in recent memory. It is filled with so many characters and story arcs that its scale is overwhelming at times. Thankfully, the two central actors in the film are such strong anchors that they manage to keep you from losing your focus while watching this grand tale unfold before your eyes. The two actors are the twin living legends of cinema - Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. <p>Los Angeles police detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is handed the job of tracking down a team of professional thieves. They are led by a clever ex-con named Neil McCauley (De Niro) who is as cool as he is calculating. McCauley lives by a strict code of conduct that demands that he be disciplined enough to walk away from anything in his life if the heat is on. When a loose end from an earlier heist interferes with his enjoying the spoils of a subsequent heist, McCauley finds out if he really can carry out this dictate. If he can, then he will be able to start a new life for himself. If he cannot, then Hanna will bring to an end his obsession with McCauley by finally catching his prey.<p>Most of the attention this film received was due to the presence of its two leads. Pacino and DeNiro certainly do not disappoint and their discussion in the coffee shop is certainly the highlight of the film. Yet, the performances of the supporting cast should also be noted. Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and Ashley Judd turn in great performances and manage not to be overwhelmed by all the machismo around them. Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and Tom Sizemore also enhance the film with the presence. Kilmer is particularly strong in his role and his relationship with Judd is the most touching of the male-female story arcs in the film. <p>Michael Mann once again manages to achieve the proper balance of substance and style in a feature film. "Heat" has an authentic feel and a sense of realism that elevates it above its clich&eacute;-filled brethrens. There are some issues with the film that hinder matters - the Natalie Portman arc is underdeveloped, the Waingro character should have had more of a presence, and the film's pacing drags at spots. Yet, "Heat" is still a solid film that is well worth watching. In a closing note, I'd like to recommend reading Nick James' analysis of "Heat" from the "BFI Modern Classics" book series. The book is a solid critique that will open your eyes to facets of the film not considered before.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>At times plodding and overwrought--the line about "heat" itself is rather clumsy--"Heat" nonetheless is an entertaining cops and robbers thriller that benefits from the contrast between leads Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.  These heavy hitters from the 1970s finally get to meet onscreen in a scene that is delightful for being so underplayed.  Director Michael Mann, whose magnificent retelling of "The Last of the Mohicans" set a new standard for action films, is in fine visual form here; his camerawork is crisp and confident, and he relies on his signature "slow burn" shots and music to carry much of the emotional punch.  With Sergio Leone and Peter Yates obvious influences--the ending of the film alone seems taken right out of "Bullitt"--Mann sometimes also dips into "Miami Vice" territory with the pacing of "Heat"; what works on TV, though, doesn't always work in film, and here there are a few too many "talking head" scenes that slow the film down.  The story is relatively simple:  a gang of bank robbers is tracked by an obsessed cop after turning the streets of downtown Los Angeles into a war zone.  Along the way, the film explores buddy and romantic relationships, culminating in a chase that is correctly the focal point of these entanglements.  Co-stars Val Kilmer, John Voight, and Amy Brenneman are capable, but it's pretty clear that DeNiro and Pacino are the stars.  The barebones DVD leaves a bit to be desired, though it fares better than the director's cut of "The Last of the Mohicans," which wasn't really an improvement over the theatrical version of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both had their share of mob related films: Al's Scarface, all 3 Godfathers and Donnie Brasco, and Robert's Casino, Goodfellas and Godfather Part 2. This is the first time they've been paired up and it's thrilling to see.<p>Robert plays Neil Mccauley, a highly intelligent thief who goes around and fine points every single &quot;hit&quot; or robbery. Al plays Vincent Hanna, an LA detective who's away from his wife and house making for some bad moments at home. One tries to tie up loose ends and leave the country with his new woman, the other tries to get enough evidence on the other to nail him.<p>One of the key scenes(and also a bit original in terms of crime stories) is when Neil and Vincent having a cup of coffee and just talking rather than trying to beat each other up. It plays nicely and it's new as usually when heroes and villians meet, it's always one trying to stop the other, but here it's more &quot;sooner or later I'm going to get you, it's not today but one day&quot; scenes. Another key scene is when a bank heist goes horribly wrong as the cops get tipped off and Neil, Chris(Val Kilmer) have to fight their way through a street in Los Angeles and escape. It's a big joy to see.<p>The ending however leaves me a little disappointed. The film ends in a big one on one showdown between Neil and Vincent then it just ends. But several characters you never figure out what happens to them or what they're gonna do but it's a great film with 2 classic actors squaring off</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>much like with Harlem Nights that had Richard Pryor&amp;Eddie Murphy i was all hyped to see it and it was not to good.well the same goes here i thought wow! De Niro&amp;Pacino? but this film is long winded and over the  top.considering the talent here it's a very average film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Heat did not have to be a lot of the things that it was, or have the things that it had. For instance, it didn't have to be three hours long. There were a lot of extra scenes that could have easily been left out, or cut shorter. Al Pacino did a great job (as always), and De Niro did well with what they gave him to work with, which wasn't great. Val Kilmer was not needed to play his part, as was the same situation with Ashley Judd's character, and with Jon Voight's. For a better Michael Mann film, see The Insider. Heat was fine to watch once. It had its good elements, but not enough to spend another three hours for a second viewing. It is not something that kids would enjoy, and its R rating is due to violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>After watching DeNiro & Pacino in their most recent outing, "Righteous Kill", I came to appreciate this film even more although they had more screen time in this one than in "Heat", "Heat" is still a crime classic in the Warner Bros tradition.  Each character is clearly delinerated and all the situations we see them in are compelling particularly DeNiro's and Pacino's characters--there is never a dull moment in this actioner. The supporting cast of Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Tom Sizemore, and a very young Natalie Portman is excellent and of course Mann's visual style really put us in that mood of doom.  Rather than give away any details of the plot, if you're in the mood for a crime saga--check it out!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray to appear someday. Well to update this review, I purchased the Blu-ray edition on 12/13/09 and it's definitely an improvement over the Standard Def version.  As far as the dialogue being deleted from Diane Venora's monologue--it's just a few word but noticeable.  I don't why Warners did this on the Blu-ray perhaps there should be an explanation of this.  Regardless I'm keeping my disc.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B350OHYHQTGX.html">A1B350OHYHQTGX</a><br/><p>When the two giants Al Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro meet... it surely turns on the HEAT.<p>This movie is so perfect in every element that makes a movie so successful. But what I liked most was the meating between Al Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro for a cup of coffee... the conversation that took place between them is very touchy.<p>But there should be a special edition of this DVD. Because the current DVD lacks so many features... yes this movie deserves a better DVD edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>First off--personally, I'd give this film five stars, but I'm rating the DVD, and it does not justice to fans .<p>This is just not your typical 'cop' film by a long shot.  Michael Mann has been aiming for this his whole career.  His Thief (1981) has similar elements, even similar scenes.  Heat is actually a remake of Mann's own LA Takedown, a 1989 TV film.  <p>With Heat, every element is in place.  The cast is a dream, even for a Hollywood film.  DeNiro and Pacino do some of their best work and even the ground in the story of a dedicated cop tracking the leader of a band of professional thieves.  The surrounding players are all pro: Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Jon Voight.  The film has the perfect look, a cold, steely blue light and a much different look at LA than in any film.  The soundtrack is in place as well, a mix of Eliot Goldenthal's rich score, Lisa Gerrard, Brian Eno, and Kronos Quartet.<p>At three hours, Mann throws in everything.  The director's reverence for the material pushes the film way past genre.  It's unfair to call Heat a 'heist' film or even a 'crime' film.  It's a rich drama about relationships between cops and crooks and men and women.<p>The action is spectacular, everyone remembers the shootout scene in downtown LA.  It highlights an awesome sound mix.  Though it's extreme, it wasn't two years before a two man crew pulled off a bank heist and started a massive shootout with cops in North Hollywood.  <p>The DVD sucks.  For a film like this, a three hour epic from a big name director, with these stars, we get zilch.  Three theatrical trailers, and French subtitles.  There's a Dolby 5.1 mix, and the film is in widescreen with a nice, clean picture.  I'm guessing Mann had little say in the release; this is doubtless a film that should get a commentary track and some behind the scenes material.<p>However, for now it's recommended on the strength of an excellent American crime film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Two men on opposite sides of the law, both loners obsessed by what they do. Two of contemporary cinema's greatest actors, facing off for the first time in their 30+ year-long careers. A director with an impeccable sense of style. And a tremendous cast, whose every member delivers a truly stunning performance. These are some of the ingredients that elevate Michael Mann's "Heat" high above any average thriller.<br /><br />The film's mood is set from the very first camera shots, following Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) from a subway station to a hospital, to drive off with an ambulance he'll be using in his crew's next score. While we don't hear him speak a single word, his movements alone are unquestionably those of a leader; a man in absolute control of every situation. Like many of "Heat"'s crucial scenes (including the two lead characters' sole face-to-face encounters in a coffee shop and during the grand finale), the opening shots are set at night; and the hard contrast between almost black darkness and brightly shining neon lights thus established from the start is soon revealed as a hallmark of the movie's cinematography. One of the next shots shows McCauley's adversary-to-be, homicide Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) making love to his wife (Diane Venora). But afterwards there is no coziness; no conversation and no joint breakfast. Their relationship is disintegrating and, although fully aware that his obsession with his job is turning his life into a "disaster zone," it is ultimately Vincent who sacrifices it to that very obsession. Similarly, Neil has adopted a discipline of never letting himself get attached to anything he can't "walk out on in 30 seconds flat" if he feels the heat coming on: a discipline looming in the background even of his growing feelings for Eady (Amy Brenneman), with whom he has gotten involved against the instinct that told him to treat their encounter as a one-night-stand. Also troubled is the relationship between Neil's friend Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd); but there it is Chris who wants to hold on to their marriage, whereas Charlene, no longer able to cope with his gambling and immaturity, wants out, although she still clearly loves him.<br /><br />Vincent and Neil are pitted against each other after an armored car holdup of Neil's crew goes awry when a new man named Waingro (Kevin Gage), who will soon be revealed as a ruthless serial killer, escalates the robbery by shooting one of the guards. Knowing that they are now all up for first-degree murder, the gang don't hesitate to kill the other guards, so as not to leave a living witness. Yet, with the police on their trail they still plan two more scores; one at the Precious Metals Depository and one at a downtown bank, the latter of which in particular proves fatal when it ends in a shootout turning L.A.'s business district into a virtual war zone. Further complications arise out of Neil's attempt to sell the bearer bonds stolen in the holdup back to their owner, a shady businessman named Van Zant (William Fichtner), who ultimately pays a high price for underestimating him.<br /><br />Shortly before the bank heist, Vincent and Neil have a brief but crucial encounter in a coffee shop; and what has heretofore been mere respect developed from afar grows into a feeling of empathy and kinship when they discover their similarities. Yet, neither is willing to cross the lines: He won't like it, Vincent ultimately tells Neil, but if it's between Neil and "some poor (...) whose wife you are going to turn into a widow, brother, you are going down." Neil responds that on that coin's flip side, he, too, won't hesitate to kill Vincent if he gets in his way. And with their positions thus established, the action is up and almost never lets off again, until they meet again during their final chase over LAX's airfield.<br /><br />"Heat" is a self-described "Los Angeles crime saga," which by implication almost necessarily means that it's not characterized by down-to-earth realism; nor does it strive to be. Of course you do *not* walk away from a midday shootout with what looks like the better part of the LAPD's Central precinct (and unquestionably the movie's saddest unintended consequence was the real-life shootout provoked in imitation of this scene a few years later). Of course it's doubtful that guys like Vincent and Neil would ever sit down together over coffee - more likely, their encounter would have brought about Neil's arrest for murder, as Vincent by this time arguably had probable cause. Of course a real cop's loyalty would always be with his colleagues, and even respect for an adversary like Neil wouldn't propel him to hold his hand, after that same adversary had shot several of his fellow policemen. But all this is ultimately beside the point. This movie's entire dynamics are driven by the antagonism between its unexpectedly similar protagonists; and on that basis, their mutual feelings of empathy and even brotherhood are entirely credible.<br /><br />The pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino was a dream finally come true; for their performances alone, "Heat" deserves highest honors. While Pacino is his usual self as a supercharged bundle of dynamite, De Niro shows incredible (mannerism-free!) control, contrasting Pacino's bursts of temper with a chilling coolness that can nevertheless flip into ruthless violence in a split second, or into tenderness and emotion in his scenes with Eady. They are complemented by the stellar ensemble cast, also including, inter alia, Natalie Portman in her U.S. film debut as Vincent's troubled stepdaughter (after her very first appearance alongside Jean Reno in Luc Besson's "Leon"), John Voight and Tom Sizemore as Neil's associates Nate and Michael, Hank Azaria as Charlene's love interest and Mykelti Williamson and Wes Studi as Vincent's fellow cops. All in all, this is a truly outstanding production - and despite almost 3 hours' running time, not a minute too long.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XPPB">Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY5J">The Score</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305263248">Ronin</a></p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>One of my favorite moments in cinema from the past decade?<br /><br />Val Kilmer emerges from a shiny L.A. bank with roughly $700,000,000,000 in a sack on his back.  Elliott Goldenthal's "Force Marker" clicks and bumps and pulses on the soundtrack.  Kilmer's in a grey suit, he's got his shades on, he's grinning, strutting a little, he's roughly eight feet away from being the last man into the getaway car and, oops, he spots a flash of an ambush waiting on the other side of a passing bus.  Boom, in 0.8 seconds he just lets rip with the AK.  And then we're off into a live action "Grand Theft Auto" inspiration, a truly staggering sequence that absolutely must be seen in widescreen.  Turn it up.<br /><br />Finally we have a decent DVD edition of the best cop movie of the 1990s. One of the great pleasures of moviegoing in this century is to see the way Michael Mann points a camera at city nightscapes, clothing, guns, vehicles, wrist watches, cash, blueprints, helicopters, crime scenes, power tools, telephones, cars and the eyes of men and women doing hard work.  All of that is on display here.<br /><br />I could go on forever about the extas here (praising the cool commentary by Mann, slamming the "deleted" scenes, sending out minor gripes about non-juiced-up picture and sound) but others have already done that better than I could.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>How can a film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro be bad?  It really can't because they would never approve the script or director.  By that I  mean, they would pass.  The fact that neither of them passed says  something.  At the very least, this is a pretty good film.<p>And it is.  In  fact I think this will be one of the defining films of the nineties.  I  suspect it will be viewed in distant eras and scrutinized for clues about  the American psyche, circa 1995.  Some will see a fantasy glorifying  professional criminals and the men who fight them.  This will be true.  Others will see a morality tale about good and evil played out with women  in the background, but actually in the forefront of our consciousness.  I  wish this part had been more fully developed.<p>Eady, played by Amy  Brennaman, chooses the man who excites her (De Niro) and ends up with  nothing (but she had an exhilarating ride).  Charlene, played by Ashley  Judd, swaps her men around, searching for the best deal, the one who will  best provide for her and the one she can best manipulate.  Justine, played  by Diane Venova, cannot help but choose the workaholic super cop (Pacino)  because he is so superior to any other man she's ever met, particularly to  her first husband, the uncaring father of her adolescent girl.  But her  life will never be secure because he is always leaving her alone so he can  chase criminals because that is what he really loves.<p>Some of this is a  mafia-style film without the mafia.  We have the same worshipful attitude  toward those who thumb their noses at society and give orders that must be  obeyed, super macho guys who bond together and follow the code, guys who  can out shoot and out fight mere mortals.  This is part of the fantasy.  We  see the expensive cars and the dinners with the beautiful women and the  adorable children at fancy restaurants as part of the booty of being men  who aren't afraid to take what they want regardless of risk.  These men  will always have the pick of the herd because, if successful, their mates  know they will get a lot of the goodies of this world, and if unsuccessful,  there's always the next risk taker who might succeed.<p>This is a complex  film and I would have to view it twice to make sure it all fits.  Being a  thriller, I know off hand that it won't.  Thrillers unravel.  But life is  too short to view this twice, so I will say I wasn't offended by the  unlikely events: the fact that the touted bank robbery scene was like a war  scene filmed with surround sound effects and jittery camera immersions and  bullets flying everywhere-semi-plausible even if nobody seemed to run out  of ammunition.  The robbery of the armored truck was nicely done except  that the tire-puncturing chain strewn across the street for the pursuing  cop cars seemed a bit stagy, and the whole thing required the most  exquisite timing.  In the uncompleted break-in there was a familiar  "Mission Impossible" tension-filled race against the clock that seemed  authentic, but probably wasn't.  The Los Angeles environs, especially the  final scene at LAX, provided atmospheric locales that made everything seem  real and immediate.<p>Where I think director Michael Mann went astray was  his insistence on giving the audience the expected confrontation between  the two big stars, a subplot that reached its low point with the phony  bonding scene with De Niro the bad guy and Pacino the good guy having  coffee together and exchanging dreams like blood brothers.  This mutual  admiration society was right out of some WWII film in which the American  general admires the courage and cunning of his Nazi counter part and vice  versa.  De Niro's final line was a little corny, but Pacino's squeezing  his hand reminded me of the way a big cat lovingly licks its prey after  killing it.  Bottom line though, Pacino and De Niro made us believe, or at  least suspend judgment for awhile, and that is what Hollywood is all about.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, "Heat" pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000G3PL">Lethal Weapon - The Complete Series</a>) are "getting too old for this ...."<br /><br />"Heat" is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale - the bank robbery - it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.<br /><br />Undeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN2Z">Collateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UGBOT0">Manhunter</a>) unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, "Heat" lives up to its name.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>As we all know, the film Righteous Kill wasn't the first time we have had two godlike actors together. True, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were both in The Godfather Part II, but they never appeared together onscreen. But here, we have them together onscreen for the first time, even though it's only ten minutes total. But this isn't the only thing that makes Heat so special.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Michael Mann's most extraordinary films, along with Last Of The Mohicans and Collateral. It's more of a psychological experience (with some operatic touches in the story) when you think about it. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a hot-headed Detective who is primarily obssessed with his career, which makes his personal life even more of a living hell. Neil McCauley (De Niro), on the other hand, is a calm professional thief who strictly believes in one rule: "Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner." That is, until a young woman comes into his life. These two figures of undeniable differences collide into what becomes an official operatic tragedy.<br /><br />This is a complete work of art. It's just as epic as the Godfather saga (excluding the length). I love how all the sub-plots are connected with each other, and how we get to understand many of the supporting characters. I especially love the shots of Los Angeles: the scenes in where the skyscrapers are in the background blend in almost perfectly. I especially love Pacino's sarcastic dialogue ("'Cause she got . . . a GREAT A**!"). I even love Dennis Haysbert's own little storyline, and how it relates to an even harsher reality. And don't think that I'll leave out the famous shootout sequence in the middle of the film, because I'm smarter than that. This sequence has got to be one of the finest action sequences ever put on film. The lack of background music makes it all much more realistic, the assault rifles and their echoed sounds are truly authentic, the bullet holes are spot-on, and even the fear and panic of the L.A. citizens become a welcome addition. By the way, Kilmer's reloading should be something worth watching. Why? Because it's bad@**!<br /><br />We've probably all seen Mann, Pacino, and De Niro's films more than once. This one I'll always rewatch until my DVD wears out. This is a classic film of the 90's. I can safely recommend this film to fans of Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Mann, action, suspense, drama, and even Moby.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Two men on opposite sides of the law, both loners obsessed by what they do. Two of contemporary cinema's greatest actors, facing off for the first time in their 30+ year-long careers. A director with an impeccable sense of style. And a tremendous cast, whose every member delivers a truly stunning performance. These are some of the ingredients that elevate Michael Mann's "Heat" high above any average thriller.<br /><br />The film's mood is set from the very first camera shots, following Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) from a subway station to a hospital, to drive off with an ambulance he'll be using in his crew's next score. While we don't hear him speak a single word, his movements alone are unquestionably those of a leader; a man in absolute control of every situation. Like many of "Heat"'s crucial scenes (including the two lead characters' sole face-to-face encounters in a coffee shop and during the grand finale), the opening shots are set at night; and the hard contrast between almost black darkness and brightly shining neon lights thus established from the start is soon revealed as a hallmark of the movie's cinematography. One of the next shots shows McCauley's adversary-to-be, homicide Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) making love to his wife (Diane Venora). But afterwards there is no coziness; no conversation and no joint breakfast. Their relationship is disintegrating and, although fully aware that his obsession with his job is turning his life into a "disaster zone," it is ultimately Vincent who sacrifices it to that very obsession. Similarly, Neil has adopted a discipline of never letting himself get attached to anything he can't "walk out on in 30 seconds flat" if he feels the heat coming on: a discipline looming in the background even of his growing feelings for Eady (Amy Brenneman), with whom he has gotten involved against the instinct that told him to treat their encounter as a one-night-stand. Also troubled is the relationship between Neil's friend Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd); but there it is Chris who wants to hold on to their marriage, whereas Charlene, no longer able to cope with his gambling and immaturity, wants out, although she still clearly loves him.<br /><br />Vincent and Neil are pitted against each other after an armored car holdup of Neil's crew goes awry when a new man named Waingro (Kevin Gage), who will soon be revealed as a ruthless serial killer, escalates the robbery by shooting one of the guards. Knowing that they are now all up for first-degree murder, the gang don't hesitate to kill the other guards, so as not to leave a living witness. Yet, with the police on their trail they still plan two more scores; one at the Precious Metals Depository and one at a downtown bank, the latter of which in particular proves fatal when it ends in a shootout turning L.A.'s business district into a virtual war zone. Further complications arise out of Neil's attempt to sell the bearer bonds stolen in the holdup back to their owner, a shady businessman named Van Zant (William Fichtner), who ultimately pays a high price for underestimating him.<br /><br />Shortly before the bank heist, Vincent and Neil have a brief but crucial encounter in a coffee shop; and what has heretofore been mere respect developed from afar grows into a feeling of empathy and kinship when they discover their similarities. Yet, neither is willing to cross the lines: He won't like it, Vincent ultimately tells Neil, but if it's between Neil and "some poor (...) whose wife you are going to turn into a widow, brother, you are going down." Neil responds that on that coin's flip side, he, too, won't hesitate to kill Vincent if he gets in his way. And with their positions thus established, the action is up and almost never lets off again, until they meet again during their final chase over LAX's airfield.<br /><br />"Heat" is a self-described "Los Angeles crime saga," which by implication almost necessarily means that it's not characterized by down-to-earth realism; nor does it strive to be. Of course you do *not* walk away from a midday shootout with what looks like the better part of the LAPD's Central precinct (and unquestionably the movie's saddest unintended consequence was the real-life shootout provoked in imitation of this scene a few years later). Of course it's doubtful that guys like Vincent and Neil would ever sit down together over coffee - more likely, their encounter would have brought about Neil's arrest for murder, as Vincent by this time arguably had probable cause. Of course a real cop's loyalty would always be with his colleagues, and even respect for an adversary like Neil wouldn't propel him to hold his hand, after that same adversary had shot several of his fellow policemen. But all this is ultimately beside the point. This movie's entire dynamics are driven by the antagonism between its unexpectedly similar protagonists; and on that basis, their mutual feelings of empathy and even brotherhood are entirely credible.<br /><br />The pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino was a dream finally come true; for their performances alone, "Heat" deserves highest honors. While Pacino is his usual self as a supercharged bundle of dynamite, De Niro shows incredible (mannerism-free!) control, contrasting Pacino's bursts of temper with a chilling coolness that can nevertheless flip into ruthless violence in a split second, or into tenderness and emotion in his scenes with Eady. They are complemented by the stellar ensemble cast, also including, inter alia, Natalie Portman in her U.S. film debut as Vincent's troubled stepdaughter (after her very first appearance alongside Jean Reno in Luc Besson's "Leon"), John Voight and Tom Sizemore as Neil's associates Nate and Michael, Hank Azaria as Charlene's love interest and Mykelti Williamson and Wes Studi as Vincent's fellow cops. All in all, this is a truly outstanding production - and despite almost 3 hours' running time, not a minute too long.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XPPB">Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY5J">The Score</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305263248">Ronin</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Everybody was hoping for it. In 1995, it finally happened!<br /><br />That year, director Michael Mann (Ali) convinced the two strongest actors of our time Oscar winners Robert Deniro (Raging Bull) and Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman) to co-star in the intense action thriller Heat. Heat would become the stars' second shared credit in a movie together, the first being The Godfather Part 2, in which both actors did not appear together in any of the scenes, and Deniro won a supporting actor Oscar for.<br /><br />Pacino plays LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna, while Deniro plays heist master Neil McCauley. Hanna is aching to bust McCauley in the act, and McCauley knows Hanna's every move. Two of them are the flipside of one another. Hanna's got family problems, McCauley's got a love interest who thinks he's a salesman. Hanna is great at his job in putting crooks away, McCauley is great at his 'job' in stealing millions of dollars and getting away with it.<br /><br />We sit, watch and anticipate the moment that these two powerful men meet. When they do, it's for a cup of coffee in a restaurant, where each rival sets the other one straight. Neither will hesitate in killing the other if they ever cross each other or come face to face while in the line of duty, even if it will risk uncovering McCauley's true identity and losing the woman he loves.<br /><br />Director Mann takes a back seat and lets his star-studded cast which includes Val Kilmer (The Doors), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Jon Voight (Runaway Train), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith), and Ashley Judd (Kiss The Girls) lead us into one of the most memorable mindblowing movie experiences of the past 10 years! Deniro and Pacino each delivers an outstanding performance in a movie that perfectly teams them up.<br /><br />Bring on the Heat!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A+</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>This movie is one of the best views of Los Angeles crime, period. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro give standout performances, yet the two share so little on screen time together. The action is the best I have ever seen since Die Hard and the Godfather, and the L.A. bank heist Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore pull off is genius and is so well executed that it is one of the greatest action scenes ever put on film.</p></br></body></html>

Scary clown? Check. Stupid teens w/ broken-down car? Check. It's hard to say whether certain decisions were "homage" or just plain copying (the psychotic, rural-redneck family straight out of Texas Chainsaw's many sequels, and the creepy babydoll-wearing matron pulled from Baby Jane) but taken together it's a mess of a movie. All of them, by themselves, interesting to disturbing images, perhaps... but the entire experience is haphazard and disjointed, and missing out on some crucial elements.<br /><br />Among the elements its missing are a central conflict between protagonist and antagonist. The stupid teens that stumble their way into the charnel-house never have any particular hope or ambition of getting out of things alive, and once they're caught, they're caught. For a conflict to work, whatever passes for the "hero" must have some semblance of plan or at least a fighting chance; here, we just watch to see how their deaths will pan out. There's no conflict in this film because nothing is standing in the way of the murderers' designs. It's all easy pickin's.<br /><br />The plot is ramshackle. Officers are thrown into the film and then summarily dispatched, having caused nothing more than a few more minutes to tick off the clock. It's as though Zombie decided, well, in this kind of horror film there are always a couple of local cops that get offed. And so, there must be some here, too! The murderers dine with their teen-victims, fix their car, let them go... and... then assault them.<br /><br />Why let them go (let alone fix their car), if the overall plan was murder? Sure, we could invent a reason, like "they wanted to play with their minds," but I think the actual reason is probably that Zombie envisioned a scene where scarecrows would "come to life" and attack. And so, he twisted the plot out of shape to realize that vision.<br /><br />This is not a good movie. It's not particularly scary, and fails at nearly every level of what we would call "drama." The only justification for the events in this film seems to be that Zombie wanted those events to happen so that he could film them. They serve no other purpose -- advancing plot, characterizing, developing theme -- that a person might look for in a story. Visually, which is where this particular movie lives or dies, I would say that it's over-produced. The movie just doesn't warrant the many "tricks" (cuts to grainy footage, negative prints, etc.) that are employed, and usually to no great effect or purpose. But there is a certain amount of command in the direction, and if the director had an actual script to work with, who knows but it might not have sucked.<br /><br />I'll give it a second star for some decent visual work, and the fact that many of the films this one hearkens to are some personal favorites of mine. That said, it never nears their quality, and fails on many basic, fundamental levels.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>House of 1,000 Corpses (HOTC) was one of those movies that I wanted to see merely because of the film's reputation.  After all, Rob Zombie, lover of all things shlocky and evil, created it. Therefore we were guaranteed a hoot of a bad time. Right?<br /><br />Well, not quite.<br /><br />Describing the plot is almost pointless, but I'll give it a try: Two couples are on a tour of the weird and strange in Middle America.  There's too dumb-to-live Jerry (Chris Hardwick), dubious Bill (Rainn Wilson, from The Office), Bill's girlfriend Mary (Jennifer Jostyn) and Jerry's girlfriend Denise (Erin Daniels).  They eventually run into Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), a ferocious clown with an attitude.  He's by far the best part of the show, chewing scenery and spitting nails with his pop-eyed attitude and his crusty accent. Spaulding lets slip that the notorious serial killer, Dr. Satan (Walter Phelan), was once hung from a nearby tree.  Of course, our Scooby gang has to go see it for themselves.<br /><br />What ensues is basically the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  They meet the Fireflys, who consists of every psycho family trope: scruffy Rufus (Robert Allen Mukes), lecherous Mother (Karen Black), cackling Grandpa (Dennis Fimple), gigantic Tiny (Matthew McGory) and last but not least, the highly annoying Baby (Sheri Moon and Rob's wife).  Residing over this insane brood is Otis (Bill Moseley), the lead serial killer and psycho who kidnaps a bunch of teenagers while lecturing them on his particularly twisted philosophy.  Somewhere in the background Sheriff Drake Huston (William Bassett) and Denise's father Don (Harrison Young) continue the search for our four protagonists after they disappear.<br /><br />There are a lot of problems with this film, not the least of which that it's obvious Zombie doesn't know what to do with the movie.  The plot particularly suffers, because there's no sense of dread.  Instead of making, say, the attack on the victims a sneaky ambush, it's an out-in-the-daylight scene with no mystery or suspense.  Even the initial scene, of Spaulding being robbed, completely lacks any real tension. Zombie's got high ambition, but he's obviously inexperienced and it shows.<br /><br />The film is schizophrenic in its tastes, uncertain as to whether it's a horror film or a science fiction flick.  At one point, Spaulding asks Bill what style of movies he likes and he indicates "science fiction."  That would explain the second half of the movie, which involves mutants, an undead doctor, and lots of trepanation.<br /><br />Through no fault of its own, Rainn Wilson in anything turns it into "Dwight in House of a Thousand Corpses." Seeing him get killed is unintentionally hilarious.  Then there's Baby, who is the most annoying character to grace the screen since Erkel.  Giggling in a high pitched screech reminiscent of dolphin speech, she recites stupid nursery rhymes, dances around in her underwear, and otherwise tries to be scary.  Instead, she just comes off as silly.<br /><br />House of a 1,000 Corpses is surprisingly tame in its gore and violence.  Sure, there's some weird dismembering and flesh sculpting, but none of it is on the level of say, Hostel.  For a movie that really revels in its gruesomeness, HOTC is sorely lacking.<br /><br />Still, HOTC some great moments.  There's a very long execution scene wherein Zombie uses the pregnant pause to spectacular effect, and he experiments with camera angles that work every fifth time he tries something new. It's telling that the best acting takes place during the insults the characters sling at you during the DVD menus.<br /><br />Zombie obviously has a lot to prove, as evidenced by his gonzo style of filmmaking.  There's a lot of "fades to pastel" (that's the only way I can describe it) instead of fading to black and white.  There's a creepy clown.  And there's plenty of down home wisecrackin', clownin', cannibalism, sadistic acts, and some science fiction crap thrown in at the end.<br /><br />HOTC is more a student's trial film than something meant for general viewing, and while it is occasionally entertaining, it's very unpolished.  Horror students can get away with a lot because the genre is very forgiving, but Zombie can do better. The sequel, The Devil's Rejects, should be a considerable improvement.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Gulp! This was one barmy film. By far the most true, nerve-wracking horror we've had in ages. Far too many 'horror' movies over the past 10 years have been neutralized sub-genre flicks starring generic babes and hunks from teen soaps. Nothing of the sort here. Rob Zombie has made a REAL horror film with some shocking and unbelievable elements.<p>Four kids, on their way home, stop over at some remote gas station (and fried chicken bar) run by the manic Captain Spaulding. Upon witnessing his freak-show amusement ride of urban legends they become fascinated with the myth of Doctor Satan, an insane local mass-murder/torturer/scientist. They make the very unwise decision of taking a slight detour in order to find him. <p>Soon enough they've picked up a wild hitchhiker called Baby who is more than a little slutty. Their car blows a tire and Baby has her brother Otis take them back to her house for repairs. Baby, Otis and the rest of the family seem kind of hospitable at first, despite their peculiar idiosyncrasies. <p>After that, well...complete and utter madness follows. Rob Zombie bombards us with so much horror, both macabre and morbid, that the film becomes a hypnotic thrill ride of guts, gore and grim. As the traumatized teens slowly lose their minds so do we. They barely have time to comprehend the mania and carnage and neither does the audience.<p>In the final 15 minutes our senses are so over-stimulated by the breath-taking madness, furious pace, escalating and mind-blowing horror that the shocking plot twist in the last few seconds comes as the biggest surprise and fright I've ever seen in a movie. <p>Many have criticized Zombie's Oliver Stone-type direction of this film and called his rapid switching of film-stocks jarring and distracting. I didn't mind it at all. It adds to the unstable atmosphere of the film and only proves Zombie took more time and effort to put this film together than most other directors do. <p>House of 1000 Corpses was made by Universal and Zombie wrapped production way back in Spring 2000. But the film was so gory and perverse that Universal simply refused to release it. MGM tried to help get it out there but ended up dumping it too. Finally Lion's Gate Films stepped in and gave the film a limited run (which is unfortunate since a mainstream Universal release would have guaranteed it reached a bigger audience). By this point the film had been cut, edited and censored. Which is a big shame. Even with these 15 minutes missing House of 1000 Corpses will still leave you feeling numb and slightly sick.<p>As Zombie is already working on a sequel (called The Devil's Rejects) he doesn't have the time to work on the uncut DVD but has promised he will do his best to get it out there. So until then get your fix with this DVD. <p>The film is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Special features include a commentary, a featurette, audition footage, rehearsal footage, cast and crew interviews, a still gallery, trailers and an isolated score.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>I was really taken off-guard by this energetic and original movie!<br /><br />When we "meet the meat," as Lyz Kingsley would say, the two guys actually have personalities and become characters with at least some depth.  As per usual, the girls get shortchanged in this category.  And then we meet the crazy Spaulding family.  Even though they're psychos, each of them gets at least some degree of personality and character as well.  As a result, "House of 1000 Corpses" is much more interesting than the run-of-the-mill horror film.  You may think you know where this movie is going once you're 30 minutes into it, but trust me, you don't, and I'm not going to ruin the ending for you.<br /><br />There are some funny, funny moments in the movie, which come directly out of the characters.  Refreshingly, the horror and the comedy don't get mixed.  Zombie pulls no punches in the horror department, and doesn't cheat by cutting away in the conventional places.  The Spauldings don't issue cheap one-liners after some mayhem.  The juxtaposition of short moments of horror between other scenes having different tones keeps you off balance and makes the horror more effective.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it is loaded with special features, and has the funniest menus you will ever see.  Each menu features a different character talking to (or berating) you, the viewer.  When you first insert the disc, Captain Spaulding will abuse you for minutes on end.  And it's funny!  You'll wait 10 minutes before you press play just to listen to him.<br /><br />This disc is worth at least a rent.  Now I can't wait to see "The Devil's Rejects"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>How much you like (or detest) "House of 1,000 Corpses" depends entirely on the perspective you take towards Rob Zombie's first film as a director.  As soon as you put in the DVD and ring the bell, you are confronted by the deranged clown figure of Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), who immediately gets in your face and threatens you if you do not make a selection.  After he goes through his rant you begin the movie and are deposited at Captain Spaulding's Gas Station and in a brief prologue it is made clear to us that this is a dangerous place.  Then we revisit the place, this time in the company of the next set of victims.  Bill Hudley (Rainn Wilson) and Jerry Goldsmith (Chris Hardwick) are traveling the back roads of America cataloguing tourist traps and have dragged along their girl friends Denise Willis (Erin Daniels) and Mary Knowles (Jennifer Jostyn).  Captain Spaulding has a "Murder Ride" and since this is exactly the sort of shtick the boys are interested in, they take it (Spaulding's lumbering assistant pushes the car through the fun house).<br /><br />One of the displays is about Dr. Satan, a mad scientist who was doing diabolical experiments on mental patients at an insane asylum until he was lynched by the locals.  The boys want to check out the tree where this happened and Captain Spaulding draws them a map.  On the way they pick up a hitchhiker named Baby (Sheri Moon) and get a flat tire, so there are so many nails in these kids coffins it is not even funny.  Of course at this point they begin to go on the film's real "Murder Ride."  That metaphor is important because the idea of a ride through what was once ironically called a "fun house" better fits "House of 1,000 Corpses" than does any attempt to think in terms of a coherent narrative structure.  Then again, your basic horror film is usually reducible to the idea that you put innocents in peril and then see if they can get out alive, which is what we have here.<br /><br />But if you think of it as a "Murder Ride" then it all makes much more sense, because just like going through a Fun House you have to look quick to see what there is to see and it all goes by so quickly, both the good and the bad.  More importantly, there is a lot to see here because Zombie has apparently taken the approach of throwing in everything he could possibly think of into this film including as many kitchen sinks as possible.  I would think that most people would watch this movie and find several things that will particularly creep them out, and for all the blood and gore Zombie does not linger on them too long, even when he is not presenting things in the mode of a music video more than as a theatrical film.  Captain Spaulding could have sustained an entire horror film, as could Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley), and the same can be said for Dr. Satan as the local serial killer legend.  However, early on it becomes clear everything in this film is going to be related (naming most of the characters for roles played by Groucho in Marx Bros. movies is a give away), which is why the final twist never had the ghost of a chance of working.  But then the title blatantly tells you want we were are going to see sooner or later in this movie.<br /><br />That fact that these events take place in the 1970s is significant because that, of course, is when the original version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' came out.  This is not only because Rob Zombie's sensibilities, for lack of a better word, are more in tune with the splatter flicks of that era than with the current generation of slick horror films following the lead of "Scream," but also because it is easier to believe, again for lack of a better word, that all this stuff could be happening somewhere in Texas back then.  Besides, I think in following the lead of Tobe Hooper's classic splatter flick that "House of 1,000 Corpses" improves on the weakest part of the original, which is when Leatherface's family sits down for dinner.  At that point they became more weird than frightening and the film is all down hill from there.  With this one meeting the entire family just means the fun, for lack of yet another word, is just beginning.<br /><br />Although I was tempted to round down on this one because the final scene constituted a lame exclamation mark to the film, I had to admit there were enough things in the film to creep my out so that I had to watch an episode of "Gilmore Girls" to cleanse my palate (Emily Gilmore is not as freaky as Captain Spaulding), which warrants at least a four star rating.  I gave up on having all the pieces make sense because clearly it was not that kind of a film, but it you demand logical coherence than this one will drive you crazy and your rating down.  But taken at face value as a cinematic fun house Zombie's film provides enough unsettling moments to justify going along for the "Murder Ride."</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>In my opinion Rob Zombie's directorial debut "HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES" is a homage paying masterpiece! 1 of my top 10 favorite horror movies of all time. its a beautiful tribute to the backwoods-slasher genre! Its Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets the Jim Rose circus!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>Hell on earth. It was high-time a horror movie of this callibre returned to the silver screen. This presentation incorperates elements in a Twin Peaks / Lost Highway, David Lynch vein, with intermittant flashes of images projected to be disturbing with a seeming antithesis of the current scene at hand, as if the pleasant life memories of the victim display within their mind as they die, to accentuate the progressive horror of their demise. The movie begins with carnival music resurrected by Dr. LaVey in his infamous Music Room scene from Speak of The Devil, accompanied by a mascot with a bald head and goatee bouncing about the place from time to time. <p>Suburban college kids travel with their girlfriends in 1977 to persue the urban legend of &quot;Dr. Satan&quot; {obvious LaVey influence} and various roadside attractions of the bizarre kind along the way, when they come upon a backwoods museum of the strange, hosted by a yokle attired in clown motif who also runs a funhouse called &quot;The Murder Ride&quot; featuring true crime displays, including profiles on Albert Fish the cannibal, among others, infamous in those parts. <p>So the foursome are out to to find out if any of the tales are true. Little did they know that a short while earlier, the place was almost robbed by a couple of incompetent brutish bafoons who are quickly outwitted by the clown and his elderly friend, both experienced freaks of the trade. Yet the likes of this was to pale in comparison to what they were yet to experience for real. After having taken the Murder Ride Tour, quite enjoyable as it was, with the host displaying an attire similar to KIng Diamond's , including face-paint and top hat, they persist to interview the keeper more about the legend; so he decides to direct them to an area where it was said to have originated from. On the way, they pick ujp a delightfully doll-like cowgirl {played by Zombie's girlfriend / fiancee' &quot;Sherry&quot;} who leads them into a trap in alliance with a shadowy phantom in the wilderness who shoots their tire out from under them. She offers to walk over to her brother's, who just so happens to own a tow-truck - then the true horror begins - one by one they are preyed upon by the resident homicidal hellbillies in various methods of mutilation, psychological torture until death is mercifully bestowed, in a very Texas Chainsaw Massacre style. <p>One scenario that I found to be of particular and amusing mention was when the remaining two of the suburban four are marched off to meet Dr. Satan {also seems to be an exagerrated composit of Dr. Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death}, dressed in rabbit foo-foo costumes, which establishes the differentiation between the predator and the prey, both the more and less evolved creatures' interaction. Another notable bit was the use of Aleister Crowley's poem narration in slow-motion while the foos were being lowered into the Black Earth, while inside of a coffin displaying a cross on the lid, which I found to be meaningful symbolism, as crucifixes and crosses are symbols of death, which were also drawn upon one character's face who performed a priest role in the mock funeral of those who have gone below. <p>In the end, House of 1,000 Corpses is a recommended film, and definitely stands out amongst all of the films currently released in this time frame, but what really makes it work is the remarkable style of the 70's, which did spawn the remarkable constant-classic Halloween. And there have been few outright, gut-wrenching serious horror movies which have been able to reach this level of entertainment, most of which are usually relegated immediately to video shelves because they prove to be too frightening for the masses, but are preserved for the serious Horror fantom. This is not a goofy parody passed as a &quot;horror&quot; flick, as the humor herein is truly black, as My companion and I were the only ones in the theatre laughing many times. I noticed sheeple leaving on a couple of occasions, seemingly just too disturbed to remain there being subjected to the nightmarish progression therein, which I would consider to be quite a compliment for a horror writer, director, or producer, who also happens to be a Satanist. <p>&quot;There is no good or evil. You just do what you gotta' do.&quot;<br />________________________________ <p>Extra bit of horror trivia: There was also a movie named &quot;House of Seven Corpses&quot; starring John Carradine and John Ireland which was released in 1973.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>For this being his first feature film Rob Zombie did a great job with this movie. It has a very late 60's early 70's feel to the movie. It makes you feel like you are watching a classic horror film from the very beginning. The reason I only gave it four stars is because of the ending. The whole Dr. Satan looking like something from a sci-fi movie, just took me out of the movie. I dont know for some reason it just didnt work for me. Overall though the movie is great, the look and feel of it was just refreshing. It isnt your normal horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**** 2003. Written and directed by Rob Zombie. Four young people lose their way and drive finally to the Firefly's, a family of vicious killers. Rob Zombie's first movie deserves our utmost attention as it reveals a true filmmaker that will confirm his skill four years later with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKL6ZC">Halloween (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. Highly recommended."</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>This is the first movie directed by Zombie and its good. It made me love horror movies once again because of the way he shot the film. The only problem I had is he tried to stuff so much into one film that it seemed like he was trying to hard. Still entertaining and not as polished as Devil's Rejects. The commentary is great as always because Zombie is honest about his films and gives good insight to what he was thinking.<br /><br />A major reason too get this dvd is the dvd menu. Its probably the best dvd menu ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>What do you consider a movie?  Horror fans have two different paths to take.  The Hammer horror films (numerous Dracula films with Christopher Lee) had a plot line that came to a conclusion, granting that sometimes the conclusion was transitory (like the hand of the monster reaching from the grave as the movie closed).  Other films, like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," don't have the same structured narrative construction.  The story is more a basic premise that is wrapped in horrific images that are designed to get a response.  Rob Zombie's film is more like the latter.<br /><br />"House of a 1000 Corpses" has a few basic storylines that connect but like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," there is no explanation of why.  The movie is designed to get a visceral response from the audience, and this movie does this in spades.  The photography can be chaotic, which reflects what is happening to the victims.  You will feel uneasy and disturbed.<br /><br />Traditional horror fans (like ghost stories, vampires, mummies, etc.) may find this a bit too graphic and bloody.  Fans of slasher films (with the psychopathic killer) will find that Rob Zombie does know horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>This could be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of this generation like TCM was in 74, this is great.  It's totally macbre, disturbing, gorey, scary, and humorous all at the same time, you name it and this baby got it, great job ROB!</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of Rob Zombie's music, but I've always admired the man's taste in horror films.  At a concert I saw, he showed scenes from Fulci films and such on his big screen, and I thought that was the coolest part of the concert.  Well, for his first film, he certainly tried to make it all he could.  If you're looking for another I Know What You Did Last Summer, you'd better hightail it outta the theater, coz Zombie has made the kind of film that he enjoys;  The kind of gruesome, schlocky film that us horror fanatics have grown up with and loved.  Because of this, many people just aren't gonna like this film, but that's okay, coz I'm sure Zombie himself knows that this movie is going to appeal only to a certain crowd of people:  People like him.....and myself.  There's no message, no moral play, no real scares for that matter.  The movie's just messed up and gruesome.  It's got a great cast.  Zombie didn't take the easy route and rely on young, fresh star power for the film's success.  He uses veteran, cult horror actors like Sid Haig, Karen Black and Bill Moseley(and if you don't know who they are, shame on you!).  The plot "borrows" very heavily from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films(Part 2 had Bill Moseley in pretty much the same role, only crazier!) and Spiderbaby(which had Sid Haig).  Zombie had to compromise to get this picture out by cutting out many scenes deemed too gruesome and disturbing for our fragile little minds.  This would have awarded him an NC-17 rating-THE TRUE MOVIE KILLER.  Well, I went to see the trimmed version to support Zombie and hopefully get him some cash back to release the version he wants on dvd.  Plus, I wanted a taste of what the film was gonna be like.  I'm not sure if it was as good as everything I've read in the last few years, but I really admire the ballsy move of making this, knowing he was going to have alot of people saying, "Boy, that was terrible!"  My only complaint is the little artsy touches he throws in, in the form of Oliver Stone-esque flashes of stock footage and grainy 16mm film.  It looks too much like he's trying to make a rock video or he's trying out all the cool little toys on his camera.  That's a small complaint though, and you get used to it pretty fast.  So, if you wanna experience a cinematic time warp that'll take make you feel like you're back at the drive-in or your local run down/small/yucky/sticky/bad acoustics theater(the kind you could actually smoke in, GOD FORBID), House Of 1000 Corpses is the best real horror flick to come along in a long time......and I doubt we'll see one like this again for quite some time.  So, get off your behind and see it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Fans have anxiously awaited Rob Zombie's directorial film debut for over 3 and a half years now, and while the finished product of House of 1000 Corpses isn't scary one bit, it's a very fun dirty little film that reminds us that horror films are supposed to be fun. In the late 70's, four kids go cross country and come across hearing the legend of Dr. Satan; an insane doctor who performed ghoulish experiments on his patients. Soon they pick up a hitchhiker (the oh so hot Sheri Moon; Rob Zombie's real life girlfriend), and from this point any veteran fan of horror films knows whats going to happen next. Soon we meet her family which includes Trilogy of Terror vixen Karen Black and the always excellent Bill Moseley. Next there are plenty of predictable scares followed by some nice gore and make up effects, and the film bares a stunning resemblance to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Zombie partly succeeded his intention; to make a truly scary horror film like the ones of old, and while House of 1000 Corpses isn't the most brilliant piece of horror film (or the most intelligent for that matter), it's a fun ride nonetheless, and Zombie shows some true directorial talent. The performances are great with Moseley stealing the entire show, his performance bearing striking similarities to his zany and hilarious deliverance of Chop Top in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and the cast also includes a foul mouthed clown faced Sid Haig and a southern drawl spewing Walt Goggins (Shane on TV's The Shield). All in all, House of 1000 Corpses is a gritty little movie that horror buffs will find some appreciation for. If you find you like this check out older horror films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 & 2, Last House on the Left, and the original Hellraiser.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>When I heard thrash/industrial metal musician Rob Zombie planned to lens a hardcore horror flick that would serve as a tribute to the grindhouse/exploitation films of the 1970s, I couldn't wait to see what it would look like. I soon lost interest, however, because after a few promising teasers about what the movie would look like I rarely heard anything about it again. Rumors started to swirl that Zombie had serious problems with major film studios, which apparently took umbrage at his endeavor. In some ways, this hesitancy on the part of big Hollywood studios is understandable: if Zombie really wanted to make a movie like the gorefests of the 1970s, Tinsel town big shots might worry about potential backlash from certain elements of the public. The taboo busting stuff that worked wonders in 1973 would cause horrific cries of outrage in the politically correct, whiny present day. Well, "The House of 1000 Corpses" turned out to be a rather tame production. It hardly invokes memories of "Cannibal Holocaust," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," or "Salo." Those films possessed the power to sicken and shock, and they still do today. Instead, "The House of 1000 Corpses" tries to hard to reify those honeyed memories of yesteryear without delivering much in the way of gore or great atmosphere.<p>I am not exactly sure how to describe this movie. It seems to be all over the place, dropping references to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and various slasher flicks from the old days. Four friends tooling across the country to gather information about bizarre, out of the way highway tourist attractions stumble upon a stand run by a profanity spewing tough guy clown named Captain Spaulding. We know Spaulding is nasty because he kills two robbers an hour or so before our heroes arrive on the scene. The clown convinces these four bubbleheads to take a tour of his museum of serial killers, and then tells the story about a local baddie named Dr. Satan who did a lot of decidedly unfriendly things to the inmates at a local insane asylum before his sudden demise at the hands of miffed locals. Predictably, one of the kids on the tour loves serial killers and convinces Spaulding to write down directions to the site where Doc Satan met his untimely end. Within minutes of leaving the roadside stand, the kids pick up a sexy blonde gal named Baby. And right after that the car suffers a flat tire. Are we there yet?<p>Almost. Baby offers to take the kids to her house where a brother (or some sort of relation) will fix the car. Of course, Baby's home contains various fruitcakes: there's Mother Firefly, played with hilarious zeal by 70's star Karen Black, and Grampa Hugo, a rambling basket case who eats with his mouth open when he isn't wowing the crowds with his stage act. Throw in Tiny, a mountainous goon with a face that looks like a lawnmower ran over it and Otis, a guy who looks like the twin of that guy the kids picked up at the beginning of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." There are probably some family members I left out, but you get the idea. This clan should have chlorinated the gene pool generations ago. The house these characters live in is interesting, decked out in all types of junk, dolls, and garbage. The four travelers, of which two are women, slowly come to realize that something is seriously wrong with their newfound surroundings. They are correct in that assumption.<p>That is really about it as far as plot goes. As the movie progresses, this family turns downright mean to their guests. Some of the kids die in gruesome ways, with one turned into an oddity called "fish boy." One girl manages to survive the ordeal after a lengthy underground encounter with zombies and Dr. Satan himself. There is enough screaming, running around, and generally wackiness to hold a modicum of interest, but the whole exercise tires rather quickly. There just isn't anything here we haven't seen before in other, better films. Even the twist ending has been done to death in nearly every slasher film made since who knows when. Of course, that may be what Zombie is trying to accomplish: he wants to rehash these plot devices in order to pay respect to the horror genre. <p>The best thing about Zombie's film is the campy performance from Karen Black. Even with pounds of makeup and outlandish clothing covering her from head to toe, Black is great. It is nice to see her return to a genre in which she once had a firm stake. I also loved Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding. He cracked me up nearly every time he appeared on screen, and he has some of the best dialogue in the whole film. Sheri Moon does a good job as the giggly Baby, with a voice that sounds like Mariah Carey stuffed in a bear trap. Overall, my problems with the film don't arise from the performances, but from the uneven feel of the film and a lack of unsettling gore sequences.<p>The dearth of gore may not be Zombie's fault. The 88 minute runtime makes me highly suspicious that I watched a cut version. At least the DVD comes with plenty of extras and a few easter eggs. The best extra is a clip of three of the characters in the film doing knock-knock jokes with the same punch line. That Tiny does get busy, doesn't he? If these extras don't do the trick for you, there is a scene-by-scene commentary with Rob Zombie to hold you over. "The House of 1000 Corpses" isn't great by any stretch of the imagination, but it does contain enough interesting threads to make me wonder what Zombie could accomplish in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>Pretty much unwatchable.  Loud, silly, and filmed in that amateurish music video style that is becoming so utterly common that it should have a genre of it's own, HOUSE OF 1K CORPSES was made by rocker ROB ZOMBIE obviously for ROB ZOMBIE.  All shlock, no shock and certainly not scary, skip this hoaky hommage to 70's horror movies because it just doesn't work.  Watch the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE again and revell in a more accurate view of horror in the 70's.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie has made one hell of a disturbing and frightening horror movie that is unforgettable and unsettling.  Forget those "fun" horror films made for teens, this is the real deal.  As soon as you finish "House of 1000 Corpses," you are literally shaking in absolute shock.  Not because it's that scary, but because it's that unrelenting and unforgiving.<p>Having a really big "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" influence in it, the film is about a young group of people who take a wrong turn and end up in a house filled with maniacs, cannibals, and murdering madmen who love to maim and torture.  What led the group to the house was a desire to find out more about the legend of Dr. Satan.  Now, they'll wish that they had never left home and have never heard the name.  "House of 1000 Corpses" takes you into Hell and back.<p>I have to admit, I had a real hard time watching it.  The movie is really brutal and uneasy to watch.  However, there's something about it that keeps you watching no matter how much you want to shut it off.  Zombie has made a successful horror movie that terrifies and shocks.  It has an undeniable feel and tone to it all that Zombie has perfected.<p>It is what it is.  It's not out to the be the Great American movie.  This movie is a horror/slasher movie and nothing more.  People who are looking for more will be disappointed, without a doubt.  Be warned, this isn't a film for the weak and sensitive.  This is not "Scream," or any other "cute" teen horror flick.  This movie is raw, dark, evil and disturbing.  That is why it is a success in my eyes.  Rob Zombie did a great job of orchestrating all of this.  I can see him doing more with this genera.  I am sure this won't be the last horror film we see from him.<p>The DVD has some cool extras.  The picture and sound quality is great.  Really gives you the sense that you are there and not just only watching it.  The menu is one of the funniest ones I have ever seen on a DVD.  Be sure to watch Captain Spaulding's greeting.  Extras included are commentary, audition footage, interviews, trailers, a featurette and more.  A lot of hard work went into the DVD, that is for sure.<p>My overall feeling about this movie is that I liked it.  It's brutal and hard to watch, but that's what Rob Zombie was going for.  Just be sure to watch it for what it is and don't try to read too much into it.  "House of 1000 Corpses" is a terrifying and uneasy ride into Hell that you won't soon forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I love robs music, and I liked this movie, but did not love it.<br />First, Mr. Zombie claims he will revolutionize the genre, and talks how clich&eacute; horror movies have become. I thought this was the most clich&eacute; movie I ever seen. examples: the car not starting, the girl tripping and falling when the bad guy chases her.<br />  This is also the most [copy cat] movie I have ever seen: it was the Texas chainsaw massacre to a tee! some compare it to this movie, but I say its almost exact. You have a morbid red-neck family, that is all working together to kill people, Chandelier made of bone, main character wares a dead skin mask, he even looks like the guy from Texas chainsaw massacre 2 (the one with the light hair and a cowboy hat)<br />  The acting is very corny, and cheesy, bad acting! plus some of the worst picture flashing, grainy editing ever!<br />  And finally, the ending just about ruins this movie<br />I would have given this higher rating if it wasn't for the lack of originality...good blood scenes though!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>So I start watching this and I am really bored for the first half of the movie.  Then it actually starts picking up my interest.  Ok, I had a problem with that annoying and grating on the nerves guy that sold chicken and had the freak show ride.  The ride was really cool though when they finally got to it.  When the kids leave his place and go in search of Dr. Satan and pick up the hichhiker, it picks up a lot.  It seemed like it took forever, but it starts getting better.  This movie was awesomelly filmed at the end too.  The camera angles on faces were some of the finest I've ever seen and totally saved the movie.  Too bad more than half of the beginning was so dull. On the extras on Sherri Moon's comments on stabbing and stuff, I really appreciated what she said.  Her performance was so creepy and real I was beginning to wonder...  Its not real its not real its not real...</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Best horror film I have seen in years.  Can't wait for the sequel.  I bought the dvd early at a store in New York.  It rocks.  All of the extra features are right on the money particularly the menus.  Sheri Moon, Sid Haig and Karen Black give some tremendously fun performances in this movie.  See it for their acting alone.  One day the scene w/ Moon lip synching &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot; will be considered a classic.  Not for all tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>house is a standard horror movie. These movies are formulaic, and Rob Zombie movie follows the formula. It's like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the old one), just with more gore. It's not scary or frightening, just disturbing. Zombie's direction and angles are the best part of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Now while this film is cheesy and is a little bit of a cliche. I really did like it. I thought it rocked, OK. I really dig on Rob Zombies music, so I figured I would like his movie and I was right. It was funny and gory. Rob Zombie proved that not only can he sing, but he can write and direct a decent horror film. All of the cast is great, especially Zombies wife Sheri Moon. She is HOT!!!!!!!!!! She alone could make the film worth watching. The movie is about 4 teenagers traveling across the country who run into a family of sadistic killers which include<br /><br />Baby (Moon), Otis (Bill Moseley of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"), Mother Firefly (Karen Black), and Grandpa (the late Dennis Fimple). Eventually (and this is now a classic horror film cliche) everyone is killed off one by one. This is where Zombies imagination kicks in. If it is a horrible, dire way to die. Then it most likely happens in this film. Sid Haig adds some comic relief as Captain Spaulding. Spaulding runs Captains Spauldings Museum of Monsters & Mayhem...Fried Chicken & Gasoline. The main menu is hilarious. Just watch that before u watch the movei. I was laughing really hard. Look for the sequel "The Devils Rejects" later this year. B.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I consider myself a huge horror fan and I think "House of 1000 Corpses" is probably one of the worst horror movies, ever.<br /><br />In "House of 1000 Corpses", Jerry, Bill, Mary, and Denise take a trip to the American roads in order to collect material for a book about offbeat roadside attractions. At some point, Bill decides to stop at a gas station ran by an extremely weird man in a clown suit named Captain Spaulding. The place is very bizarre and tacky, but since Jerry and Bill live for that kind of rarities...they love the place!. Captain Spaulding nicely invites the two guys to take a look at the "murder ride". After finally managing to persuade the girls, the four friends take a look at the weird attraction. That's how they become aware of the local legend of Doctor Satan. A weird creature who devoted his entire life to experiment with people and turn them into monsters. Apparenly, Dr Satan was hung from a tree by a bunch angry villagers. That tree is not far away from the "murder ride". Obviously, Bill and Jerry insist Captain Spaulding on letting them know the way to that tree and he finally accedes. In the middle of the road, they pick up weird hitchhiker, a blonde girl named "Baby". The car breaks down all of a sudden, but Baby nicely offers some help and invites them to stay at her place while her brother fixes the car. Unfortunately, Baby and her family are a bunch of sadistic maniac who enjoy celebrating Halloween in a grotesque way.<br /><br />"House of 1000 Corpses" is nothing but a "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" rip-off.  The film is very disturbing as some scenes and images were defiantely very creepy. Its also very gory but that doesn't mean its scary. It also sometimes goes over the top on the gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Wednesday, April 14, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Nice presentation but lacked dread factor.  I had recently picked up Rob Zombie's greatest hits the other day after becoming aware of him with the Living Dead Girl era.  When I saw his name attached to this film I was intrigued to see how he'd handle a 70's gore-fest homage after seeing a bunch of his videos on the greatest hits cd/dvd.  While never causing any feelings of fear or dread that accompanied my initial viewings of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in the day, this film was pretty artsy schlock.  That is to say it was Corman level in its camp but executed with higher production values.  Heh.  It never aspires beyond its station and has fun w/ its cartoony gore.  Two couples are attacked and locked up in a house of horrors with a freaker family.  Yes, it's an overused contrived plot at this point in horror cinema history, but it was an amusing hour and half.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>..but with a Rob Zombie twist. Take &quot;Texas chainsaw massacre&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &amp; &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; put them in a blender and blend well. The movie is hypnotic and twisted, funny, spooky, psychotic, stylish, inventive, and over all insane. A group of nerdy teens (who appear to be near 30 in real life) stop off at a wacky gas station / haunted novelty store. Big mistake! After the psychotic clown who runs the place gives them a map, they pick up a strange female hitchhiker. They take her home and meet her estranged family. If their nightmare hasn't begun, it's about to. From here on out they are abused, tortured and much more. &quot;HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES&quot; is what you might expect from goth rocker Rob Zombie. I mean that in a good way, you get lots of humor in between the scares and thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Some folks seem to be getting their knickers in a twist.  Either this flick was a cheap imitation of the slasher films of the Seventies, or it substituted blood and gore for a plot, or it wasn't &quot;cool&quot; enough with its gore (whatever that means), yada yada yada.  <p>Horse feathers.  The horror genre really isn't my cup of tea (make that cherry Kool-Aid), but I could darn sure tell that Rob Zombie (bet that's his real name) decided his HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES was going to do everything but take its grimy, gory self seriously.  This movie slices and dices while rehashing and recycling the same old tired plot about four kids in the wrong place at the wrong time, yet the extra zaniness and insanity keeps the story from growing as stale as the loaf of bread on my kitchen counter.  Zombie, even though he's paying bloody homage to the classic slashers of the past, travels down several unique roads that inherently enhance the film's entertainment value and cult status.  Again, all the macabre, loony enhancements aren't my cup of Kool-Aid, but it's obvious the cast and crew were having fun, and it shows via each frame.<p>The confrontation of good vs. evil drives the motor of each horror story, and that's what is lacking in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.  Pure evil dominates, from start to finish, ultimately creating a sense of disinterest on the part of the viewer.  Even Freddy Kruger would get kicked around every once in awhile, but not these ghouls.  On the other hand, Karen Black can kick me all she wants to.  Even though the years are adding up on old Karen, she still brings out the &quot;zombie&quot; in me.  In fact, I'm feeling kind of petrified right now.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I half excected to dislike this film, because I was a bit skeptical about Rob Zombie as a director. But after watching it, I actually liked it. The film is an extreme horrorfest, filled with excessive gore and disturbing settings. And when I mean excessive, I mean it conveys a no-holds-barred attitude. It's gory entertainment for those who can actually take it. Plus, it's severely dark and hellish, so it's not for those who are very squeamish. Personally, I thought that this film was good. Not excellent, but good enough to keep me interested. Although it may not achieve classic status like The Exorcist or Nightmare on Elm Street, I still like it for its overall gore and psychotic atmosphere.<br /><br />In short, Rob Zombie has given us an entertaining horror film that would most certainly please a large percentage of horror fans; it did for me. I have never seen both versions of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I do believe this might be even better than Chainsaw (but my opinion will probably change if I ever see any of them). Next up: The Devil's Rejects!</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have owned this movie for the past 2 years, but I think today I actually watched it all the way through! I think Zombie did a really good job. I love how he puts incredible detail into, like the scary props at Captain Spaulding's and all the HALLOWEEN decorations were awesome. Four college students named Bill, Jerry, Mary, and Denise are traveling throughout America looking at different road-side attractions, until they come to Captain Spaulding's who tells them about Dr. Satan. They become interested and run into the sadistic Firefly family, who act friendly at first, but turn to psychopaths. On HALLOWEEN, they torture them by using a razor on Bill's face, cut through Jerry's scalp, dress Denise up like a little girl, Mary's dad gets shot and his face torn off, etc. (It would be sad if this happened in real life.) Later, Denise must survive Dr. Satan's underground chamber. The climax was a little silly, but it's horror film. If you love HALLOWEEN, Zombie's movies and his style, you'll love HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is one of the few movies I've watched lately that gave me the creeps. This is a horror film with plenty of wacked out and disturbing characters! The film starts out with the strangers on a deserted road trick, but it soon turns into something resembling the 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre, before going into an even more demented satanic zombie flick!<br /><br />The film did hold my interest for the most part...maybe the sexy little wacko Baby was responsible for that?! I've seen better, but I've seen so much worse and Zombie and the rest of the cast sure do pay homage to the old time horror films. You can find this one pretty cheap and if you like a little twisted gory horror,this might be for you!</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>At the beginning of this movie, the main characters visit a tour of horror; a carnival ride where the spooks hop out to give viewers a quick scare before disappearing again.  I can't think of a better opening and metaphor to this movie.  House of 1000 Corpses is just like the old carnival rides.  Once you get past the immediate shock response, there's not much left.  It's a very hollow scare.<br /><br />On one hand, Rob Zombie has succeeded in his goal.  He opens the movie with a creature feature presentation.  And there is the parallel to the horror movies of the 70s, particularly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is very evident in this movie.  In this aspect, the movie calls to mind the shocking images of TCM and the unstoppable cruelty involved.  However, while it does evoke these images, it fails to hold interest.  Where TCM is now a classic of horror movies not only because of the violence but the characters, 1000 Corpses will fall flat.  It has an insane cast, no question.  But they are insane for insanity's sake.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching torture, and unquestionable acts of violence perpetrated on people in an almost voyeuristic sort of way and with no real reason why, then this is your movie.  Some reviewers have commented that this movie is great because it isn't a PG-13 crapfest that Hollywood has been dishing out.  While this is true, there are plenty of movies that are better that don't perscribe to this crappiness.  In fact, check out the French film Haute Tension (aka Switchblade Romance) if you want to see a horror movie that has the violence and gore AND a decent story behind it.<br /><br />I just can't really get into this movie.  Towards the end, I was tired of the mindless violence and torture.  And just when I thought it was over, it kept going.  It's like a train wreck that keeps piling up.  Once you get past the shocks, there's not much meat on this corpse's bones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>House of 1000 Corpses (Rob Zombie, 2003)<br /><br />Yes, it's derivative. That was the point.<br /><br />House of 1000 Corpses is a tribute to bad seventies horror films (and a few good ones). This should be obvious by, well, just about everything about it, but still, some folks didn't get it. I don't understand why. It couldn't have been the sets, which echoed everything from early Argento films to Shriek of the Mutilated. It couldn't have been the cast, most of the bad guys from which were in those bad horror films. It couldn't have been the editing (two words: Mario Bava). It couldn't have been the overly garish use of light, a holdover of black-and-white B-movie directors who felt the need to oversaturate everything they touched. It couldn't have been the Saturday night chiller theatre frame the movie has (featuring a cameo from director Rob Zombie). Everything about this movie pointed directly back to almost every horror film made during the seventies. Why were these people expecting an original movie?<br /><br />If you look at it as a bad seventies horror film, it's great mindless fun. In case you missed every horror film made between Last House on the Left and Final Exam, the story involves four teens who make a bad decision to go out looking for a tree where the evil, insane Dr. Satan was hanged many years ago, and suffer a flat (helped along by one of the bad guys, in a scene straight out of Motel Hell), causing them to go to the house of the hitchhiker they picked up (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, though this one's much better looking), whose brother, conveniently, owns a tow truck (Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation). Then, well, things start getting... odd.<br /><br />It's a fun little rollercoaster ride into nostalgia, and worth watching if you have a fondness for movies like The Dead Hate the Living, Galaxy of Terror, Trilogy of Terror, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, or the eighties remake of The Blob (alumni of which all make appearances here). There's even a cameo for Michael J. Pollard, of Fulci's Four of the Apocalypse fame.<br /><br />Don't expect a great movie, and you'll have a good time. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I waited so long to see this drivel. It's not worth it. Mediocre at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>It's got a great begining. It has so much promise. The clown, the little jokes, it's all terrific at first. But about two thirds of the way into the film you realize it's not going anywhere with that great start. And then in the last five minuites (and it takes forever to get to those last minuites and I'm not spoiling anything here, trust me) - anyways, in the last five minuites it almost redeems itself but it's just gone too far off track to actually make it worth it. <p>I watched this with some friends during a horror-movie-watching fest, and at that two thirds mark we started making fun of it. Up till then we'd been riveted, glued to the movie. After that, we just gave up and mocked it. <p>With about, oh, half an hour or forty-five minuites cut out of it it might be worth it. There are some great scenes, some great ideas. And you should probably watch it at least once, so you can say you did, and out of curiosity. Plus, there really are some great scenes. But it's so definitely not worth a second watch.<p>If it were a bit tighter, leaner, edited better, if it didn't go so far over the top on a little acid-trip diversion, then it would be such a good film. I know the acid-trip bit was intentional, but it took too long. It's like a dramatic silent pause that goes too long: everyone will be quiet, and everyone will hold their breath for only so long: then the drama goes out of it and you start laughing at what might otherwise have been something tense. Maybe that was intentional, I dunno.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>The other night Sid started backwards by watching Devil's Rejects before it's predecessor House of 1000 Corpses. Thanks yet again to our on-demand station that made this one came available while all the characters were still fresh on the mind. Have to say despite a lot of the reviews this was one very creepy flick that takes place with a very uncomfortable situation. That situation would be getting stranded in some hick town to be welcomed in by a family that turns out to be serial killers also housing the local legend known as Dr. Satan. Yeah it was absolutely as crazy as it sounds, and Sid loved it.<br /><br />The movie starts out with 2 couples who are on the road looking to write a book about the countries strange roadside attractions. The first stop they hit is Captain Spauldings fried chicken and gasoline, that also has a funhouse type tour. While there they learn the legend of Dr. Satan and decide to take off in hopes of finding the tree he hung from. Once there car breaks down after piking up a hitchhiker named Daisy (Rob Zombies tasty wife) all the fun begins. We are introduced to the ultra-physcotic Firefly family that couple well with Leatherface's relatives. In addition they house Dr. Satan who performs experiments on people they catch while they're still alive. Some actual creepy moments, which is so rare in film.<br /><br />So very surprisingly House of 1000 Corpses was one of the better horror films Sid has seen in sometime. The way it was shot was very dark with hints black comedy and a lot of tripped out imagery. It almost seemed like certain scenes were made for those viewers kicking back stoned out of their minds. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Now obviously it is nearly impossible to be scared by a film, but this one had a lot of creepy elements especially toward the end. When they finally found the Dr, who looked like the crypt-keeper with an oxygen mask on, and his butler the giant axe maniac the scenes got very tense. Just the thought of coming across that would freak anyone out. So yes we really enjoyed and would have years back thanks to all the scares and Sheri Zombie nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I liked it. Why do so many people unlike this film? I can see why. It doesn't seem like true horror. Here's what goes on:<br /><br />A few pals are driving in the back roads of America when they stop by Capt. Spaulding's Museum of Horrors/gas station/food bar, they admit that they're lost. So, before they leave, Capt. Spaulding gives them a ride on his Murder Ride {which is quite interesting} and tells them of some things about murderers and stuff. After that he is convinced in drawing them a map. When they pick up a hitchhiker on the way, someone blows out the tires on their car and they are stranded at the hitchhiker's house where the fun begins. Will they get to leave? Who else lives there? And what do THEY have planned??

I love how the DVD has him introducing the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>House of 1000 Corpses is a horror film that takes the word overkill to the literal meaning.  Two college couples are on their way home to the father of one the girls when they find out about a local mass murder of innocent patients in a mental hospital decades ago.  Their curiosity wants to take them to the tree where the killer, Dr. Satan, was hanged, but instead their car breaks down.  Soon they find themselves among insane people who practice witchcraft, cannibalism, and murder for pleasure.  As a cinematic experience this film offers some interesting shots, cinematography, and editing, but this too seems to be driven to overkill and makes the story a feast in repetitious carnage.  Thus, the story seems lost, but the violence keeps the audience's attention due to its graphic and abnormally painful nature.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Beeing a Rob Zombie fan of his music. I was really looking forward to seeing this film. But after veiwing it I dont think i will see any future Rob Zombie films if there going to be this bad!<p>I was expecting to hear alot of Rob's music in the soundtrack, but was disapointed by only about 3 or 4 maybe 5 i heard during the film.<p>By now youve read other reviews of what this movie is about. And most people havent shared my opionion about this film, but i must say it was horrible. The acting is terrible and the plot may not be predicatable, but it still was stupid and when it came to about the 1 hour 20 minute mark of the film, it just did not want to end! It just kept taking all these new twist and turns and was getting quite boring and completly unbeleivable and I was begging for the movie to finally finsih. it sure went for way to long!<p>The most annoying thing in it would have to be the girls laugh. If you have heard the laugh sound on the &quot;Sinister Urge&quot; or &quot;Soundtrack to this movie&quot; song &quot;house of 1000 corpses&quot; then by the end of this film you will be so sick of hearing that laugh you will want to smack her in themouth and tell her to shut up! The movie isnt even really titles well, seeing as how the house does not contain 1000 corpses (not thats seen anyway) and comes later in an underground cave type of thing there for it was named pretty badly! In my opinion it should have been called &quot;movie of 1000 annoying bad laughs and screams&quot; cheesy plots and jokes, and nothing speichel about this film to make it any diffrent from any other lame horror flick. Wanna see a great horror movie? then dont bother with this one, only Rob Zombie's die hard fans will love this flick!<p>It apparently took 2 years to finally get a release. but dont expect that to be because of some kind of scene that the FDA or whoever they are didnt want you to see... its probably because they didnt want to release such a bad movie with such a bad plot, and bad acting....and that annoying girls laugh :S there not one thing scary about this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>I usually enjoy horror movies.  The only thing horrific about this movie was that I actually sat through this cinematic piece of crap.  This movie was so bad, there are not enough words to describe how bad this film was. This movie did nothing but irritate me.<br /><br />Two couples are on a road trip and make a stop for gas.  They go into this strange store that has all kinds of weird things, and they take a tour of this house of horrors and get a lesson on some of the notorious murderers including the local legend of Dr. Satan.  The tour was silly because the "ride" had to be pushed by some doofus.  As they leave their car develops a flat tire (someone shoots at their tire on purpose), and they end up at the house of a strange, strange family who just love Halloween.  Someone from this strange family fixes he car, and the couples leave, well they try to.  Before they can leave, they are attacked, and held hostage.  You would think the movie action would pick up, instead you may find yourself dozing off while watching this snoozer.  I had no interest in the victims or the villains in this movie.  There was nothing to hold my interest, and I could not wait for this movie to end.  Even the gory scenes where boring.  This movie is one big yawn fest.  The acting is terrible, horrible cinematography, and terrible directing.  There was this one line in the movie "You don't have to go to hell, this is hell, this is hell", well watching this movie is pure hell!  The family was sick in the head, not scary.  I need for a horror movie to scare me, make me squirm, jump a little, want to cover my eyes and peek through my fingers, gross me out a little.  This movie made me want to curl up and fall asleep.  I did nothing but yawn, and wonder is this horrible movie over yet.<br /><br />The only highlight of this movie for me was when I recognized Walton Goggins (from the FX series The Shield) as Deputy Steve Naish.  Now when that is the only thing that will excite me in a film, it has to be bad.  If you are Rob Zombie fan, then you will probably like this movie, but if you are a die hard horror person like I am, you will not like this movie.  So do yourself a favor, don't rent it!!!!  Don't buy it.  If you buy this movie and don't like it you will only want to fling this movie out of your window.  The R Rating for this garbage of a movie should stand for Revolting.<br /><br />Rent 28 Days Later.  At least that movie will keep your interest.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie, horror fanatic and rock and roll icon, has crafted a wacky tribute to all things weird and wonderful. HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is his attempt at bringing his "every day should be halloween" vision to the screen. Like an unholy mixture of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Spider Baby, Natural Born Killers, and VH1's Surviving Nugent; H-O-1K-C is by no means a classic, but does have it's moments. I loved the beginning at Captain Spaulding's gas station / fried chicken stand / Murder and Madness Museum. Sid Haig (Spider Baby) made an excellent host of the ghoulish festivities. The Murder Ride was well done, like an animatronic tour of hell. We learn about the notorious Dr. Satan, who is ufortunately not used enough in the story. I'd watch a whole movie about his exploits! We meet the four dopey kids who will go on to the actual house itself, a spook-house loaded with twisted hillbillies and their victims (why is it always the rural folk??). This long section is fairly entertaining, yet somehow dull. Even while cheerleaders were being slaughtered, I found myself checking my watch! Lots of flash - very little fear. Even Karen Black (Trilogy Of Terror, Burnt Offerings, It's Alive 3) had a hard time spicing things up! Baby (Sherri Moon) wasn't bad, but was overused, while Tiny and the others just sort of lumbered about like extras. The final chapter in the underground catacombs is great and shows what the rest of the movie could have been. Sadly, it goes by too fast! I'm looking forward to Zombie's next feature, as few seem to have the appreciation for monsters (both human and inhuman) that he has. Hopefully, his next venture will be better...</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Halloween (the original) has recently been named the scariest horror movie. The first (and last) time I watched that movie, I was so bored! This movie is the exact same. Labelled a horror movie, it's overly long, and apart from a few gory scenes, didn't do anything for me. I am one of those people who needs a movie which will make me jump out of my skin, hiding behind a cushion/couch/guy, and makes me want to stop watching. Definitely wanted to stop watching during this! Just when you think the film is over, another scene appears. And another. And another. And you're exhausted by the time it finally finishes, just because you've been waiting for it to finish for so long!<p>There was a bit of a heated discussion after it finished, involving why horror movies always have teenagers as their main cast (think of something different, PLEASE), similarities between this, and many other movies of the same genre (Blair Witch Project, the Friday 13th movies etc). What I did accept as a valid point during the 'discussion', was that it showed you who the killers was practically straight away, whereas many other films (the Scream trilogy, and Urban Legend come to mind) are films that you know the killer is likely to be one of the cast (obviously), but you have to work it out.<p>Particularly regarding the camera work, this movie is along the same lines as Blair Witch Project (another movie that didn't really hit me until the last 5-10 minutes). During the credits you see some very strange cutaway scenes that don't seem to fit into the movie, and are filmed on a very shaky, gritty, 16mm hand held camera. These were filmed in Rob Zombie's (NOT his real name obviously) basement after filming wrapped. He would invite cast members over to his house on the weekends and shoot the footage himself with a 16mm hand-held camera. With the exception of the shot of a setting sun, he created the opening credits the same way.<p>I found myself very bored during this movie, and frequently eyed up the clock, finding it was only a couple of minutes since I last looked. This is definitely not a movie I would watch again, I'd like to keep precious hours of my life thank you very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this is directed by rob zombie.youd think with that really cool scene he did in beavus and butthead that this one would have turned out better.its long and drawn out in spots.its obviously not for the children.its also quite low budget.any real hardcore rob zombie fan will love it all the same.it gets gross a few times.its just a regular old horror film with vague wierd people and stupid teens getting themselves chadsed down and hacked up.it got a nc-17 rating so i was very exited to see it,but with that kind of build up,i was disapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>I waited 2 and ahalf years of this piece of garbage.It was nothing what I thought it would be.When the DVD comes out I might try to see it again,if there's a unrated version on the disk.Not scary and not even as gory as I hoped it would be.Don't waste your time and your money.But I still think Rob Zombie rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>After 2 and ahalf years of waiting and 2 stuidos later,we're finally gonna be able to see this werid-looking horror film.I've wanted to see this film since Oct 2000,when I saw the first trailer.This film is gonna rock!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>More shocking than the first "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "The Exorcist" or even "Basket Case", and probably more extreme than the "Hellraiser" series, "The House Of 1,000 Corpses" is one of the most brutal, merciless and graphic horrors ever filmed, and certainly among the best of its extreme kind ever made.  Turns horror conventions upside down in the following way - in most horror movies, the antagonist, whether a tragic monster or a purely evil psychopath or whatever, has to have something impressive about him or her or it, some sense of awe or special-ness to make it work, and often something likable.  The inhabitants of the House, however, provide the exception to the rule.  Some of them are visually frightening, yes, but not so much in an 'impressive' way.  This is the most vile, unlikable, nastiest, most despicable band of psychos ever to terrorize the screen (even exceeding the filthbags in "Last House On The Left"(!) by virtue of the one villain in that movie who had some shred of decency and remorse within himself), and while a movie like "Candyman" works by giving the viewer a wreaker of evil who carries considerable mitigating factors and enough of a sense of tragedy to generate empathy, and "A Nightmare On Elm Street" works by putting out there a purely evil entity but one who's darkly engaging and fun to love to hate, "The House Of 1000 Corpses"'s villains are just so blood-boilingly detestable, that This is what makes this particular movie so completely riveting.  I have never rooted so hard for the hideous demise of the bad guys so much in all the years I've watched movies.  And it's utterly brilliant.<br /><br />  Set in the late 70s with a couple of apparantly intoxicated fraternity-type guys driving around and whooping it up, thinking it's a cool way to spend the evening cruising around looking for evidence of local rural legend Dr. Satan, with their exasperated and smarter girlfriends tagging along for the company and to keep their beaus from getting into too much trouble.  After picking up a female hitchhiker, it's all downhill and straight to hell for the unlucky foursome.  And yet it's not quite as straight forward as it sounds.  There'a few characters where you may not necessarily know if they're going to be part of the evil or not, there's occasional black humor amonst the mayhem, and there are shocks that aren't solely associated with just the extreme nature of the violence but are truly unexpected plot twists.  There are movies that start out frightening from the first frame, this goes it one better by starting Before the movie's opening frame with the interactive menu, featuring Captain Spaulding (played with genius by Sid Haig) talking to the viewer in a friendly manner as if he can see you right there in your front room, an amusing and almost campy way to start off the DVD that, if you let it run for a while before pressing play, starts to become very creepy and uncomfortable.<br /><br />  This is the first movie directed by industrial shock-metal master Rob Zombie (who provides plentiful music for the show, along with a lot of peppy, happy non-metal whose prescence during such brutal scenes is so inappropriate that it's unnervingly masterful).  Zombie helms the film with perhaps-unexpected skill and tremendous style and originality.  I hope to see a slew more horror movies over the years by this man (although I hope he doesn't abandon his music either), but I have to say he shows enough innovation and technical know-how that he's going to be able to direct other genres of movies too if he chooses to; anyone who shows this much talent on their debut can make any kind of film they please.  A straight drama or non-dark romantic comedy occasionally inserted in between ultra-horrors?  I don't see why not.  How about it, Mr. Zombie - show the critics that horror specialists are every bit the equal of any other genre's masters.<br /><br />  One of the best horror movies of 2003 (possibly horror's greatest year ever).  Not recommended for non-diehards of horor though.  If you're just getting into the field, you might want to try some of the many other horror movies that are just as great and often just as scary, but not as gorily graphic, like the "Halloween" series or "The Blair Witch Project", before something this demented, and then see "House Of 1000 Corpses" after a while.<br /><br />  On a closing note, what's perhaps even scarier is that Zombie apparantly plans to make the upcoming sequel, "The Devil's Rejects" even darker and more gruesome, and its villains even More despicable.  He's set himself a hard task, but to think that he just might be up to it....Yikes!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Directed by Rob Zombie (of course, not real name of Robert Cummings), 'House of 1000 Corpses" became an instant cult, like 'Rocky Horror Show.'  See this one as such ... kind of a film that is full of campy, very campy fun.<br /><br />The plot is, as you know, similar to 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre.'  The four hapless (and stupid, you say) students driving a car at a deserted courtryside find themselves trapped in the wrong place, like, the house where killers dwell.  This is no secret from the beginning.<br /><br />Interesting part is its cast: you see Sid Haig with painted face like clown, who organizes a 'murder ride' at his own house, but that's just a beginning.  You see Bill Morsley (yes, that's him in 'Texas Chainsaw 2'!), Irwin Keyes, Michael J Pollard, and oh! no! that's Karen Black too!  Hey, you might not remember this, but she is an Oscar nominee!  Plus, many, many dead bodies, some of them making us very sick.<br /><br />Still, the film is not scary.  That doesn't mean it has no merit for us to watch.  But the fact that it has borrowed the central plot from 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre' is so obviously felt, and the film is shot with too much MTV-style visuals, and I found the film dazzling (and intriguing) at first, then boring, especially the latter half.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I offend you, but ... is it worth our wait?  I know some people loved the film, making this film a surprise hit.  I know Rob Zombie loves horror films, and made a lot of references to the genre (and the title is a 1974 film 'The House of Seven Corpses.'  Sid Haig and other actors are funny to see ... sort of, and as far as we see its opening, Rob has a talent to make a good film.  But I need something more, something besides what makes this film a cult film.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Four young college graduate are making their way across the U.S., writing a travel book of roadside attractions. Captain Spaulding's murder ride is too much to pass up, as is his crazy good fried chicken. But the ride puts them on the trail of local hero Dr. Satan, the never-captured serial killer, and through a carefully orchestrated set of events, the quartet find themselves being entertained by the Firefly family, who make serial killing a family business. Growing surrealism succeeds in creating a funhouse rollercoaster ride of murder and mayhem. Not Zombie's best movie; his first time out, the result is rough and overflowing with what will become Zombie trademarks. You may want to start with Zombie's Halloween, to learn how he thinks before taking on the Fireflys.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Nothing could ever prepare the world for the circus sideshow that is Rob Zombie's HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES. It is no wonder Universal and MGM shelved the film after its completion for fear of the devastating effect it would have on their reputations. Shot like some sort of acid-induced Heavy Metal video, HOUSE borders on genius and sheer madness, but the disjointed narrative structure and crude editing show signs of Zombie's inexperience. Two couples run into trouble on Halloween Eve when they set out to find the burial site of local legend Dr. Satan. After going flat on an old country road, a beautiful hitchhiker lures the tourists to her family's decrepit home, where they are beaten and tortured before they come face to face with Dr. Satan! The entire picture plays out like a fan boy's wet dream, making frequent pop-culture references while filling out the cast with B-movie icons like Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, and Karen Black in a series of bizarre and frightening new roles. HOUSE most successfully emulates the filthy look and feel of 70's Exploitation pictures like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, leaving the viewer in a disgusted state of shock after each of the grueling torture sequences. With HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, Rob Zombie ushers in an unbridled new style of excessive Horror filmmaking that is wildly entertaining, but severely lacking in its basic storytelling techniques.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>I passed this up, many times, when I worked in a movie store.  The cover was freaky, and the special packaging was gruesome.  I never rented it.  However, I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, and loved the movie.  A coworker explained that this was a "part two" of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, so I gave it a chance.<br /><br />I not only enjoyed the movie, but I must admit that this is now one of my faves.  I also purchased the following items related to this flick; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008JL80">House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, and<br />[[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].<br /><br />After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own.  I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie took the music world by storm with his group White Zombie and then turned it on it's ear even more when he went solo, adopting a horror film attitude that rocked the world. Now he takes that idolization of horror films to a new level by making one himself.<br /><br />The trials and tribulations of getting this film released are now a part of legend. After screening a rough cut of the film for a test audience and the brass at Universal Studios, Zombie was boosted by the crowd's reaction. The same couldn't be said for the studios chief who deemed the film morally reprehensible. Selling it back to Zombie, he finally got MGM to cough up some money to make a few changes and to release the film. A comment on MTV, a joke about them apparently having no morals, led to their dropping the film as well. Finally, Lions Gate, a film company willing to take chances, picked the film up and fans had their chance to see what the controversy was all about.<br /><br />Police guarded doors to theaters across the country. If you weren't 18 years old, you weren't going to see this movie, released with an R rating. But horror fans flocked and the movie became enough of a hit to garner a sequel now in the works. So what was the who ha all about?<br /><br />The story takes place on Halloween night, 1977. Four young people (Chris Hardwick, Jennifer Jostyn, Erin Daniels and Rain Wilson) are on a cross country tour, checking out forgotten roadside attractions and writing about them. One night, they stop in at Captain Spaldings, a gas station that sells fried chicken and has its own Museum of Monsters and Madmen. In love with the place, they take the tour.<br /><br />Along the way they are treated to tales of cannibals and crazies that ends with the story of Dr. Satan, a local madman who worked in the nearby asylum. There, he conducted unusual experiments on patients, driving them madder than they were. Once discovered, he was lynched in a wood close by. But the next day, his body was gone and never found.<br /><br />Fascinated, the group asks for directions to the tree where the doctor was hung. Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) gives them directions and off they go.<br /><br />In the middle of a rain storm, the travelers pick up a hitchhiker named Baby (Sheri Moon). When their tire goes flat, she takes one of them home with her and sends out her brother to pick up the car and bring the rest. What the group sees is a weird world indeed.<br /><br />The house is a collection of oddities, from the grouping of baby dolls nailed to the wall to the odds and ends that surround them. Things get a little hairy during an after dinner show the family is putting on to celebrate Halloween, and the group leaves. At least they try to.<br /><br />Stopped by the family and captured, they awake to find themselves the prisoners of a maniacal group of murderers, known to the viewers already since we have seen their earlier captures, a group of missing cheerleaders. One by one the group is killed off or tortured until a moonlight ceremony finds them exposed to the real Dr. Satan and his crew. To give more away would ruin the fun.<br /><br />Zombie, who wrote and directed, has made an incredibly great looking movie. The camerawork that one would associate with a movie like this far exceeds all expectations. He has gone on record as saying that this movie is his tribute to the horror films of the seventies, the visceral, crazy filled movies that had kids captured and seeking escape. While watching, you get an idea of movies that influenced him, everything from the obvious choices (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) to the less known (MOTHER'S DAY).<br /><br />Zombie also uses a number of devices to make your skin crawl and to catch you off guard. Scenes intercut with the action depicting interviews with the killers or glimpses into what they've done behind the scenes offer shocks. Garish lighting effects of red and blue spots give off a weird feeling as well.<br /><br />Does the movie offer scares? You bet, plenty of them. Does it truly pay tribute? Of course! Should it have been this controversial? No. It may be a gut wrenching film, but how is this morally reprehensible while films like THE REAL CANCUN showing real teens getting drunk and having sex is not? At least this isn't real....I hope. Is it worth seeing? For fans of horror this one is a must see. It's spawning a sequel (mentioned earlier), a series of action figures and its own comic book. Get in on the excitement early on.<br /><br />The DVD offers a ton of extra features. Behind the scenes footage, a making of featurette, casting sequences, interviews, director commentary, at least 2 easter eggs and more.<br /><br />When I saw this in the theater, my hopes were high and I expected so much. At the time I was disappointed. In watching the movie again, I now understand better and appreciate more of what Zombie was doing, what he was trying to show. This is a movie that gets better the second time around. And DVD offers you that and more. Give it a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>I don't understand the hype surrounding Rob Zombie's much-awaited directorial debut, which becomes nothing more than a bloodier, gorier rehash of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"and not even a good one! While it does have dazzling visuals, gob smacking editing, flamboyant sets and deliciously over the top characters, that's the only merit I can give it. <p>Taking its cue from vintage 70s horror films, "House" centers on very little, but one might make out that it's about four kids whose car breaks down and they end up in a house full of lunatics. You see, the kids were on the road looking for eerie and abnormal tourist attractions and are about to stare a couple in the face, most notably the manic cannibalistic Dr Satan. <p>If an hour and a half of undecipherable plot and sickening - but not exactly novel - horror tickles your fancy, then "House of 1000 Corpses" should get your heart palpitating. Some of the characters in this movie are truly terrifying. Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding, the owner of a roadside attraction chronicling serial killers, is an obvious highlight. He's freakishly uncomforting, but refreshingly entertaining. It's a pity the movie didn't feature more of him in it's plot. Karen Black's over the top performance is also a highlight, but hey, she's a legend in my book. <p>Once the kids get to their `Final Destination'--the house of horrors, if you will--the film goes down hill. One by one the freaks come out of the woodwork, and one by the one the kids are slaughtered. Nothing very novel there - and horror fans, it isn't done very imaginative either. In fact, most of the horror sequences are clouded by either foggy edits, shots of old horror films or TV shows, or unfathomable imagery. For a film that's been shopped around to that many distributors and been removed and re-slotted into different release dates, I fail to see what the attraction is with this film. In my opinion, it's not better than an MTV video clip that some hard rocker would helm. Yes, it's similar to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but more "The Next Generation" than the original. Now does a film like that deserve so much of your attention?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>A friend of mine recommened this to me, and we watched it earlier today. I hated this movie. The acting was bad, the plot was barely there, and the writing was HORRIBLE. I understand that this was a throwback to old horror movies from the seventies, but if you're gonna do it, do it right. It had one or two funny and/or disturbing scenes in it, but for the most part, it sucked. I didn't like the use of satanic rituals in this movie. It really bothered me, and I know that the scene was probably meant to do that, but still. If you're the kind of person who is sensitive to that type of material, then stay away from this film. I have my reasons for feeling the way that I do about that. <p>This could have been a fun movie, and I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't expecting much in the first place, but I wanted it to be amusing at best. Like I said, there were a few good moments in it, but not enough to waste an hour and fifteen minutes of your life on. <p>SKIP IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This was a great movie that is humorous and scarey at the same time. It very scarey at times and very funny as well. It did borrow from many horror flicks and serial killers as well. When I was watching the movie, I was sitting there thinking what killer this is from. It is more scarey than the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" but is also similiar to it as well. Give it a try, for the price of a rental, what can you lose? I recommend this to anyone that likes B horror flicks that actually act like a big budget one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>"House of a 1,000 Corpses" is not worth a serious review.  In short, this movie was another attempt to borrow from the original classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (as so many have tried to do and have failed before this); however, this does not even come close to being scary or horrifying like the original "TCM".  IT IS A TOTAL JOKE!!!  I wasted my time watching this trash, so I'm not going to waste much of my time writing about this trash.  If you want a good scary horror movie about crazy backwoods killers, you need to watch the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  If you want to waste your time watching rubbish that is about as interesting as watching paint dry and about as scary as Mr. Rogers, you need to purchase "House of 1,000 Fecees" immediately.  In all honesty, I would call "House of 1000 Corpses" a stupid person's black comedy, but that's about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>Very cool movie, he actually brought back 70's-80's horror movies which are my favorites. Worth the buy. But i will tell you one thing about the second part coming out its called devils rejects . I saw a 10 minute clip and it looked stuppid as hell. Nothing like the original.It went from a horror to an action flcik in the 2nd part they show them having some stupid shoot out with cops. I dont just lloked more like an action flick. This is going to be like the hills have eyes the first one was great the second one was complete crap. Some times certain movies dont need sequels. Though this opinion is early , i will still go see the devils rejects cause you never know my opinion might change.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>I was  more interested in this film than I thought I would be. I am sure you know the plot by now. Kids driving cross country, get side tracked into small town, and encounter killer hillbilly psychos.<br />The first encounter is at a gas station/funhouse. The kids stop to fuel up and take a funhouse ride through a chamber of horrors. This was a fun scene and I love funhouse rides, so ofcourse I loved this scene. The props in this scene are exceptional.<br />Next the kids decide to go investigating the local urban legend "Dr. Satan".<br />This is where the fun begins. They encounter a hitch hiker who lures them back to a house in the middle of nowhere. Here they encounter the dreadful psycho family.<br />I saw lots of inspiration from other films such as: Scarecrows, Rocky Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to name a few.<br />The props in the house are wonderful and the mood of the house is successfully bizaare. It was nice to see Karen Black in this film, and I believe she gave the best performance.<br />The last scene where the last surviving teen gets plunged into some crazy underground community is pretty cool. Almost frightening.<br />This film isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't as good as some reviewers say either. It is a fun film for Halloween time and would be great to view at a Halloween party.<br />It isn't a brilliant film, I don't know if it will be a classic, but if you aren't a film snob and don't take it too seriously it can be a fun ride.</p></br></body></html>

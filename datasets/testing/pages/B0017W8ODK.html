Based on Ian McEwan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307388840">Atonement</a> and directed by Joe Wright. Earned two Golden Globes ((Best Drama and Musical Score) and Academy award in the musical score category. England in 1935. A young student is sent to jail on account of the testimony of a 13 year old girl. Four years later, he chooses to join the army on behalf of prison. The first hour of ATONEMENT is a little jewel dealing with what is left unsaid and delusion. I was less enthralled by the second half of the movie with its war scenes and the character played by Romola Garai that didn't have the mysterious and multi-level aura of Briony Tallis at age 13. Notwithstanding this critical remark, I recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Anyone familiar with Ian Mc+Ewan's prolific work knows that he is a writer that explores human sexulaity and it's consequences to the people and world around us.  This film is meant to capture the story of a young girl who due to unusual set of circumstances is a witness to the startling attraction between her beautiful sister and her own platonic love, housekeeper's son Robbie.  She is much younger that her sister and a young lad and confused and startled about their behavior while they are together. Her sister on the other hand, is beautiful and well aware of her high social standing.  The yound man Robbie, she is attracted to, is housekeeper's son and in spite of his obvious handsome apperance and smartness (he is a scholarship kid attending medical school at Ivies) far from a catch for a girl of her social standing.  But their mutual sexual attraction and electrofying desire will diminish all social constraints.  It is the young girl who stands in the way of their happiness and her accusation against the young man inexplicable even to herself, is a cause of their demise and her eternal sorrow for her actions.  I really enjoyed James McAwoy's performance and Vanessa Redgrave's appearance at the end of the movie is a real treat.  I do not believe that any film can ever be as powerful as Ian McEwan's written word on paper.  While Kira Knitley is beautiful to look at, her performace is just not quite there yet...</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>In ATONEMENT just misses being a masterpiece, but some of this has to be attributed to the moviemaker's obsessive fidelity to the source text--for once, they should have thrown out the book and just kept the cinematic elements.  Here the actors work overtime to embody the ultra-romantic lovers Ian McEwan created in his novel, but the one is so painfully thin, and the other so oddly short, that actually I didn't even think the army would take him, even if they were so desperate they were recruiting convicts during the dark days preceding Dunkirk.<br /><br />Knightley and McAvoy are otherwise perfectly convincing and oh, how I wanted them to have a happy life together!  Compounding what you might call "identification" problems in the movie is the way the director has used three different actresses to play the part of Briony Tallis.  The young girl is very good, but it's the grown up girl who's the best, Romola Garai, here outshining everything else she's done on the screen.  None other than Vanessa Redgrave plays Briony as an elderly woman, now a world famous novelist on the order of Iris Murdoch--Redgrave is a good ten years too young to play her convincingly, as the real life character would be really, really, really old, while Redgrave looks ready to play Renee Richards all over again.  She sort of called in the part, oddly enough, and maybe a relief after the anguish all the other actors have to express.  It is Redgrave who has to put over the big post modern twist in the story, and whether or not that falls flat depends on how much you believe her slightly wry delivery.  Her explanation for her character's actions may leave you walking away thinking, did she really expect us to believe her?<br /><br />We were in a crowded theater when James McAvoy is typing the incriminating letter that gets him into so much trouble, one letter at a time, type, type, type, each character filling the screen, and a little boy in the audience asks his mother, what does that word spell Mama?  Everyone laughed and I didn't hear what the mother told her son.  It was just awful, why take your toddlers to a movie called "Atonement"?  Or maybe you should take them out when the lovers onscreen start typing out four letter words in the late nineteen thirties.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>To put it simply, this is an amazing film, wrenching, mesmerizing, beautiful, and painful, alternating poetry and brutality. It's a story of self-righteous misunderstanding and unreliable narration (on several levels), in which the events an overly impressionable young girl witnesses lead to the destruction of two lives -- three, if you count her own life. And, like the book, the ending, in which Briony, now on the verge of death, tells the interviewer the truth she couldn't quite tell in her novel (she's not really very brave), is upsetting and painful as well. There are no clean endings in real life. The screenplay is beautifully written, and extremely close to the novel -- closer than I would have thought possible, in fact. Keira Knightley is very good as Cecelia, though she doesn't really get a chance to emote in this role, Cecelia being a rather closed-off sort of person. James McAvoy nails the part of Robbie Hunter, unjustly imprisoned on Briony's testimony and the victim of class differences -- especially in the scenes in northern France, after the bitter years of imprisonment have taken their toll. But Saoirse Ronan turns in the best work in the film as the thirteen-year-old Briony. Romola Garai is pretty good, too, as Briony at eighteen, and Vanessa Redgrave is competent in her brief section as the aging Briony. I can't think of another film in which the same character at three widely different ages, played by three actresses, has been so well developed. There's even a considerable physical resemblance among them. This is a far from light-hearted romance, or even a standard war story, and you won't forget it for a long, long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Based on Ian McEwan's best-selling novel, Director Joe Wright produces an amazing and stunning film that respectively complements the book.  The film and storyline may appear to be the typical love story.  However, it is much more complicated and threefold.  First, the romance between Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and the wild imaginations of Cecilia's wide-eyed and presumptuous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who would cause her own lifetime of regret.  Second, Cecilia and Robbie finding their way back together despite a war torn landscape.  And third, Briony's attempt to reconcile and atone the wrong she had done between Cecilia and Robbie with the publication of her memoir.<br /><br />The cinematography is cleverly and beautifully shot.  If one closely looks at how the film proceeds like an Alfred Hitchcock mystery, the storyline is not cut and dry, and one will see how the fragments of events evolve and revise from the conflicting beginning to the climactic end.  Briony's character reveals how facts of her personal past can easily be changed for a desirable fictitious narrative; indeed, her character steals the show.  And although this may look like a love and war film as displayed in the grotesque and surreal Dunkirk scenes and scenes of Robbie's undying love for Cecilia, it is Briony's self-discovery and maturity she eventually achieves at the end of the film.<br /><br />As with many novels that have been made into films, the film is missing some of the graphic and detailed narrative that the novel provides.  If Wright had made a duplicate of McEwan's book, the film would have been longer.  Nonetheless, with the crafty film-making, ATONEMENT is a top-notch movie that is deserving of its accolades for an Academy Award nomination.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This is one of the most powerful films of the year, and it will stay with you after it ends. It is a powerful tale about the importance of truth and the consquences of deception. Excellent performances from all of the cast, and one of the best films of 2007! See it as soon as possible. Should be nominated for several Academy Awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I've seen four films from last year that were nominated for Best Picture, and I liked "Atonement" (2007) the most. I read the book when it was first published back in 2001, liked it but did not think of it much before the movie was released. I did not rush to the theater to see "Atonement" - mostly because it was universally compared to "The English Patient". I sat through "The English Patient" once and decided that I would not want to see it again. Well, to make the long story short, I rented "Atonement" when it was released on DVD, and to my utter delight, it turned to be the Best movie of last year. Its first part, 45 minutes in the Tallis's family estate that depict one long hot summer day in 1935, the day that had dramatically and tragically changed the future of the film's many characters, is simply cinematic triumph. The atmosphere of sexual tension, of longing, of discovering love and immediate losing it forever has been recreated masterfully. The first third of the film depends a lot on the inner monologues, body languages, on the differences in ability to see something and to interpret it. I found director's choice in showing the same events from different points of view very creative and appropriate for this kind of cinematic story telling. I was very impressed by Dario Marianelli's Oscar winning score that used the sound of typewriter as a leitmotif. I found it very fitting for the film which is about a devastating power of word that could be the deadliest weapon of all. Shrapnel and bombs just finished the deed that three simple words had started on the evening of one hot summer in 1935. I found the middle part of the film somewhat weaker, not as intense with the emotional impact as the first part until one mournful tragic scene of the war's horror as seen through Robbie's eyes. Once again I was fascinated by the director's and young actor's art of saying much without a word.<br /><br />In the movie with no single bad performance, we are rewarded in the final with short but memorable appearance of Vanessa Redgrave who as one of my friends commented, has "only her face, eyes, and voice to work with." But this is an actress whom Katharine Hepburn favored over all actresses and remarked that she was "A thrill to look at and to listen to." The short epilogue with Redgrave brings the movie to the same high level as its amazingly artful opening part. After I finished watching "Atonement", the first thing I did - I placed the hold for "The English Patient". Ten years is a long time. Maybe I'll see it differently now. Or maybe the fact that Anthony Minghella who had interviewed Redgrave's character in the last scene of "Atonement", suddenly and untimely passed away last March had added to my decision to re-visit his film.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>When I first heard that Atonement was going to be made into a film, I thought how will the authors beautiful prose and lavish style be captured on film.  I was pleasantly surprised as I watched this movie at how faithful the screenwriter was to the source, the only qualm I had was the ending, in the book you get a real insight into the thoughts of the elderly Briony and it is extremely revealing, she goes back to the estate, where they are throwing her a party and you lean the fate of all the characters, the way it's layed out is prefect and it is one of the best payoffs of any book I have read, in movie, however, this is given short shrift, we get six minutes of an out of it Redgrave, and its such a huge letdown to anybody who has had the pleasure of reading this fantastic book.  Having said that, however, I must say, overall, I loved this movie, the first act was perfect and the young girl playing Briony was perfect.  Knightley and McAvoy have great chemistry and they convey a yearning that you know would have lasted the test of time.  The second act is well done as well, though I was not as crazy about the actor playing the late teen Briony, she looks just like the younger Briony, but she cant sustain, the younger actors command of the character.  The third act as I mentioned earlier was a real letdown, but if you have never read the book, then you will most likly have little problem with the last act, but for those of us who had it was the difference between this being a five star film or a four star film.  Really good film, could have been great and if you like this film, do yourself a favor and read the book, at least read the last act, it's heartbreaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Atonement" turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book.  But before I explain what I mean by that, a little background on the story may be in order.<br /><br />Ian McEwan's novel - which spans eight decades, from the 1930's to the present day - centers around Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in England.  Briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe, a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for.  One unusually hot summer day in 1935, Briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister, Cecilia, and the caretaker's son, Robbie, that her child's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved.  Her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time, through World War II and beyond.  As time passes and Briony grows to adulthood, she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done.  The coup de grace is that, due to circumstances beyond her control, Briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer.<br /><br />At the risk of offending devotees of the novel, I must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites.  For despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality, the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying.  As a writer, McEwan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description, but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story.  His plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy, and his dialogue, when indeed he deigns to use any, is almost always stilted and unconvincing (I have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when I was reading the crucial letter-swapping scene).<br /><br />Yet, something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen (suffice it to say, I didn't roll my eyes this time around).  Since film is a largely visual medium, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright are able to convey through images what it takes McEwan endless reams of paper to get across.  Here, an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders, a meaningful turn of the head, a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand.  And, indeed, the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling, a time, a place, sometimes even an entire theme, all on their own.  Even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece, that structure comes across as less fragmented, less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel.  Thanks to the seamless fluidity of Seamus McGarvey's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of Dario Marianelli's brilliant musical score, everything in the film version of "Atonement" feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece.<br /><br />Of the performers, only Keira Knightley is in any way problematic.  She looks positively gorgeous as the seductive Cecilia, and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character.  But she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped poutiness (a problem, too, in "Pride and Prejudice") eventually becomes annoying and distracting.  As Robbie, James McAvoy proves again why he is one of his generation's most exciting screen talents, while young Saoirse Ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old Briony.  Ramola Garai and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave do nicely as Briony in later stages of her life (although the ending, while moving, is a bit more reminiscent of "Titanic" than it needs to be).<br /><br />Wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical "stunts" into integral pieces of the drama: a beautifully realized, five-and-a-half-minute long tracking shot of the carnage at Dunkirk, the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score, a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking.  Through sight and sound, Wright creates a surrealistic, dreamlike tone, perfectly appropriate to the material at hand.  What's amazing is that, even with all these stylistic flourishes, Wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story's core.  In his direction, he displays an astonishing economy of means, moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed.  Not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece; it greatly enhances it.<br /><br />"Atonement" ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted, as Briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity.  Watching "Atonement" is nothing short of a rapturous experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>When the luminous Vanessa Redgrave as Briony, the elderly woman who seeks atonement throughout this film, takes the screen at the very end of "Atonement," this film finally makes sense, catches fire, and becomes thoughtful and meaningful. Redgrave adds Weight to the proceedings: something sorely lacking in this "Epic" love story.<br />With that being said, I found "Atonement" a very beautiful and stunningly produced film. For once, the shifting between time periods and between the lives of Briony (as a child, as a young woman and as an elderly woman), Cecelia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy: finally coming into his own with this subtle, heartfelt performance) is not a problem, does not confuse but instead adds texture, friction and verisimilitude: this is a film of remembrance after all...of events, reactions and situations recalled by Briony at various stages of her life: a life seemingly dedicated to righting a wrong from her young life.<br />In fact, "Atonement" is a film of penance. A film about a Mistake, a Misinterpretation, a film about a child's misplaced, unwanted and unwarranted love gone awry. Director Joe Wright ("Pride and Prejudice") carefully even reverentially directs this material which in several ways reminds me of Lillian Hellman's "The Children's Hour" in that a child is at the center of a controversy and her words literally cause big problems for an adult. Oddly enough Briony and Mary in "TCH" are both of a so-called "elevated" social class while the object of their invective is not. Wright should have mined this conflict between classes a lot more than he does. As it is, it is dropped and instead "Atonement" becomes less than what it could have been.<br />McAvoy's Robbie, though from simple beginnings, is obviously meant for great things. His mentor is Cecelia's father and he is off to Cambridge very soon after the film begins. McAvoy plays him with just the right amount of bragadaccio and humility: he knows he's smart, he knows that he is a star yet he knows his place...at least for the time being. Knightley's performance is more problematic. Her reactions sometimes smack of something akin to that of an American high school cheerleader in their lack of depth and feeling.<br />But, no one can deny the sexual heat that she and McAvoy produce in their terrific scenes together. You truly believe that these two could/can/would bed each other: the penultimate scene of Cecelia and Robbie in the Tallis estate library both clawing at each other like two cats in heat... reeks of musk, bristling stiff starched clothing and silk underwear.<br />"Atonement" then is not a complete success but instead is an example of lost opportunities on the one hand and of a director adhering too close to the source material on the other. Despite all of this, this is a film of uncommon physical beauty. If only the thought processes behind this film could have matched or surpassed the physical concerns we would have had a major triumph here. As it is, "Atonement" is merely a good not a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>Thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is an aspiring writer who has completed her very first play.  Eager to act it out to everyone, she is disappointed that her cousins seem not so enthusiastic about it and there are other things going on in her household that take the attention away from her unique accomplishment.  She has a crush on Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son, and she is not too thrilled when she sees something from her window.  It appears there is something going on between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie, and this is further confirmed when she reads a letter from Robbie to Cecilia, a rather explicit letter that he hadn't meant to send out in the first place.  What transpires is a story of betrayal, misunderstanding and deception, one in which two young lovers are torn apart and live tragic lives.  Actions have consequences, and Briony, now eighteen (played by Ramola Garai) is living it.  Will she be able to make things right for Cecelia and Robbie?  Will she be forgiven and, in turn, find peace?<br /><br />The film is absolutely beautiful.  Joe Wright, whose work I'd seen previously in Pride & Prejudice, has an eye for beautiful landscapes and overall flawless cinematography.  The setting (mid to late 1930s, amid the dawn of WWII), the costumes and scenery are gorgeous.  The script is fairly faithful to the book, much more faithful than the director and screenwriter had been with P&P, where they took far too much artistic license.  The acting is wonderful as well.  I am officially a big fan of James McAvoy.  Not only is the Scottish actor extremely attractive, but he is also a wonderful actor.  I had seen him in Becoming Jane and The Last King of Scotland, and this further proves that he is talented man with a promising Hollywood career.  As for Keira Knightley... It's not that I don't like her, or that I think she's a bad actress, but I simply cannot understand her.  Literally, I cannot understand half the words that come out of her pouty little mouth.  She talks too fast, and kind of mumbles, and I have to turn on the DVD's subtitles in order to grasp her words.  I don't usually have a difficult time understanding the various British accents, so I think it is more a matter of a diction problem from her.  Other than that, I think she did a fine job as well.  The film moved me, and I was saddened by its poignant ending.  The one thing I complain about is that Cecelia and Robbie were not together long enough to make me believe in this star-crossed romance and intense love for each other.  I simply didn't see enough of it on the screen.  I know the purpose is that they did not get to spend enough time together, and that they had been torn apart before the romance could begin, but still.<br /><br />The DVD is good.  It surprised me that the film has an analog 1.85 widescreen format instead of the smaller 2.35 aspect ratio, which I would have preferred (image is clearer and sharper).  I enjoyed the deleted scenes and commentary.  All in all, Atonement is a wonderful film.  It deserved all of the award nominations it has received and this is one DVD I'll be watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"Atonement" appears to be this season's must-see love story. My local art-house theater scheduled an unusual 2-week showing that takes it over Valentine's Day, suggesting that the film's romantic elements make it appropriate for a lover's night out. But for all this positioning and promise, "Atonement" turns out to be a gaily-wrapped Valentine chocolate with a hollow center.<br /><br />The basics of the tale can be gleaned well enough from the trailers. At a sumptuous English estate between the wars, Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the estate's serving staff, and the owner' beautiful daughter Cecilia (Keira Knightley) are falling in love. They are caught in an indiscretion by C's 13-year old writer sister Briony. A series of unfortunate events unfolds that allows Briony to accuse Robie of heinous crime, and he is carted of to jail, and eventually to war. Later, after Briony has grown up a bit, she tries to undo the damage she has done, hence the film's title.<br /><br />The potential for the story is terrific and the first half of the film has some wonderful moments. Briony is played by three actresses, the most vibrant of whom is the youngest, Saoirse Ronan, who plays Briony at as an emerging woman with all the narrow view, outraged morality and petulant jealousy of childhood. The visuals in this portion of the movie (and throughout as well) are extraordinary. A scene at a fountain, in which Cecilia retrieves a  pottery piece broken by Robie is stunning. And the film's signature scene, in which Robie and Cecilia express their love, ensures that the viewers will never look at a wall of books in quite the same way ever again. But in spite of these moments, the film sputters along on half-power, perhaps assuming that the smoldering emotions between the characters will burst into flame in the viewer's mind. Alas, in spite of the terrific eye-candy provided by Knightly and McAvoy, it does not. Whether due to inept direction or the actors' restricted range, neither lead manages to convey more than one emotion at a time, and that not well. Peripheral actors (notably Patrick Kennedy as the child-loving scoundrel Leon Tallis) managed to convey complete characters, in their few moments of screen, in ways that Knightley and McAvoy cannot. Endless lighting of cigarettes does not an actor make.<br /><br />I found the war sequences particularly puzzling. McAvoy, along with a couple of companions, spend at least a half hour wanding around an enemy-infested French countryside with no more sense of menace than a Sunday stroll in the park. They end up at Dunkirk, where they spend another 15 minutes of film time wandering aimlessly around the tens of thousands of soldiers waiting to be evacuated. This particular shot will impress cinematography fans (it seems to have be one of  those one-shot wonders) but it says very little about Dunkirk (suggesting perhaps that it was just a jolly holiday to be pinned down by Germans with one's back to the sea) and does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. A beached ship in this section of the film serves perhaps as a metaphor for the impotence of the men awaiting rescue, but it serves also to represent the film itself -- gorgeous, fully a-sail, stuck in the mire. As the film returns to 18-year old Briony (played by Romola Garai), it pretty much loses its moorings. Garai spends much time wandering around hospital corridors looking vaguely sad. Gory war wounds replace real emotionality. It's just more screen time that says nothing about the characters or advances the plot.<br /><br />"Atonement" is a baffling disappointment, and ends up being a boring exercise in which actors mime emotional depth by standing about in period costume. It is an example of what happens when filmmakers focus on making pretty images, but forget to tell a story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this film because of the actors involved in it. James McAvoy,who was excellent in "The Last King of Scotland" & "Narnia", Keira Knightly, and Vanessa Redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews.  However, the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because I had liked Joe Wright's direction in the previous film to this, "Pride & Prejudice" also with Keira Knightley.  Because of this and despite McAvoy's and Redgrave's excellent acting, I felt disengaged from the film.  Also Knightley somehow lacks that "something" that made the late Audrey Hepburn magnetic and so I felt little of McAvoy's passion for her because of this. So regretfully, 2 stars which means okay but no bonnets for this very over-rated film (check out "The French Lieutenant's Woman" for comparison).</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Atonement" has pleasant moments.  I didn't enjoy it very much, but I think it probably is good.  Saoirse Ronan who was Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actress as the young Briony Tallis does an excellent job of creating a lot of stir.  Ramola Garai takes over as Briony at age 18 and does a good job of trying to atone for her actions as a young girl.  Vanessa Redgrave is excellent, albeit in a thankless role, as Briony right before her death.  Redgrave has been nominated for Oscars for "Morgan!" (1966), "Isadora" (1968), "Mary Queen of Scots" (1971), "The Bostonians" (1984), and "Howard's End" (1992).  She won a supporting Oscar in 1977 for "Julia."  I have been watching her captivating performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6LSOA">Evening</a>.  As the aging author telling this tale, she is reduced to a TV interview show format.  Keira Knightly who was nominated for an Oscar for "Pride & Prejudice" in 2005 looks good.  James McAvoy, who plays Robbie Turner, was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes for this film.  He had previously been nominated for an Oscar in the powerful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He's always very good in his films; however "Atonement" keeps him rather boxed in emotionally, despite the excellent scenes in the war.  Brenda Blethyn plays his mother Grace Turner in a nice cameo.  The best performance of the film for me was in the cameo of Jeremie Renier as Luc Cornet, a French soldier who dies from a scull injury in front of Briony.  It's a short but powerful performance.  Belgian Renier was nominated as Best Actor by the European Film Awards for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0O5IM">L' enfant</a> (The Child) in which he sells his baby.  In "Atonement," he is touching with his mind going between memory and the present.<br /><br />My greatest disappointment with "Atonement" was the screenplay which tries to be clever by jumping back and forth with flashbacks and giving us only part of the story to be unhooked at the director's discretion.  Thus, rather than just telling a fairly interesting tale, we must wonder at how clever the screenwriter was.  It doesn't work and the final scenes like the flooded tunnel come as downer footnotes.  If depressing cinema is your forte, get your hanky for this one.  The performances and cinematography, however, are exquisite.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Atonement" was adapted by the brilliant Christopher Hampton from the novel by Ian McEwan. Though it beautifully captures the bygone English country lifestyle, this is much more than a doomed romance in a picturesque period setting. It is a story about the meaning of stories. In 1935, as Great Britain is on the brink of war, 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) has just completed her first play, which she intends to put on for her brother's visit. Her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightly) is beginning to express her long-felt interest in the housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy), on whom young Briony also had a crush. When envy and inexperience lead Briony to misinterpret Robbie's actions, her accusations have devastating consequences for all.<br /><br />Narratively, "Atonement" spends its most interesting day at the Tallis country manor. Briony is agitated by one incident after another. Cecelia and Robbie's flirtation is evolving. The guest list spells disaster. And this grand house, photographed to seem utterly labyrinthine, looms over everyone. Kudos to director Joe Wright for preserving the different perspectives so essential to the characters' experiences. But, thematically, it is the jump forward in time 5 years, then 60 years, that tells us what we need to know -not about Cecelia and Robbie, but about the fiction that undid them and that which preserves them. We're left, once again, to judge Briony's account of events, her choice of lies. "Atonement" gives thoughtful consideration to the impact of stories, while Keira Knightly and James McAvoy have great chemistry, and Saorise Ronan projects enough tension to keep us worried.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008): There are 2 featurettes, 7 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a feature commentary. "Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of Atonement" (26 min) interviews director Joe Wright, novelist Ian McEwan, screenwriter Christopher Hampton, cast, and crew about the characters, the Tallis home, filming the retreat to Dunkirk, and themes. "From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic" (5 min) interviews Wright, McEwan, Hampton, and producer Paul Webster about adapting the novel to film. The feature commentary by director Joe Wright is interesting and informative. He takes us through the film, explaining his decisions, commenting on characters and how themes of storytelling and perspective are expressed. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Based upon the novel by Ian Mcewan, ATONEMENT is a beautifully shot and constructed movie that examines the power of perspective, the importance of truth, and how differences between the two can clash and affect people's lives.  The film opens in 1935 England in a beautiful country estate.  Thirteen-year old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) is a precocious girl attempting to establish herself as a writer by writing tales of fantasy and plays that she and her friends can act out for their families.  Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is in love with the son of one of the housekeepers, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), and is eager to marry and start her life anew.  Briony has a secret crush on Robbie which alters the perspective of some of the things she sees.  She thinks that there is something sinister about the flirtations between Cecilia and Robbie and when she catches them in a sudden moment of lovemaking, she believes that Robbie is a sex criminal who is attempting to hurt her sister.  That night when a young girl that is staying with the family is sexually assaulted, even though she did not see his face, Briony accuses Robbie of committing the crime.  He is arrested and taken away and the lives of Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, and all of their friends and family are horribly altered.<br /><br />The movie tells the story from two different perspectives: that of Briony's and that of what actually happened.  The story if first seen from Briony's perspective. Then after a certain sequence it rewinds to the beginning of the sequence and the audience is shown what actually happened.  This doesn't occur during the entire movie, but it does happen about four times throughout the film.  Some of the people I watched the movie with found the effect annoying, but I felt it fit with the story being told and the messages the film seems to be interested in having people discuss.<br /><br />As far as movies go, ATONEMENT is pretty much a straight drama interlaced with a bit of romance.  The plot itself isn't really interesting just by itself, but becomes intriguing when interlaced with the issue of perspective.  The acting is fairly well done and it's nice to Keira Knightley attempting to play a full-grown woman.  I was particularly impressed by the performances of James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, Saorise Ronan as the thirteen-year old Briony, and Romola Garai as the older Briony working as a nurse during WWII.<br /><br />The film's strongest points are the settings, cinematography, and editing.  The scenery is lush, vivid, and full of tones that reflect the mood and atmosphere of a particular scene.  The cinematography is amazing, particularly an extended five-and-a-half minute tracking shot take at what is supposed to be Dunkirk beach.  The set that was constructed in Redcar, England for the shot is an impressive piece of scenery and one of the most visually stunning I have seen built specifically for a movie in the past few years.  Director Joe Wright did a marvelous job of bringing it altogether.<br /><br />ATONEMENT isn't a very happy or uplifting movie.  There is very little joy in the picture and the story revolves around a girl trying to atone for the actions that disrupted her peaceful, idyllic existence and brought her into womanhood. Like some other excellent movies from 2007 (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THERE WILL BE BLOOD), the movie ends somewhat abruptly.  There is a sense of closure, but the audience is left at the end of the movie revaluating everything they have seen, trying to piece together what was real and what was not.<br /><br />Highly recommended for film buffs, especially those who enjoy excellent cinematography.  Also recommended for those who enjoy classy, English dramas with a bit of romance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>When I think of Joe Wright, whose only other motion picture is Pride and Prejudice, I think of some of the best choreography today. He's up there with Baz Luhrmann who does those extravagent musicals such as Moulin Rouge. What impressed me from his first movie was how daring he made scenes that were already tough enough to get made. Filming intricate and coordinated scenes such as the ballroom dance that flirts for minutes with blind footmoves and difficult/fast lines. And he does it again in Atonement, though with more of an observant approach, with the four minute beach scene, seemingly pain free. I marvel at how he handles such difficult scenes, and it keeps me enthralled because in all seriousness I have to dig into the sacred past and compare him even to a young Stanley Kubrick in how he choreographed Spartacus. It is early, but I get the sense that given enough money and backing he could muster his epic masterpiece as well. We have to remember that Joe's been working with Focus films and that's an independant film company with little money to spare for exuberance. He hasn't been the helm of a gargantua film project like Spielberg or Peter Jackson, but we are looking at the blossoming of a very gifted director. I'm using one of my prediction cards on this one in saying that Joe will be in the likes of the giant company of some of our most respected Directors given time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>With its unusual structure, incorporating views of the same events from two different perspectives, this arty film is a somewhat demanding watch, at first.  Then, as it proceeds through the Dunkirk sequence and into, what after awhile, is revealed as fantasy, the movie takes on a new dimension and it captured my attention. The real kicker comes near the end when Venessa Redgrave makes her appearance and admissions. Beautiful photography dominates the first half during the 1936 period. The war sequence, though technically impressive with its 5-minute tracking shot, doesn't have the same impact. Worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>After seeing it a second time, I think that ATONEMENT should have won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 2007.  It is a rich, sweeping production; a touching romantic drama that transports you back to a simpler, albeit more dangerous, time and place.<br /><br />There is also a surprise, absolutely unforgettable ending.<br /><br />Ian McEwan's acclaimed novel was adapted to the screen by Christopher Hampton and directed by Joe Wright.<br /><br />Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play the star-crossed lovers whose lives are destroyed by a vicious lie told by her younger sister, played at different times on the picture by Oscar-nominated Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.<br /><br />With a great film, like ATONEMENT, you see many things in a second viewing that you missed the first time around.  For example, the occasional sound of a typewriter on the soundtrack takes on an entirely new meaning, as does a brief scene of McAvoy walking through a field of poppies.<br /><br />There is also a 5-minute stedicam sequence on the beach at Dunkirk that makes Orson Welles' brilliant opening sequence in TOUCH OF EVIL look like child's play.<br /><br />The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains two excellent "Making of" featurettes, deleted scenes and audio commentary by director Wright.<br /><br />?

A very good story about how you right the wrongs that you've done in your lifetime. This story takes place in England during World War II.<br />Asking if we really can right our wrongs is like asking, can you drive a vechile from New York to California on one tank of gas...NOT!!<br />But you will spend most of your life trying to ATONE for your wrongs!!<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>After seeing the movie, I do fancy giving the book another go. But I definitely couldn't get my head around it the first time around.<br /><br />Why did I buy Atonement? I was actually curious about this movie. People rave about it, crying when they came out of the cinema etc. People saying it was only made to win awards. All these five star reviews. Which normally means I won't like the film.<br /><br />Although I was quite confused during the first half hour, as it flips between one person's viewpoint to another, but I soon got dragged into the movie. The cast do brilliantly in their roles, although I don't think I'm ever going to be a fan of James McAvoy. He's just not one of my favourite actors.<br /><br />I won't go into the whole story, as so many other reviewers have already done so. But while I'll agree that yes, the film has been made to win awards, it is a really good film. I didn't, however, cry after watching it. I was more shocked when the credits were rolling. The only bit I didn't like in the movie was the much celebrated tracking shot through Dunkirk. Why is it so special? I got bored when it was on screen, there was nothing special there. In my opinion, it was an overly long shot, which didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Prepared to be shocked and surprised with this movie, as it takes you in a direction that I certainly didn't think it would. And I actually liked Keira Knightley for once. (I don't normally.) Although she's still far too skinny, but she'll never change. James McAvoy - I've seen him in a couple of films now - most recently Wanted - and I still don't like him. My personal opinion, other people start swooning when his name is mentioned, just not for me.<br /><br />Watching Atonement has made me want to re-try the book again. And definitely watch the film again, to see if I can spot the little 'clues' that there's supposed to be throughout. But an excellent movie, and one I did not think I would like.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Honestly, for about half the picture I was annoyed with the pacing and the time jumping.  But boy, does Atonement have one heck of a pay off.  In the end, I was more than a little choked up.  Knightley and Mcavoy are perfectly cast and Saoirse Ronan is a budding star if ever there was one.  IMHO, Director Joe Wright is more to be commended than screen writer Christopher Wright for this piece.  I think he took some bold risks that truly don't pay off until the end.  Highly, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Cecilia Tallis is the elder daughter of a wealthy Englishman in the 1930's.  She finds herself irresistably drawn to Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son whom her father supports.  Her little sister Briony has a girlish crush on Robbie and she spies on Robbie and her sister and lies about their relationship.  Her lies have far-reaching consequences and throughout her adult life she seeks to make atonement for her misdeeds.  This is a beautiful film, wonderfully acted, which truly does justice to the novel upon which it is based.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>As a long-time Ian McEwan fan, I always thought his best book was "Atonement" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099429799">Atonement</a>, and this amazing film certainly does justice to the novel. The first half of the film is set in 1935 on a hot summer day on the lush country estate of the Tallis family. Cecilia (Keira Knightly) is the gorgeous, sensual, but bored older daughter of the family. James McEvoy is the housekeeper's son, who works on the estate in the summer but is clearly going places, after a Cambridge education paid for by the mysterious Mr. Tallis, whom we never meet.<br />Cecelia's 13 year old sister, Briony, is an aspiring writer, and is trying to stage her first play that evening for the guests of the house. But there's a lot more going on, as the pounding score by Dario Marianelli suggests. Briony witnesses a mysterious scene by the fountain between Robbie and Cecelia, and we suddenly realize the undercurrents of passion and emotion thick in the hot summer air.<br /><br />Looming in the background are thoughts of the war to come. Through flashbacks and replays from different points of view, the tension builds, and in the space of one boring summer day, the lives of the Tallis family and of Robbie are shattered.<br /><br />For those who haven't read the book it's hard to say more without being a spoiler, so I won't. For lovers of the novel, rest assured that director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have stayed faithful to the novel, with amazing results. It's hard to think of another instance where the film so perfectly complemented the novel, deepening my understanding and suggesting new interpretations. The war scenes are filmed with all the chaos and horror McEwan writes of, and the final interview with the elderly Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave, just makes a bit more explicit the shattering climax of the book. With seven Academy Award nominations, including the three biggies, this film is a must see. One of the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>ATONEMENT ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years, boosted by some brilliant color photography, a lyrical background score, a well crafted script, and some fine ensemble performances. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines, but otherwise the cast is impeccable.<br /><br />Basically it's a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the English countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman (Knightley) and a handyman at her father's estate (JAMES McAVOY). Their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister Briony (amazing performance from SAOIRSE RONAN), who happens to spy on them from an upper window. She's a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her. He does, but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely exposed them both to danger.<br /><br />From that point on, the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives. In director Joe Wright's hands, the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied, by the conclusion, that the tale has been told in a very effective way.<br /><br />VANESSA REDGRAVE comes in toward the end, as the older version of the young woman who told a lie, and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting way.<br /><br />The standout performances are given by SAOIRSE RONAN as young Briony and JAMES McAVOY. McAvoy is impressive throughout, totally in command of a difficult role, almost emotionally draining in the film's detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shell-shocked manner. His confrontational moments with the eighteen year-old Briony (RAMOLA GARAI) are brilliantly played by both performers.<br /><br />Many stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale. This one is very powerful and yet, at the core, remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depth.<br /><br />The background score by Dario Marianelli , distinguished by lots of piano music, is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multi-layered story.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Joe Wright has wrought something quite magnificent with his latest film.  It's what Brits do best - superbly photographed period drama with serious actors, seriously acting.<br />In 30's England in a stately manor, we are introduced to two sisters.  The elder (Keira Knightley, looking absolutely ravishing, and speaking in her best clipped tones..) is in love with Robbie (James Macevoy), who is not upper class but been a friend of the family for some years.  A moment charged with sexual tension is observed by the younger sister, Briony, is misinterpreted, and ultimately leads to a false accusation.  It is the results of that accusation that drive the movie that follows, and Briony's growing understanding of what she has done and how she can atone for it.<br />Acting, particularly the three actresses playing Briony, is superb.  Even better is the stunning photography which is both beautiful and imaginative... although the much hyped Dunkirk beach scene comes off as more showing off than intrinsically useful to the story, as audacious as it is.  The Oscar winning score is outstanding, striking sombre, aching and dramatic notes as required, and punctuating scenes with the staccato rhythm of a typewriter to great effect.<br />However, there is a pacing problem with the movie.  By shortening the novel in the section which shows what Robbie endures as a result of the accusation, we do not get a deep enough sense of the tragedy to make the pay-off as effective as it should be.  It's a quibble, but one which robs the movie of a good deal of its emotional impact.<br />This is a great director's calling card, and fantastic viewing on many levels.  I suggest that it only falls short of being a masterpiece by a flawed middle section, and being just a little too self consciously clever from the director's chair.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 1935 England, 13-year old Briony (Ronan) lives with her family in the countryside.  Her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) is developing a relationship with Robbie (McAvoy) the servant.  Cecelia herself has a crush on Robbie and is a bit jealous.  She does see him as a seducer and wants to protect Cecelia.  When a friend of the family is raped on the grounds, Briony offers up a lie that will change the three of their lives forever.<br /><br />"Atonement" is an interesting, if tragic, movie.  It straddles a thin line between youthful misunderstanding and jealous maliciousness.  Briony is a tragic figure, played well by Ronan, Garai, and Redgrave, who spends her life trying to make up for a wrong that may or may not have been intentional.  McAvoy is solid as Robbie, the person whose life is most directly affected by her actions.  Director Joe Wright does a good job bringing war torn Europe to life.  The problem with "Atonement" is that, aside from having a main character in Briony that is mostly unlikable, the film is a bit of a downer.  This will not be a hit with mainstream audiences, and really was the weakest of the Best Picture nominees in 2007.  This is definitely not a film for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Atonement" explores the theme of love unfulfilled. It starts of as a typical English drawing room comedy set in the relative calm of 1935 England - but storm clouds are gathering.<br /><br />Performances are uniformly excellent and the film, beautifully shot, has an almost dreamlike quality. There is an extraordinary extended shot that weaves along the Dunkirk foreshore. And the ending is heartachingly beautiful. This film is stunning achievement on a modest budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is a good interpretation of Ian McEwan's novel.  I liked it...but I didn't love it.  It's usually a bad sign when you think: "It took me less time to read the book than it does to watch the movie.  There are many good things about the movie - especially the acting.  Kiera Knightly is fine and James McAvoy is fast becoming one of my favorite new actors.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />Part of the problem is with Briony.  The actress who plays her as a young girl is fine, but for some reason the filmmakers felt the need to give her some apparent sexual hang-ups in order to give an (unsatisfactory) motivation.  The actress who plays Briony as a young woman comes across as a cipher.<br /><br />As I intimated, there was also a problem with the pacing.  Events are dealt with in a more heavy-handed way in the book than in the movie.  The book was about the problems of perception, but the movie seems to sidestep this - implying that Briony knew the truth all along.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>The first hour of the movie is impressive. The cinematography, the editing (twice with the same scene told from two different perspectives, one observed from Briony, the young sister and one showing what actually happened), the score (with typewriter providing the background sound) and the young sister's steadfast gaze and focused attitude all make an excellent presentation.<br /><br />Then the second hour moved to the war in 1940, both in Europe and in London. A drastic change in the mood. Visually stunning and touching. Especially when Vanessa Redgrave as the old Briony disclosed everything that happened after her lie in 1935 - the truth as well as what she had hoped for.<br /><br />I would say this is a good and thought provoking movie. But I can't help feeling what's holding it back from being a better one.<br /><br />(a)It's very Joe Wright - it bears too close a resemblance to Pride and Prejudice in the first hour, in portraying the life of the Tallis family in the English countryside. In so doing, the movie lacks its signature tone and is somehow masked by the director's previous work.<br /><br />(b)I wish I had not seen Pride and Prejudice and Miss Potter (with Keira Knightley, James Mcavoy and Brenda Blethyn already in the cast in addition to the same visually stunning portrayal of the English countryside). Atonement could then have made a refreshing and fluid story telling movie that stands out on its own.<br /><br />(c)While Saoirse Ronan (young Briony) and James Mcavoy (as Robbie) are superb, Keira Knightly (as Cecilia) is not in the same league. She has the beauty but somehow her determined and firm look make her inner feelings unable to surface completely, short of what Saoirse Ronan and James Mcavoy have achieved. She could have delivered more subtlety and depth to her character. Maybe some part of the Elizabeth (Pride and Prejudice) still lingers in her or maybe the director finds that already adequate? James Mcavoy, on the other hand, has pulled off a wonderful performance. Juno Temple (as Lola, Briony's cousin) is also impressive. She got to portray the young and the grown up Lola. It's unfortunate that Saiorse cannot do likewise and continue her captivating screen presence.<br /><br />That being said, Atonement is still worth watching. I am also more sympathetic to what Briony (the young sister) has done. Should Robbie and Cecilia have been more discreet in their younger days, Briony would not have to make such a difficult decision. So atonement, in some sense, needs not rest on Briony's shoulders alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times, basking in not only the brilliant story/mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language, rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen, but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton (we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film) becomes even more clear in its realization  of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose.  Joe Wright as director steers this story well, finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly superb.  From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis (an impressive Saoirse Ronan) to the years' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony (Romola Garai) to the 'epilogue' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave, the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy.  But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's  tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work.  Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee, Brenda Blethyn, J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renier and countless others are played to perfection.<br /><br />The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II.  Dario Marianelli's music score (much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet!) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of 'La Boheme' with de los Angeles and Bj&ouml;rling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations.<br /><br />Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film (and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night!): it is the perfect marriage of novel, cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film. Highly Recommended on every level.  Grady Harp, January 08</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>You will appreciate the movie more if you have read the novel. It is not a straightforward love story and definitely not a war epic. It is also not an English society story from the 30s, though it starts as such. A young girl with writing ambitions has her share of frustrations with family and with a failed crush. She sees things and misunderstands them involving her elder sister and her crush. This leads to false accusations, a wrong arrest, a life badly damaged, a love unfulfilled. The script handles the misperceptions of the girl perfectly, we get to see things in different versions. It is like time moving in loops.<br />The middle part shows us the struggles of the two separated lovers towards getting back to each other in the middle of war. Dunkerk for him, London hospitals' nursing wards during the bombing of London for her. The younger sister repents and tries to make up, but is rejected.<br />The final and shortest part is set in the recent past and has the former young girl explain what happened. You will find that the story makes perfect sense and is well constructed.<br />The book was one of McEwan's better ones. The movie is on par with the novel: I have rarely seen a better adaptation of such a novel. The script deserves an Oscar, as does the cinematography. Some of the images are outstanding, e.g. the 3 soldiers walking dejectedly and lost through France or Flanders towards uncertainty and Dunkerk, and the we see a bomber fly over them, but we see it only as its reflection in the small canal. Look at the pictures!<br />The cast is excellent and I disagree with those who think that KK is miscast, though her performance in Pride and Prejudice was more impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Atonement" is a great example of an excellent book that was seamlessly adapted for the big screen.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Ian McEwan, "Atonement" is the story of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old girl growing up in England in the year 1935. Briony is a very intense girl who is obsessed with storytelling. She witnesses a series of events between her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), and Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the Tallis family's housekeeper. Briony things she understands what she sees, but she really doesn't. When a terrible crime is committed, Briony points the finger at the wrong man, sending an innocent person to prison and leaving Cecilia absolutely devastated.<br /><br />This is an amazing story about love, truth, and justice. I have read McEwan's novel, and I was blown away by how well this story transferred to the screen. Everything in the film looked just the way I'd envisioned it when I read the book, which is a great testament to the filmmakers. I was very impressed by many of the performances in the film, especially those of the actors portraying young Briony, Cecilia, and Robbie. Ronan is a superb young actress whose portrayal of Briony is absolutely brilliant. Knightley seems to get better and better with every film she makes, and "Atonement" is no exception. She brings Cecilia to life on screen and makes her evolve from a selfish girl with a high-and-mighty attitude to a passionate woman who will do anything to be with the man she loves. The on-screen chemistry between Knightley and McAvoy is unbelievably intense (that library scene...wow!). I think Cecilia and Robbie will become one of cinema's most treasured couples, right up there with Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.<br /><br />I also need to mention the amazing cinematography in the film, as well as the music. There are many spectacular camera shots in the film, and dramatic uses of light to enhance certain scenes. The film's score integrates Briony's pounding typewriter keys into the music of the entire movie, which is seamless and incredible.<br /><br />I only have two small gripes about this film. First of all, the ending of the movie slightly differed from the ending of the book, and I don't understand why it was changed. Secondly, I wasn't thrilled with Romola Garai's portrayal of Briony at age 18. She just wasn't as creepy and intense as Ronan, which was disappointing. However, it's possible that I'm being overly critical of Garai just because Ronan was so utterly fantastic in her role. It would be a lot for anyone to live up to.<br /><br />Overall, "Atonement" absolutely dazzled me. I appreciate that the film is so true to the book in every way, and it was wonderful to see this amazing story come to life. This is a must-see that has "Academy Award winner" written all over it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I have never read ATONEMENT (although I own the book, it has somehow never made it to my nightstand), so I brought no preconceived expectations, except that the story was emotionally shattering and the ending is supposed to be a mindblower.<br /><br />Based on the movie, neither expectation was even close to being met. This is the story of the Tallis family, whom we meet in 1935, at their country estate in England.  Oldest daughter Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is secretly but chastely in love with young Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the housekeeper, who apparently received a scholarship to a good school as a young man, and actually is anticipating going to medical school.  These two have obviously known each other for years, and the heat between them is just starting to really get cranked up.  This is unfortunate, because on this particular day, Cecilia's 13 year-old sister Briony seems to be making a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She is an aspiring writer, and clearly thinks very highly of herself.  While both sisters clearly are children of privilege and have a somewhat haughty attitude, young Briony is also a smart child whose self-esteem has probably been inflated to an inappropriate level.<br /><br />So the heat turns up on the two young lovers, and Briony is there to not only read a note from Robbie to Cecilia, but to catch them in a couple of intimate acts.  She misunderstands what she is reading and seeing, and this leads to disaster for Cecilia, and particularly for Robbie, who is accused of a horrible crime and sent to prison.<br /><br />This covers nearly the first half of the film, and this part of the film is quite compelling.  It's well-written, very well acted and oozes with atmosphere.  We feel everyone simply languishing...bored and open to getting into trouble.  It's dramatic stuff, and when the "act" ends with Robbie arrest, we anticipate an escalation of events and emotions that will take this film to the "shattering" levels.<br /><br />And here's where the film falls nearly completely apart.  Robbie is allowed into the army after 4 years in prison, and we see him at Dunkirk, the site of the historic evacuation of British troops from the mainland back to England.  This daring and costly evacuation of hundreds of thousands of troops was a turning point in the early days of the war...if the evacuation had failed, Britain would have been routed, and Germany could have invaded the island.  As a viewer, we are told none of this...we had just better know it.  However, we are instead allowed to follow Robbie as he wanders through some fields, sees some horrific sights and generally looks like a guy who has been through hell.  There is a scene on the beach that shows us the immensity of what the troops face.  It is about 5 minutes long and is done in one long take.  Technically, it is truly impressive...dramatically, it serves almost no purpose.  It shows off for no reason.<br /><br />Back in England, we see that Cecilia has become a head nurse and is estranged from her family.  Briony, a nurse-in-training, continues to write and apparently is still eaten up by guilt at what she has caused...because now, of course, she believes that what she saw was mis-interpreted.<br /><br />So we see some scenes of these three characters grappling with the ware.  So is this a war movie?  Why so much emphasis on the war when what we've been led to be interested in is these three characters...who play second fiddle to the war for nearly an hour.  War scenes are certainly inherently interesting, but in ATONEMENT they should be supplementing our understanding of the characters not overwhelming them.  By the time the brief third act starts, and all the surprises are revealed, we have pretty much stopped caring about the characters.  And the surprises really aren't that surprising.  The whole tone of the movie, and the way it has played around with time makes it a bit unsurprising when the truth is revealed.  I won't say I saw it coming...but I also didn't really feel surprised.  My wife felt the same.<br /><br />Another problem is the character Briony.  She is unlikeable throughout the film, at all ages.  We aren't given a reason to sympathize with her, as she goes from arrogance to cowardice to regret.  Big deal...none of those feelings compare to the damage she has wrought.<br /><br />Everyone does a decent acting job, and technically the film is accomplished.  But director Joe Wright doesn't handle the tone of the film well enough for us to accept all the shifts and leaps.  And without knowing the book, I have to say that the script, particularly later in the game, is pedestrian and truly fails its characters.  It's almost like the first half of the movie and the second half were written and directed by different people.<br /><br />I can't say I cared much for the film.  It's been nominated for a lot of awards, so clearly others will react to it with more affection.  But it left me cold.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>This film opens in 1935 at a spectacular estate in the English countryside, takes us to the bloody beaches of Dunkirk, and then ends in a television studio sixty years later. The well-to-do Cecilia falls in love with Robbie, the son of the housekeeper. Thanks to Cecilia's father, Robbie attended Cambridge and has plans for medical school. Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, also had a crush on Robbie, so when she watches a scene at the estate fountain, reads a love note never meant for anyone's eyes, and interrupts an embrace in the library that would shock any thirteen-year-old, she reacts in fear. Briony tells a lie about a family tragedy, the consequences of which are catastrophic for everyone, especially for her own mind and soul. Briony spends her entire life seeking atonement, and at the end of the film we're not sure that she has convinced herself, much less the audience. Atonement earned seven Academy Award nominations.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Several years ago I read this book.  Loved it!<br /><br />I never thought it would adapt well to the screen though.  It seemed  too dreamy with too many scenes that might or just might not have happened.  I was wrong.  This film is as much a masterpiece as the book and was nominated for several Academy awards.  Perhaps it's because Ian McEwan, the author, who I consider to be a literary genius, had a role in adapting his book to the screen.  Perhaps it's because the details of the setting are so scrupulously adhered to.  And perhaps it's because the acting throughout is just so darn good.  Put together this film is an absolute gem.<br /><br />The film opens in an upscale house in the English countryside in 1935.  It seems an idyllic life, especially through the eyes of 13-year old Briony Tallis who is writing a play to be performed by her young cousins for the entertainment of her family.  Her older sister, Cecilia, is in love with Robbie, the son of the cook, who has been provided an education by her father and loves Cecilia in return.  But trouble ensues because of a misunderstanding based on the young Briony's active imagination.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1940.  England is now at War, Robbie has spent five years in jail and is now in the British army.  He and Cecilia are still in love and Briony is eighteen years old and a nurse in a British hospital.  The war is awful.  We see Robbie experiencing its horrors.  He is wounded and suffering as he waits nine days for evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk.  At this time, Briony has a change of heart, realizes that she has caused pain to her family because of her earlier lies, and seeks out her sister who she hasn't seen for the past few years.<br /><br />It is only later, after a lifetime, that we find out that this visit to her sister is not quite what it seemed.  This occurs when the elderly Briony gives up the secrets that bind this story together.  Wow!  What an impact!<br /><br />The setting and cinematography are exceptional and the acting is outstanding.  Kiera Knightly is cast as Cecilia and James Turner as Robbie. Briony is played by three different actors at different ages - Saaorise Ronan at 13, Ramola Garai at 18, and Vanessa Regrave as a the elderly woman.<br /><br />This is a fine, complex and nuanced film.  A sophisticated audience will love it.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>"Atonement" is a difficult film to review.  Portions of the film are truly outstanding and well worth note, while possibly a  greater number just do not live up to expectations.<br /><br />The tale begins in 1935, with a creative young Briony Tallis writing a play to be performed that evening on the return of her brother, Liam.  The sheltered young girl misinterprets a series of events and through her youth and arrogance gives false testimony against a young man, sending him to prison for 4 years for rape, and later to Dunkirk with the British Army as was commonly done as an early parole.<br /><br />The story focuses primarily on Briony's grief as she realizes that she's given false witness and what the real cost of this testimony brought to her family.<br /><br />The tale is told in a mix of flashbacks, flash forwards and a scene which literally moves backwards.  While the time shifts are interesting artistically, the sussurus of whispers from the audience of the show I attended indicated I wasn't the only one asking my seatmate, "Where the heck are we?"<br /><br />Much of the filming was stunning, but the music was far too heavy-handed and didn't at times enhance the scenes it played a role in.<br /><br />"Atonement" got bogged down in WWII in the telling of the tale.  While many of the battle scenes were very well done--were all of them necessary?  Much of that material made the film seem more like a war story than a character exposition.<br /><br />Briony Tallis failed to capture my sympathy or interest at 13, (Saoirse Ronan), 18 (Romola Garai), or 60-ish (Vanessa Redgrave).<br /><br />Cecelia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy) were the standout performance through the whole show.  Every action seemed to speak their passion for each other. Their sex scene in the library was not the most showy, but the subtlety of the actors' words, movements all bespoke a far deeper passion than they even showed.  And they never gave up hope--even while Robbie was at Dunkirk in one of the bloodiest battles in history and Cecelia was in blitz torn London, it seemed they still believed every day they would return to each other.<br /><br />The film was not quite worth matinee fare or coming out to get wet on a cold, rainy day.  What I probably will remember most from this production is the snafu when three women lost their umbrellas in the theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Guys -- if you sat through this with your wives or girlfriends (hopefully not both), they owe you TWO movies with exploding cars or Vin Diesel to "atone" for the experience!  Other random observations:<br /><br />James McAvoy must have a clone.  I think that one out of every three movies made nowadays stars McAvoy.  The guy must be the hardest working man in show business.  Has he figured out the cloning thing, because he seems ubiquitous.<br /><br />Cut the smoke!  If you watch Hollywood movies, you would surmise that 90% of the population smokes cigarettes.  What's up with that?  It's a lie.<br /><br />If you had not been briefed on the movie's plot, it might be very confusing.  Read up first.<br /><br />Say What?!  The velly British dialogue is hard to decipher at times.  I confess I switched on the English subtitles to help follow the dialogue.<br /><br />The movie is visually arresting.  I loved the scene on the beach evacuation (Dunkirk) when the soldiers were singing a hymn; also the later scene with Briony in the hospital wards with Debussy's "Claire de Lune" in the background.<br /><br />So writing a fictional piece is some kind of atonement for ruining the lives of the characters?  Oh please!  That is no "atonement" at all.  Writing some fanciful account of how these two lovers could have otherwise turned out does not expiate or atone for the lie perpetrated by Briony.<br /><br />That is why I view this as "Pseudo-Atonement."</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Atonement is a difficult movie on several levels. Emotionally, it's a tale of twisting logic and the power of simple words unleashed. It's a story of what ifs and if onlys. An epic full of longing and sorrow, passion and pain, Atonement is not a movie to watch to unwind after a taxing day full of drama, unless intense drama onscreen helps you unwind. Though the writing is tight and intriguing and the acting spot-on, the transitions from some scenes to others left me scratching my head. Several scenes are revisited with different points of view. I also struggled with following a couple of time line events for the same reason. One character ages from ten or eleven to eighteen but the  stated time frame is only five years unless I missed a heading telling the viewers of a time change.<br /><br />I will have to watch Atonement again because I'm not sure I fully appreciated the message of the film. Though Atonement is the title, I'm not sure how this played out throughout the storyline. When it's all said and done, I don't see it. I can't say anymore without a spoiler, so I won't.<br /><br />Atonement is not going to appeal to the majority of movie lovers. Historical fans may not find enough historical richness though there are plenty of shadows and hints of the times. War epic fans may not find enough though there are strong and poignant war moments. Those who want cookie cutter endings definitely are going to want to avoid it unless in a mood to cry. Fans of tragedy or human character and the study of why people do what they do may really find the most satisfaction.<br /><br />Sensitivity warning...the war scenes are peppered with the F-word, and a young man pens a note sharing what he'd like to do sexually with the woman he loves and one crude anatomical word is shown several times. Child endangerment and adult-child inappropriateness are an issue early in the movie. A couple are shown in a sexual embrace though much is hidden by clothes and lighting, an assault with a glimpse of nudity as well as a young woman in a white, wet dress add to the need for the R rating. Some war injuries are moderately intense as are the death of some horses.<br /><br />The acting is the major reason I'd suggest the film. Cinematography and writing would be the secondary reasons. Otherwise, if you are ambivalent, rent before you buy or skip altogether unless you like your stories to go really deep into the reality of cause and effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Child prodigy, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is very capable.  Using a typewriter in her family's stately English house, she is able to produce "stupendous" plays--as her mother says--while barely a teenager.<br /><br />Her great work, however, is based on an actual experience.  Seeing her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightly) from her window, she sees her undress in front of her suitor, Robbie (James McAvoy) in front of a fountain.  Astonished, she looks away from the window.  When she looks back up, Cecilia is drenched, having gone in the fountain.  The whole scene seems mischievous, filled with passion.  Shortly later, we see that scene played out again.  But this time we see it properly from the couple's point-of-view.  Robbie has become playful and careless.  He eventually knocks a vase out of Cecilia's hand which breaks on the stone rim of the fountain with a piece going into the water well.  Aware of its value as the family's most valuable keepsake, Cecilia strips of her clothing and dives into the fountain to retrieve the missing piece.<br /><br />One of the main elements of 'Atonement' is deception.  What a child sees can be misleading.  As I watched the film, I kept thinking of 'Witness' and how in real life people can take matters out of context.  One's view of an event can look very different from another`s.  Much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LXH0AE">Stranger Than Fiction</a> before it, the movie blends, then sorts out fiction from reality.<br /><br />Richly embellished in music that highlights the mood of every scene, and edited with such keen perfection as to be Oscar worthy,  ('No Country for Old Men' being the other big contender in my mind.') 'Atonement' has a standard of excellence that seldom falters for a moment.  The frenetic pace of the music, matched with the tapping of the typewriter, build up to some intangible suspense.  Where the story is going, no one has a clue.  Like many recent cinematic offerings, the movie starts to shuffle the time frames.  Mainly it goes forward, but sometimes it backs up to show us a new piece of evidence.  Although different in impact, the life changing incidents reminded me of the shuffling done in the recent film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112S8S2">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead [Blu-ray</a>].<br /><br />From there Robbie's and Cecilia's lives are disrupted.  Starting in 1935, the couple must later face the debacle of the Second Great War.  What is so special about `Atonement' is the way it plays out the contrast between the fate that we all must face (in this case war), and the consequential choices that make or mar people's lives.  While the ending isn't entirely neat and tidy, the resolution has a sweeping resonance that hardly teases the audience.<br /><br />Besides yeoman craftsmanship by director,  Joe Wright, and editor, Paul Tothill, 'Atonement' brings upper echelon performances to the screen.  Christopher Hampton's screenplay adaptation (from a novel by Ian McEwan) is solid and  keeps the emotional tension.  'Atonement' may not be as strong as last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJFY">Notes on a Scandal</a>, but it is a compelling piece of work, nevertheless.  With all of its assets, this film may indeed bring a day of reckoning when it gets closer to the annual awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>In May 2008 I went travelling on my own for a month taking in Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. With ten flights in all and lots of waiting at the airports I armed myself with five novels for the journey but by the time I reached Sydney I'd finished them all! I needed further reading so bought Ian McEwan's Atonement and was so engrossed it became only the third novel I have read in a single day - the others being Clive Barker's The Thief of Always and Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Being a novel I loved so much after the first read I approached Joe Wright's 2007 film adaptation with both hope and anxiety.<br /><br />The film focuses on three principal characters - Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) - during different periods in their lives. At the outset Briony is thirteen, an aspiring writer with a rich imagination. Her older sister Cecilia has completed her education as has Robbie Turner, the son of the family's housekeeper who has been financed through his education by Briony and Cecilia's father. During the summer in 1935 Briony witnesses an encounter between Cecilia and Robbie by the fountain, one of sexual tension and developing feelings, but one the girl interprets as Robbie being something of a sexual predator. Further incidents that day are also misunderstood by Briony and culminate in her accusing Robbie of a crime he has not committed. So convincing is Briony that only Cecilia and Robbie's mother believe she is lying but it doesn't stop Robbie being sent to prison. The film then switches to 1939 where Robbie has been released from prison in exchange for his service in the Second World War where he is shipped to France. Cecilia has now chosen to abandon her family out of loyalty to Robbie and has become a nurse in London. Eighteen year old Briony (Romola Garai) is also training to be a nurse and contacts Cecilia to inform her that she now realises her mistake and wants to put things right.<br /><br />Ian McEwan's novel is a masterpiece and was always ideal for a film adaptation but only if it was done right. Joe Wright has thankfully got most things right but unfortunately not all. First and foremost is the casting of the three main characters. We have three actresses playing Briony at different stages of her life and all were very good, particularly Saoirse Ronan. The film's problem for me came with the casting of Keira Knightley as Cecilia. Knightley has often been called wooden in the past and I felt she just wasn't right for the role of Cecilia. I didn't get the same emotional depth and complexity of the character of Cecilia as the book conveys. I feared such a blemish could have dragged the film down badly but thankfully Joe Wright cast James McAvoy as Robbie and here is the high point of Atonement. McAvoy brilliantly captures the changing character of Robbie beginning as the educated but dutiful inferior to the Tallis family before we see him physically and mentally destroyed by his service in the Second World War. McAvoy has come a long way since his days in Shameless and I think it's crucial that he gets a lot of screen time in Atonement particularly when showing us his time as a soldier.<br /><br />Wright has captured many of the elements of the novel well here. The idyllic rural home of the Tallis family is colourful and sumptuous, contrasting brilliantly with the ravaged and war torn France where Robbie witnesses some horrific events before leading the last of his comrades to Dunkirk. The soldiers' arrival at the beach sees the camera hover over the soldier's heads as they negotiate long grass before we are given a terrific panoramic shot of Dunkirk, overcrowded with soldiers waiting desperately for ships to evacuate them. We don't see any conflict in Atonement but the reality of war is vivid enough just watching the soldiers wait at Dunkirk, sitting targets for the Germans. Back in London Cecilia has already been hardened by her duty as a nurse while she waits for news of Robbie. Briony, who has opted not to go to Cambridge, is learning of the horrors of war as she tends to the wounded and visibly feels torn apart by guilt at the fate she has sentenced Robbie to, who prior to his arrest has aspirations of continuing his education and being a doctor, a path that would surely have kept him out of the army.<br /><br />Watching Atonement and finding much to appreciate but other areas quite weak I waited with trepidation for the moment when Briony, Cecilia and Robbie are reunited for the first time since Robbie's arrest. This is such a crucial part in the book that it had to be done right in celluloid. With McAvoy having proved himself up to this point it didn't surprise me when he excelled during this exchange, telling Briony exactly what he thinks of her while Cecilia looks on with no pity for her sister who has destroyed so many lives. The shocking twist in the novel hits just as hard in the film as an elderly Briony looks back on her life. When I first finished the novel I was full of anger at the character of Briony and the question at the end is has she atoned for the past? I felt the same anger watching the film which proves what a good job the actresses that played Briony did. Knightley's performance is the film's major disappointment but everything else is faithful to the book with McAvoy the undoubted star of the show.<br /><br />An adaption of Atonement could easily have been done badly and although Joe Wright's film isn't perfect it has captured the essence of Ian McEwan's masterpiece. Both are worth the experience but if I had to choose between the two I would opt to read the novel. However, if you're looking for a good drama then head for Atonement but do have those hankies on standby.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>A bright and observant young girl, 13 year-old Briony Tallis, sees and puts together events that have escaped the notice of her elders.  Unfortunately, however, young Briony makes the fatal mistake of misconstruing events and accusing her older sister's well-meaning boyfriend of a horrible crime!  Adding to the drama of these events is England's brave fight against the Nazis in the early days of World War II, and the differences of class that complicate the tragic romance of Briony's sister and the maligned boyfriend who is also the son of one of the servants of the aristocratic Tallis family.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Warning!  Minor spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I'm going to attempt a relatively spoiler free review.  There are numerous minor and a couple of major twists in the film and I believe potential viewers would be best served by seeing this as ignorant as possible of what transpires.  I have not read Ian McEwan's novel (in fact, I very much regret that I have never read any of his novels, though he has long been on my "List," the ever-expanding titles of books that I intend to read at some point), so I can't say how closely the film does or does not hew to the book.<br /><br />This is not as a whole a great film, but it unquestionably has many extraordinary moments.  It certainly is a very ambitious film and while it doesn't always succeed in its ambitions, it does often enough to make seeing it an unforgettable experience.  The film begins very, very slowly and twenty-five minutes into it I found myself almost completely uninterested in what was happening.  There was also some confusion about precisely who various characters were.  This does gradually get straightened out and after the first half hour the film definitely picks up dramatically in pace.<br /><br />From beginning to end I had trouble with the erratic placement of scenes within the narrative.  We often see scenes acted out twice in a row from different perspectives.  Once we jump back several years with little context provided.  I'm sure this is meant to be very cinematic, but the decision not to be linear in the narrative is sometimes confusing, and I'm not sure that there is a huge pay off.  This, however, along with the slowness at the beginning of the film, are about the only negatives I have with the film.<br /><br />The positives for the film are numerous and significant.  This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.  From beginning to end every scene looks perfect.  Occasionally the beauty seems an end unto itself.  Take the astonishing long scene shot on what is supposed to be the Dunkirk beach.  This is a very long shot apparently done in a single shot that is absolutely epic in scope.  I'm pretty certain that it was not, in fact, done in a single take.  There were probably a couple of wipes that allowed them to splice different takes.  My reason for saying this is that the scene was just too complex and gargantuan for anyone to have accomplished it in a single take.  The very long take that begins Orson Welles's A TOUCH OF EVIL was under far more controlled and simple circumstances.  The final minutes of Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was complex, but it also featured a couple of cuts.  There is a very long single-shot scene in Joss Whedon's SERENITY, but that scene is simplicity itself compared to the Dunkirk shot.  But here is my question:  does the Dunkirk scene, as glorious as it was, really achieve anything narratively?  It is just this gorgeous piece of bric-a-brac stuck in the middle of the film.  Mind you, I'm delighted that they put it in there.  It was a fascinating scene to watch.  But I'm not sure that it made ATONEMENT a better movie.  Contrast this with the very long single-shot scene from the end of CHILDREN OF MEN or the even longer car chase scene earlier in the same film, both of which made the movie much better and contributed to the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />The acting is marvelous and it could signal Keira Knightley moving to more adult roles and the beginning of a star career for James McAvoy.  I also loved many among the supporting cast.  All three of the actors playing Briony at various ages -- Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave -- were amazing.  But of the three, Ronan was perhaps the most astonishing.  I was not aware until afterward that she had received an Oscar nomination for her role as the 13-year-old Briony, but it was richly deserved.  I also learned that she is going to be starring in the Peter Jackson film THE LOVELY BONES as the young murdered girl who narrates the story (no spoiler there -- you learn it at the outset), which has tremendously increased my interest in the film.  And everyone in all the other supporting roles was equally as excellent.  My only regret was that Brenda Blethyn, who has to go on any short list of the world's greatest actors, had such a small role.<br /><br />All in all, while the film began very slowly and I think had some questionable issues surrounding narrative structure was all in all a remarkably good film.  If I were a member of the Academy it wouldn't get my vote for Best Picture, but it certainly has my respect.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>From time to time,we can enjoy certain films like this, where the the state of art may be felt since the first shot.

In many respects the film "Atonement" is about both these definitions and how they can define a life. When pre-teen Briony (Saoirse Ronan in a spectacular performance) a budding writer catches Robbie (James McAvoy) the bright, young groundskeeper and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley)having sex in the study she pieces this along with other things she has seen to create a "story" for the police when a crime is committed that rips the two lovers apart.<br /><br />Older and wiser Briony (Romola Garai)tries to make amends and repair her relationship with Cecilia (now a nurse)and Robbie (who is now being sent overseas to fight) as best she can during WWII but finds the road to forgiveness difficult and painful.<br /><br />Screenwriter Christopher Hampton (the scripts for "The Quiet American" and "Dangerous Liaisons") captures the essence of the novel capturing the spirit as well something that is rare for film adaptations from a popular novel. Director Joe Wright ("Pride and Prejudice") is no stranger to the peril of translating a novel to film does a marvelous job of making "Atonement" cinematic in every respect. You'd be forgiven for the mistaken belief that this isn't adapted from another medium.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: "Atonement" looks marvelous in its DVD incarnation with colors that perfectly capture both the pre-War bright colors of the film and the somber tones of London and France during WWII. Detail is sharp and a very nice, smooth film-like quality to the DVD.<br /><br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES:<br />We get a solid batch of special features with "Atonement". The best special feature, however, is director Joe Wright's commentary track which provides intricate detail about the challenges of shooting the film--particularly the amazing tracking shot on the beach of Dunkirk which only took three takes (amazingly) to perfect. It's a good thing, too, since it was shot using Steadicam requiring the camera operator to lug the camera up and down the beach. It's a brilliant sequence easily as cinematic as anything that the Coens or Ridley Scott dreamed up for their big films from last year "No Country for Old Men" and "American Gangster".<br /><br />We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Wright, a solid featurette on the making of the film. The "Novel to the Screen" featurette is pretty interesting as well detailing the challenges of translating the written word to a visual medium without losing the very qualities that made the novel so memorable.<br /><br />The one flaw the film has is that it runs a bit too long and could have been trimmed without losing the dramatic power of the film. That observation is purely subjective however as some people will probably love the film just the way it is.<br /><br />Largely overlooked by Oscar this year, "Atonement" may be a bit stuffy and more conventional on the surface in a Masterpiece Theater way when compared to "No Country for Old Men", "There Will Be Blood" or the experimental "I'm Not There" but that surface is as deceptive as Briony's story. Director Wright and screenwriter Hampton's sly, slick slight of hand in telling this tragic love story is easily as adept as any of those other films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>Interesting enough, two of the critically acclaimed films that have come out this Christmas season center around a confused child's dastardly influence on his/her small environment--in a locale that is beleaguered by war.  While in "The Kite Runner," twelve year old aspiring storyteller Amir deliberately lies to assuage his guilt regarding his reaction to a tragedy that befalls his best friend in pre-Soviet invaded Afghanastan, thirteen-year-old budding writer, Briony of director Joe Wright's Atonement completely misinterprets a flirtation she witnesses between her older sister--the willowy Cecilia (Keira Knightly) and the Cambridge educated son of the housekeeper, Robbie (James McAvoy) in pre WWII Britain and unthinkingly sets off a series of events that result in a crime that ruins all three lives.  Both of these creatively imaginative children in their search for attention destroy their likelihood for a healthy existence; only through the act of repentance does either of them get the opportunity to make the necessary amends.  Luckily Amir's second chance comes in the form of an actual person that he proactively influences.<br /><br />In Briony's case, the issues are further complicated by outside stimuli that put her eventual accountability in the realm if the moot point.  Only at the end of the film does director Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton brilliantly detail for us in a scene played to perfection by the incomparable Vanessa Redgrave as the 2000 Briony, the utterly abysmal chain of events that she had no power to control.  Even the literary force of her imagination can wield little strength in the face of such devastating reality.  Her happy ending fades to a mere contrivance when compared to Amir's flesh and blood resolution.<br /><br />From the get-go we are mesmerized by the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter's keys hammering their petulantly persistent staccato rhythm, reminding us that we are en masse to hear a story unfold--we do not know who is telling the story or if we are about to witness a story within a story--we know only that the story continues from an idyllic 1935 peek at privileged manor life to the hospital wards of war-torn London and evacuation of Dunkirk to a modern day taping of an interview in a television studio.  Wherever we hear that keyboard tapping we follow like bloodhounds on a scent to whatever end  the story will eventually bring us.<br /><br />The startling and contrasting cinematography for "Atonement" either glows with the warmth of summer or cremates the sky and surroundings with the actual ashes of war.  The actors filter in and out like silent film stars--the first few dramatic minutes are marked by non-verbal glimmers of each personality:  Briony marches from one wood-paneled hallway to a raft of flower-sprigged bedrooms.  She parades to the music of the typewriter key as the outraged child and again as the young haunted nurse patrolling the hospital ward.  Siren Cecilia moves her angular body engulfed in diaphanous green silk or creamily lapeled dressing gowns with the assuredness of Bette Davis.  Even in the starched uniform of a hospital sister she appears in charge and in affected need of a cigarette holder.  Poor but sensual blue-eyed Robbie floats through the estate's fields like the appreciative optimistic beneficiary he is and later blank-eyed like a desanguinated ghost, he flits through the macabre carnival-like atmosphere of chaotic Dunkirk beach like a lost child.  Regardless of the film's halcyon-day beauty and stark ugliness, the production seems at times to lack cohesiveness. As much as I like actor McAvoy, his rambling about in war-torn France while suggesting his character's diverted life course, seemed wasted as if the filmmakers too were distracted by their own craft rather than connect us more intricately to the story and sobering themes snowballing around us.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Like many period pieces "Atonement" fascinates by depicting a sliver of life from a time long gone.  As an adaptation of a finalist for the Booker Prize, it is difficult to convert the language and mood of the book to the screen.  Director Wright nearly gets it right in the first half, depicting a misunderstood act of carnal courtship as a topnotch episode of the Masterpiece Theatre genre.  His camera work impresses; the manner in which he repeats key events from the perspective of the child and the adults spectacularly superimposes that vantage point and sensibility in the mind's eye of the viewer. Nonetheless, he fails later on with too much ado about war, falling prey to too much costuming and epic scenes that detract from the original McEwan theme of the imagined atoning for life.  Particularly enjoy actor Jame McAvoy whose splendid sensitivity and versatility is showcased in almost every scene he is in.  Recommended with this caveat.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I started the book quite a while ago and dropped it after about the first third, mostly because I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  Full disclosure;  I listened on the audio version, usually while driving so it's possible that if I had read the actual "book" I might have enjoyed it more.  I think that part of my problem was the class thing--the characters seemed so snobby and over-privileged, especially the two sisters, that I had a hard time caring about them.<br /><br />So, in my case anyway, the film overcame that problem instantly by its gorgeous visuals.  From the first scene of the abundant greenery surrounding the huge country  home, I was taken in.  Then the casting---the stunning Keira Knightly and the hunky-but-sensitive James McAvoy--overcame any resistance I'd had to these characters.<br /><br />Of course the theme of the story is atonement and we are given a fascinating tale of how the words of a 13 year old girl lead to the destruction of the two people she most loves.  It's interesting to read the reviews of the film, here, and also of the book, to analyze Briony, the 13 year old.  Many reviewers see her as an evil child who deliberately lied about the crime due to her spurned crush on Robbie.  A few see Briony in a more charitable light--that of a spoiled and neglected younger child who lives in the world of her imagination so strongly that she may not realize her own mistake.  Some see her action as trying to protect Cecilia from Robbie, who, by that point, has become a monster in her eyes.<br /><br />What I see as a weakness in the film is the lack of the family background which would present Briony's action in a more understandable way.  Reviews of the book are more charitable to Briony than the film reviewers because of this lack of information, I think.  The book tells us that this is highly dysfunctional family; the father is frequently away with his mistress, leaving the mother suffering from incapacitating migraines.  Her consolation seems to lie in her children and she spoils the young Briony giving her delusions of grandeur for her literary ability.  The father has taken a liking to Robbie, the son of the servant, because he has motivation for academic success that his own son, Leon, lacks.  When Robbie outperforms Leon at University, this is a cause for the mother to dislike him, which lays the groundwork for the ensuing tragedy.  The alleged victim of the crime keeps still and allows an innocent man to go to prison, as does the real perpetrator.  The class system, itself, undoubtably plays a part in the injustice.  In my mind, there is plenty of blame to go around.<br /><br />There is a question of whether Briony deliberately and knowingly lied or if she was a victim of her own innocence,need for approval and genuine shock at the sexual scenario and honestly misunderstood what happened. As another reviewer of the book wrote, even Cecilia could have done more to discover the truth by questioning Briony and Lola, but she,too,was stuck in her own misperceptions.<br /><br />The book, too, gives more of the background of Lola, who is suffering from the fact that her parents are being divorced.  This makes her more than a willing party to the sexual advances of the chocolate king which are later interpreted as a crime. Indeed she later marries him.  The book gives such a thorough background of the whole family that it is an accident waiting to happen.  And on the hottest day of the summer, it does.<br /><br />The film, however, treats this as Briony's crime and we follow her as she matures and gradually realizes the seriousness of the consequences of her action.  We are given some graphic views of the war, which some people think are not necessary to the story.  My feeling is that in seeing the depth of Robbie's suffering, we feel the tragedy that this lie has brought about.<br />Perhaps another screenwriter might have given us more of the psychological background of the family and less of the sheer physical horror of war and this might have made for a more satisfying story...who knows?<br /><br />The ending is problemmatic for many viewers, as well as for the readers of the book.  As I watched the film, I bought into the idea of the elder Briony atoning for her "crime" as well as she could by re-writing the story of Robbie and Cecilia, giving them, as an act of "kindness, the time together that they deserved. One can speculate on the nature of art and the role of the writer in portraying reality but I won't bother here.<br /><br />I did feel that this ending was satisfying in an intellectual way but that it was thin soup emotionally.  The huge suffering that we saw built up a huge expectation of something equally great to wind up the story and this little performance by the elder writer in a tv interview really didn't do it for me.<br /><br />In sum, this is a wonderful film and certainly worth seeing.  Whether it completely works is my question, but it certainly brings up some fascinating and important questions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>While some might balk at my title and dismiss it, it's a good a descriptor of the film as any that's not necessarily criticising though I wasn't the biggest fan of it either. It's not that I'm against films geared more towards the better half but I usually find those films unbelievably melodramatic and even at times manipulative that it's as if the film wants to do anything it can to make you walk out in tears, saying how amazing the film was. Director Joe Wright's last film, Pride and Prejudice, is similar but here it's better handled but it's still not as great as it was made to be.<br /><br />It's 1935 and Cecilia is living in the beautiful countryside with her family during summer vacation awaiting the arrival of her brother. Sister Briony is a precocious and aspiring writer who's just finished her latest play she wants to put on for the arrival. But witnessing Cecilia and love Robbie as well as reading a letter, Briony feels dejected since she too feels something for Robbie so when she finds a terrible event happening at night, she blames Robbie. 5 years later and choosing World War II rather than prison, Briony tries to make amends and bring together the 2 she helped separate.<br /><br />Every Oscars there's usually that one film that was well-received by critics and ends up being nominated for Best Picture even though there's probably no chance that it'll win the top prize. Atonement is to me the same type of film since others released last year were better but getting a nod meant lots of attention would be paid towards it. While it is well directed and written, there's nothing really about it that makes it better than any film released last year so it brings unfair judgments. The first half is flawless in its pace and story but then the war stuff comes, we get a time jump and it's either too sluggish or it's too surface-level and not enough depth.<br /><br />What most people remember about the film is a huge tracking shot halfway in that shows thousands of extras, a huge set complete with a choir, ferris wheel and the like. While it's certainly a long, complicated and impressive shot, there's something too "look what we can do" about it that makes it more showing off rather than Children of Men which used it to actually tell the story at the same time. But the film, with its gorgeous cinematography and unique Academy award winning score (which I felt was given mainly for its inventive use of a typewriter clacking than it being the best score) doesn't really excel at doing romance perfectly.<br /><br />Acting-wise everyone is solid with Keira Knightley still taking on projects to prove she can act, James Mcavoy showing he can have a bright future but the standout is Saoirse Ronan playing young Briony showing a naivety-yet-intelligence without being one of those know-it-all brats you wish someone would slap. My one knock with the Briony character is that with her 2 elder counterparts, played by Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, they give her the same haircut and it feels like they didn't trust the actresses enough to do the different parts so they just made them have the same hair as if haircuts and old age ended up giving the same results anyway. Small complaint but still.<br /><br />I would recommend the film to women definately while for the guys I would for those who don't mind the melodramaticness of the story. While I consider Diving Bell and the Butterfly better than this, it was at least a solid film anyway, just not exceptional.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The first part of this film is gorgeous. Its a great opening to an intriguing story. The characters really appeal to you, the acting is incredible, the imagery, lush and realistic. But then, it all falls apart. The middle and especially the end parts all feel disjointed, almost as if they were an entirely different film. Now, I love romantic, tragic dramas and was really excited to see it. But I must say, I left feeling dissapointed. I am not saying I was looking for a happy ending, or a grand conclusion, however, I was looking for a solid gut-wrenching, awful-in-a-good-way type of ending. And after it ended, I just didn't feel anything. I truly felt nothing for any of the characters after everything was said and done. I am giving this film 3 stars however, because I really loved the first part of the film, and the musical score is actually outstanding. Its one of the most beautiful scores in any film. Too bad the movie didn't really match it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>...I was just about to pop it in the DVD player when I looked at it and realized that I had already seen it a few weeks before but had completely forgotten it.  Perhaps I am getting old, but this rarely happens to me with the films I like - I can usually remember almost all the details of films that I liked, for years.  That wa a clear sign to me - as I fought to recall the details - that this was a rather unmemorable film, to say the least.<br /><br />It is one of those story-within-a-story mixtures of fact and fiction (entirely fiction, of course), when things are not quite what they seem.  You have an extraordinary youth who regrets a momentary action that impacted many lives, in a sense an original sin that has shaped decisively her life, let alone that of the people she impacted.  There are many beautiful things about the film, but it did not become the kind of interior journey that makes certain films kind of archetypal symbols that enter my imagination.  This one clearly did not.<br /><br />REcommended.  The acting is pretty good, the story is OK, and the production lush.  It just isn't great, in my view.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>Gorgeous photography, but the story really drags.  Let's face it - this is a women's movie.  Huge amounts of time wasted on sisterhood themes - jealousies and snooping and deception between Cecelia and Brioni.  Robbie just exudes sensitivity - he goes to war and doesn't seem to fight at all - he just sniffles and cries and longs for Cecelia.  Particularly annoying is time-shifting, which seems to be in vogue today.  The story jumps back and forth for no particular purpose and sometimes events are changed.  Confusing affectation.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Now and again British cinema gets overestimated and this is one of those sad events. It maybe that the pairing of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley does showcase some serious talent but it is still a far cry from the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet type publicity it got.<br /><br />We will be hard pressed to find such an original script that attempts romance, sexual deviance, war time shock surgery and delusions but after seeing it on the screen one can't help but feel that such concoctions end up mixing like coke and Alka-Seltzer, fizzing instead of sparkling, the acting is on par as is the lush cinematography, but direction and story leave pollution where sweetness should have been. We don't mind sad stories, but aberrations like this make storytelling pointless and blunt. Very dissatisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Atonement is Masterpiece Theater at the Cineplex.  Its virtues are excellent acting and cinematography, a classic British country house, perfect period pieces -- check out, for example, the Guinness ad on a pre-WWII bus --, a scene of absurdity and chaos as the British are evacuated from Dunkirk, and -- most of all -- superb source material, Ian McEwen's novel of the same name.  Briony is a smart and creative 13 year old who does not know or understand all she thinks she does.  When her creativity embroiders an incident she does not understand, personal calamities ensue, not least -- as Vanessa Redgrave's wonderful portrayal of Briony decades later near the end of her life makes clear -- to the girl herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film labors at times.  Even conceding that they must portray those stiff British upper lips, class divisions and all that, the lovers, Keira Knightly and James McAvoy, lack chemistry.  A laggard pace and awful sound track that is loudly obtrusive at all the wrong moments also mar the movie.  This makes Atonement a good, not great, film that retains the capacity to suggest just how great McEwen's novel is.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Briony, a 13 year old girl, was in love with her family's servant Robbie before she makes a false statement against him accusing him of rape of her friend, after she finds out he and her older sister Cee are in love.

She stays in touch with Robbie over letters, hoping he will return to her safely from war one day and live with her happy ever after. Briony feels guilty and tries to contact her sister to apologize and confess her mistake.<br /><br />Robbie dies before he was scheduled to return home. Her sister dies in a tunnel she was hiding that got destroyed during the war. Briony feels immensely guilty because she feels that she was the one that prevented their deserved love. She then decides to write a book to tell everyone the truth about her sister and Robbie, confess her lie, and give them an imagined happy ending. The book is called "Atonement".<br /><br />Excellent story! Great acting! Wonderful sound track!<br /><br />This movie made me think, most people think love should result in goodness and happiness, but couldn't it also produce hatred and pain. Is that why they say "Love Hurts"? Briony's early love of Robbie made him and her sister suffer and live miserably till they died. Isn't that many times the case?</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's "Gangs of New York" in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy.<br /><br />The first hour of Atonement is interminably long. The viewer soon discovers there's very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale. In a nutshell, Briony, a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with Robbie, the housekeeper's son, who lives on their estate. Briony is the Brit version of the 'Bad Seed' but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality (oh my, upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeeper's son having sex in the library!!!). Speaking of that library scene, do you really believe that Cecilia and Robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them? And what about the crude note Robbie gives to Briony to give to her sister? If he loved her so much, why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to Briony (who he could have easily guessed would have looked at it?).<br /><br />Worse than these plot contrivances, is the accusation of rape that lands Robbie in jail. Notice how Cecilia hardly sticks up for Robbie at all as he's hauled away by the police. Wouldn't she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family? The 'investigation' into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen. In real life, many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued. There's none of that here since 'Atonement' must fit the classic melodramatic mold--an innocent lover (victim Robbie) is broken by Bad Seed victimizer (Briony). At least there is an antagonist--for awhile--but Briony then disappears until the end of the movie, only to reappear (in the imagination) of a now elderly Briony who is working on her "21st" and "last" novel. The now reinvented Briony is a nurse (who opts not to go to Cambridge) and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the War effort. And the elderly Briony somehow 'atones' for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement: the 18 year old Briony apologizes to Robbie and allows the star-crossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore (this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by Briony the novelist that Robbie died at Dunkirk and her sister was killed during the Blitz).<br /><br />Atonement gets high marks for atmosphere and mood. It has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters. The characters here are one-dimensional in that the upper-class Brits are petty despots (the children reflect the parents' hostility) and the working class are hapless victims (exemplified by Robbie and his mother). Atonement becomes another movie in the second half and overall sports two antagonists. The Bad Seed is replaced by the horrors of war. 'Atonement' is an empty vessel. Don't be fooled by all the 'bells and whistles.'</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>Despite the critical accolades and awards, I found this movie very disappointing. Based on a novel by Ian McEwan, and directed by Joe Wright (who had filmed the latest movie version of Pride and Prejudice, much inferior to the BBC miniseries), the bulk of the movie occurs in a British country house during one day in the mid 1930s, in which a crime might have happened of might have just been the figment of the imagination of a fevered child. The main characters will feel for years the consequences of what happened that day. Since I'm totally uninterested on the life of England's upper classes, I was quite bored during a lot of the movie. And as if that wasn't enough, the final twist of the movie (in which Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo role) is totally insulting, and makes the viewer feels cheated. The engaging presence of Keira Knightley and newcomer Saoirse Ronan are among the movie's few virtues. On the other hand, the much praised scene set during the evacuation at Dunkirq is very show-offy in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>When Vanessa Redgrave shows up late in the film as the senior Briony, things get interesting because she's a fine actress who captures emotion well.  The younger version of Briony, played by Saiorse Ronan, is also quite watchable.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of the film.<br />I couldn't feel anything for the other characters, who are by turns obnoxious, mean, or just plain stupid.  Robbie in particular is an idiot--he writes a disgusting fantasy note, forgets that it's the wrong one, and lets it be delivered to the object of his desire.  Despite the obscenity of it, she likes it.  Please--give me a break.<br />It wasn't much fun to have to spend nearly two hours with such people.<br />Another problem is that McEvoy and Knightley have no chemistry.  I never detected a hint of passion between them.<br />Yet another flaw in the film lies in the unnecessary semi-flashbacks.  This narrative device works in some films but not so much in this one.  All it does here is slow things down, then stop and restart them for no good reason.<br />This did not deserve a Best Picture nomination.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>The Oscar nominations are getting worse and worse every year.

Director Joe Wright proves here that Pride and Prejudice was no fluke as Atonement is well crafted, superbly photographed and with an intelligent script makes this film a total success and triumph. Beginning in the summer of 1935 in an English Manor we are introduced to Briony, a precocious and over imaginative young writer. The film starts as she tries to understand the relationship between her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) and the housekeeper's son Robby (McEvoy). After a horrendous attack on their cousin, Briony's innocence, naivety and jealously leads her to put the blame on Robby who is immediately taken away to jail.  Cut to 1940 and Robby, who got the chance to join the army, is now an evacuee in Dunkirk. Cecilia is a nurse in London as is Briony. What follows is Briony trying to come to terms with what she has done and trying to make peace with her sister. From the lush Countryside to the bleakness of the beaches of Dunkirk the photography is spellbinding. The direction is first rate with a stunning tracking shot of Dunkirk. Also the music and the use of the sound from the keys of the typewriter are used to perfect effect. The performances are first rate, notably Saoirse Ronan who plays the young Briony.  While the film does lull a bit during the middle, the performances carry the viewer through it.  A hugely enjoyable period/war drama, that's as ambitious as it is compassionate. A stunning achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Atonement is a exquisite work of a film. Both lush and heartbreaking, it just sweeps you off your feet into this movie going experience that you rarely experience now a days, completly wrapping you in its spell that has you transfixed through out the entire film, from its tone setting beginning to its heart wrenching finale.<br /><br />On a particularily hot day in the English summer of 1935, young Briony Tallis witnesses a moment of sexual tension between her older sister, Cecily, and their housekeepers son Robbie. Far to young to understand the meaning of this event, she initially takes it as something negative and believes Robbie intends to harm her sister. So one night, she draws from her sexual naivete and childish ways to accuse Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Because of this small understanding and act of betrayel, Briony unwittingly sets into motion a series events that will ultimatly change the lives of her sister, Robbie, even herself for years to come.<br /><br />Technically wise, the film just exceeds beyond what you have seen on film. The cinamatography and art direction are just flat out stunning. Everything just seems to radiate this ethereal and richly refined look in almost every single frame, from the warm pastels of the hot English country side to the cold, grim gray's of WWII, its almost as if you are viewing a work of moving art or better yet, your actually seeing the texts from the book just come alive on screen, which in my opinion is a very difficult feat to achive with a book of such intrisant detail and depth. It baffled me that the film did not win in those awards at the Oscars, which I felt they rightfully deserved.<br /><br />All the acting is just phenomenal. Both Keira Knightly and James McAvoy are just fantastic as the star crossed lovers (and both shamefully snubbed by Oscar) and each three incarnations of Briony are all seemless. Saoirse Ronan shows off such a poise and grace that far succeds her teenage years as the young Briony, Romola Garai exudes a sense of remorse you can almost feel the weight of her actions on your shoulders, and finally, Venessa Redgrave tops it off in a devistating performance in just under seven minutes, all the sadness of her actions expressed in her eyes.<br /><br />Christopher Hampton does an excellent job on the screenplay, adapting from such a complex and deep book that can rarely ever be done. And Joe Wright just excels in the directors chair (especially with the now famous Dunkirk scene) turning what could have easily been another sappy love story into something far more complex, from acts of betrayle, effects of war, and the sheer fantasy of ones mind. The music score is just so unique the way the composer uses the sound of clacking typewriters, as if the events going on in the film are being written at that exact moment in Briony's mind. What I also love about the film is the way the characters speak and act, with the whole naturalistic manner you saw way back in the 1930's where the words were given very promptly and in a very direct speech, its like an almost modernized version of all those old classic films, which will definently appeal to an older audience. Now, on that note, some people may be turned off by the whole speech thing (since a lot of people nowadays are not used to that sort of dialect) but its really not that big of a deal and after a few minutes, it is not a such a big deal.<br /><br />Beautifully acted, masterfully shot, and experatly scored, Atonement is a movie going experience that should be seen by all, one that will follow you days after the final, haunting shot.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS.<br /><br />There is little I can add to the myriad critics and viewers who have seen this beautifully rendered work of art from the novel by Ian McEwan.  But I want to point to the commanding performance by Vanessa Redgrave at the end in which she tells us what has happened.  She absolutely commands the screen and engages us in such a direct way that we are enthralled and touched.  From an artistic point of view it is interesting that the words she speaks need no embellishment or any acting out.  There are so perfect and her delivery is beyond professional.  It is lived, as is the case with all great acting.<br /><br />I also was very much taken with the performance of Romola Garai who played Briony at 18.  Her face conveyed more than words can tell.  She felt so deeply not just her character's great sin, but the tragedy of the war and the dying she saw all around her and the sense that she could not be forgiven.  Saoirse Ronan, who played Briony as a girl had a hard edge, almost an evil edge to her that was perfect for the part, a kind of "bad seed" depiction with her washed out face and small self-importance and her inability to not just understand what she saw and experienced, but her inability to understand herself and to love instead of desiring only to be loved.<br /><br />The way the story is presented with scenes out of chronological order but in psychological and emotional order was most effective.  I was especially impressed with the idea of showing us the scene where Briony pretends to drown and is saved by Robbie after the fact of the great lie she tells.  As presented we immediately understand why she lied.  His anger and failure to understand her childish love for him perhaps worked like the Achilles heel of his character.  Had he been able to love her as one might love a child and help her to understand that he could not love her otherwise, everything might have been different.  Or perhaps not.  In a sense hers was an act of atonement, although not in a positive sense.<br /><br />The epic scenes of the beginning of World War II with the British in retreat and all the bloodshed and waste of war magnified and accentuated, especially the scene with Briony and the dying French soldier Luc, made us understand how precious life was for those who witnessed this while serving as a dramatic and psychological foil for the love and life that Cecilia and Robbie could not experience.<br /><br />I also like the economy with which the essential details of the story were presented.  We see the dramatic scenes and then we understand with just a few words or even a look what actually happened.  For example when Briony as a nurse attends the wedding of Lola and Paul and as the bride and groom walk away we see the shame in their faces, the same shame that Briony feels, only they are not going to own up to it, we know.  And then there is the quick flashback to the scene that Briony as a girl had witnessed and this time her mind allows her to see the man's face.  And then a bit later on in the scene that the author inside the author (Briony) makes up, we understand that there will be no revelation of the truth because a spouse cannot testify against a spouse, or at least in this case would not.<br /><br />And then there is the brilliant ending with Vanessa Redgrave summing it up and tying it all together--but more than that, showing us how Briony grew as she went from childhood to old age.  In fact the emotional and human transformation that takes place in Briony's character is perhaps the central point of the story.  I haven't read the novel by Ian McEwan but I am familiar with his work and know he must have been responsible for such a psychologically compelling development and ending--although it is obvious that the script by Christopher Hampton and the direction by Joe Wright are more than first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>A relatively uneventful and unrewarding and pointless film with little romance, and not even any battle scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>2.5 Stars. This is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully filmed and acted, but at the same time it hops around so much in POVs and time sequences that you lose your way - and interest. What's really going on and what is purely imagined? Even though this is integral to the story itself, the final payoff -- which you may find yourself tapping your toe awaiting -- is more, "Are you kidding me?" than "Wow!" American audiences may also find these emotionally straightjacketed Brits so intolerable that you'll want to scream, "Jesus Christ -- just tell her you love her already and kiss her!" Then there's the assortment of accents, some of which are so thick and mumbled I had to turn on the closed captions in order to understand them.<br /><br />'The English Patient' this ain't. More like, 'Better Be Patient, 'Cause it's English'.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>I liked Keira Knightley in her last collaboration with director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice) and, while not having high hopes for a similarly good engagement here, I hoped for better than I got from this sleepy movie. I can never understand what the Motion Picture and Film Academy sees when they nominate dull and slow films like this for awards, especially when they nominate them for the biggest award there is. I know its members are easily influenced by hype -- Hollywood lives on hype, after all -- but I see movies better than this one almost every time I turn on the TV.<br /><br />Some of my friends thought otherwise, thinking the romantic storyline, clever ending -- where the heroine apparently atones for an earlier indiscretion -- or the hybrid real-fake scene of early World War II Dunkirk made the movie worth watching. I wish any of this had been true, that this film had mimicked any of the glorious storytelling from "The English Patient", a similarly-induced World War II-era romance.<br /><br />But, alas, this movie did not achieve that. In my opinion, "Atonement" needs to atone to its viewers for boring them to death. This is the slowest film I've seen in some months with just about nothing going on to keep the viewer engaged. Even its raison d'etre -- a scene early on where a young woman misidentifies an event and turns it into sexual misconduct -- is not very fetching. A few directorial and production highlights can't save this somnambulist's delight.<br /><br />So, to summarize, I'd say don't believe the hype about this movie. It is not Academy Award quality and, frankly, isn't very good. I watched "Knocked Up" the night after this and rediscovered the elements that make a film worthwhile and enduring -- humor, human attachment, a clever script, real life characterizations and a complete lack of pretense. I'd say rent "Knocked Up" and forget "Atonement".</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I did not read the book "Atonement", so I had no expectations or any words to spoil the movie for me. I love a good mystery, romance, period piece. I love movies that take us out of the formulaic and into the furtive air. I try not to judge someone's work based on what I "wanted" to see versus what they gave me in the end. That said I was disappointed in this movie, and would never set eyes on it again for as long as I live.<br /> The cover boasts "A Crowning Achievement, A Ravishing Romance!" so of course I am thinking that Keira Knightely and James McAvoy who are two of the greatest actors we have right now (I used to loathe Keira but now see her as an asset to historical dramas), will give a good performance and satisfy my hungry romance loving appetite. I knew the premise going in. Young girl has crush on an older man, he loves this girls older sister, young girl misinterprets their relationship and in her naivety sets into motion events that tear the lovers apart maybe for forever! Can she rectify her mistake, Atone for her lies, will the romance ever be able to bloom without it being hindered by distance and time?<br /> I know there aren't always happy endings, I don't expect them nor do I want them to take place for fear of monotony and blandness. The whole movie was really very beautifully shot, although in some instances a little too perfectly framed. The sweeping shot at the beachside with all the soldiers didn't feel right to my eyes; it felt too "planned" and hokey. The costumes, sets, locations, music, were all well done, but it couldn't save this movie from being completely devoid of heart and soul and ultimately not a "ravishing romance" by any definition. It was pathetic and sad and so disappointing. I don't understand why it got all the attention it did.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>OK, anyone remember that one - Julie Christie - Alan Bates??<br /><br />Originality ....originality .... everything seems to be recycled upon an unsuspecting YOUNG public today.<br /><br />Performances?

Far from the kind of gritty, hit-and-run indie flick that many superficially similar films have been, this baby wears its high production values and dramatic pedigree on its sleeve with jaw-dropping cinematography, piercing writing, impeccable directing and uniformly stellar acting.  Director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have scored big time, resurrecting the kind of high caliber and emotionally earnest film that used to be made with regularity by major movie studios.  Where, I ask you, have been the Bravehearts, the Apollo 13's, the Forrest Gumps, the Shawshank Redemptions and the like, the movies that found the right blend of old-school Hollywood grandeur and gloss with artistic risk and thematic richness; the movies that reminded us why we loved movies in the first place?  They're a rare breed now-a-days (The Lord of the Rings a glorious exception) as it seems its either grandeur and gloss (The Pirates franchise) or artistic risk (No Country for Old Men).  But that's just another reason to love "Atonement:" it brings it all back, even if, ultimately, it's only briefly.<br /><br />The film opens in aristocratic England in 1935, the prolonged lull between the two great wars.  There, Robbie (James MacAvoy) tends the gardens of the upper crust Tallis family, while harboring secret longings for their eldest daughter Cecelia (Keira Knightley).  All the while, the youngest daughter Briony (Saoirse Ronan) quietly pines for Robbie, jealous of the attention he seems to pay to her older sister.  Her only outlet for her newly adolescent uncertainty is her unusually fertile imagination that crafts stories of daring and desperation.  Secrets and false perceptions lead to both Robbie and Cecelia to realize their mutual feelings and their undoing as Robbie is wrongfully accused of a horrible crime and Cecelia becomes estranged from her family.  To give away too much would be to spoil the raw emotional depth charges that sneak up, suffice it only to say that Briony's gifted mind betrays her.<br /><br />The film then jumps to 1940, with the British on their heels and retreating from France and the rampaging Nazi war machine (the audacious, breath-taking tracking shot of the British high-tailing it out of Dunkirk captures the ungodly cost and waste of war).  Robbie has been drafted into the Army and Cecelia and Briony have volunteered for the nursing corps.  But Briony is the outcast for inadvertently causing such pain for her older sister and the love of her life.  The one meeting between Cecelia and Robbie in a London coffee house before Robbie was to be shipped off to France speaks to true love, but also to enormous regret and chances lost. .  Theirs is a sincere romance tragically done in by forces beyond their control.  Knightley and MacAvoy may be young, but their acting chops are immense and far beyond their years.<br /><br />And that goes double for Ramona Garai, who portrays the teenaged Briony.  Her name is unknown for sure, but nonetheless she turns in the finest performance of the film.  In a movie whose major themes include regret and chances lost, she personifies the most potent: the perhaps futile quest for forgiveness for past transgressions, compounded, for Briony, by powerful feelings of shame that begat the cowardice to set things right and the knowledge that all the horrors that befall Robbie and Cecelia can be traced back to her wrongdoings.  It's Briony that needs to atone, and when she finally lays herself at the mercy of Cecelia and Robbie for forgiveness, Garai cuts to the bone.  Her eyes desperately, pleadingly search for that which she knows she will never deserve and it rips your heart out.  Later in life she will use her uncanny abilities for storytelling to vicariously atone for her sins, but it may never be enough.  Would it ever be enough for anyone?  Ponder that question, but do more.  See this stunner of a movie and be reminded of why and how movies can be powerful and entertaining simultaneously.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Atonement" is all about regret and loss, about how the words of one person can so painfully and irreversibly change the course of someone else's life. When it comes to the three main characters, there's no clear hero or villain. This is especially true of Briony Tallis: at age thirteen (Saoirse Ronan), she falsely accused her sister's lover of something he didn't do; at age eighteen (Romola Garai), her attempts to reconcile are flatly rejected. It's difficult to say whether or not her apology should have been accepted, because in all honesty, I'm not sure she deserved forgiveness. On the same token, her apology is genuine, so maybe her sister, Cecilia (Kiera Knightley), is being far too irrational. That's the beauty of this film--it doesn't pressure you into feeling one way or another about the characters. It merely presents them as they are, and how they should be perceived is left up to the individual.<br /><br />Based on Ian McEwan's novel, the story opens in England in 1935, in which Briony and Cecilia live in a sprawling countryside manor without any cares in the world. It's immediately established that Briony is an aspiring writer. This is not only because of the film's score, which uses a typewriter as a percussion instrument; the opening few shots show her typing the final few sentences of her play, one that she wishes her three visiting cousins to perform. She eventually looks out the window and misinterprets what she sees: Cecilia and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)--the estate's gardener--are arguing in front of a large fountain, and in the course of the argument, Cecilia strips to her underwear and plunges into the water. Briony has no idea what her sister is doing, but from the look in her eyes, it's obvious she thinks Robbie has done something bad to her.<br /><br />And she uses that moment against him later on, when Robbie's error comes back to haunt him. We see the very same fountain scene from Cecilia and Robbie's point of view, which clearly shows nothing improper taking place; their argument was over something so trivial that it doesn't even bear mentioning. Later on in his room, Robbie types several drafts of an apology note. One of the drafts used some naughty language, meaning that no one was ever meant to read it. Unfortunately, Robbie mistakenly seals that draft in an envelope, after which he asks Briony to deliver it to Cecilia. Briony reads the note and concludes that Robbie is a sex maniac, a label only strengthened when she discovers him and Cecilia in an embarrassing situation. Briony also witnesses the rape of her preteen cousin, Lola (Juno Temple), and when the police arrive, she points the finger at Robbie. He's immediately arrested, and at that point, all he and Cecilia have is their love for each other.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward four years. By then, Robbie is a soldier fighting in World War II; in the midst of bullets, blood, and death, his thoughts dwell only on Cecilia, who he has only seen once since the night he was arrested. Now a nurse, Cecilia only wants Robbie to come back to her, despite the fact that his good name has forever been ruined, both socially and legally. Robbie would like nothing more, and he reminds himself of his promise as he moves from place to place with his fellow soldiers. In his mind, people and places are becoming more and more distorted, and reality seems to be slipping away from him. It could be that his longing for his lost love is so strong that all else is irrelevant. It could be that reality is so disillusioning that fantasy is all he has left. Or maybe the gaping wound on his chest has gotten infected, making his brain sick with fever. Whatever the case, Cecilia is his only source of comfort in a very uncomfortable world.<br /><br />Briony, meanwhile, has given up on college to become a nurse, like her sister. Naturally, the two haven't spoken in a few years, but because Briony now understands the magnitude of her false accusation, she tries desperately to find Cecilia and apologize. Her guilty conscience pushes her back into her writing, her first manuscript beginning with a foolish girl witnessing her sister and her sister's lover by a fountain. At this point, she doesn't know whether or not it will be finished--she tends to doubt it, not only because of the pain she feels, but also because she doesn't yet know how the story will end.<br /><br />The same tactic is used for the film's story, which concludes with an elderly Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) being interviewed about her latest novel, "Atonement." I can't describe in detail what happens, nor can I closely examine what she says; far too much would be given away. What I can say is that the ending is emotionally charged and beautifully balanced with the beginning. In essence, the entire film shows how guilt can force someone on a journey, one that doesn't necessarily lead to happiness but definitely to maturity. What a draining journey to take, for both the characters and the audience. "Atonement" is without a doubt one of the year's best films, a beautiful yet heartbreaking story of love, anger, and the notion that forgiveness is not at all easy to earn.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Briony Tallis, 13 years old and an aspiring writer, sees her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner at the fountain in front of the family estate she misinterprets what is happening thus setting into motion a series of misunderstandings and a childish pique that will have lasting repercussions for all of them. Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola is raped, she tells the police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed when in fact it was a visitor to the estate. The storyline of Atonement is where this movie holds most of its impact. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me almost to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is. "Atonement" is a perfect movie, superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline that's great. A great interpretation of a wonderful novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Having put the novel down after almost 100 pages, I rented this DVD with trepidation.  Either I missed the point of the book, was having a bad week, or this director magically took dry prose and breathed life into it.  First rate story, acting, music, and even tears at the end made this a bravo performance and merited the Academy Award nomination.  Highly recommended.  (And, yes, I will try the book again).</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Every year, there seems to be one film that receives a lot of positive critical praise and a lot of award nominations, so much so it seems to turn people away from the film. This year, that film is "Atonement". A number of people have hemmed and hawed when I asked if they have already seen the film. "I heard it was like "The English Patient"".  I loved "The English Patient" but opinion seems to be equally divided. But "Atonement" is very different. I think any film made in Britain, set during World War II is going to be identified with "The English Patient". That's a shame, because the two films are not very similar and many people intensely dislike the former Oscar winner, so much so that just the mention of it is enough to steer many away from a film that could be remotely like it.<br /><br />"Atonement", based on the book by Ian McEwan, reteams Keira Knightley with her "Pride and Prejudice" director Joe Wright. They have created a masterfully crafted look at a romance interrupted by events beyond the couple's control.<br /><br />In the mid 30s, a hot summer leads everyone at a country house in the English countryside to become antsy. Briony (Saoirse Ronan), a precocious 13 year old, decides to write another play; she will perform it for the assembled houseguests with the help of her cousins and everyone is sure to love it and think she is just brilliant. Her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley) finds it difficult to deal with her growing attraction to Robbie (James McAvoy), the caretaker's son. They flirt and challenge each other to show their true affections. But Briony also has a schoolgirl crush on Robbie, and naturally, she doesn't understand all of these feelings or what she sees her older sister experiencing. Invited to dinner, Robbie writes Cecilia a letter and asks Briony to deliver it. He soon realizes he gave her a more explicit letter and yells for her to return. He tries to talk to Cecilia about it, but they give in to their carnal needs. Briony walks in and mistakes what they are doing. One thing leads to another and Robbie ends up in jail (there is a lot of stuff going on, I've only scratched the surface). When World War II begins, he is given the opportunity to join the army to get out of jail, and he is off to the battlefields of France. There, he pines over the letters he receives from Cecilia, who has disowned her family, and her sister, and works as a nurse. Briony (Romola Garai), now a young lady, has also become a nurse and desperately wants to right what she now realizes was a mistake.<br /><br />Directed by Joe Wright, "Atonement" is a great piece of romantic filmmaking.<br /><br />We initially meet Cecilia and Robbie, as they deal with the restrictions of their respective class standing in the way of their romance. Everyone has to be very proper, so they are unable to express their emotions. Then, frustrated by the constant flirting, Robbie writes a letter to Cecilia. But he is unable to come up with the right wording, the proper wording. Because of his inability to express his feelings, he writes an explicit letter, laughs and then writes another letter, a proper letter, but he mistakenly gives the wrong letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia. Briony is also attracted to the young man, so she sneaks a look at the letter and is shocked. All of this works so well because Wright and his screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, have perfectly captured McEwen's portrait of these rich folks who are languishing in the summer heat, bored and randy, letting their feelings overtake their better morals and better judgment.<br /><br />Briony is a precocious kid and we first meet her after she has finished a new play. Naturally, she has her mother and Cecilia read it, both of whom give their blessings. Then she ropes her cousins, twin boys and their older sister, into agreeing to perform it. But when the older cousin, who is a few years older than Briony, starts to try to take over, Briony gets frustrated. This is her play and she must be in control. Later, Briony's lack of control also helps to explain her actions as they spiral out of control, becoming more severe and damaging.<br /><br />Throughout the first half of the film, Robbie and Cecilia are clearly attracted to each other. Yet, because Robbie is the son of the family's caretaker, they are unable to express their desire. When Cecilia makes a mean comment about Robbie owing her father a lot of money for his schooling, we realize this is the same behavior two school children exhibit when they are interested in one another and unable to show it.<br /><br />Keira Knightley does a very good job of portraying Cecilia's frustrations. At one point, she lays on dock next to the lake, in a swimming suit. You can almost see the heat rising off of her body. So, when she and Robbie flirt, and they have a little tussle, she dives into the fountain to retrieve a broken piece of pottery, only to emerge in a drenched dress. Of course, this does nothing to assuage Robbie's desire and you have to think Cecilia is probably glad of the result. As Robbie and Cecilia dance around their feelings, Knightley brings a lot of complexity to the role. She argues with Robbie, she longs for him, she wants to hold him, but she can't. All of this is perfectly portrayed by the actress.<br /><br />When she receives the wrong letter from Robbie, she knows Briony has read it, but doesn't care. When he shows up for dinner, in evening dress, she leads him into the dark library ready to show him her true emotions. But Briony walks in and interrupts. She is shocked by what she sees.<br /><br />James McAvoy plays Robbie, the caretaker's (Brenda Blethyn) son. He knows there is a barrier between he and Cecilia and this only serves to make him all the more frustrated. When she suddenly appears out of the fountain, he is shocked, but seems more shocked because he would love to grab her and ravage her. But he can't do that. This all leads to the letter.  Like Cecilia, he is very frustrated and the heat isn't helping.<br /><br />The pair are extremely convincing and work well together. You can see the longing in their eyes as they yearn to touch each other.<br /><br />When the war hits, we watch as Robbie deals with life in the war-torn French countryside. He covets the letters Cecilia has sent to him and counts the days until he can return to England on leave and see her. Like many woman, Cecilia has become a nurse and tries to help out where she can. More interestingly, she has also disowned her family and lives in a small apartment in the middle of London. When they do reunite, it is an awkward moment, because he has been scarred by war and can't open up to her immediately. But she places her hands on his and all is well again.<br /><br />Briony, now a young woman, has been thinking about the events of that summer evening many years before. She realizes she mistook or misunderstood some things, and wants to make amends. She also realizes she has interrupted her older sister's romance and wants to set things right, but Cecilia will have nothing to do with her.<br /><br />One of the most striking things about "Atonement" is, strangely enough, the sound design of the film. As the film opens, we hear a typewriter clacking away and then watch as Briony finishes her play. But this same sound becomes almost a background noise through much of the film. At various points, we watch a character's actions through a certain point and then the typewriter sound becomes louder and the action shifts back a bit, and we watch the same events from a slightly different viewpoint. As Briony is presumably writing this, at some point in her life, it is fascinating to see the different viewpoints presented, almost as Briony seems to realize her mistakes. The typewriter sound blends into the music, adding a nice underscore to the melodic background.<br /><br />The typewriter and Briony's reexamining various events leads up the emotional, gut wrenching climax of the film. I defy you to not use the hanky you will wisely have in your hand, waiting for this very moment.<br /><br />"Atonement" is a very good film, very romantic, and sure to bring a large number of people to tears. It is superbly made and you never once feel like you are watching something that hasn't happened. What more could you want from an Awards contender?</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly Briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director Anthony Minghella, who tragically passed away earlier this week. One can surmise that director Joe Wright's use of the estimable filmmaker for a well-placed cameo is something of a tribute to Minghella's work on similarly grandiose epics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTWCO">The English Patient</a>. Minghella would have been an ideal director for Ian McEwan's emotionally complex <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099429799">2002 novel</a>, as would have been David Lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9M">Doctor Zhivago</a> and the intimacy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780023420">Brief Encounter</a> (especially in the wartime tearoom scene). Regardless, Wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic. Much of the film's measured success has to do with his and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's abiding fidelity to McEwan's time-juggling story structure.<br /><br />The story is actually divided into two discrete parts. The first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling English estate in 1935 as precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening. She idolizes her beautiful older sister Cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeeper's impassioned son Robbie Turner. When she sees the two together at the garden fountain, she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred. Later that evening, Briony makes a false accusation, and Robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison. The second part takes place five years later as Europe is engulfed in WWII. Robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in France, aching over Cecilia while trying to get to Dunkirk in order to return to England. Cecilia has become a nurse, as has a now-grown Briony regretfully estranged from her sister. Where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpected.<br /><br />I'm rather divided on the performances. As the headstrong Cecilia, Keira Knightley evokes old-school glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn, but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses. James McAvoy captures the boyish magnetism of Robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on. Together though, Knightley and McAvoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story. On the other hand, Briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the character's evolving fate. As the adolescent, Saoirse Ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing self-possession. She makes us care about Briony despite her repugnant act of self-interest. Romola Garai takes over as a young, uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a London hospital. Finally, Vanessa Redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaning.<br /><br />All the production values are stunning - Sarah Greenwood's meticulous production design, especially in the Dunkirk scenes; Jacqueline Durran's simply designed period costumes; Dario Marianelli's stirring music score (with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes) and Seamus McGarvey's rich cinematography. Pay particular attention to the uninterrupted five-minute tracking shot at Dunkirk done with a Steadicam, a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in Orson Welles' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305999872">Touch of Evil</a>. The 2008 DVD has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production - an informative commentary track from Wright; a comprehensive, half-hour making-of documentary, "Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of `Atonement'"; a five-minute short, "From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic", in which Wright, Hampton and McEwan discuss the transition on a cursory level; and seven deleted scenes, about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from Wright.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>At the very beginning of 2007 I was introduced to this film.  I was surfing the web looking at upcoming `Oscar fare' and I stumbled upon a still of James McAvoy from this movie I had never heard of called `Atonement'.  At the time I was too wrapped up in another buzzed about film (one that eventually turned into disappointment) to really give this one all that much attention, but as the year progressed forward and the buzz for `Atonement' kept growing I decided to give it a look.  That's when I got my hands on Ian McEwan's novel; the source inspiration for this film.  A few days later I was in tears as I turned the final page of the novel and I just knew that this movie was going to be something special.  I just knew that if it was done right then it would be, quite possibly, the best epic romance ever filmed.  Then I got the opportunity to see the movie and I must say it was everything I dreamed it would be.<br /><br />The film (as well as the novel) follows a certain lie that destroys the lives of three people.  Young Briony Tallis is a very imaginative child.  At thirteen she possesses a maturity that is beyond her years, but it is also a false sense of maturity.  This is to say that Briony only thinks she is mature.  Briony and her sister Cecilia come from a very wealthy family and live in a beautiful home in England.  Robbie Turner, the family housekeeper's son, has pretty much grown up with them like a brother and has been taken under the wing of their parents.  While on the outset one might sense a sort of distain between Cecilia and Robbie it soon becomes apparent that that distain is in all actuality a grounded yet unexpected love.<br /><br />Briony doesn't understand this love.<br /><br />Through a series of events that are misinterpreted by Briony she draws some very unhealthy and inaccurate conclusions about Robbie and when a horrible act of violence is committed against Briony's visiting cousin Lola, Robbie is the first person to whom the finger points.  This false accusation stakes the base or foundation for `Atonement'.  As Robbie is imprisoned and then shipped off to war; as Cecilia writes off her family and begins working as a nurse awaiting Robbie's return; as Briony, stricken with guilt, forsakes her higher education to nurse wounded soldiers, we are always left with this impetuous lie hanging over our heads and lingering in the air.<br /><br />The acting on the parts of the entire cast is flawless, but like many of the critics have already noted, there are three performances that stand out above the rest.  James McAvoy turns in his finest performance to date as the accused; Robbie Turner.  What I love about this performance is the fact that the emotions seem to peel away from him to reveal a man raked by pain and suffering yet determined to find his way back to the arms of his one true love.  Keira Knightley once again proves that she is more than a pretty face (and what a pretty face) with her flawless portrayal of Cecilia.  Her performance is delicate and precise; a very mature turn for which is a stark contrast to her other lauded performance in `Pride and Prejudice'.  Both characters are drastically different yet similar in perplexity.  She wears both very well.  The character of Briony Tallis is separated among three actresses, one of which stands out among the rest.  Young Saoirse Ronan plays Briony at age thirteen, the Briony who starts this downward spiral.  Her performance is in a word `flawless'.  She brilliantly captures the danger that rests inside innocent wonderment and displays an almost cold demeanor that, when analyzed closely, gives way to the immaturity within her character that she cannot accept.  It's a marvelous performance.<br /><br />The other two actresses that portray Briony are Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.  Both of them do a fine job but neither have the power that Ronan has.  This may have to do with the fact that Ronan's part is lengthier and much baitier.  Garai does a fine job in getting under Briony's guilt but she at times appears a tad lost, as if she's not sure what she should do next.  This could throw some off but once Redgrave comes on the screen she answers a few questions we may have and sheds some light on Garai's seemingly odd behavior.  Redgrave is miraculous in her very short scene but I feel that I can't really speak of it without giving too much away so I'll refrain from saying anything more.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is on point throughout.  Young Juno Temple is memorable as the victimized Lola Quincey and brothers Felix and Charlie von Simson capture the innocence of Jackson and Pierrot beautifully.  Patrick Kennedy portrays Leon Tallis with great brotherly attention and Harriet Walter and Brenda Blethyn portray opposite spectrums of motherhood memorably.  Benedict Cumberbatch is noteworthy for his intense performance as Paul Marshall.<br /><br />The real star here though, is none other than director Joe Wright.  His attention to detail is miraculous.  What I love about his approach here is that it is epic in its broad scope and flashy visual grace but delicate in that it never overlooks the little things.  Sure, it's beautiful but it's also very intricate and cautious.  Wright works very hard to do his source material justice and manages to do so with flying colors.  Just look at the lauded Dunkirk tracking sequence; orgasmic to say the least; but more so, the library love scene is in my opinion the single best sequence in film this year.  The way that Wright was able to create such raw lusty emotions without shedding an article of clothing; the way Knightley's head, stiff and tense, arches to stare McAvoy in the eyes and whisper "I love you"; every single detail just creates this flawless experience.  Combine this with 2005's `Pride and Prejudice' and one can see that Joe Wright is setting himself up for a marvelous career.<br /><br />`Atonement' is truly a very beautiful film, visually as well as emotionally.  Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey superbly captures the beauty that surrounds this masterpiece while Wright and his cast drip such flawless emotional detail.  One can't help but absorb this films magnificence.  Truly one of the best films to be released this year; a complete and memorable masterpiece; `Atonement' has a place alongside films like `Titanic' as one of the grandest and greatest epics ever filmed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Amazon's review gets its right here: this is a director's film.  Joe Wright's staging of Dunkirk in one extended, long shot is magnificent; it's something that will stand as a testament to his ability for decades.<br /><br />Keira Knightley - still only 22 - and James McAvoy are solid as the star-crossed leads.  About Keira, enough said.  About McAvoy, he continues to grow into a major film star.  We happened across him the other night in a small part in the BBC's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5YP1Y">The Inspector Lynley Mysteries Series 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5</a>.  That was about 2001.  He's been on a fast-rising, well-deserved, upwards trajectory since then, most notably his fantastic turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>, in which he doesn't get blown off the screen by Forest Whitaker's epic rendering of Idi Amin.  Holding his own there was an achievement in itself.<br /><br />Despite the two stars, the film hangs it hat on a triumvirate of actresses who play the role of Briony.  This is where I feel the MPAA got it wrong in its 2007 Supporting Actress nominations: Saoirse Ronan got the nod for her role as 13-year-old Briony.  Surely, she gets the meat of the time on-screen, and it's a very self-assured performance for 13-year-old girl.  But, acting-wise, both Romola Garai (as the 18-year-old version) and the power cameo by Vanessa Redgrave as 'Older Briony' (that's how the credits tab her) are better performances.  I was especially taken by Ms. Garai's short but powerful rendering.  It's the point in her life where Briony begins to comprehend what she's done and cannot un-do.  That experience is clearly etched on her face and her performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>With multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype, I decided to check out ATONEMENT strictly to see what all the hubbub was about. Is it over-hyped or does it stand out as "The Best Picture of 2007"?<br /><br />The answer is both yes and no.<br /><br />Visually it a feast for the eyes. The routing of the English army into Dunkirk is nothing short of amazing. Let me clarify that, too. We don't see the battle leading to Dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness. The crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding, and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen. This was the most intense sequence in the entire film. It was also shot in a most uncommon way, with the camera initially following James McAvoy's character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own, but returns to McAvoy later. An interesting way to shoot this series of events.<br /><br />The costumes, sets, and props were perfect. There was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically I enjoyed the woolen army uniforms, the streets of early London, and the nursing uniforms the young women wore (again, all perfect).<br /><br />The acting was good. James McAvoy (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland</a>) steals most of the show as the good-natured but ultimately wronged Robbie Turner, an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U7WV1Y">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>). Knightley does a fair job as Cecilia, a young woman in love with Robbie, a man far beneath her station. When Robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime, Cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with Robbie.<br /><br />But more powerful than Knightley was Romola Garai who plays her sister Briony. Briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning Robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child. It is Briony who really rules the movie, giving us her fervent wish for "atonement" later in life after realizing what damage she's caused both Robbie and her sister.<br /><br />The powerful Vanessa Redgrave (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOKFHG">Venus</a>) plays the aged Briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile Briony's wish for atonement are. Although Mrs. Redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film, it is only a few minutes. There've been rumors that she'll garner some award for this performance, but I hope that these rumors are unfounded. Don't get me wrong; she did a fine job. But her brief performance doesn't warrant any kind of prize.<br /><br />Listing the good above, I have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one. This is a war story, something we've seen time and again. Director Joe Wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time, but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar with.<br /><br />That said, one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending. If you're looking for a feel-good, man-returns-home-and-marries-girl-and-they-have-fifty-grandkids kind of movie, this one isn't going to make your happy tears list.<br /><br />This is a mixed bag as far as films go. An overused premise with some uniquely new ideas.<br /><br />But is it "The Best Film of 2007"? It does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to Romola Garai. But it's not the best. That prize I'm reserving for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDDP7I">No Country for Old Men</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Every year, there seems to be one film that receives a lot of positive critical praise and a lot of award nominations, so much so it seems to turn people away from the film. This year, that film is "Atonement". A number of people have hemmed and hawed when I asked if they have already seen the film. "I heard it was like "The English Patient"".  I loved "The English Patient" but opinion seems to be equally divided. But "Atonement" is very different. I think any film made in Britain, set during World War II is going to be identified with "The English Patient". That's a shame, because the two films are not very similar and many people intensely dislike the former Oscar winner, so much so that just the mention of it is enough to steer many away from a film that could be remotely like it.<br /><br />"Atonement", based on the book by Ian McEwan, reteams Keira Knightley with her "Pride and Prejudice" director Joe Wright. They have created a masterfully crafted look at a romance interrupted by events beyond the couple's control.<br /><br />In the mid 30s, a hot summer leads everyone at a country house in the English countryside to become antsy. Briony (Saoirse Ronan), a precocious 13 year old, decides to write another play; she will perform it for the assembled houseguests with the help of her cousins and everyone is sure to love it and think she is just brilliant. Her older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley) finds it difficult to deal with her growing attraction to Robbie (James McAvoy), the caretaker's son. They flirt and challenge each other to show their true affections. But Briony also has a schoolgirl crush on Robbie, and naturally, she doesn't understand all of these feelings or what she sees her older sister experiencing. Invited to dinner, Robbie writes Cecilia a letter and asks Briony to deliver it. He soon realizes he gave her a more explicit letter and yells for her to return. He tries to talk to Cecilia about it, but they give in to their carnal needs. Briony walks in and mistakes what they are doing. One thing leads to another and Robbie ends up in jail (there is a lot of stuff going on, I've only scratched the surface). When World War II begins, he is given the opportunity to join the army to get out of jail, and he is off to the battlefields of France. There, he pines over the letters he receives from Cecilia, who has disowned her family, and her sister, and works as a nurse. Briony (Romola Garai), now a young lady, has also become a nurse and desperately wants to right what she now realizes was a mistake.<br /><br />Directed by Joe Wright, "Atonement" is a great piece of romantic filmmaking.<br /><br />We initially meet Cecilia and Robbie, as they deal with the restrictions of their respective class standing in the way of their romance. Everyone has to be very proper, so they are unable to express their emotions. Then, frustrated by the constant flirting, Robbie writes a letter to Cecilia. But he is unable to come up with the right wording, the proper wording. Because of his inability to express his feelings, he writes an explicit letter, laughs and then writes another letter, a proper letter, but he mistakenly gives the wrong letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia. Briony is also attracted to the young man, so she sneaks a look at the letter and is shocked. All of this works so well because Wright and his screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, have perfectly captured McEwen's portrait of these rich folks who are languishing in the summer heat, bored and randy, letting their feelings overtake their better morals and better judgment.<br /><br />Briony is a precocious kid and we first meet her after she has finished a new play. Naturally, she has her mother and Cecilia read it, both of whom give their blessings. Then she ropes her cousins, twin boys and their older sister, into agreeing to perform it. But when the older cousin, who is a few years older than Briony, starts to try to take over, Briony gets frustrated. This is her play and she must be in control. Later, Briony's lack of control also helps to explain her actions as they spiral out of control, becoming more severe and damaging.<br /><br />Throughout the first half of the film, Robbie and Cecilia are clearly attracted to each other. Yet, because Robbie is the son of the family's caretaker, they are unable to express their desire. When Cecilia makes a mean comment about Robbie owing her father a lot of money for his schooling, we realize this is the same behavior two school children exhibit when they are interested in one another and unable to show it.<br /><br />Keira Knightley does a very good job of portraying Cecilia's frustrations. At one point, she lays on dock next to the lake, in a swimming suit. You can almost see the heat rising off of her body. So, when she and Robbie flirt, and they have a little tussle, she dives into the fountain to retrieve a broken piece of pottery, only to emerge in a drenched dress. Of course, this does nothing to assuage Robbie's desire and you have to think Cecilia is probably glad of the result. As Robbie and Cecilia dance around their feelings, Knightley brings a lot of complexity to the role. She argues with Robbie, she longs for him, she wants to hold him, but she can't. All of this is perfectly portrayed by the actress.<br /><br />When she receives the wrong letter from Robbie, she knows Briony has read it, but doesn't care. When he shows up for dinner, in evening dress, she leads him into the dark library ready to show him her true emotions. But Briony walks in and interrupts. She is shocked by what she sees.<br /><br />James McAvoy plays Robbie, the caretaker's (Brenda Blethyn) son. He knows there is a barrier between he and Cecilia and this only serves to make him all the more frustrated. When she suddenly appears out of the fountain, he is shocked, but seems more shocked because he would love to grab her and ravage her. But he can't do that. This all leads to the letter.  Like Cecilia, he is very frustrated and the heat isn't helping.<br /><br />The pair are extremely convincing and work well together. You can see the longing in their eyes as they yearn to touch each other.<br /><br />When the war hits, we watch as Robbie deals with life in the war-torn French countryside. He covets the letters Cecilia has sent to him and counts the days until he can return to England on leave and see her. Like many woman, Cecilia has become a nurse and tries to help out where she can. More interestingly, she has also disowned her family and lives in a small apartment in the middle of London. When they do reunite, it is an awkward moment, because he has been scarred by war and can't open up to her immediately. But she places her hands on his and all is well again.<br /><br />Briony, now a young woman, has been thinking about the events of that summer evening many years before. She realizes she mistook or misunderstood some things, and wants to make amends. She also realizes she has interrupted her older sister's romance and wants to set things right, but Cecilia will have nothing to do with her.<br /><br />One of the most striking things about "Atonement" is, strangely enough, the sound design of the film. As the film opens, we hear a typewriter clacking away and then watch as Briony finishes her play. But this same sound becomes almost a background noise through much of the film. At various points, we watch a character's actions through a certain point and then the typewriter sound becomes louder and the action shifts back a bit, and we watch the same events from a slightly different viewpoint. As Briony is presumably writing this, at some point in her life, it is fascinating to see the different viewpoints presented, almost as Briony seems to realize her mistakes. The typewriter sound blends into the music, adding a nice underscore to the melodic background.<br /><br />The typewriter and Briony's reexamining various events leads up the emotional, gut wrenching climax of the film. I defy you to not use the hanky you will wisely have in your hand, waiting for this very moment.<br /><br />"Atonement" is a very good film, very romantic, and sure to bring a large number of people to tears. It is superbly made and you never once feel like you are watching something that hasn't happened. What more could you want from an Awards contender?</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Atonement is a lush looking movie with two excellent leads in James McAvoy as Robbie Turner and Keira Knightley as Cecilia.  The romance and attraction between the two feels very real as the movie progresses, which is a testament to their ability.  The true star of the film, and an easy character to hate, is Briony, who is played to perfection by three separate actresses.  This is a complicated story that is not exactly a "feel good" film.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are very valuable; especially the commentary from director Joe Wright, who does a masterful job with the movie.  From England to France, the film features excellent scenery.  This film is set just prior to World War II and serves as the backdrop for the release of McAvoy from prison to serve his country.  Choices and a crime play huge in the movie; betrayal, love, and loyalty are the other key themes.  This is a four star film that from a technical standpoint is excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Repentance for the sinner.

To me, value is about 4.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>I suppose Ian McEwan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099429799">novel</a> was memorable enough that I suddenly looked forward to seeing it on film, but it surprised me when I realized how attached to the story I was when the film jogged my memory a bit.  That is a pretty big compliment to the movie of course.  It's a great novel and an interesting story.  The ending hit much harder on paper than it did on film but that is a nitpicking.  Atonement, as a film is absolutely gorgeous.  The art direction, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, and the actors all look and sound amazing.  Young director Joe Wright makes films with the sensibility of someone in the twilight of their career.  His team captures remarkable images over and over again, all the while weaving this tale with great efficiency.  I didn't see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1ZBGS">Pride & Prejudice</a> but given that many of the same talent was present there, I'm going to give that film a shot.  Joe Wright has more than solidified himself.  There is no doubt in my mind that this guy knows how to make movies.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, Atonement is broken out into four parts.  The first part follows Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13 year-old girl from a rich English family with two older siblings.  She wants to become a writer.  She has an older sister named Cecilia (Keira Knightly) who is in the midst of falling in love with their housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy).  Some miscommunication and some meddling interrupt their budding relationship suddenly and that incident's repercussions become the center of the story thereafter.  The second part moves forward four years where Robbie is in the military during the Second World War.  Briony (now played by Romola Garai) and Cecelia are both nurses for the war.  The third part focuses on Briony's experience as a nurse and eventually how she reconnects with Cecelia and Robbie.  The fourth part of the film meets Briony (played now by Vanessa Redgrave) as a successful novelist in her 70s who is terminally ill.  Overall, each section is certainly true enough to the novel from what I can recall, but then again I read it seven years ago.  Some details are missing that may not have been easy to include but they are mostly there in spirit to satisfy those who loved the book. One detail was left out that had me a bit perplexed, but the film was too good to not find forgiveness.<br /><br />It is hard to express how sad this story is without giving away significant spoilers but rest assured it is a powerful story and the film succeeds in that transition quite effectively.  A lot of credit must go to the screenplay from Christopher Hampton who won an Academy Award for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015YV4K">Dangerous Liaisons</a> and although only nominated here he delivers something of equal quality with Atonement.  There are also some shots in Atonement that are absolutely unforgettable, in particular the lengthy sequence where Robbie experiences the Dunkirk Evacuation.  It is one long single shot that must've required immense coordination from the crew and extras.  In and of itself it is a special achievement and it doesn't come off as unnecessary or intentionally flashy regarding the team's technical prowess in any way.  It is also hard not to mention the performances, which are all good and the leads are actually great.  Keira Knightly should definitely be taken very seriously as an actress and McAvoy really stands out to me for the first time. Atonement is certainly a successful adaptation of the McEwan novel but it is also one of the best films of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>The setting: English countryside in the interwar period.  The storyline: 13-year-old Briony Tallis mistakes her sister's flirtation with the hunky hired help and her own infatuation with him to unjustly implicate the young man in rape, and screws up all three of their lives as a result.  Seeking atonement, she works as a nurse in London during WW II, then later writes a book admitting she bore false witness.  Sorry Briony, that doesn't make up for destroying a man's life.  Burn in Hades, you little brat.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is the best thing in this romance involving the usual props and contretemps - misplaced love, tuxedos, perverts, teapots, country estates, falling bombs, French, stuffy accents and misdirected love letters.  As for the movie itself, it's more a vehicle to demonstrate that the actors are, well, great actors.  And they are.  Every performance was top-notch and the sets were lavish, although I could tell the director and set designer were more concerned with English estates than with Dunkirk.  But you can't have everything.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that overall, though, the movie made me feel a bit depressed.  If you're a fan of the genre, then this is a great addition to your collection.  For the typical moviegoer, however, it probably is too much a downer.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Although I gave this film four stars overall, it is problematic.  Having said that, this movie is stunningly filmed and very well acted.<br /><br />The film has a wide appeal in that it's a period piece, a romance story, a war epic, and it's strongly centered around a theme we can all relate to, atoning for one's sin(s).  In addition, the acting in this film is first-rate.  Keira Knightly is both stunningly beautiful for such a fragile looking thing and shows that she can really act beyond her "Pirates" role to which this character is very far removed.  Also, James McAvoy is terrific and gives another star making performance (as he had done in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland </a>).  All of the supporting cast members are equally excellent in this film.  Of course, one of the film's greatest assets is its cinematography.  This film is sumptuously filmed and the one take beach shot of the retreating British army is unforgettable.<br /><br />However, the telling of the story is the film's greatest problem in that there are shifts in point of view and time periods with little or no lead in or explanation.  Yes, I know they are intentional, but that doesn't mean they were done well.  Even when one is paying attention to the film, the shifts are often abrupt and very distracting until one figures out what is going on.  These shifts make the film seem disjointed and poorly edited.  I'm not sure who is to blame for this approach as it could be the director, the writers, the editor or some combination of all three, which is where I think the blame does lie.  Now, in spite of this very strong criticism, this is still an excellent film.<br /><br />The plot is outlined by Amazon very well, but their praise is, in my view, rather excessive.  In any event, you can read their summary which is informative and accurate.  In short form, it's the story that spans about four years in which a very young girl has a crush on the son of a house servant who himself has a crush on the oldest daughter in the home.  That quiet crush ends up being mutual and erupts into a secret love affair that is, unfortunately, discovered by the very jealous younger sister who feel betrayed by the boy and she sets out to destroy him.  It's the classic, "If I can't have you, no one can" scenario.  The young girl tells a huge lie that sends the boy to jail and then to war.  She attempts "atonement" not by ever saying she's sorry or by recanting her vicious accusation, but rather by becoming a nurse and caring for wounded soldiers.  The audience is left to decide if she achieves atonement or not by her actions.<br /><br />For myself, I am rather old fashioned about forgiveness in that I think little can substitute for a sincere and straight-forward apology to the persons affected.  How can one expect forgiveness if he or she never actually asks for it or even owns up to what he or she actually did?  In addition, the person asking forgiveness needs to understand that a simple "I'm sorry" doesn't "fix" the problems created and some times an apology isn't enough and needs to be coupled with appropriate reparations.<br /><br />Of course, the victim can certainly find it in his or her heart to forgive someone for a bad action even without the other asking for forgiveness, but that doesn't diminish the need/requirement of one to own up to what he or she did and simply trying to lead a better life afterwards, as done in this film, doesn't pay the bill entirely even though it is a praiseworthy thing to do.  An apology ought to also be coupled by a change in behavior and in this story the young girl does this, but I am very disturbed by her reluctance to ever tell anyone what she did or, at the very least, ask forgiveness directly from the people she hurt so much.<br /><br />Of course, the acceptance of an apology is often a tricky thing too and we have no clue how the main characters in this film would accept an apology if it was offered.  For starters, one has to examine if the apology is sincere or not.  Personally, I think people should be a graceful as possible in accepting apologies as it takes a lot of humility to offer an apology that includes noting the wrong that was done.  All too often in our society today we have this need to win at all costs and even when someone gives us a heartfelt apology, we sometimes feel the need to stomp all over the person anyhow.  Perhaps it is part of that eye for eye, tooth for a tooth mentality.  One accepts the apology, but must get some revenge anyhow to "equal" out things.  To me that's not accepting an apology as forgiveness means releasing a person from the burden of guilt he or she has with no strings attached. I can't help but think the characters in this story would have gone down this path had an apology been offered.  Well, one can only hope.<br /><br />Respectfully Submitted 06/08,<br />Steve Hedge</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>This is my first time looking at this picture, and I have to say that it really moved me. I can see why one shouldn't bear false witness against one's neighbor for true. It seems there are two sisters . One just grown up and serious, and one younger, writing plays and gets herself in business she can't quite understand. Because of this, one is falsely accused and sent to prison; He is only released to go to war. The elder sister moves away from her family hoping to still be with the man she truly loves, and the baby sister is left with a heavy load of guilt. I believe a moral is here for us all to learn. Don't hurt no one if you cannot help them. perhaps that is a bit easy to say, and a child needs to stay in a child's place and mind her business. Because of her own fancies, she hurt two people who could love and be happy together. Because of the war, they lost that. what a interesting movie. I like when they examine the what could happen and we are lead to believe that that is the case, but sadly it isn't. Very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />An exceptionally well-made and completely non-formulaic film which consistently defies viewer expectations, Atonement has left some viewers cold (particularly those who expected a standard love-against-all-odds picture) but it's a very impressive piece of moviemaking (the scene at Dunkirk should be on everyone's list of best shots of all time) and a movie I'm glad I watched.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Beautifully shot, Atonement begins by introducing us to the wealthy Tallis family, ensconced in an impressive estate in England during the late 1930s. Briony (played as a young girl by Saoirse Ronan), the youngest member of the family at 13, is a budding writer, concocting plays and other works to be presented at family gatherings. We also meet Cecilia Tallis (played with heartbreak by Kiera Knightley), Briony's gorgeous older sister. During the early course of the film, Cecilia learns that Robbie (James McAvoy), educated son of the family housekeeper, is in love with her. In a moment of almost-shock, Cecilia realizes that she returns this love.<br /><br />Young Briony, who happens to have a crush on Robbie herself, accidentally walks in on the two lovers one pivotal evening. Events later that night lead to Briony accusing Robbie of a crime he didn't commit. His quick arrest, and subsequent enrollment in the British army (WWI), deny Robbie and Cecilia the time together that they so long for.<br /><br />Years later, Briony sorts through what happened, understanding her terrible error and what it meant, leading to the title of the film.<br /><br />This film is beautiful to look at. Shots are carefully composed. Period costuming, hair, makeup, and props are impeccable. Keira Knightley wears an emerald gown that is a revelation. It is cut so delicately that it even makes her stick-thin body look curvy.<br /><br />Performances are amazing. Knightley portrays Cecilia as achingly bewildered by her feelings, then stricken with yearning at being separated from her lover. McAvoy's Robbie is a triumph, particularly in the scenes during his military service. There is a slow, uninterrupted shot of his face, during which he discovers the evidence of a mass execution, that will stay with me a long time. An older Briony is played in a genius turn by Vanessa Redgrave at the end of the film, summing up the heart of the tale.<br /><br />I sobbed like a baby at the end. Sooo worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Great acting by cast members, but the storyline was long and slow..... Basically not my cup of tea!<br /><br />This story can be summed up by betrayal and two people truly in love are unable to be together due to the betrayal. And the betrayer who feels remorseful their entire life finds a way to make atonement for their actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>Atonement is a love story. Unlike most love stories where the events unfold predictably and there are no major problems along the way, this one is wrought with disasters. Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightly) is a wealthy girl from a well-to-do family. She is the epitome of the well brought up girl; she's beautiful, she dresses well, she is charismatic, and she's smart. It is no small wonder that one of the house staff is enchanted with her. Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) is well educated but comes from a poor background, so he is not the ideal mate, but the mutual flirtation between this couple betrays their hidden desires. Enter Briony (Saoirse Ronan), Cecilia's younger sister with a vivid imagination and a crush on Robbie. She glimpses a few moments in the couple's flirtation with each other and assumes the worst and jeopardizes their happiness together.<br /><br />The story is uneven; it is exciting right from the start, but the excitement seems to wane a bit in the middle. It suffers from confusing moments and some pretentiousness, especially the long take on the beach during the war. It seems director Joe Wright wanted to do something to prove his abilities, but its gratuitousness seems more like showing off than anything and detracts from the quiet beauty of the rest of the film. Events continue to drag on, and right when one starts to lose interest, the story catches you and pulls you in hard. The ending is heartbreakingly memorable and an unusual finish to such a love story.<br /><br />This movie should have won the Oscars for best cinematography and best art direction. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at from the color choices to the framing of each scene. Looking back, there are so many vivid images to remember, such as Briony walking through the floral arches in the garden, the seductively rich colors in the study, the grey streets during the war... What is amazing about these choices is that in spite of each frame looking like a painting, the sets seem very real and lived in. This movie does not take on the staleness of the typical historical picture; all of the actors seem comfortable in their costumes as if they were their daily dress.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The cinematographically spectacular film "Atonement" was a marvelous adaptation of the passionate Ian McEwan novel set in 1930's pre-war England.  The onset of the film is set in a majestic English countryside estate where the privileged Tallis family reside.  Young sister Briony, a talented writer, played impressively by Saoirse Ronan is immaturely competing for the affections of James McAvoy playing Robbie Turner, son of the family housekeeper with her older sister Cecilia played by Keira Knightley.  McAvoy had been mentored by the Tallis family, sent to Cambridge and about to enter medical school.  The subdued relationship between Knightley and McAvoy smoldered during a erotic lovemaking scene in the library unfortunately witnessed by the jealous Briony.  The smitten 13 year old had her revenge by unjustly implicating McAvoy for a sexual assault on her cousin Lola who had been staying at the estate.  McAvoy is dragged away from the tender embrace of Knightley to prison in handcuffs.<br /><br />The film then fast forwards four years to Northern France where McAvoy and two mates are trudging through the fields retreating to the amazingly filmed mad pandemonium of Dunkirk.  Released from prison to fight in the army, McAvoy and Knightley, a London based nurse still communicate and pine for each other.  Briony now a nurse in training realizes the tragedy her lies have spawned, separating the two lovers. She tries to make ammends and re-establish communication with her sister.  Using flashbacks and flashforwards the story plays out though the chewed up battlefields of Europe and bomb plagued streets of London.<br /><br />The conclusion of this film reveals that an aged Briony played by Vanessa Redgrave an accomplished and prolific author is touting her ultimate novel and lifelong labor "Atonement". She fills in the blanks of this tear jerker love story and her regrets of the effects of her actions.<br /><br />Kudos to McAvoy whose portrayal of the humble, disgraced Robbie should propel him in stardom.  The magnificent cinematography of Seamus MacGarvey using a variety of English filming locations combined with a dedicated screenplay by Christopher Hampton combined to make "Atonement" a surefire Best Picture candidate.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I have not read Ian McEwan's novel so the story and the way it unfolds in without any anticipation on my part. Atonement has a wonderful sense of time and place - the peace just prior to the Second World War.  The early scenes set during a hot summer in 1935 seem like a kind of paradise for Cecilia and Briony Tallis, set amid a beautiful house and gardens; but all is not was idyllic as it seems. There is love and jealousy in the air between Cecilia and her younger sister, a budding writer, over Robbie Turner, the son of their longtime groundskeeper for whom the Tallis family has a liking strong enough to erase class barriers and allow the son of a servant to share dinner with them.  Robbie has great expectations in that he has a promise from Cecilia and Briony's father that he can attend medical school.  Love, however, intervenes and everything changes.<br /><br />James McAvoy as Robbie and Kira Knightly as Cecilia are perfectly cast and their performances sweep us up into their romance.  The young Briony (nicely played by Saoirse Ronan) has her own crush on Robbie that is unrequited, and seeing her sister in love with him turns her jealousy into a tool of punishment when she falsely accuses Robbie of raping a cousin.  The relationships between the three main characters are nicely developed; as much as one is disgusted by Briony's actions one understands the impulse.  To ease her guilt she performs an act of atonement by becoming a nurse (Romola Garai playing the 18 year old Briony) in a London hospital, tending the war wounded and dying.<br /><br />The film has the sweep of an epic with the inclusion of the evacuation of Dunkirk. Surveying the vast scene of destruction, the beach littered with broken down vehicles mirrors the terrible twist that Robbie's life took and we, like all of the stranded men, are hoping that Robbie and Cecilia will be reunited.  We don't know until the end of the film where the various threads of the story have taken us.  The story makes use of flashbacks so we are aware sometimes of what is going to happen before the characters do, but when we arrive at the conclusion of the love story of Cecilia and Robbie we know how bitter a single act of jealous can become and how a thoughtless act can have repercussions for life.  This final phase of Briony's life is marvelously conveyed by Vanessa Redgrave, who sums up the story in an interview.<br /><br />Atonement is beautifully filmed, perhaps the best example of cinematography this year.  I was reminded of the beautiful photography that was characteristic of David Lean's films.  Although the love story may not be as compelling as Jack and Rose in Titanic it is just as deeply felt and is beautifully told.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2007's "Atonement" is a beautifully acted and directed movie, a richly textured period piece, and a tragedy in three parts that defies easy description without giving away the movie's punchline.<br /><br />At the center of the story is female writer Briony Talis.  When the story opens on a hot summer's day in 1935 at an English estate, Briony is a highly imaginative 13-year old girl trying to stage a play with her reluctant cousins.  The genesis of tragedy is Briony's observation of her older sister Cecilia's (Keira Knightley) relationship with Robbie (James McAvoy), son of the estate housekeeper and a bright and decent lad whose college education Briony's father has funded.  Cecilia and Robbie are on the verge of a passionate romance, but through Briony's eyes, Robbie's actions take on a more sinister connotation.  When one of Briony's cousins is sexually assaulted, Briony pins the crime on Robbie, who is sent to prison.<br /><br />The movie jumps ahead to 1940.  Robbie, released from prison to join the British Army, is one of many soldiers awaiting evacuation from Dunkirk as the German Army closes in.  In flashback, we learn that Robbie and Cecilia, a nurse working in London, rekindled their romance before Robbie shipped out for France.  Briony, now 18 years old, has begun to appreciate the dimensions of the tragedy she unleashed by her false testimony in 1935.  She has passed up college to become a trainee nurse in a hospital dealing with battlefield wounded.  We see her reach out to her sister and Robbie in an attempt to make amends.<br /><br />The final narrative leap is to a studio interview with an aging Briony(Vanessa Redgrave), who has just finished her 21st and last novel.  The novel is about the tragedy of 1935, an effort to atone for what her mistake cost Cecilia and Robbie.  In this interview, the final plot twist is delivered, and the viewer can now make sense of a movie told from multiple points of view.<br /><br />Sets and costumes are perfectly chosen for each time and place in the movie.  The evocation of Dunkirk is heartbreakingly real.  Director Joe Wright delivers a spectacularly long tracking shot that portrays the full horror and chaos of the evacuation beach.  Knightley, McAvoy, and the three women who play Briony at different ages do a very good to excellent job imparting emotional punch to an austere storyline.  An example is Briony's moving attempt to comfort a dying French soldier in hospital.  The ending is likely unexpected for those who have not read the novel, and may be more or less satisfying depending on the value the viewer places on the literary device that conveys the final plot twist.<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommended as a well-done and thoughtful viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>This is a very faithful adaptation of a fine novel, and like the source material it is veddy British at the outset and takes the patience to stay with its story for the ample, though sad, rewards of its outcome.  I haven't seen a better evocation of a literary work in recent memory, and the visual look of the film is marvelous, from the stately English manor, to WWII London to the hell of Dunkirk.<br /><br />This will not be a film for all comers.  As stated, like the book, it takes its time to unfold, and although at its center there is a fervent and desperate passion, overlaying it is all that British propriety.  This is stripped away in layers as we come to know these people and the terrible lies and deceptions that ruin lives begun from a central misperception by a bright prodigy who assumes things beyond her limits to know and brings about tragedy.<br /><br />Worth the going for those willing to wait for clarity amidst a marvelously rendered atmosphere, with fine performances, most notably James McAvoy's Robbie and Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony, within cleverly imagined script and direction.  In the end I found the complex story nicely told, and, finally, a touching and sad tale of tragic error and its aftermath and the final resignation to the only atonement possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted because I ended up sitting in a front row aisle.  Nonetheless, the film was cinematically pleasing.  Some of the dialogue is rather simplistic.  However, you have to keep in mind the story is told from the viewpoint of a thirteen-year-old girl whose testimony caused a serious disruption in the lives of her sister and the lover.  The actors are essentially acting  out how young Briony, our main character, sees these circumstances.  Briony spends all her life trying to overcome her guilt for what she put the lovers through.  I can see how incredibly hard it must have been for director Joe Wright to adapt this intrinsic story into a visual masterpiece the audience could comprehend.  It is easy to get bored, and the beginning is rather slow. Be  patient with it.  Everything and every character has a purpose.  It all becomes clear at the end of the movie.  Vanessa Redgrave and James McAvoy were great, but Keira didn't do so hot this time.  Focused, yes, but her lines were often preemptive and forced.  That's great for Elizabeth Bennett.  Not suitable for vulnerable Cecilia.<br /><br />Not quite Best Picture worthy, but definitely deserving of some awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>While some may be astounded at the considerably unanticipated conclusion, or question what direction the film will take due to the constant shifting back and forth through time, Atonement unquestionably provides a story few have seen before. With piercing typewriter sounds blended into a strikingly catchy score and superlative acting all around, this is a sweeping, epic love story that is sure to receive Oscar attention in the coming months. Tragedies as rich and fulfilling as this are seldom indeed.<br /><br />Young Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) feels matured beyond her age of 13, and thinks only of adult tasks such as writing and conducting her play, The Trials of Arabella. When she sees her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightley) being approached by Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son, whom she has a childish crush on, she becomes jealous. That evening, visitor Lola Quincy is attacked and raped by a friend of the family during a search for her runaway brothers, and Briony names Robbie as the culprit. Wrongfully accused, but with no witnesses to clear him, he is sentenced to prison. Given the option to serve in the army rather than to rot in prison, he is quickly swept up into the atrocities of World War II. Meanwhile, Cecelia waits for him faithfully, serving as a nurse, and as Briony grows up she realizes the anguish she's put the two lovers through, and desperately seeks a way to right her wrongs.<br /><br />The most discommodious aspect of Atonement is the manner in which time is lapsed and then backtracked, and mixed up in every method possible. At points the film jumps forward by several years, slides back a few months, repeats events from different character's perspectives, and meets back up with itself at others. There's even a segment that plays in reverse and in slow motion. It is an artistic concept, but seems to serve little purpose in a film that focuses so heavily on character development and an unconventional love story.<br /><br />The love story is unique in the sense that the intervention by Briony causes a need for narration from only one viewpoint, despite scenes being shown from many character's perspectives. She struggles with the guilt of realizing how her meddling with their lives may prevent her from ever being able to achieve true atonement. The film follows her as she grows up and becomes a well-known author, and is finally able to write an autobiographical account of her life that includes her horrendous mistakes and how they affected Cecelia and Robbie. With the beauty of her brand of fiction comes embellishment and adjectives that mask the truth, for which she has abandoned in a final attempt to give the two lovers happiness. For her, truth no longer serves a purpose and in an effort to amend her estrangement from both family and ultimately love (what she refers to as an act of kindness), she writes her story the way she believes it ought to be told.<br /><br />Technically, while there are a few noticeable prop inaccuracies, the cinematography is gorgeous and the music is unforgettable. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey employs long tracking shots and seamlessly edited sequences in which the camera follows characters as they witness the aftermaths of various battlefields. The dead bodies of a young girl's school are laid out like railroad tracks, enemy horses are summarily executed like, ironically, humans, and a beachfront war zone showcases the dead and dying troops as they attempt to regroup. Through each scene, the score beautifully accompanies the wondrous imagery, and the most noticeable of all is the penetrating typewriter strokes that permeate the rhythms of the piano-heavy theme music.<br /><br />"Come back to me," Cecelia pleads with Robbie, who has undergone mental stresses that prevent him from fulfilling his dreams of marriage and living in a picturesque white beachside cottage. Both powerful and profoundly emotional, this Joe Wright directed film, based on Ian McEwan's novel, is a rare treat among the largely predictable fodder frequenting the theaters this year.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>A lot of recent movies have tried to create suspense by telling their stories in bits and pieces. Flashbacks and flash-forwards abound. With "Atonement," we get a number of these time displacements, plus we have the added fragmentation of a story sometimes told from different viewpoints, in brief imitation of "Roshomon."<br /><br />The Director apparently hoped to hold our interest by making archeologists of us all, uncovering one shard after another, engaging us, challenging us to put the pieces together into the final unified piece of pottery. Half-way through though, I felt as if there might just be too many missing pieces here to warrant my continued efforts.<br /><br />Another problem with the movie is that it set up false expectations. Its backdrops don't quite match its theme. The central tragedy of the film is launched in the 1930's in a large English estate taken right out of the pages of a classic Agatha Christie who-dun-it. There are long corridors and balconies, all slightly darkened, all gleaming sinisterly with polished wood. In standard Christie-style, some members of the upper-class gather here for a house party where they mingle with gardeners, butlers, and other factotums of the estate. The standard illicit love affairs, rivalries, and tensions brew among this cast of characters. All this leads the viewer to expect a neatly clipped murder in the library.<br /><br />However, while there is a crime committed, and while there is some question about who did it - the mystery is not at all the sort of puzzled contrivance that we have been set up for. The viewer is all of a sudden shifted into the very much less contained, much less solvable gore of the WWII evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk. From there, we're launched onto a sea of murky moral considerations and motives.<br /><br />The result is a somewhat pretentious collage of mismatched fragments that it gets a chore to relate and relate to. There might have been a good point buried here, about the inscrutability of a lot of human motivation and about how an off-the-cuff deception can lead to hugely tragic consequence. But that worthwhile theme seems to get lost in the battlefield smoke of Dunkirk.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>The story is a romantic emotional one, taking place during the 1930s.<br /><br />The film director has played the emotional card rather well, and I must say the sets, the decors and costumes are marvelous.<br /><br />The actors were well cast, and is especially obvious through Briony.<br /><br />I say "almost perfect" because Keira Knightley just doesn't appear to act properly for the time period. All other actors are quite decent, and seem well directed. But Keira...<br /><br />Superb cinematography. The images are quite stunning.<br /><br />Clearly one of the best of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film is based on one of the finest novels written in the last 20 years. Because of the beauty and power of the book, I was concerned that the film would not be able to capture the depth, romance, tragedy, and meaning of the book. I must say, the film does a great job. The acting is superb and Kira Knightly provides one of her most powerful performances to date. Three actresses play the role of her younger sister, Briony, each capturing the internal dynamics of this conflicted character at various stages of her life. I say `conflicted' because at each stage of her life in the film Briony is undergoing some internal and external turmoil.<br /><br />The elegant English country house with its Triton fountain; the sandy beaches of Dunkirk filled with the horrors and chaos of thousands of wounded English soldiers without leadership, water, food or hope; the tragic army hospital fully of the suffering, maimed and dying; and the chaos of London during the air war; all of these come vividly alive in the film.<br /><br />The actors engaged in character development of the highest level. The characters are seen in both romantic and tragic situations. The film's sense of history, especially warfare, and the effects of history on the individual's life trajectory is superb.  The film also captures all the signs of classism and its destructive forces. In some ways it is classism that has separated Cecelia and Robbie at college and it is classism that is one of the barriers to their romance. It is also classism that contributes to Robby's imprisonment since those persons in the film guilty of crimes would rather see a poor boy imprisoned rather than risk any loss of face. The depiction of the horrors of war was moving.  The dead and dying are seen in general during sweeping shots of battlefield and hospital, and in particular tragedy such as Robbie's discovery of the mass grave of French school girls or Briony's last conversation with a young French soldier who was missing half his skull.<br /><br />Rather than discuss the plot which you will see by watching the film, I would prefer to discuss the themes that the film explores with great insight.<br /><br />The first theme that I found engaging was that of maturity of emotion and development of personal character/courage, as exemplified in the character of Briony. What is it within us that matures? Briony finds that with time her emotions mature, allowing her to turn down college and to engage as a nurse probationer in an army hospital in the middle of war-torn London. Her sister Cecelia is also serving as a nurse in London. At night in the hospital attic Briony writes her first novel "Two Figures at a Fountain". The creative impulse must also undergo maturation. Movement toward the state of artistic control means curtailing and directing the imagination, rather than allowing it to run wild. Briony at first does not understand this lesson and many of the people she loves most are punished as a result. It is important, in regard to understanding this film, that imagination creates the tragedy.<br /><br />The second theme I found engaging was the effects of classism, a social structure that acts as a barrier but can be overcome by those with courage and compassion. Cecelia and Robbie's love was first impeded by class until a happy accident allows Cecelia to understand the level of passion that Robbie secretly holds for her. Passion can move us beyond social definitions and confinements and toward a more authentic life. When Robbie accidently sends the obscene note to Cecelia, its authenticity breaks every barrier and releases them to experience pent up and held back affections and passions. The note, with its direct crude language, hits Cecelia almost like Zen enlightenment, revealing to her all that she had felt but hidden under a veneer of social control.<br /><br />The third theme I found engaging was that of the nature of atonement itself. Atonement has both internal and external manifestations, depending on whether the transgression has damaged the self or others or both. Briony makes both an internal atonement as she pursues life as a nurse, treating the horribly wounded soldiers. But she also makes an external atonement as she attempts to rectify the damage she has done. She does this through fiction, through imaginative narrative.<br /><br />Maturity means foresight into the consequences of our decisions and actions and this force is hopefully paired with growing character which is the willingness to accept responsibility for those decisions and actions when they go astray. Thus experience that results in increased control of emotion, forethought, and assuming responsibility when wrong are those forces that bring about a healthy maturity with corresponding character development. The film develops this theme beautifully, even to the final scenes of the film, where the elderly Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave, reflects on this process that she underwent so many years before and the way that she has constructed atonement for herself and those she loved and lost. I was imagination that created the tragedy and it is imagination that brings about the atonement.<br /><br />Very few works of literature are as profound, moving, and sublime as the original novel. The film captures this world with rare power, grace and beauty.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Perhaps it was just not possible to fully adapt the acclaimed novel by Ian McEwan into a film. Had it not been for Kiera Knightly, James McAvoy, and Vanessa Redgrave's combined thespian talents ... this movie wouls have been a watery rendition of the story.<br /><br />Set in England in 1935, an imaginative and romantically jealous 13-year-old girl makes an accusation that ends up destroying three lives. Briony Tallis, a budding writer, secretly fancies Robbie Turner, the son of the family hosuekeeper. Just back from Cambridge, Robbie and Briony's older sister Cecilia, are fighting their internal feelings for one another on the hottest day of the year. A misplaced letter finds itself in the hands of Briony which triggers the fateful accusation that lands Robbie in jail and Cecilia estranged from her family.<br /><br />Five years later, the teenage Briony is a nurse in training in London during the second world war and tries to makes ammends to her sister. Robbie is fighting in the British army and stranded in France while Ceclia lives in a modest flat in Belham living off her hospital wages. Briony uses her literary ability to attone for her inner shame and guilt over what she did. However, there is nothing that can be done to restore Robbie or Cecilia's shattered lives.<br /><br />Through a series of flashbacks and other scenes we learn that Briony has relied on her imagination to heal the rift between her sister and Robbie. The very same imagination that caused her to rip them apart in the first place. In the end, there is no true attonement for any of them. Lynn Redgrave as the old Briony brings the story to its sad ending of unfinished business and love lost by one lie.</p></br></body></html>

It's also well made and creepy. Gaspard Ulliel plays Hannibal Lector who wants revenge on starving soldiers who ate his little sister right in front of him when he was young. Once he starts killing he starts to enjoy it a little too much.<br /><br />  The movie plays a little like Batman Begins. He gets some training in the way of the sword. Then all of a sudden he's ready to be a killer and it comes easy to him. "Spoiler", he kills a guy that disrepects a woman he has feelings for. She's even a bit out there, she acts as if receiving the head is like getting a dosen roses and says "you shouldn't have done this for me".<br /><br />  Things like that are a bit silly but Gaspard Ulliel still does a good job carrying the movie as Hannibal Lector even if he is no Anthony Hopkins. His expressions basically make his performance though. He has fun in the movie playing Hannibal and throwing out one-liners here and there. But I doubt viewers will have as much of a good time with all the over the top violence. So for that I can only mildly recommend this movie. Also eventhough Gaspard faired well as Hannibal, I rather see Anthony Hopkins back one more time to make a better movie than Hannibal. I know there's Red Dragon but I rather see another sequel than a prequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>Sociopaths of the Lecter variety are either born, or they are created by maltreatment from earliest infancy.  The Hannibal character in this film/story was much too far along in age... was he six, or seven?... to have been vulnerable to the mind-warping machinations which produce psychopathic behavior toward others.  It was attempted in the story to show that he had no feelings, as when he registered nothing on the lie-detector test, and the French police detective said that the "human" part of Lecter had died in the snow, when he was found by Russian soldiers.<br /><br />It's feasible that the character would want revenge for seeing his sister murdered and cannibalized, but ordinarily that would not make him demented toward other people... not to the extent that one becomes a regular serial killer.<br /><br />I think Thomas Harris dropped the ball with his Hannibal origins.  His book "Red Dragon" was actually the best tale in the series, with the best plot and characterization.  The rest has been entertaining, but the rest has all lacked the same depth as the book "Red Dragon" exhibited.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, a young Hannibal watches as his parents violently die, leaving his young sister in his care. Alone and without any means of support, he is forced to live in a Soviet orphanage. He flees to Paris to find his uncle has died but his Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li) welcomes him. Even her kindness and love cannot soothe the nightmares and sorrows that plague him. Showing a cunning aptitude for science he is accepted into medical school, which serves to hone his skills and provide the tools to exact justice on the war criminals that haunt him day and night. This quest will ignite an insatiable lust within a serial killer who was not born, but made. Entertaining and a surprisingly fitting addition to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>Despite the presence of the stunning Gong Li sauntering about in a silky bathrobe and a fairly decent performance from Gaspard Ulliel, I still have to summarise this film with a pronounced and very distinct "meh", simply because the sheer nastiness present in Harris' other tales of the good doctor was missing and because of some very lazy continuity. Simply put, when viewed in light of what comes later in the illustrious doctor's career, all credibility goes out of the window. It would have made far more sense if said cannibalistic killer had gone by a different name in Europe and had adopted the name 'Hannibal Lecter' upon entering Canada /America. That I could've forgiven. As it is, this film just doesn't make sense with regard to the continuity of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A ridiculous movie that has almost nothing in common with Silence of the Lambs (though it might share a kinship to the freakshow that was Hannibal), Hannibal Rising is neither interesting nor plausible nor well-made: apparently only Anthony Hopkins was holding this franchise together.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Sure, this does not have Anthony Hopkins, but how could it?  This is the backstory to the great series of books/films in the Hannibal Lector series.  Based in Lithuania and France during the WWII and the aftermath of the Nurenberg Trials, Hannibal Rising takes us through a backstory of how a montser is born.  Guspard Illiel does a decent job as a young Lector, but the performance was a bit stale, but it is tought to follow Sir Hopkins.  The overall cast was decent, story plausable and reasonable fit with the story of the series.  I'm sure this will not be the last in this series.  There will likely be a filler inbetween this one and Manhunter/Red Dragon soon to come in the next 2 years.  Worth going to see if you are a fan, and if you are new, see Manhunter (better of the two) or Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Hannibal Rising" is great! The cast led by Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal Lecter and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu, is great. The directing by Peter Webber (who also directed "Girl With A Pearl Earring" (2003) is excellent!

The casting by Leo Davis (who also did the casting to "The Queen" (2006) is excellent. The production design by Allan Starski (who won the Oscar for his work on "Schindler's List" (1993) and also did the production design to "The Pianist" (2002) is excellent. The set decoration by Judy Farr & Karel Van&aacute;sek (who also did the set decoration to "Hostel" (2006) is excellent. The costume design by Anna B.

Plays out like Hitler Week on the History channel, only with People-Eating! I mean, honest to God, how do you make a movie about a serial killer cannibal psychiatrist boring? Ask director Peter Webber, he did it.<br /><br />LONG REVIEW, or, PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO EAT PEOPLE, ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. The little nihlist spin Jon Demme gave "The Phantom of the Opera" could be summarized in three words: nasty, shocking, evil. When I first saw it, for a few weeks I recommended it be burned. The effect of that chicken-skin netherworld of inky-black grue was like standing in a meat locker and having a spitting black electric eel, its skin still slick with tepid water, dumped down your pants.<br /><br />"Silence of the Lambs" felt like pure Evil because it was meant to: it was a bleak nightworld highway of Hell with no offramps. The audience was dumped into a world where sanity stood on its head. Hannibal Lecter, society psychiatrist, was the very epitome of that film's brutal wrongness: a finely concocted, meticulously educated, disarmingly sophisticated monster whose refinement only serves as a pressure cooker for the ferocity and savagery lurking just within the urbane exterior.<br /><br />Take any two minutes of grandmaster Anthony Hopkins's performance: it practically bristles a perfectly modulated, barely contained menace.<br /><br />That menace---that sense of a hinged trapped set to spring on naught but a muscle tremor---is totally absent in "Hannibal Rising": Young Sherlock Hannibal (French actor Gaspard Ulliel, who probably does a fine job when he's talking Frog) bristles with all the menace of a cow-eyed virgin schoolboy visiting Europe for the first time. The only time Ulliel really rises to the occasion is when he gets all jiggy with a samurai mask and sword. And then, only for a moment.<br /><br />And it's really not even poor Mr. Ulliel's fault that "Hannibal Boring" struggles to breathe and dies on the slab: more than anything it's the flick's whole schizophrenic struggle to humanize a guy who likes nothing better than a little Homo Sapiens pate with his champagne breakfest. Hey, who are we to judge! The SS ate his sister! Imagine what a little kidney-biting could have done for Schindler's List!<br /><br />Nor can you blame the screenwriter for the flaccid storyline: lay that at writer Thomas Harris's door, an author who hasn't had magic in his typewriter since, well, ever. Harris's backstory to his foodie supervillain was: Hannibal, budding Lithuanian aristocrat, has to deal with World War 2! Hannibal loses baby sister to some fascists with, uhm, diverse palates! Hannibal makes it through, baby! Hannibal gets even, along with a nice first edition copy of Julia Child's "Joy of Cooking".<br /><br />At the end of the day, though, "Hannibal Sleeping" fails because it spends all its time answering the most tiresome question of our dull Age: "Why". Asking "Why?" is a nice long drive up Nowhere Lane. Why did the big bad man capture a schoolbus full of little kids, cut them up into a million pieces, and airmail all the parts to Guam?<br /><br />Why is pointless: why not? (the central question in "Silence of the Lambs") is far more amusing. Why does there need to be a why? Sexuality leads us to the precipice from which we may view the futility of the question, where why is buried beneath thrashy seconds, minutes, hours, days of sweaty insanity and pheremonal depravity.<br /><br />Why? Because it feels good, Clarisse.<br /><br />Which can't be said of this flop. "Hannibal Rising" is zero red meat and lots of tofu, sprouts, and sushsi: fifteen minutes later and you'll be hungry again.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hannibal Rising (Peter Webber, 2007)<br /><br />Now, I have to say, I watched a whole lot of movies this weekend. But still, you have to ask yourself: how memorable was Hannibal Rising if I forgot about it while listing out the movies I'd seen this weekend to review, and not remembered to add it to that list for over an hour?<br /><br />Now, I'll admit that I'm judging this movie more harshly than I otherwise would because it's from the long-bleeding and damned-close-to-dead Hannibal franchise, but screenwriter Harris (adapting from his own novel) and director Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) really invite that sort of thing; there are little visual clues to the other movies littered throughout, including the infamous scene of a young Lecter (A Very Long Engagement's Gaspard Ulliel) trying on the bottom half of the samurai mask, which directly resembles the masked forced upon Anthony Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs. Even that would be forgivable if the armor ever ended up being more than set decoration in this movie. But no-- it's there for the sole purpose of throwing the audience a biscuit. Really, what can you say to that?<br /><br />Divorced from the mythology, it would probably be a serviceable little thriller, a kind of I Spit on Your Grave-lite. Lecter and his family are living in Lithuania in 1944-- not a very nice place to be, as the Germans and the Russians are about to collide on their doorstep. Eight-year-old Hannibal, his younger sister Mischa, and his mother and father, along with some servants, retreat to the country house just before the Germans, with some SS-wannabe tagalongs headed by Grutas (Danny Deckchair's Rhys Ifans), get to Lecter Castle and start murdering the help. Through various chains of coincidence, the surviving Lecters and Grutas' band both end up barricaded in the country house, where bad things happen, and Hannibal vows revenge. Yeah, you've heard it all a million times before. And it works, kind of, in the sense that you know what's coming within a few minutes of the opening (really, if you've seen the rest of the movies in the canon, you knew what was coming from the moment you first heard this movie was in production). In that respect, it's analogous to any of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels; you're looking forward to the next inventive death, rather than worrying about such details as plot, characterization, etc. All of which do exist here as a kind of thin veneer, so at least it ranks above any Friday the 13th after the second one.<br /><br />One high point n the movie bears mentioning, though. I've been seeing more and more of Richard Brake (who here plays one of Grutas' underlings) recently, usually in really, really bad movies. But the more I see of the guy, the more I like him. He's wonderful at playing slime. One of these days, he's going to break out and become "that guy you know, but can never remember his name," like William Fichtner. Be ready, you can say you knew him when.<br /><br />Other than that, really, as long as you can turn your brain off for two hours and aren't terribly insulted by Harris' pandering, you'll have some fun with this. **</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I like the Silence of the Lamb series of movies, as well as the Manhunter movie. THis is a movie based around the life of the young hannibal lecter, a young noble from lithuania...who would have guessed it. It shows that initially his blood lust was out of revenge, and how it evolved to much more.  My only question is how did he become Dr. Lecter, because it seams he left medical school in this movie to go to Canada to get the "last man"  that murdered his sister.  Overall though, i did enjoy the movie dispite some flaws. There are some good Hannibal lines in the movie to quote, and the plot was something different. I guess I was hoping to see a movie that was set just before he was captured and put in jail, and the crimes he commited to get their. This movie starts our in his past way before that.  Check it out, decent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Some movies don't need to be made...simple as that.  This applies 100% to "Hannibal Rising", a film that is completely unnecessary to the Hannibal cannon and should never have been made.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Hannibal Rising" tells the story of young man Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) who comes into his psychotic personality after a terrifying experience involving his young sister & cannibalism.  After becoming an orphan and moving in with his aunt Lady Murasaki (Li Gong), Hannibal vows to find his sister's tormentors and inflict grisly punishment on them.<br /><br />Besides all the other laughable stuff (for example, the young Hannibal putting on a barred mask) in this film, the glaring weakness is easy to identify: Hannibal Lecter was scary because he couldn't be understood.  As human beings, it is difficult for us to understand the mentality behind a cannibal, and that is why Anthony Hopkins' Lecter was so creepy.  Trying to explain Lecter's flesh-hungers is not only probably impossible, but also just plain dumb.  There needed to be some endgame thoughts before even pitching this movie, such as "what purpose will it serve?" or "does this story really need to be told?".<br /><br />It doesn't help that the acting is nothing special and there is no psychological tension whatsoever.  Pretty much just emotionally flat all the way through.<br /><br />Overall, then, I consider "Hannibal Rising" to be one of the most ill-conceived movies of all-time.  It didn't need to be made, and then even when it was it was made very poorly (likely in order to try and attract a younger audience to the Hannibal franchise).  Save yourself over two hours of boredom and skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>We really thought this was a well done film in the Hannibal Lector saga.<br /><br />In fact, I have to confess I never really saw the fascination with the original "Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />I always felt that film was kind of bland and never understood how it became such a craze. Perhaps I will watch it again sometime soon now and see if I like it better all these years later.<br /><br />But as I sit here writing this today, I would have to say I found this new "prequel"-- HANNIBAL RISING to be a more entertaining and intriguing film than the original that started it all.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Gaspard Ulliel gives us a fine performance as a young Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter. HANNIBAL RISING presents the infamous character brought so brilliantly to life by Anthony Hopkins in a surprisingly sympathetic light.<br /><br />Ten-year-old Hannibal and his younger sister Mischa, growing up in World War II-era Lithuania, are taken prisoner by a group of local Partisans who seem to have no loyalties whatsoever. During captivity, Hannibal is exposed to the most abhorrent of all atrocities. He spends the remainder of the film wreaking vengeance on the men who so profoundly scarred him.<br /><br />Lecter's behavior is violent and lurid throughout the film. Nonetheless, he is an avenging angel, albeit with a bizarre moral compass. This is more than can be said for the depraved people he targets.<br /><br />That being as it is, Lecter's intentions become not only understandable but laudable, even when his actions in themselves are repugnant. Questions of flaw, fault, and guilt tease the viewer throughout, forcing consideration of the conclusion that a dark justice is still justice.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Some franchises should just know when it's time to hang it up once and for all.  Hannibal Rising is a prequel to everything else we've seen our favorite cannibal in, and upon viewing it you may wish you hadn't.  If you read Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel, then you'll probably remember the brief glimpse of backstory given to Hannibal Lecter's (Gaspard Ulliel) origin, of which this prequel capatilizes on.  As we witness the atrocities performed on Lecter and his family, we see the boy grow towards adulthood with revenge on his mind, and who can blame him really?  What kills Hannibal Rising is that Lecter isn't frightening at all throughout the film.  What helped make Silence of the Lambs so good, and to a degree Red Dragon (I wasn't fond of Ridley Scott's Hannibal at all) is that Lecter was a frightening, and brilliant, psychopath who became one of the most memorable screen villians of all time.  Here, he's relegated to a sympathetic state, and it doesn't work.  Not to mention that to say that Gaspard Ulliel doesn't fit the role is saying it lightly, and the rest of an otherwise solid cast (including Gong Li, Kevin McKidd, and Dominic West) are pretty much wasted in their roles.  Peter Webber's direction, while stylish, is ultimately empty, and a majority of the film plays out like an overlong slasher.  While there are a good amount of creepy moments and some solid, grisly effects, Hannibal Rising is a dud, and hopefully, the means to an end for a franchise that has been picked clean.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Hannibal Rising is a good, solid thriller. It tells a heartbreaking story of a boy whose parents were killed during WW2, his younger sister murdered and eaten by savage looters who were fighting neither for Russian army nor for German one but for themselves. After some years of wandering, growing up and finally finding a decent home he starts looking for those prowlers to kill them one by one in most brutal ways a viewer can only imagine. The story-line saves some twists for us along with all the necessary bloody and disturbing details. Sounds nice. But not if it's a story of a young Hannibal Lecter. So four stars go to this film as to a picture apart, not as to another segment of life of Dr. Lecter.<br /><br />And it's not the fact that Hannibal Rising doesn't contain even 10 percent of psychological intensity of The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Jonathan Demme's film we were dazed and horrified by Dr. Lecter's evil ways. Such a monstrosity was always beyond our comprehension. We could just conjecture what his childhood had been like and how he had come to be such a villain as he was. Dr. Lecter's background and his psyche always remained a mystery to us. Usually people of this kind come from normal families, they have normal lives, and their small deviations are not seen untill the time comes. But here, in Hannibal Rising, everything is pretty simple and all the explanations are restricted by limits understandable to Everyman. By Freud for example. Yes, young Hannibal witnessed the death of his parents, he saw his sister brutally murdered and eaten by a bunch of subhumans. Certainly now we know why he's such an evil and why he eats people! Oh, the filmmakers forgot to discover if he peed in his bed as a boy and whether he was breastfed untill he was two years old. I mean, c'mon... Some things are better kept secret, really.<br /><br />We were always amazed by Dr. Lecter's education and sophistication. Now we get to know in his teens he was raised by his aunt who was Japanese and tought him everything exquisite and elegant she knew from her homeland including bushido... Oh, and her family died in 1945 in Hiroshima(!) Come on now, people!<br /><br />I truly believe Thomas Harris shouldn't have written this book. But since he's a talented writer and since Dino De Laurentiis is a talented producer and a person who knows how to squeeze everything possible from a story, Hannibal Rising came out to be rather good and professional. It will come to no one's mind to compare it to The Silence..., and people may argue about whether it's better or worse than Manhunter, Hannibal or Red Dragon, but anyway it's better to embrace this film as a separate work of art. This way you won't be disappointed. Not so known Gaspard Ulliel played young Hannibal which is a good thing because wide audience doesn't know him and he can be scarier and more ominous than any other famous actor. For that matter I also liked the rest of the cast. Not that famous but brilliant Rhys Ifans and beautiful Li Gong, popular in China but known in the West mainly by Mamoirs of Geisha and Miami Vice are extremely interesting to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>A complete waste of time and money.

Not the way this series should have ended.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the history of cinema there are many great cinematic villains that have terrified movie audiences over the years. Often times they are frightening in appearance or deeds, sometimes they are misunderstood or victims of circumstance, and they can even be so captivating that you can't help but pay attention to their many evil acts. These great villains range from the dreaded Darth Vader, to the slashers known as Freddy, Jason, and Leatherface, or the brilliant evil genius' of the James Bond films, to the most feared psychological villain of all time, Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. Moviemakers lately have felt the need to explain the origins to some of cinema's classic villains from George Lucas' prequel trilogy of 'Star Wars' films, to Leatherface's lackluster origin story in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning", the most recent addition to the list of villains getting the origin treatment would be Hannibal Lecter in the Weinstein Company's adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel, "Hannibal Rising".<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is the origin story of Hannibal Lecter, showing how he went from being an innocent young boy in Lithuania to society's most deadly, cannibalistic serial killer. As a young boy in Lithuania, Hannibal witnessed the deaths of his parents in World War 2, leaving he and his sister Mischa to fend for themselves. Just when Hannibal thought things couldn't get worse, a group of militia men invade their home, taking Hannibal and Mischa hostage. Soon, food begins to become sparse, and the militia gets desperate and chooses to survive by taking Mischa's life for food. Some time after that, grown up and in college, Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel), is mastering every course he takes, and well on his way to earning his doctorate. Little does his professors know that Hannibal hides a dark, deadly secret. In his own time he is obsessively pursuing the men that formed the militia that took his sister's life, and if there's one thing Hannibal intends to do when he finds them, it's take his pound of flesh for their crime.<br /><br />The decision to make a prequel to the popular Hannibal Lecter trilogy of films seemed like a waste of time and space, simply a way for the studio to just cash in on the character's well-known name. Which left me feeling like this would be a pathetic movie, because more than likely not a single person associated with the previous films would be involved, and for the most part I was right on that count, but there was a glimmer of a chance that this movie would be more than expected. Shortly after the film was greenlit, it was announced that the movie was being written by none other than Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, based on his novel of the same name that he was in the process of finishing up. With that prospect, I thought that "Hannibal Rising" (at the time the movie was being called "Young Hannibal") just may stand a chance of equaling its predecessors in terms of quality storytelling and acting that is among the best Hollywood has to offer.<br /><br />Well, as good of a writer Thomas Harris is, or I should say was (his other three books in the Lecter series are great works of fiction), this novel and the screenplay that was based on it are far inferior to anything offered in the other installments. I was disappointed by the movie for several reasons; first I felt the actor chosen to portray young Hannibal was only okay. I understand he was trying to only give hints as to what this character will become later on, and I'll give it to the actor, there were a couple of times that I saw a glimpse of Anthony Hopkins' creepy portrayal seep in, but these were few and far between. For the most part the actor was just flat in his performance and apparently the only expression he really knew how to make was a snarl, he didn't really have any of the nuances that Anthony perfected in this character. Second, it seemed like Hannibal took to cannibalism a little too easily. I understand that he saw his sister suffer at the hands of evil militia men, and seeing that would definitely scar a young child, but when he kills the first soldier and commits his first act of cannibalism, there is no uncertainty or disdain for what he's doing. He simply does the deed, doesn't appear to be bothered by it, in fact he may even have enjoyed it (the movie really doesn't explain this), and moves on in search of the next victim on his list. Which brings me to my third problem with this movie; aside from revenge being his motive for killing the killers of his sister, he doesn't show any further conviction to commit murder. Leaving one to wonder why he continued after achieving his vengeance, did committing all those acts of murder and cannibalism become such an obsession for him outside of revenge that he just felt compelled to do more or what? This was an aspect that wasn't explained, and I felt should have been, especially since this was to be the origin of his evil life and a deep psychological profile into the why of his life of crime. Instead, Thomas Harris' screenplay and novel barely scratched the surface, no doubt because the Weinstein's are hoping to cash in on further installments of prequels, since Hopkins is probably through portraying the character. And my final complaint would have to be that there was no cameo by Anthony Hopkins, the least they could have done was bring him in during the final moments of the film to link it in to the other three. Instead, he gets his revenge, the story ends, and the credits roll. Nothing linking it in to the other films, aside from the name of the lead character.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is not the worst film ever made, it's actually an average movie, and if it was the first in the series to be made, it may have seemed better, but when comparing it to the other three already in the franchise, it pales in comparison. The other movies contained many psychological aspects to them, especially "The Silence of the Lambs", "Red Dragon" and "Hannibal" did to an extent just not as much, but this film didn't contain any. There was potential, especially given that Hannibal endured a horrific childhood which is the root of his evil, but aside from a few dream sequences we don't get much insight into his character, and the dreams only serve to show us exactly what the militia did to him and his sister. Which is probably where the biggest problem of this film lies, is that in trying to explain why Hannibal is who he is, the makers of the film try to make the audience feel sympathy for him. This is one of modern cinema's greatest movie villains, I don't want to feel sorry for him, I want to see what made him who he is. The filmmakers tried to accomplish the why of the character, but went about it wrong, all they explained was why he was killing the militia, it never explained why he felt the need to continue killing other people that weren't involved in his sister's death. So, because of that the audience feels that his killing is justified, at least in this movie (it's just a really sick brand of justice), and in doing so you sympathize with him. What this all boils down to is that the filmmakers, especially Thomas Harris, really dropped the ball on explaining the origin of Hannibal Lecter, opting simply to give audiences an average revenge tale, just a little gorier than most.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is unrated containing violence, gore, and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>Hannibal Lector is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic villians in modern cinema. Well, at least he was ... until this schlocky, cheesy and embarrassing film came along.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" creates a proposterous backstory of Hannibal Lector as a traumatized child whose sister is cannibalized by soldiers, and then ends up the adopted son/lover of his uncle's Japanese wife. Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club. Whoever thought he was ready to fill the shoes of Sir Anthony Hopkins was clearly off their meds.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is easily the worst film I've seen since "Basic Instinct 2".</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 1944, Hannibal Lecter (Ulliel) sees his parents die in a battle outside the family cabin.  He and his sister are captured by some locals, and in the bleak winter eat Hannibal's sister to survive.  Eight years later, Hannibal seeks out his uncle's widow, Lady Murasaki (Li), and moves in with her.  Hannibal's goal is to locate the guys who ate his sister and kill them.  Hot on his trail is a French police inspector (West), who knows what Hannibal is up to but cannot prove anything.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" may as well be titled "Hannibal: Death of a Franchise".  It is completely unnecessary and makes a joke of everything that has gone before.  Ulliel is greatly miscast and does not even come close to filling the shoes of Anthony Hopkins (who wisely has steered away from this film).  This has to be one of the bigger disappointments in recent years.  Stick with "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Red Dragon", and forget about "Hannibal Rising".</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>"Hannibal Rising" doesn't answer the most important questions. Such as: how does the liver of a war criminal taste with chianti? How many Hilfswillige can you consume at one single occasion? Why weren't there any starlings among the ortolans? And where were the French police when Vichy put little children on trains to Auschwitz?<br /><br />And do Japanese women really have....?<br /><br />Frankly, this movie really sucks. "The silence of the lambs" was a *very* good movie. "Hannibal" was not. Care for some delicious brain, inspector Starling? And now this...<br /><br />Incidentally, I also wonder how a bourgeois defector from Soviet Lithuania could return to the USSR in the middle of the Cold War, using his real name? Perhaps Hannibal the Cannibal had connections with Beria?<br /><br />One star.<br /><br />Time for a snack...</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>It is a rare event indeed when a film adaptation surpasses the novel in just about all aspects.<br /><br />Although Thomas Harris penned the screenplay, when the last credits began to roll, my thought was that the book was merely an incidental, written with the ultimate goal in mind to put the story on the screen. This is a very well produced film, well paced with spectacular detail, and an outstanding performance by unknown, Gaspard Ulliel, capturing that sophisticated, pure evil which we have come to expect from the good doctor: a truly mesmerising performance as the character grows to understand his true nature.<br /><br />To be fair, the book was a sad disappointment, (see my review) making Hannibal into a card- board -cut- out- run-of-the-mill serial killer. It took a lot for me to spend the money to see the film, expecting the adaptation to fall short of the novel, thus when considering the blandness of the text, one would assume the film to be a disaster, not so in the least.<br /><br />Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu is not only stunning but her gentle expressions reveal a sensitive soul and one that truly cared for Hannibal, staging a cover-up for his first murder. Interestingly, it is here we discover Hannibal's prime motivation to kill: terribly rude people, and that poor French butcher, (a Nazi collaborator) after being extremely rude to Lady Shikibu, copped it from Hannibal in a cruel, slow and creative fashion. This was an extremely tense scene in the film, where we first witness Hannibal's creative and great love for the kill.<br /><br />In the film and the novel, including a mention in the last novel, `Hannibal', the reason the good doctor developed his tendency towards the eating of human flesh, still doesn't wash with me. The character is too complex, too intelligent, too self aware to suddenly carve out the delectable cheeks of his second victim and have a one-man barbecue. Harris should have researched a little harder and find what turns highly intelligent people into meat eaters of the human variety.<br /><br />Although the professional critics panned this film, compared with the novel, Hannibal Rising is a good story and a good and fitting contribution to Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs films... a wonderful surprise...a solid four star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Hannibal Rising" is one of the darkest, most heavy-handed films I've ever seen. Yet I absolutely loved it. Even I don't understand why: the circumstances of the plot are ugly, focusing on the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the mind; a majority of the characters are malicious, having little if any regard for humanity; the visuals are more than a little difficult to watch, with disturbing scenes of torture and murder. Such unpleasant material doesn't easily make for an engrossing experience. Nonetheless, I found myself utterly fascinated, unable to avert my eyes from the screen. This is an engaging, shocking, beautifully photographed story of how the quest for vengeance can turn a hurt soul into a monster.<br /><br />Such a person is Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic criminal mastermind made famous by Anthony Hopkins in 1991's "The Silence of the Lambs." This new film chronicles Lecter's early descent into madness, beginning in 1944 with the deaths of his mother, father, and sister in war torn Lithuania (he was only a child then, no more than eight). While his parents were merely shot to death, his baby sister, Mischa (Helena Lia Tachovska), was targeted by a group of German soldiers using the Lecter family lodge as a hideout. Because of the lodge's remoteness, and because it's the dead of winter, the soldiers quickly discover that food is scarce. "If we want to live," says Vladis Grutas (Rhys Ifans) as he savagely eats a puny rabbit, "we must eat!" That's when they all look over at the children, specifically at Mischa.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward eight years. Lecter is now a teenager (Gespard Ulliel), living in an orphanage that was once his family's castle. How tragic: what was once his home is now strictly controlled housing for hundreds of young men. As one might expect, he's not exactly popular among the other boys, especially since he remains silent during the day and screams every night as he dreams of his sister's death. There's some clever manipulation at work here; his painful childhood almost forces us to feel sympathy for the young Hannibal Lecter, even though we know he will eventually become a murderous lunatic. Is he truly insane, like the previous films would lead you to believe, or is he the unfortunate result of humanity's cruelty?<br /><br />No one can definitely answer those questions. All one can do is witness Lecter spiraling out of control, sinking further and further into the depths of hate. At some point, he promises his sister that he will find her murderers and make them pay. Such is the way with revenge: it clouds judgment, reason, and morality, and it leaves a void that cannot be filled, no matter what. Lecter fell victim to such a void as a child, which serves as his driving force for the rest of the film. He devises a plan to escape the orphanage. He then leaves for France and meets his Japanese aunt, Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li). They immediately bond despite his initial reluctance to speak. The bond is made stronger as he watches her pray to her ancestors; she bows in front of her father's samurai armor, seeking strength and courage.<br /><br />We know Lecter is seeking the same thing, especially since an emotional eruption is fast approaching. It finally arrives when he brutally murders a butcher using Murasaki's samurai sword. The butcher was intentionally crafted to be a despicable man; not only did he debase Murasaki, he had also aided the German's in transporting and exterminating Jews during the war. I can't say I felt sorry for him, which I suppose was the intended effect. The scene also establishes Lecter as a cold, calculating psychopath, a personality that's rarely indicative of a sympathetic character. But keep in mind that his family was needlessly murdered; who wouldn't be emotionally scarred by such a dark turn of events? I continuously questioned how I was supposed to feel about this character, even after he enrolls in a prestigious medical school in Paris. His main task, interestingly enough, is preparing cadavers for examination and experimentation.<br /><br />The story's morbidity increases dramatically as Lecter tracks down the German soldiers responsible for his sister's death. Unfortunately, executing his plan will not be as easy as he thought; hot on his trail is Inspector Popil (Dominic West), in charge of capturing and incarcerating war criminals. To some extent, he understands Lecter's pain. This is because he, too, lost family during the war. However, he's also a man of the law, and he refuses to let Lecter's vendetta against a group of soldiers slip through the cracks. The situation is also hard on Murasaki; her family was killed when Hiroshima was bombed. She finds herself torn between loving her nephew and desiring for inner peace.<br /><br />But for Lecter, absolutely everything is clear-cut; all he has left is the need for revenge, something that can never be alleviated even after the wrongdoers are caught. Having his way with the German soldiers makes for some uncomfortable moments, especially since they involve methods of torture that are best left unmentioned. I suppose you can understand why some will be turned off by this movie; as I've already said, it's a dark, dark story of cruelty, obsession, and pain. Writing this review still hasn't helped me to understand why I enjoyed "Hannibal Rising" so much. Maybe it's because I have a deeper understanding of a previously unknown character. True, Hannibal Lecter would go on to do terrible things. Still, I no longer view him as a loathsome monster. I now view him as a pitiable monster, made evil because of a deplorable environment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>Surprisingly, I actually liked this movie. Don't get me wrong it's not something I care to see over and over again, but I think it set the basis for Hannibal Lector fairly. Sometimes, it does kinda get on my nerves that they'll make a movie with 30 different sequels, and then try to take you back to the beginning and show you how it all started. With that being said, some of them are really good, and this is one. I think people are unfairly comparing Gaspard Ulliel to Anthony Hopkins when really there should be no comparison. Gaspard is playing a much younger Hannibal who hasn't grown in age yet, and it's his job to set the stage for the story we all know and love. Which he did do it justice, I might add. I guess since he's an unknown face to the American audience, and he's just now being introduced into a movie portraying a character of this magnitude the comparions were envitable. At any rate,  Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of Hannibal actually takes place many years later when he's much older which should be taken into account. What I like about this movie is that even though cannabalism is a morbid, nasty, and extremely disgusting thought for a sane person. I'm glad to say that's really not the way they portrayed it in this movie. It wasn't done deliberately with the intention of making the audience puke by showing us Hannibal actually eating somebody's flesh, eyeballs, or brains out of their head while they're still alive. It also wasn't way over the top with the blood and gore for no reason like most films these days. I guess that's why a lot of people complain that it's boring, because they didn't get to see somebody's guts or intestines exposed. This movie shows you how Hannibal became the psychological, cannabalistic, monster that he is today. They show you that he's a regular human being that was driven to cannabalism through hurt and the need for revenge after his little sister was eaten by a bunch of savages. I feel a little guilty, but I actually found myself rooting for Hannibal to get his revenge which disturbed me a little bit. Needless to say, I liked it, and I think that the "Silence of the Lambs" as well as the "Manhunter" and "Red Dragon" fans owe it to themselves to see this movie. At least, if their interested in how Hannibal became the cannibal.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>In `Silence of the lambs' both Clarence Starling and Dr. Frederick Chilton desperately try to unravel the monster that is Hannibal Lector. While Chilton fretted over figuring out what made Hannibal tick to broker a book deal, Starling was all too busy trying to solve a crime while becoming emotionally attached to a psychopath. The enigma of Hannibal Lector is what drove that detective story. The sequel `Hannibal' is a pure tale of horror with Hannibal on the loose in society. Within the framework of that story one tempting revelation came to pass... that Hannibal had been through a traumatic World War II experience involving his family and starvation. Nothing could have been more deliciously tempting. Let's face it by the end of `Hannibal' it was the single most mouth-watering eye-opener into the Hannibal diagnosis since we learned that his pulse did not go above 72 while chewing on a nurse.<br /><br />`Hannibal Rising' serves up the best dish yet. The whole movie is one big boiling frothing pot that feeds a Harris fan's ravenous need. For those who are interested, you will be licking the spoon and asking for more. Not only that but this movie is a whole new type of thriller. Who can accuse Harris of being uninspired and clich&eacute;d? The risk of `Hannibal' is worth the experience of `Rising' and then some more. Harris should be commended for rattling our brains and stomach with suggestive images of a boiling child's bath tub while relating it to the horrific incident that is slowly revealed throughout the frames.<br /><br />We get one most realistic depictions of a post-WWII France. Hannibal (a tremendously impressive Gaspard Ulliel), a young holocaust survivor of an all different type, has gaps in his memory and tries to remember the horrible thing that happened to him. Brought up and educated to higher than high standards, his only relation his Japanese aunt (Li Gong, a wonderful addition with Samaria swords and masks included!), the damaged child ferments between the cuts, encountering incidents that illuminate the darkness to reveal an evil so unsettling that drives him on to a type of shocking avenge operation for a motive that exposes you to a awfulness that you have never experienced before. This is a whole lot more than just flirting with the insane. This is exactly what intelligent horror should be. It might be Hannibal 4, but that does not mean it is not good. I thought it was one of the best sequels in recent memory. Not "S.O.L.T", but it can stand alone as a damn fine serial killer movie with plenty of brains to boot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Hannibal Rising suffered severely at the box office because it was implied in the trailers that we'd mainly see a young Hannibal Lecter slashing up the countryside. That kind of marketing certainly didn't lure me into theaters to see it, and--based on its less than $30 million box office gross--much of the public had the same sentiment.<br /><br />At the end of May, Hannibal Rising gets released on DVD and the memory of the slash-'em-up trailer is still in my head, so I'm not compelled to see it, but 4 weeks later I finally do. And it turns out to be one of the better movies that I've seen this year.<br /><br />Funny though...I'm not sure that I'd have appreciated Hannibal Rising as much without first seeing 1991's Silence of the Lambs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> . Oh, it certainly isn't necessary to see Silence of the Lambs prior to seeing Hannibal Rising. Ironically, seeing Lambs before seeing this prequel just puts a better perspective on the things to come as you watch Lecter in his early years. It did for me anyway.<br /><br />In Silence of the Lambs you fear Lecter and what he'll do next. In Hannibal Rising you actually find yourself rooting for him with a kind of sympathy. Hannibal Rising is more a story of revenge than it is a story about a serial killer...kind of like a Rambo <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640S1">First Blood (Special Edition)</a> with class.<br /><br />In Hannibal Rising, you get a great directorial from little known Peter Webber and a terrific performance out of mostly French film actor Gaspard Ulliel. In the beginning sequence Webber went a little overboard with getting us to believe that those who committed the atrocities that ultimately turned Lecter into what he bacame would all be so unified in the decision to commit the atrocities. But the movie really is done well overall and Ulliel played a masterfully diabolical young Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />So forget that the movie poster and DVD cover have a picture of Lecter in what looks like that this'll-prevent-you-from-bitng-me mask (turns out that's not what it is at all). And forget that the trailers showed mainly a young, sinister looking Hannibal Lecter as if about to cut someone open. Hannibal Rising ultimately is less gory than you probably think it will be, and less gory than 2001's Hannibal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXSP">Hannibal</a> . It's not a Horror movie. It's just a very good movie like 1986's Manhunter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008V5RP">Manhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition)</a> and/or its 2002 remake Red Dragon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLKN">Red Dragon - Collector's Edition (Widescreen)</a> .<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say that Hannibal Rising is a classic, as Silence of the Lambs was, but it's very good. Fans of Lambs should take a chance with Hannibal Rising.<br /><br />The missing story in the Lecter chronicles is his doings in the US leading up to his capture by FBI Agent Will Graham (between Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon). Can't wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>this movie turned out to be quite watchable, because i failed to appreciate the book and couldn't finish it. a very tragic story about how hannibal had gradually degenerated himself into a monster. just like the german philosopher said, 'don't turn yourself into a monster while hunt the monster.' become a man-eater is just like after the lion tasted the human flesh, the beast would become obsessed in eating humans, because only the human being's blood is salty that's more tasty than other creatures.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Since this one bombed so badly at the box office I didn't have much hope for it.  After watching it though, it is not that bad.  It is certainly no Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but it was interesting.  The movie is very dark.  Most of the characters have very dark sides.  Though I do have to say that everyone has a reason for their actions which makes it more realistic.  Hopkins is sorely missed, but even the best makeup can't make him 40 years younger to play himself in his early 20's.  The young actor playing young Hannibal is solid and certainly creepy, he also came across a bit flat.  The story is interesting on how Hannibal became the monster he is.  I think the aunt part is not really necessary and muddles things somewhat.  Overall I think this is worth watching if you are a fan of Hannibal, but on its' own it is merely so so.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HANNIBAL RISING may not be in the same league with its predecessors, especially SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it was written by the same author - both the novel and the screenplay - and so we must accept that the arc of the story of the murderous cannibal is intact.  Where this version of how the child Hannibal became the crazed and bizarre man due to his witnessing the loss of his young sister to the appetites of hungry soldiers is less successful than the studies of the grown man is the lack of including the genius mind, epicurean stance, highly sophisticated art lover, and macabre sense of human relationships as shown in the boy to young man period.<br /><br />Filmed in beautiful color and atmosphere the story begins in WW II as stated above and as Hannibal the lad escapes the carnivorous appetites of the Nazi solders (including the evil Grutas as portrayed with gusto by Rhys Ifans!) and becomes Hannibal the young man (Gaspard Ulliel) who with the aid of his aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) continues to search out all of the soldiers who ate his sister.  And in the end we do discover some hidden secrets about the now mature Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />Director Peter Webber keeps the pace and the gore going and has at his side a fine supporting cast (Richard Brake, Kevin McKidd, Stephen Walters,  Ivan Marevich, and Goran Kostic among others).  Ulliel is credible in the minimal dialog is given and it probably is the fault of Thomas Harris that this young Hannibal doesn't show all the key characteristics he will eventually flaunt. It is not a bad film, just not one that will be remembered as well as the originals.  Grady Harp, August 07</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Finally, again a thriller that has it all: suspense, style, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, great photography, first-class acting, and a very good soundtrack. This Hannibal edition is the perfect precursor to Silence of the Lambs. Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal Lecter is superb - you can't ask for more, ... an extremely talented actor.<br /><br />The exotic touch comes through Gong Li who once again delivers an excellent performance just like in the recent Miami Vice picture. The incorporation of some minor japanese mysticism is also a nice touch and adds flavor to this superb thriller. The ambience and mood in this flick is very well captured and the select effective closeups are what good movies are made of.<br /><br />Although there were only four people in the theatre we went to, fans of thrillers should go and see this film and they will thoroughly enjoy it. I watch a lot of films and usually I only like one or two each year, and Hannibal Rising is really movie making at its best in this genre. The story line is also very good and provides the perfect backdrop to the latter Hannibal Lecter as it all comes together now: the creation of a merciless monster/cannibalistic serial killer. Once released as DVD, this film is certainly a must for every DVD collection. Five stars all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>"Hannibal Rising" gives us an account of the childhood through young adult years of Thomas Harris' notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecter. I won't synopsise the plot because several key events occur very early on in the movie - suffice it to say that the boy Lecter has his humanity removed by exposure to several inhuman characters, as well as the death of his family, during WWII Lithuania. Subsequently, the introverted and silent Lecter is taken in by his beautiful Japanese Aunt and, as the body count begins to multiply, Hannibal comes out of his shell and becomes more and more the character we remember from "Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />This isn't a great movie. Mind you, it's not a bad one, either, not at all - Gong Li and Rhys Ifans give solid supporting performances to Gaspard Ulliel's confident, dynamic reading of Lecter, and Peter Webber's direction, while neither memorable nor original, is at least competent. Production design is duly lush, and the script is also reasonably sound. But the overall feeling you're left with at the end of the picture is that of Yet Another Blockbuster, and nothing at all like a study of the twisted psyche of a cannibalistic murderer.<br /><br />Possible Spolier Alert: Several of the elements of Hannibal's past are overblown and campy, not least the flashback scenes involving the Lithuanian militia and Lecter's sister Mischa. Far from a proposed sense of the inhuman, the bawdy antics of the group of soldiers recall Monty Python in a very undramatic way. There's nothing here we haven't seen before.<br /><br />Similarly, the heritage of Hannibal's Japanese Aunt feels slightly overconvenient and tacked-on, when, for his first murder, Lecter "borrows" the Samurai mask of her ancestors, providing a visual link to the most terrifying image of Hopkins' Lecter. But since that wasn't a choice on the part of the Hopkins character, why use it here? Like much of the film (the Lara Croft-style leather & motorcycle antics of Gong Li, samurai training montages in post-WW II France, exploding barges that belong in James Bond, and so forth), this image rings false, and Gaspard Ulliel's essentially sound portrayal of the young Hannibal Lecter is overdressed and dumbed-down because of this.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you haven't seen or read any of the other movies or novels in this series, this might be a good place to start: it's a lightweight, blockbustery sort of film, very flawed, but containing several decent elements of cast and production that save it from being a plain old bad movie. "Hannibal Rising" fails when it is played for cheap thrills - had the same movie been made with the same people and toned-down, it could have been a classic.<br /><br />Take that as you will.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>The only thing I had heard about HANNIBAL RISING was that it was awful. So, I put off watching it until last night. I was shocked to see a well thought out tale of unimaginable childhood trauma, revenge, and psychopathic evolution. Hannibal Lecter (Gaspard Urriel) is a young man w/ no goal in life, other than to avenge the cannibalistic death of his little sister, Mischa. His mind is set. His conscience is clear. His mission is absolute. Hannibal lives only to keep his promise to Mischa, and there will be much blood shed in the process. Learning the ways of the Samurai from his aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), Hannibal hones his skills in medical school, using cadavers as practice subjects. Human anatomy becomes Hannibal's roadmap in his quest for the most efficient methods of extermination. This will be very useful to him later on. Hannibal Lecter has grown up. His soul long shredded and lost, he takes those first steps. His will be a long and memorable career...</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>To begin a review of this film I think it is very important to acknowledge that it is is no way of the caliber of the Hannibal Lecter films with Anthony Hopkins and is in no way an intense psychological profile based horror film with deep characterizations.  It is in no way a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Luckily, I came into this knowing the book and movie both got bad reviews so I had no expectations.  And this allowed me to watch this film and enjoy it as a separate entity from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br /><br />The idea of seeing how the young Hannibal developed his desires and tastes for cruelty and sadistic murder is very intriguing and the plot certainly is overblown.  His family lived in Lithuania during the war and he watched his parents get killed and when he and his sister were alone, he saw soldiers invade the house and eventually devour his sister - supposedly in order to survive for they had no food.  Of course if a person viewed all this they would be affected for life.<br /><br />I found Gaspard Ulliel, who plays Hannibal, to have a very strong screen presence and totally believed his madness and the purpose of avenging the death of his sister as a reason/excuse to begin his avenging those who were a part of her death.  What was difficult for me was that he did not speak until he finds his way to the home of his aunt and when he finally spoke it was very quietly and he had a very strong accent that had no hint whatsoever of how Hannibal spoke later in life as played by Anthony Hopkins.  The introduction of the aunt causes some confusion in the script.  She teaches him martial arts and how to use swords.  We do see how he possesses this ability but we don't see why she taught him this.<br /><br />The last half of the film was excellent but not as a prequel explaining the true story of Hannibal Lecter but as an excellent horror film.  Each murder he commits is gruesome and very well filmed.  It is a quality horror film.  I believed his intensity and developing madness and was able to appreciate this film for what it was.<br /><br />If you watch this film thinking you will see an intriguing intro ino the madness of Hannibal Lecter of the quality of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS you will be greatly disappointed.  But as a horror movie in its own right it is excellently made.  The acting is all around very good, the scares are there and the gore is plentiful and utilized in believable ways.  I ended up really enjoying this film for what it was.<br /><br />Watch this with no more expectations than seing a fun, quality horror film that happens to have Hannibal Lecter in it.  The reasons for his desire to kill are fully explained but in a simple way but why his madness kept on evolving and he took pleasure in being a true monster is left alone.  You believe he is a monster but it is meant to just be accepted.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Well we now know how Hannibal fancied Chianti and Fava Beans with his human liver. Seriously I thought this was a nice background on our favorite scary bad guy. Good acting and directing, great sets and costumes, and decent music make it worth at least a rental and probably a purchase if you are a fan of the other three movies. Seeing Hannibal from childhood gave us more insight into his psyche. Now here's the thing, most people will say that the cruelties Hannibal suffered were endured by many in Europe or Asia during WWII and they never tracked their tormenters down and ate their faces. They are right of course, but I still like the premise as to how Hannibal used his medical training to further cannibal cooking and the art of "How to Best Serve Man". So I recommend you rent it if you liked "Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", and "Red Dragon" or "Manhunter".</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>We have seen the earlier days of Batman and Darth Vader. Now a film about the beginning of another famous character arrives, telling us how Hannibal `Cannibal' Lector succumbed to the dark side of human nature, and became one of the world's notorious killers. Sadly "Hannibal Rising," which looks like a typical revenge story, wouldn't tell us much about it except that two females played important roles in his younger days.<br /><br />Not that "Hannibal Rising" is a bad film. The film, which begins with young boy Hannibal's harrowing experiences during the WW2, is competently done as long as its acting, production designs and cinematography are concerned. French Gaspard Ulliel may not be the most credible Hannibal after watching Welsh Anthony Hopkins or Scottish Brian Cox playing the same role, but Ulliel's Hannibal is creepy enough to convince us of his future as `Cannibal' Lector. Rhys Ifans is also great as a ruthless kingpin with sadistic traits.<br /><br />However, the script written by Thomas Harris himself has nothing truly intriguing about it except the some gruesome killings by ever-resourceful Hannibal. The film has little to say about his inner self expect two marginally interesting things: frequent flashbacks about Hannibal's younger sister, and the relations with Hannibal's aunt Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). As to the former one, things can be easily detected. As to the latter, it is yet again clich&eacute;d images of the Orient with the name of Lady Murasaki borrowed from the classic Japanese literature "Diary of Lady Murasaki" in the eleventh century. I like Gong Li and I admit her beauty and huge acting talent (see her films made in China ... any of them), but her roles is not substantial enough like the borrowed name of a classic.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is an OK revenge story with familiar scenes where `bad guys' are given brief moment to talk in triumph before the vengeful protagonist when he should shoot him first. You will find many familiar plot devices such as humiliating school ward or a big boat in the canal. The difference is painful tortures and bloody deaths, which you can see here a lot. But if you're looking for suspense, intelligence or dark humor that has made "The Silence of the Lambs" something special, you will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the Eastern European flavor of Hannibals youth tale. Hannibal Rising is easily better than at least one Anthony Hopkins presence in sequel, perhaps two.<br />The actor portraying the youthful medical student Lecter excelled in his role. Have failed to see him in anything else and don't really understand why.<br />Glad I purchased the streaming version though I had the DVD....made it easier to remain captain of my couch and my status as a video potato.....keeps my mind off the Presidents murder of our country.<br />I highly recommed this movie to anyone considering purchasing it in any form. Good entertaining movie with some chills. The Europeans cannot do much well consistently but on occasion they certainly excell. This is one instance illustrative of the latter.<br />Enjoy the movie somehow and let Amazon make it easy!!</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I think this is the 2nd best in the series, after the truly first-rate Lambs Silence.  The story is tautly wound:  Hannibal is completely de-humanized as he loses his family to war-time thugs, mixing his budding sexuality  with cannibalistic revenge.  While this is a rather simplistic explanation of the psychopathology of a monster psychopath, it makes for a great viewing experience, so long as you want to witness his horrifically graphic series of atrocities.  The acting is extremely good, to say the least, and the story is coherent, full of incredible images, and tragic.  People expecting realistic psychology, I think, should look to documentaries:  this is entertainment, not science, as if psychology ever could be more scientific than intuitive.<br /><br />Recommended.  Just make sure you have the stomach for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>As with the book, I had problems with the movie trying to explain the evolution of a monster. Sometimes, when the mystery is removed, especially when it is done in such a pedestrian fashion ( where all the pieces fit into perfect little boxes ) as is the case here, the plot doesn't thicken- it congeals. That said, the film moved along at a crisp pace, the acting was good ( though no one can replace Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal ), and the cinematography was quite good. It was far from boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The book was perfect, the film is even more perfect than perfect. It is exactly what we could have dreamed of. The story is the absolute logical explanation of the previous volumes about Hannibal Lecter and we cannot think of one detail in these earlier volumes that is not the direct consequence of what happens in this later volume that tells the infancy, teenage and youth of Hannibal Lecter. What makes it so fascinatingly believable is that this period of his life is situated in Lithuania during the war and in the Soviet union and in France after the war. The political elements, allusions or direct references are correct even if at times slightly simplified, for instance the butcher, the first victim of Hannibal Lecter's on the French territory, who was a collaborator during the war and took part in the sending of some Jews to deportation could go on with his profession in spite of the hatred he had accumulated among people because as a butcher he must have taken part in a lot of black market operations and most post war higher ups or councilors and representatives in his zone must have used his services in a way or another during the war, to sell the meat they produced on their farms or to buy the meat they could not have with the food coupons. But that lack of precision is already in the book. But a little bit of research on such a point, and others, would have made the film even more believable. The man Hannibal Lecter, and his psychology are really clarified. He was traumatized by what he went through and he never managed to get out of it, to forget it, to forgive the criminals, etc. But is a man that resilient to be able to forgive and forget seeing his own younger sister being cooked in her own copper bathtub and then eaten by a bunch of wild human beasts? I guess we would like to think so. But what we are sure of is that no matter how much you forget something, that thing remains in your mind and can manipulate you any time anywhere unconsciously. All people who suffer such traumas do not become criminals but most of them have some blank moments and their general attitude is either one of distantiation or one of extreme orthodoxy along some ethical or ideological line. For example we have not really thought of the impact of the torturing and execution of the early Christians on the very corpus of their beliefs and principles. How can some persecuted group defend the principle of loving their enemies who are putting them to death in atrocious ways everyday?  That is what this film is all about and it shows how relentless the victim of such violence can become, and that is not vengeance. It is justice in the eye of plain humanity, in the eye of what they have suffered, in the eye of God even. But the good question remains to know where the police, or more generally the forces that are supposed to defend law, order, justice, freedom and many other principles, were at the time of the crimes. No one can answer even when one war criminal of that type is caught up like Papon in France who was tried in the late 1990s for crimes against humanity he committed in Bordeaux in 1944 after a complete career in the top administration or the government of the country. He was the police and the direct representative of the state in Bordeaux hence law and order in 1944. The problem we have to solve is then what do we do for these people who suffered such horrible crimes after the end of the period concerned. What do we do with the victims of the war in Iraq, both American GIs who come back completely disturbed and Iraqis who are going to be haunted by what they suffered for decades. There is no easy answer to that question.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>This wasn't a bad film. The acting was very good in this film. Gaspard Ulliel as the young adult Hannibal did an excellent job. Li Gong was very good as Lady Murisaki, Hannibal's aunt and only link of humanity left. The Story was good. While the film was suppose to be an explaination as to what made him a monster. Instead the film kind of turns out to be more of a tragedy. Knowing that the horrible things that happened to Hannibal Lecter and his family will eventually turn him into a very dangerous monster.</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This movie is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs.  I love the whole series and the diabolical character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, M.D..  This film, however, is the very weakest of them.  It was beautifully filmed, however, it just didn't do it for me, I can't really explain why.  Maybe because it was more like a war movie or the great Anthony Hopkins was not in it.  However, this was about the young Lecter, so Hopkins, couldn't have been in it.  The surround sound was unbelievable and during the war scenes, I heard gun fire and explosions from everywhere, like I was there.<br /><br />The movie does give us a glimpse of why Hannibal turned out the way he did.  His parents were wiped out by the Nazis during World War II and his young sister (Misha) killed and eaten by starving soldiers.  He was the only member of his family to survive and he received no mental counseling.  Hannibal grows up to seek revenge on all those involved with Misha's death.<br /><br />A friend of mine, CLINT BRONSON, placed a comment on one of my reviews, Red Dragon (a great film in the Hannibal Lecter series) that stated, "These are movies that are great for school bullies to watch. For they pick on a kid who is weaker or a nerd. But the kid grows up! And likes knives and never forgives!"  I didn't know what he meant at the time and questioned the comment, but he should have told me to watch this movie and that would explain.  I must apologize CLINT, for not understanding your comment.  For this truly is a movie for school bullies to watch.  Hannibal does get revenge on those who wronged him and his family.<br /><br />While I was very disappointed in this film---it does explain Hannibal's mental state and why he commits those atrocious killings and you should watch all of the series in sequence starting with this one, then Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>With each new entry into the Hannibal Lecter story, my appreciation for the series as a whole, and for each previous chapter, grows.  And this time it's been done with a prequel that goes all the way back to Hannibal's childhood, a story that I - and probably quite a few other fans - wasn't sure was a good idea to tell.  Didn't the excellent "Red Dragon" reveal enough of Lecter's backstory?  Was going back further going to do anything other than take away the air of mystery to the character?<br /><br />  Fortunately, "Hannibal Rising" only deepens the impact of the character and his previous films.  Beginning in World War II Lithuania, we see the deaths of young Lecter's family, not at the hands of Hannibal  himself, but by Nazis and a band of marauding Lithuanian ex-Nazi collaborators/turned 'freelance' looters and terrorizers.  Through a ghastly set of circumstances best left to be seen in the movie itself, the surviving Hannibal is found by the Russian forces moving in at the end of the war, a mute child wandering through the woods with a chain around his neck.  Raised in a Soviet orphanage, the amnesiac and still-mute Hannibal seemingly develops into an unlikely defender of the oppressed  ("You go against the way of nature, Hannibal", an orphanage official tells him, "Always hurting the bully"), Lecter eventually frees himself and makes his way across Europe to the residence of some disrant relatives, where the bulk of the movie takes place.  The older but still mute Hannibal (played by Gaspard Ulliel in the male breakout performance of the year so far) is cared for by the widow (Gong Li, another great performance in a highly well-acted movie) of his deceased uncle, later becoming more deeply involved with her.<br /><br />  It's upon regaining his memory of the events in the war that the transformation really begins.  The bloody path of Hannibal Lecter as we know him begins as revenge, but as we already know from the previous movies, it doesn't end there.  Hannibal ends up travelling from innocent child to a dark, violent avenger, to what he is when "Red Dragon" takes place (although "Hannibal Rising" wraps up many years before Dragon commences - maybe we haven't seen the last of the pre-Anthony Hopkins Hannibal).  As the end of Hannibal Rising nears, it enters extreme territory that makes the legendary 'banquet' scene from 2001's "Hannibal" look like a tranquil countryside brunch.<br /><br />  *WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />  In ways, we see Hannibal Lecter die twice in this movie.  The first is in the World War II Lithuanian winter, where the little boy effectively ceases to be, and begins the path to his new incarnation as a passion-driven dark avenger.  The second death though, the passing from avenger to psychopath, could be considered to be a metaphorical suicide (as opposed to the way his days as a happy child were 'murdered' when his family's lives were taken).  What drives Lecter to this point - and the violence with which this path begins: the death of one of the last surviving members of his family's killers, in a fashion so savage and shocking it outdoes anything in the previous three Lecter movies; makes his dispatching of previous guilty parties seem tame; and is enough to floor even the seasoned horror fan - is the kind of thing to stay with one, to haunt you long after the movie is over.  And with it the evil, fully-formed Hannibal Lecter, is truly risen.  Great stuff, managing to be on par with Anthony Hopkins's Lecter movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>People won't ever give this enough credit due to the whole franchise thing; However, this is an enjoyable, worthy entry(esp. when you consider this could have been total disaster...). Gaspard Ulliel is paticularly good as young Lecter, and all the villians are worthy of being snuffed off; The method of tracking them was dumbed down a little from the book(now that's hard to believe...), but they all provided some nice grisly moments in this often grisly film. The war stuff is actually impressive, esp. the scene within the first 10 or so minutes; There is def. a good look to this movie, esp. some of the forest shots; There is some beautiful photography/scenery surrounding 2 deaths(1 w/a rope, 1 involing a guy who cuts meat and likes to fish...). The director is confident, and although there could have been done on his behalf(like w/Ratner and 'Red Dragon'), we should really be counting our blessings. I thought the cat-and-mouse between Lecter and the Detective in France was well done.  Die-hard horror fans won't get enough horror probably, but there is some; I guess it's just a little tame after 'Hostel'. But you know, I can't wait to watch this again. Everyone is complaining they could have done more with this story; True; But it doesn't make it any less of a movie to me...</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>A completely unnecessary and incredibly dull adaptation of the book describing Hannibal the Cannibal's unfortunate childhood and motives for becoming a....consumer.

I haven't read the novels by Thomas Harris, so I can't compare them, but the film is awesome. The performances here are just delectable, especially Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. I can't wait to see Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in "Red Dragon" (I've decided to see the films in chronological order). I don't know why it's classified a a horror film. It should be termed a suspense thriller. Revenge is a dish best served cold. "Good evening, Inspector." Unrated.

"Hannibal Rising" depicts the story of Hannibal Lecter during his younger years, from a small boy who watched his parents die and his sister being eaten alive by neanderthalls, to a beautiful looking young man with revenge on his mind. This revenge is what makes Lecter into the monster that he became: it takes over his life like an addiction that he cannot break away from. There is always a reason behind one's behavior, even if that behavior means murdering people: this film explores all of this and more.<br /> Gasparo Ulliel, who plays Lecter, gives a virtuoso performance, and I am sure Anthony Perkins is proud that such a talented and gifted actor gave new life into the most haunting movie villin of all-time.<br /> Thomas Harris, who wrote the original "Silence of the Lambs", wrote the screenplay for "Hannibal Rising". An impeccable script.<br /> The DVD is outstanding, with deleted scenes, commentary by the director Peter Webber and producer Martha DeLaurentis, teaser and theatrical trailers, and the documentaries "Hannibal Lecter: The Origin of Evil" and "Designing Horror and Elegance".<br /> The film is beautifully filmed in Europe.<br /> The critics say it all: Joel Siegel, from "Good Morning America" states, "if you can keep your eyes opened, your going to be scared", and Pete Hammond, of "Maxim" says, the film is "a fascinating and terrifying journey into the making of a monster".</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>I always wondered if Dr. Hannibal Lecter would be as fascinating and intriguing if not for Anthony Hopkins' performance in previous movies. Even As perfect as Hopkins' performance was, I think this great production of Hannibal rising rises to the same level of previous Hannibal movies and makes the book by Thomas Harris's a living novel.<br /><br />The evolution of Hannibal's evil is captured flawlessly through great music, direction, production and the outstanding performance of the cast, especially Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki. It is amazing how the physical and emotional attraction between these two characters captured by the camera through their looks and body language. This view provided by the camera was more profound and telling than any possible dialogue.<br /><br />In spite of all the criticism that was directed at "Hannibal rising" when compared to Harris' original novel, I don't think that this movie could have been any better; highly recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>& no not in emotional way they just had to go & ruin Hannibal by humanizing him  this is no where near up to par with Manhunter, Silence Of The Lambs or even Hannibal. That's just me to me it is a trilogy Manhunter Silence Of The Lambs & Hannibal. Hannibal Rising directed by Peter Webber who I hope this is the only movie I ever watch that you have directed. Thomas Harris himself wrote the screen play & Dino De Laurntiis produces for the last time. It stars Gaspard Ulliel as a Young Hannibal & Lo Gong as Murasaki there the only decent thing about this movie  the dumb a  s  s who played Jigsaw in Punisher War Zone Dominic West in this. You start off in 1944 the Lecter family during the end of WW II in Lithuania the whole family is killed except for Hanninbal & his little sister SS forces cannibalize the girl. Hannibal is later found by Soviet Forces the Lecter Castle has been turned into an orphange 8 years later Hannibal has been rendared mute due to tramatic experances & later escapes to Paris to live with his Aunt she helps him speak again. We get Hannibal going for revenge Crow or Punisher style I'm sorry but I'm supppose to care about this character I know it is a prequel but this character who would go on to serve human to party guests drove Will Graham to insanity had Dr Chilton for dinner savaged the gaurds in Silence cooked Ray Liotta's brain which we will never forget for different reasons & we are suppose to pity poor Hannibal. The Boogeyman should remain The Boogeyman the tramatic childhood stuff worked for Francis Dollarhyde & Jame Gumb but it doesn't for Hannibal. It is just what it is cliche. This movie is so slow paced & I don't mind slow paced movies as long as the characters keep me involved but out of all 5 films this has the most forgettable character & forgetable score. I guess I can say it is shot well but so was The NOES remake & I don't think much of Samuel Bayer as a director. According to Thomas Harris he was in fear of them writing a prequel cause Dino De Laurntiis said "If you don't write it I'll do it with someone else. I don't want to lose this franchise & the audience they want it." It was made out of greed. Harris shouldn't of done it he wouldn't have had to take the blame for a s h i  t t y novel. He could've wrote some kind of Hannibal sequel I know Anthony Hopkins wasn't going to come back but they could've got Brian Cox back. The gore isn't impressive either.

A very disappointing movie.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This film purports to tell the story of Hannibal Lecter's childhood and the reason he became the diabolical serial killer we all love to fear.  However, it just doesn't ring true for me.  Here, Hannibal is on a righteous, if gruesome, mission to avenge the murder of his little sister, which provides an arc and dramatic sweep to his violence.  We never see him engaging in any of the childhood behaviors with have been pretty well established as classic precursors of serial killing, such as cruelty to animals.  When we contrast this with his behavior in earlier films, such as biting the face off a nurse who was leaning over him (referred to in "Silence of the Lambs") or killing and cooking a musician for hitting a bad note ("Red Dragon"), we are left to conclude that he must have developed a taste for murder as a result of his actions in this movie rather than his traumatic childhood.  Of course, I'm overanalyzing it.  The obvious reason for constructing the plot in this way is that the filmmakers want to build sympathy for Hannibal by rationalizing his despicable behavior as the product of a sensitive, hurt soul.  Actor Anthony Hopkins, "Silence" director Jonathan Demme, and even "Red Dragon" director Brett Ratner created a compelling character by making us fear Hannibal, not empathize with him.<br /><br />On its own terms, this is just an okay movie (albeit one that wastes the wonderful Gong Li as a ridiculous Japanese stereotype).  As a chapter in the saga of Hannibal Lecter, it is a terrible misstep.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />So just how does one go from being a carefree, apple-cheeked schoolboy to becoming the most notorious, cannibalistic serial killer in literary history?  "Hannibal Rising" thinks it has the answer.  First, you watch as Nazis mow down your parents in cold blood.  Then, you look on helplessly as a band of starving Lithuanian soldiers carve up and eat your little sister.  Finally, you enroll in med school so you will not only acquire intimate knowledge of the human anatomy but will have unlimited access to disemboweled cadavers and tools of dismemberment that will come in mighty handy in your off-duty hours.<br /><br />The very concept of Hannibal Lecter is so off-putting and distasteful (pardon the pun) that it really only works when you have an actor of the caliber of Anthony Hopkins on hand to, in some way at least, "humanize" the character.  For without the "charisma" Hopkins brought to the role, Lecter becomes just another garden-variety psycho - and the movies themselves mere exercises in cheap, tawdry exploitation.<br /><br />This is the single greatest problem with this alleged "prequel" to the Academy Award-winning "Silence of the Lambs."  Hard as it tries, it really can't make Lecter's transformation all that compelling or believable.  And without that shield to protect us, the goriness and unpleasantness come rushing over us with full, unabated force.  Admittedly, there`s a certain purgative kick in watching the cannibals get their comeuppance at the hand of one of their victims, but you`ll still probably feel like taking a shower after the movie.  About the only interesting aspect to the story is how each of the three main characters has chosen a different way to cope with the loss of family members in the war:  Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), of course, turns to revenge murders and cannibalism; the chief inspector (Dominic West) goes after unpunished war criminals; and Lecter's beautiful Japanese aunt (Li Gong) helps protect her nephew from the full force of the law.  But such analysis is going way too far in justifying a movie whose sole purpose for existing is to turn the audience's stomach as it caters to the propensity for vicarious sadism that resides in the human species.<br /><br />Those who made "Hannibal Rising" have taken a character who was terrifying precisely because his actions COULDN'T be explained in any rational manner - and thus any one of us could fall victim to his madness - and have turned him into a conventional Angel of Vengeance stamping out evildoers and injustice, with the imprimatur of "divine righteousness" to give him moral cover.  In short, they have transmogrified him into little more than a comic book action figure (albeit an extremely dark one).  Not that it`s any big deal in the grand scheme of things, but "Hannibal Rising" might be more accurately entitled "Hannibal Falling."</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>As a fan of all the Hannibal Lector films, I was expecting another film I'd enjoy and thinking this would be a terrific character study of man who is one of the most famous fictional killers of all time. What I got instead was more of a simple revenge story than the character study. Oh, yeah, we do learn some background of the famous "Dr. Lector," but not enough of what really made him the weird combination of intellectual and cannibal.<br /><br />Although portraying and having someone in the film label the young adult as "monster," the filmmakers (actually, author Thomas Harris) really made him more of a sympathetic character instead. They took the easiest road, out, too, making an easy target the villains: the Nazis. How often has Hollywood done that, even today 60 years after the conclusion of WWII. What we get is a revenge story of how Lector went from a child captive of the Nazis for a short time, to a medical student in Paris and how he tracked down the Nazis who killed the rest of his family.<br /><br />The best part of the film was the absolutely gorgeous cinematography. This is beautifully filmed, first frame to last. Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal was okay but certainly not as riveting in the role as the mature Anthony Hopkins was in his three performances. Why a young French actor, who has all the accents that Hopkins doesn't have, would play the role, I don't know.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>It's hard to review "Hannibal Rising" without taking into consideration the other films in the franchise.  Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins</a>, which can and does stand apart from its batty bretheren, this film's punch relies in many ways on the Lecter mythos, much to its detriment.<br /><br />I suppose you could attempt to view the movie as an isolated incident, a self-contained story, but that would be both wrong-headed and, for anyone who knows anything about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, virtually impossible.  Besides, even if you could take away expectations and biases from the viewing experience, you still end up with a pretty watered down treatise on what makes a monster.<br /><br />Much like Showtime's deliciously dark series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter</a>, "Hannibal Rising" hopes to show us how serial killers are born.  Their answers aren't that different: a mind-boggingly horrific childhood experience combined with the tutelage of a fighting/killing master.  Dexter's seemed a bit more plausible -- he was adopted by a police officer who sagely tried to channel Dexter's murderous tendencies into more productive veins; Hannibal, on the other hand, is taken under the wing of his obscenely wealthy Aunt, Lady Murasaki, a sexy Japanese immigrant who teaches Hannibal the arts of sword play and flower arranging and why it's okay to make out with your aunt if she's only a relative by marriage.  Also, her chef gives Hannibal lots of great cooking advice.  "The cheeks are the best part of an animal!"  Hannibal does not have to ask which cheeks the chef is talking about; I would've.<br /><br />Hannibal's childhood trauma involves the grisly death of his sister at the hands of war profiteering Lithuanians.  The rest of the movie follows Hannibal as he exacts his vengance on these men, who are still pretty bad guys.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say this: it's a prequel, so if you're guessing that Hannibal gets away scott free, you're on the right track.<br /><br />Under normal circumstances, I'd be compelled to give a movie like this three stars instead of two, but "Hannibal Rising" does such a thorough job of squeezing all of the sick mystery out of the character of Lecter that I found the whole experience rather patronizing.  Part of what makes Lecter such a fabulous anti-hero is that he is essentially unknowable.  The darkest and most disturbing element of his personality isn't his amazing intelligence, his erudite charm, or his transcedentally creepy calm.  It is the fact that his reasons are his own to know, and only for us to guess at.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" not only removes the mystique from the man, but it also reduces his actions to those of sullen kid.  Hannibal is not the anti-hero in this movie; he's the actual, legitimate hero, and the label doesn't suit the character, at least not as he's ever been portrayed in any other film.  It turns him into a puppet that's holding its own strings.  Even worse, the film insultingly holds the audiences hands through some of its weightier images.  When Hannibal passes through an open-air butcher market or when he sees a bracelet that his sister used to wear, we are treated to flashbacks of Hannibal's last moments with his sister, as if we can't already guess on our own the connections to be made.<br /><br />The closest thing to Foster's Clarice here is Inspector Popil, a man smart enough to know that Hannibal is responsible for the sudden outbreak of beheadings and cheek eatings.  The victim of his own fair share of war crimes, Popil even sympathizes with what makes Hannibal kill, but he has, of course, chosen the path of law and order.  Hannibal respected Clarice's weaknesses as they could be found in the virtues she chose to valiantly uphold.  That respect is missing here, and so the character of Popil remains woefully unused, his status relegated to that of a narrative mouthpiece.  "That young boy died out there with his sister," Popil says.  "What came out of that woods was no longer human.  It was ... a monster!"<br /><br />If you say so.  Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of Hannibal does have hints of "monster" about it, but it lacks depth and coherency.  He spends much of the movie grinning quietly and looking at people out of the corners of his eyes.  It's all well and good, I suppose, but you'll get the impression that something's missing.  What's missing is the uncertainty, the creepiness, the indefinable menace that made the man such a great character.  It's been said that we hate most the things we understand most; Hannibal's not hard to figure out in this film.  I guess it's fair to say that that doesn't necessarily make it a hate-worthy film, but it does make it boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I just got done watching "Hannibal Rising" this evening. Hmmmm, not sure what to make of it! I've read and seen "Red Dragon" (which I loved by the way), "Silence of the Lambs", & "Hannibal"....<br /><br />After reading many negative reviews for both the book and movie versions of "Hannibal Rising", I wasn't sure if I wanted anything to do with the book or the movie.... However, decided to watch the movie for myself and form my own opinion.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think "Hannibal Rising" is as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It is suppose to be a prequel, giving us the idea of why Hannibal is the way he is as an adult. I thought "Hannibal Rising" was suspenseful and well acted by the cast members. We see Hannibal as a monster out for revenge for those who killed his younger sister. This is where Hannibal begins to learn and refine his murderous appetite that we later refined when he becomes an adult..... What starts out as revenge turns into gruesome psychopathic behavior.</p></br></body></html>

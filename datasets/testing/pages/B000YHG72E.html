Since he has been raised as an elf, this leads to some quite hilarious situations.

The ending is a bit cliche and corny, but overall this is actually a pretty enjoyable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I'd never really thought a Will Farrell would become a holiday classic, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a> is a wonderful Christmas treat. The story is simple enough: a human is adopted by Santa's elves, but then returns to New York to find his birth father. As expected, what ensues is one major culture clash. It's absolutely hilarious, with Farrell walking around New York City in an elf costume and getting into all sorts of trouble. My family watches it every Christmas Eve. It certainly beats the usual sappy holiday specials.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>This is my favorite modern holiday movie. It's hilarious. :-D<br />A parody of many holiday specials, including the animated 'Rudolph', this is real fun for the whole family.  Ferrell never breaks character, and what a character. Bob Newhart as the head elf is inspired.<br />Laughs all the way through and a Christmas message too.<br /><br />ENJOY! :-D</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is yet another film that you can watch during this time of year. Despite it being far from perfect, it's a hilarious comedy, and I had a great time watching it. It has so many gags that work, and it has Will Ferrel as an elf (well, a human who was raised by elves)! If that doesn't seem funny to you, then I'd be fresh out of ideas. Ferrell gives a surprisingly excellent performance here, and the supporting cast is brilliant. James Caan, Bob Newhart, and Zooey Deschanel really have something here. But I think the greatest thing about this film is that it's one of those that gives you a very warm feeling about the holidays. It's about family, friendship, and most importantly, love. In short, Elf is a funny Christmas film. It may not be as memorable as It's a Wonderful Life or Home Alone, but it's still very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Elf has to be one of will ferrell's best movies outside of blades of glory. this Christmas movie is fun for the whole family. i love this movie and so will you.

He takes a job at Gimbel's department store during the Christmas season and meets his new girlfriend. Great moral support from James Caan and Ed Asner.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>In this movie Will Ferrell plays Buddy, a man raised by elves.  He eventually goes on to seek and find his birth father in New York City.  He finds him, but at first his birth father (the gruff Walter Hobbs played by James Caan) thinks he is looney and it's some kind of joke.  It is somewhat understandable when you take into account the clothes Buddy is wearing (his elf outfit).  Very cute, but a bit out of place.<br /><br />The real charm of the movie lies in Buddy's child-like innocence.  It is hilarious to see him get into situations that probably would not be exceptional if someone more "normal" was involved.  He is truly one of a kind and his personality shines throughout the entire movie.  Additionally, he is something of a master decorator and snowball thrower, after getting lots of practice at the North Pole no doubt.  This movie is really fun and funny and suitable for children as well.  A perfect holiday movie if you want to laugh out loud.  This may be Will Ferrell's best movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Elf starring the hilarious Will Ferrel, James Caan, and Zooey Deschanel is a cute and funny holiday film. I wasn't expecting much before I watched it, but Elf is a gem from beginning to end. Ferrell's performance brings both wide-eyed innocence and hypersensitive drama to the extreme. Parts of this film are so silly but enjoyable. This is a new holiday classic, just as good as A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation. Elf will have you weeping like an infant from laughing so much. Defintely one to add to your holiday collection. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>"Elf" was everything I hoped it would be. Will Ferrell does a great job as Buddy, the elf that wants to find his real dad and home. This will surely go down as one of the classic Christmas tales. Ed Asner makes a great Santa. The story itself is touching and not at one time boring. Somethings in the film are childish, but the movie is intended for children. Just the whole fish-out-of-water story, as someone said, is what makes the film. Buddy just can't seem to fit in anywhere, but he does make a lot of friends.

As one of Santa's elves, Buddy (Will Ferrell) grew to well over six feet tall and never seemed to display the usual elfin preternatural gift for toy craftsmanship (while other elves knocked out a thousand Etch-a-Sketches per day, Buddy couldn't top one hundred).  His confusion ends one day when Buddy learns the residents of The North Pole adopted him many years ago.  With that new information, the full-grown adult with a perpetual child-like disposition sets out toward New York City in search of the father he never knew existed.<br /><br />Buddy's "fish-out-of-water" adventures in New York and his search for love and acceptance from his father (James Caan) make up most of the action of "Elf".  In NYC, Buddy discovers gum on the street isn't free candy and signs that read "world's best cup of coffee" aren't necessarily true.  The filmmakers make a bold and wise decision by refraining from having Buddy change (to grow up and lose his na?ve, trusting demeanor).  He remains the sincere, wide-eyed elf throughout the entire film, never forgetting to take time to enjoy himself by consuming copious amounts of syrup and making himself sick by going round and around in revolving doors.<br /><br />Not only does "Elf" refrain from re-cycling the same tired stories usually seen during the holiday season, it takes jabs at Christmas specials of the past.  The opening act is filled with witty, clever incidents that arise when elves raise a human and when the child grows up and returns to society.  The early comic set-ups seem to come from people who know and love the Rudolph/Frosty specials but still can't resist lampooning them a bit.<br /><br />As with most light-hearted comedies, the first half of the film provides more entertainment than the last half.  Most of the funny incidents help establish the character of Buddy and the conflict of his life in New York.  Thus, once that is established, the film becomes more about a clich&eacute;d plot where Buddy's father needs to learn about the true spirit of Christmas and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Even with an obvious and predictable ending, viewing "Elf" must be described as a wholly enjoyable experience.  Will Ferrell once again allows himself to play a character that audiences will want to laugh at (not with).  He is simple, ignorant, illogical...and utterly irresistible.  The film's appeal tethers itself to Ferrell's Buddy and is the result of clever, witty people (Ferrell, Director Favreu and writer Berenbaum) who have learned that "silly" and "smart" are not mutually exclusive traits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Every holiday season, movies and tv bombard us with either treasured holiday classics in film and TV, or they try to re-create that magic with a new movie or TV special. More often than not, the new ones, in this day and age, don't measure up. I am happy to say that this movie, while it doesn't exactly succeed, comes closer than anything in recent memory. Directed by actor Jon Favreau("Swingers"), "Elf" is a slight and silly piece of cutesy fluff that should entertain everyone, from most any age group, to the very end. Former SNL cast member Will Ferrel, who can do no wrong in my humble opinion, plays Buddy The Elf, but he is no ordinary elf. Many years ago, while Santa(played by Ed Asner), visited an orphange, a little baby crawled into Santa's sack, without the big guy knowing, and ended up in the North Pole. Instead of taking him back, they named him Buddy(after his diapers), and Papa Elf(Played by the always wonderful Bob Newhart), decided to adopt the infant and raise him as his own. And as an elf. Flash forward 30 years, and the gigantic, human sized Buddy finds out he is human and sets out to find his real father, who he learns is a publisher named William Hobbs, and lives in a far away land known as "New York City". Buddy meets up with Hobbs(James Caan)and his family, while adjusting to big city life. In the process, he meets the lovely Jove(Played by the adorable Zooey Deschanell), and tries to find his place in the world and to open the eyes of his father. It's pretty standard in the plot area, but it is decently written and structured, and Buddy is such a charming and loveable oaf, that you watch every second he's on screen. The movie, surprisingly, isn't as wackily funny as one would expect from Ferrell and the nature of the material. It's funny, but has a sense of romance and nostalgia that kinda makes it seem like those oh-so-warmy made for lifetime Christmas movies. But better. The supporting cast also includes Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, and an uncredited Michael Lerner. The movie is cute and digestable, and it has that oh so important holiday message of opening your eyes and seeing what you got and embrace it. We've seen it a million times, but it never fails to resonate or matter if it's done well. And it's done pretty well here. Ferrell is a commanding presence, that's for sure, and he makes the most of the silly situations. Caan is his usually serious, solid self, and Deschanell, who usually does more independent type movies, is a delight. And what a nice voice she has!. Asner is a good Santa, and I believe I have seen him in the role somewhere else as well. I have always loved Bob Newhart, and it was nice to see him in a big film. I just wished there was more of him. A great soundtrack filled with holiday favorites and other nice little nuggets pepper the film. The look of the film is pretty nice as well. Nothing beats New York at Christmas time. The design of the North Pole is hilarious, as it reminds us of those old 60's and 70's TV specials we all grew up on. The animated critters and a walking and talking snowman(voiced by the mysterious singer Leon Redbone, who also contributed to the soundtrack), also give those nostalgic little touches. The DVD extras are also a nice batch of goodies. I especially like the 10 minute section on people who really decorate big time for the holiday, and a section on Christmas in Hollywood. There is lots more here, and they are all fun and entertaining for a pretty fun, entertaining, and ultimately harmless little movie. Merry Christmas!.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>Buddy is a human, accidentally taken from an orphanage as a baby, ending up with Santa's elves, and getting raised by them. He grows up much taller than they are. Buddy finds out that his father works in the Empire State Building, and sets out to find him.<br /><br />Buddy has no clue as to what city life is like, and there is one funny scene after another. Buddy hops on the lines painted on the street. He goes into revolving doors, and "rides" them for a long time. He makes goofy motions as he attempts to straddle the steps of an escalator. He jumps from mattress to mattress in a department store. He eats pigeon droppings from off the fences (ugh!). He takes a flyer from one man and then passes it on to another man who is passing out flyers--back and forth.<br /><br />Knowing the real Santa, Buddy exposes the Santa at Gimbel's store as a fraud. There is quite a row there, right in front of the children! But then Buddy stays at the store overnight and decorates it in a fashion never seen before.<br /><br />Over time, Buddy's father warms up to him. It isn't easy. Buddy acts like a huge overgrown child, and is a constant source of irritation in the family and at his father's workplace. Buddy's eating habits are bizarre, to say the least. Everything must have candy!<br /><br />In time, Buddy becomes close to his half-brother, a boy named Michael. After school, Buddy meets him, and they walk home together. Suddenly, some boys pelt both of them with snowballs. No problem. Buddy picks up a bunch of snowballs and hurls them at the adversaries in machine-gun fashion, hitting all of them squarely. They all scatter.<br /><br />Santa's Sleigh crashes in Central Park in New York. Only Buddy can repair it, and then only the spirit of Christmas can make it fly again. (The spirit of Christmas involves such things as singing Christmas songs, and believing in Santa. It is measured by a "Clausometer" gauge in Santa's sleigh). Michael makes off with Santa's list. People are curious what is written in it. The television reporter is embarrassed when Michael reads what Santa was asked to give her. Then people start to sing, the Christmas spirit re-awakens, and the magic begins again.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Nonsense.  ELF is pure nonsense.  A baby that crawls inside Santa's bag of toys on a fateful Christmas Eve and thus is raised by the elves in the North Pole.  As the human (Buddy the Elf, of course) grows, he can't help but notice he's "different."  And finally, Buddy is told the somber truth--that he is not an elf, that he is a human, and that his father (who happens to be on Santa's "Naughty List") resides in Manhattan.  And so Buddy sets off, on foot, (after saying goodbye to various animated North Pole pals) to the Big Apple, where mayhem reigns supreme upon his arrival.<br /><br />Like I said:  nonsense.  But funny nonsense.  Will Ferrell plays Buddy with simultaneous naivete and tongue-in-cheek raunchiness; he more than carries this film on his bright green shoulders.  James Caan is pure vanilla bland as Buddy's reluctant, long-lost father, while Bob Newhart is at his deadpan best.  The plot is hokey, the ending syrupy (as is Buddy's diet) and contrived, yet ELF had me laughing in spite of my curmudgeonly self.  The holy grail of entertainment is escapism, and ELF takes the viewer directly into the story and doesn't let go until the last giggle.<br /><br />This is a movie not only appropriate for Yuletide cheer, but anytime one needs a raucous laugh.  My only concern is my utter confusion:  ELF's elves are little munchkin midgets, while the elves in "Lord of the Rings" are tall and stoic.  Wow.  Guess I've gotta brush up on my elfology.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Buddy is an elf. Well, not really. Buddy is a human who grew up in the North Pole thinking he was an elf.  One Christmas Santa was putting presents under the tree at an orphanage and little Buddy snuck out of his crib and crawled into Santa's sack. Santa didn't know about it until he got back home in the North Pole. By then, he couldn't take the baby back. They would have to wait at least a year. So a kindly Master Elf and his wife who had no children of their own, adopt Buddy and raise them as their son. Buddy, though just doesn't fit as an elf. Not only is he too tall for everything, but he can't work as fast, either. Everyone thinks he's a klutz.  Papa Elf has to tell Buddy the truth and Buddy then leaves the North Pole to search for his biological father (James Caan) in New York City.  Add in a couple of slapstick gags, some really witty and original dialogue, a touch of boy meets girl story, a Scrooge-like man who has a change of heart, and a crash landing of Santa's sleigh in Central Park and it makes for one hilarious and charming Christmas story. Not too mention Bob Newhart.<br /><br />ELF is bound to become a Christmas classic that people watch every year. There aren't very many Christmas movies like that. The majority of Christmas movies that are made are seen once, put on video and DVD, and then forgotten except by strange little trivia lovers like myself. However, every few years a Christmas movie comes along that ends up becoming a new favorite and eventually becomes a classic, like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE CHRISTMAS STORY, and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION.  ELF will be the next movie added to those lists.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is at his comic genius best, portraying just the right mix of innocence and sincerity without seeming to be mushy. One of the best things about the film is seeing Bob Newhart, a comic legend in his own right, teamed up with Ferrell. It's a comedians generational crossover. Ed Asner gets to be a little less cranky than he often is since he plays Santa, and he does a fine job--why wasn't he ever cast in more friendly roles sooner?  James Caan also does a wonderful job as Buddy's long lost father, Walter. Caan isn't given the best lines or material, but is able to make it work. Mary Steenburgen gives a strong supporting performance as Walter's wife and Zooey Deschanel is absolutely adorable as Jovie, the department store clerk who Buddy falls in love with.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast, good writing, intriguing direction, and an involving story. It's slightly quirky, but not so much so to turn anyone off.  In terms of Christmas movies, ELF is bound to become one of the giants.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>this is the ultimate feel good holiday movie. a very fuuny attempt by Will Ferrell into family comedy and it's not offensive at all. fun for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I don't do Christmas.  I've mentioned that before, but then again some people may not have taken me too seriously (I find the concept to be self-centered and manufactured).  That said, some may balk at me gushing over a Christmas movie, but I like what I like and this movie deserves my attention.  Talk about a movie that defies expectations.  Looking at the trailer for this film or glancing at the DVD cover and you'd think it's going to be `stupid funny' so when the film winds up displaying genuine sincerity with every laugh you find yourself scratching your hear in disbelief.<br /><br />This film has serious heart.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Buddy, a human who was adopted by Christmas elves when he was a baby and raised to believe that he too was an elf.  He made for a rather clumsy elf, being that he is kind of gigantic, and so he was eventually told the truth about his origin and sent off to the real world to find his human parents.  He does find his father, but that doesn't go over very well (especially since Buddy is so genuine in his overall naivety that he comes across like a complete nut-job).<br /><br />Sure, there is that whole `Christmas spirit' mumbo-jumbo that is so beautiful in context yet so inaccurate in application, but it works marvelously in this family centric film that nails nearly every mark it attempts to hit.<br /><br />This film just has `it'.<br /><br />In fact, this film has heaps of `it' in the form of Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel.  I mean, really...what a marvelous cast.  Ferrell is just effortless and so wonderfully delightful as Buddy.  He captures the tone of this character with ease and delivers a performance we will remember and adore.  James Caan handles a stereotype with gusto, and Bob Newhart is just so huggable as Papa Elf.  I've always had a soft spot for Steenburgen, even when she hasn't deserved it, and Zooey Deschanel should be in EVERY movie.<br /><br />If you want a smart, witty, charming family film that will defy odds and really deliver than this is the one for you, whether you engage in the traditions that come from this over-hyped holiday or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Elf is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.<br /><br />Will Ferrell fans fall into two camps: the ones that appreciate his raunchy side, and those who find his goofy innocence charming.<br /><br />I'm in the second camp.<br /><br />My children and I quote Elf often. "Does somebody need a hug?" is a favorite.<br /><br />But I know perfectly wonderful people who hated the movie.<br /><br />If you go for art or brilliant acting/writing, or a deep heartfelt message to take away with you -- you probably shouldn't go there with Elf. The logical will be annoyed with the elf adoption and flying sleigh logistics.<br /><br />But if you find it at all amusing when grown men wear tights and get sideswiped by taxis, Elf may be singing your song. Does excessive childlike behavior no matter how old the child, coax a smile? Then Elf may be a movie you'll add to your favorites list.<br /><br />Elf may fall into that category with Napoleon Dynamite...either you love it or you hate it. And I'm a Napoleon fan.  I even loved Nacho Libre, Three Amigos and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Give me an excellent sight gag, some physical humor and a few great one-liners and I'm in.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>For a lot of moviegoers, Bob Clark's delightful A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983) is their sleeper favorite Christmas movie each year.  Mine, after believing in Santa again after two superb versions of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (George Seaton and John Hughes), is bound to become director Jon Favreau's hilarious and inspired ELF (2003).  Here is the premise in David Berenbaum's very original screenplay:  a baby who crawls into Santa's toy bag ends up being raised at the North Pole by Papa Elf (a wonderful Bob Newhart).  At age 30, elf Buddy (a wonderful Will Farrell) is a real elf sent to find his human father (James Caan) in a Christmas New York City filled with fake elves and phony Santas in myriad toy departments.  Caan is much too busy with ad accounts in his Empire State Building office, so Buddy finds himself in the Toy Department at Gimbels.  There is a very funny scene where a huge boss of the department tells him to get back to work and stop saying "This is not the North Pole-where's the snow?"  Watch Buddy jump for joy when told by the boss that Santa is coming at 10:00 a.m. the next morning.<br /><br />Buddy falls in love with an incandescently delightful Zooey Deschanel, as a hardworking Gimbels elf.  Working all night to make the Toy Department look like the real North Pole, Buddy wanders into the empty women's locker room at dawn when he hears Zooey taking a shower and sweetly singing "Baby, It's Cold Outside."  Deschanel has a lovely singing voice and, like Farrell, should have gotten an Oscar nomination.  In another movie era, ELF would make her a star.  She slowly realizes that Buddy is the real thing; so do Caan's wife, Mary Steenburgen, and whoever plays his young son.  Buddy does outlandish things, like eating spaghetti with maple syrup and drinking a whole two liter bottle of Pepsi in one gulp, then letting loose with a 20 second belch that had me on the floor laughing, despite my better judgment.  It is FUNNY.<br /><br />ELF is sublime whenever Zooey is on screen with Buddy.  With Sinatra's "You Make Me Feel So Young" on the soundtrack, the two discover the Christmas wonders of Manhattan, including Rockefeller Center and the largest tree Buddy has ever seen.  And they share a lovely first kiss while ice skating.  Poor Caan keeps losing ad accounts with unbelievers, but slowly warms to his elf son because everything Buddy does has good intentions, like cutting down a gigantic Christmas tree in Central Park to have a tree at home.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, Santa (a well-cast Ed Asner) brings his presents and sleigh to Central Park, but finds himself grounded there because his sleigh is powered by believers, who are in short supply!  But eventually even Caan becomes a believer when he passes up a huge ad account to be with his neglected real young son, Buddy's brother.  Zooey shows up to do a heartfelt rendition of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", eventually joined in by a huge gathering of believers.  Obviously, the movie has a happy ending.  I won't tell you what it is.  I have already given away ? of the plot.<br /><br />ELF reminded me a bit of John Hughes' expert remake of MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET (1994), where Richard Attenborough is so convincing as Santa and enchanting young Mara Wilson is such a true believer that the whole movie works beautifully to make even jaded adults rethink their previous training about Santa really being your parents.  When Buddy hears this story from Papa Elf at the North Pole, he scoffs hilariously, "Oh yeah, right.  I'm sure the parents have time to work and still get all the presents and make the cookies for Santa's visit!"  If you can find enough magic in your heart to try and believe in a real Santa Claus and genuine North Pole Elves, the wonderful duo of Will Farrell and Zooey Deschanel in ELF will sure go a long way toward making a believer out of you.  Even if you don't believe, you should still laugh a lot and have a good time.<br /><br />ELF is a movie that seems destined to be a Christmas season movie perennial.  John Debney did the lovely ethereal music score, which is interspersed with traditional carols, and Rusty Smith is credited production designer for the fun job of transforming Gimbels Toy Department into the North Pole.  Now who are director Jon Favreau and writer David Berenbaum?  I look forward to what they both do next.  The movie is both Full Screen and 1.85 Wide Screen on DVD.  It is also an Infini Film that you can play with a trivia footnotes commentary over the movie, if you like.  There is also a traditional commentary with Favreau and Farrell, but I opted for the straight movie to hear all of the dialogue.  Have fun with ELF.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Will Farrell captures the essence of innocence as Buddy the elf in "Elf," directed by "Swingers" man Jon Favreau.  From the beginning, this movie catches both the imaginations of young kids and the hearts of adults.  It tells the story of the aforementioned Buddy, an orphaned human baby who is raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole, and his attempt to find his real father who just happens to live in New York.<br /><br />Farrell is perfect as the innocent Buddy.  He is captivated by everything New York.  From the huge buildings to the gum on the handrails at the subway entrance, he takes it all in.  When he finds his father(James Caan), he tries his best to be accepted into the family, but his innocence often gets him in the way or in trouble.  Also, Santa runs into a little trouble on Christmas Eve and has to call on Buddy to help save Christmas.  The result is a heart-warming, happy-ending tale that is perfect to watch at Christmas and year-round.<br /><br />The supporting cast is splendid.  Bob Newhart plays Buddy's adoptive elf father.  Ed Asner plays a wonderful Santa.  Mary Steenburgen plays Caan's wife who is amazed by the childlike simplicity of Buddy.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of this flick is the lovely Zooey Deschanel, who plays a department store elf that Buddy falls hard for.  Their date, including a taste of the "world's best coffee," is fun to watch, and Deschanel and Farrell have wonderful chemistry on the screen.<br /><br />Language is pretty light, so the youngsters can watch this.  There are a couple of curse words scattered through the movie, but nothing you can't hear at the mall, unfortunately.  The music is fun.  Deschanel performs "Baby, It's Cold Outside" with Farrell in the film, and with Leon Redbone in the end credits.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this film will become a Christmas favorite and eventually rank up there with holiday comedies like "A Christmas Story."</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Elf is a cute bit of fluff  about a human orphan (Buddy) who grows up as a the foster son of an elf at the North Pole. Will Ferrell  stars as the tights-wearing, permed elf, Buddy. Bob Newhart  stars as his foster father and James Caan stars as his biological father. When Buddy has difficulty making his quota of toys, he begins to question himself. Overhearing from some of the other workers that he's really a human and NOT an elf, he decides to go to the real city to find his biological father.<br /><br />I really liked most of Elf, with the exception of two things: there were a few 'sophomoric humor scenes such as when Buddy is eating used chewing gum off the rail in the subway in New York, and scenes where Buddy is eating spaghetti with maple syrup. (Gag). And the rather annoying message that: Biological fathers are somehow superior to adopted fathers. I was disappointed that after Buddy found his biological father he ditched his elf dad and and wanted to become human. Say what? I wish Hollywood wouldn't perpetuate this myth that biology is somehow better than adopted parents. (Sigh).<br /><br />Other than those minor peeves, this was a cute funny movie sure to please the kiddies or the kids at heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Wow, this was an incredibly corny but funny movie. Sometimes it was gut burstingly funny, but towards the end it gets really stupid. The scene where Ferrel is singing (spreading christmas cheer) is priceless. I was in tears! It is a silly but fun movie. Will Ferrel stars as Buddy, a human orphan raised as an elf in Santa's workshop, grows up in the land of Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials. Candy cane trees, gingerbread houses and an animated talking snowman are this boy's life. His odyssey to find his biological father, a cynical publisher on Santa's naughty list, takes him out of the land of sugar plum diets and into the bustling streets of New York City. He meets dad, dad thinks he's a nut, takes him in, other son befriends him, dad get's mad at buddy after buddy innocently mistakened a midget for an elf (yet another gut burster) and says some unkind words, son finds buddy, santa crashes in central park, and they all help santa and save christmas. Now that I just ruined the movioe for you, you should still see it. It's no A Christmas Story, but it is a fun and enjoyably silly comedy for the whole family to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Elf" is one of those rare films that is impervious to criticism.  It is a fun and funny film that espouses the spirit of Christmas and actually means it.  As a counterpoint, just recall "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" of a few years ago, a film that allegedly was about the commercialism of the holiday yet wholeheartedly embraced said consumerism.  Credit has to be given to Will Ferrell who jumps into the role of Buddy, the human adopted by elves, with reckless, yet sweet, comic abandonment.  Buddy is essentially a man-child, but Ferrell makes his belief in the spirit of Christmas infectious.  James Caan does an amusing turn as Buddy's slow-burning gruff biological father.  And it's nice to see old-pros like Bob Newhart and Ed Asner as Papa Elf and Santa Clause, respectively.  Peter Dinklage has an amusing cameo as an ill-tempered children's author.  Credit has to go to director John Favreau for not going saccharine, or, even worse, making this a cynical exercise.  I'm not sure if this is classic stuff, but it'll do.  One quibble is some of the off-color humor was superfluous, but that will probably go over younger viewers heads.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell, one of the funnier of the recent Saturday Night Live cast members, stars as Buddy the Elf.  As a baby living in an orphanage, the baby buddy manages to crawl out of his crib and into Santa's bag of toys.  When Santa (Ed Asner) returns to the North Pole, the baby is found and they decide to raise him as an elf.  This north pole is straight out of a Rankin-Bass Animation with stop-motion snowmen and woodland creatures.<br /><br />Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf, played in his best deadpan style by Bob Newhart.  But all is not well, Buddy is twice the size of all the other elves and just doesn't excel at toy making.  He's finally told that he's human...he was put up for adoption and his father WAlter(james Caan) never knew he had a son.<br /><br />Walter is now a publishing Exec in NY and what's more..he's on the naughty list.  Buddy sets out...walking...all the way from the North Pole to NY to meet his dad.  Along the way he encounters a few adventures like getting a job as a Gimbels department store Elf, and getting into a fight with the fake Santa, and meeting a beautiful, but lonely girl, Jovie.<br /><br />Of course Walter at first thinks Buddy's nuts...but a blood test proves Buddy is his son and takes him home to his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael.<br /><br />As you would expect, Buddy eventually wins over his gruff father and imbues everyone around him with the true spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />The movie is very predictable but what Christmas movie isn't.  Ferrell is just so damn funny with his child-like portrayal of buddy, winning over everyone he meets...even the clerks in the mail room.  Ferrell really has great timing.<br /><br />All the roles are pretty standard, especially steenburgens who always seems to play the nice, sweet mother figure.  There are also some nice bit parts from Andy Richter and Artie Lange as the aforementioned fake Santa who gets into a fight with Buddy.<br /><br />The two disk DVD is loaded with a lot of extras including several cute little games you can play with your dvd remote.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is entirely possible that Will Ferrell will never have another role as perfect as that of Buddy the Elf in "Elf" for the rest of his film career.  This is just a case of perfect casting, which is critical for any film that wants to tell you the story of a 6' 3?" inch human being who thinks he is one of Santa's elves.  Ferrell strikes the perfect note of earnest na?vet&eacute; for most of the film and manages to stay endearing without becoming obnoxious (although the syrup on spaghetti bit is toeing the line for my money).  From the moment he appears full sized, you are sold on Ferrell's Buddy and whatever failings this 2003 holiday comedy has, it has nothing to do with his performance.<br /><br />The premise of "Elf" is that one Christmas many years ago Santa Clause (Ed Asner) left an orphanage with a small passenger in his sack of toys.  Since Santa obviously has a warm spot in his heart for children, little Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and raised as an Elf despite the fact that he is twice as big as his adopted father by the time he is four.  But Buddy does not know that he is adopted until he overhears the other elves talking about the problems with an "elf" who can only make 85 Etch-a-Sketches a day instead of 200.  Once he knows the truth, Buddy heads to New York City and the Empire State Building, where his father, Walter Hobbes (James Caan) works.  The only thing that Buddy knows about his father is that he is on Santa's naughty list; he does not know that Walter has a wife, Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and a son, Michael (Daniel Tay).<br /><br />"Elf" is a film that is really geared for children, which is a polite way of saying that the script by David Berenbaum keeps things simple for the kiddies as it goes through all of the expected scenes as Buddy turns rough beginnings with his father and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the cute girl dressed up as an elf at Gimbels.  The publishing house that Walter works for is in desperate need for an idea for a great children's book, and if you do not know where that idea is going to come from then you have simply not been around long enough to have seen enough of these films to figure it all out before the end.  Hiring Asner and Newhart is great, but giving them better scenes and dialogue would have been even better.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Buddy's little animated friends and a lot less of the Central Park Rangers (What is up with having New York Police Officers be the "villains" in a post 9/11 movie?  Bah Humbug, people).<br /><br />But the premises are certainly there to be developed into more memorable scenes.  For example, Buddy might have been a human in an elf's world, but he is a serious thrower of snow balls and only needs forty minutes of sleep a night, which gives him lots of time to do Christmas decorations.  The latter comes up with a memorable scene early on, but is then reduced to being just a running gag.  Yet for most of the film the idea that Buddy has a touch of magic is ignored.  Obviously the fish out of water/stranger in a strange land bits are a large part of the film, but this just emphasizes this film is geared for elf sized children.  I think it could have been even more enchanting if it had raised its sights slightly higher.<br /><br />The other major problem with "Elf" is that the least interesting relationship is between Buddy and his father, where there is just no chemistry.  The scenes with Jovie are a lot more touching, there is not enough of Faizon Love as the manager at Gimbel's who thinks Buddy is working him, Amy Sedaris is pretty much wasted as Walter's secretary Deb, and Steenburgen simply puts Caan to shame every time they have a scene together.  If I had to make a choice between recasting the role of Walter or reworking the script, I am not sure which way I would go.  The former would be the cheap fix, but the character and cast are good enough that tinkering with the script could have increased the chances of "Elf" being the modern Christmas classic it wants to be.<br /><br />Still, kids will love the film, and adults will find enough to laugh at and enough gentle tugs of the heartstrings to make it worth the viewing.  But it is just not up to the level of a perennial film for the holiday season.  Besides, since this an Infinifilm DVD it is loaded with lots of goodies for movie fans to enjoy (I especially liked just listening to kids talk about elves, Santa's sleigh, the North Pole, etc.).  I am starting to get good at navigating through all the options and have actually developed a preference jumping in and out of the extra scenes the second time I go through the film.  Final Note: I am sure most of your figured out that Leon Redbone was doing the voice of Leon the Snowman, but the voice of the Polar Bear Cub was the master of stop motion animation, Ray Harryhausen.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>My wife and I went to the movies last year and our choices were BAD SANTA and ELF.<br /><br />Thank God we chose ELF.<br /><br />This movie hits all the right notes and will become holiday traditional viewing like A CHRISTMAS STORY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  They really knew what they were doing by making it family friendly too.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is absolutely perfect as "Buddy," an adopted elf who discovers he's human and heads to New York to find this real father.  His energy and exuberance, along with a funny script, really makes this one work.<br /><br />I haven't even watched the extras yet but the movie is funny enough to give it five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Holiday movies seem to me to almost be a wasted effort.  A film that only appeals one month of the year.  "Elf" is different.  It has that magic that "Christmas Vacation" has.  A film that I will watch every holiday season.  It will be timeless and never get old.  It is charming and fun for the whole family,  It is cleverly written, tightly directed, and slick production values.  Will Farrell is in top form in the title role.  Director Jon Favreau show his comic timing in his direction and moves the film at a quick and happy pace.  Sit back, drink eggnog and leave Santa some cookies.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>"Elf" was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.<br /><br />I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into "Silly and Stupid" Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.<br /><br />In Elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.<br /><br />Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parents to watch together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Liberties can be taken when it comes to some holiday movies, and Elf is also one that fits this niche, as Will Ferrell plays a human who mistakenly was left abandoned and wound up being raised by Papa Elf and his group of elves. Trying to fit into the elf world, Buddy (Ferrell) helps his fellow elves prepare gifts for Christmas and do other sorts of jobs, but never quite holds up his end (at one point, after not meaning his quota, Buddy frustratingly calls himself a "cotton-headed ninnymuggins" in despair). One day, after overhearing other elves speak about Buddy's "humanness", Buddy has the truth broken to him by Papa Elf: he was adopted by the elf community, and he's really human, and his father, who is on the naughty list, is in New York where he works. Buddy departs to New York to find his real father, and tries to understand and fit into the culture of the human world as Christmas approaches. Buddy's father is play perfectly by James Caan, who is aloof and distant from Buddy. While in a department store, Buddy meets a beautiful worker who he falls for. From here, the film focuses on Buddy trying to gain a role in his human father's life as well as his new found relationship with his fellow worker, all the while trying to stir up Christmas spirit in a world where it is sorely lacking.<br /><br />The casting for Elf is superb. Ferrell can use his zany and over-the-top antics, and it fits well with his character Buddy as he makes his transition to the human world as a giant elf. He plays the role as "man-child" with perfection, and his obnoxious and overly loud outbursts go well with the inner child and innocence in this role. There is also great chemistry between Ferrell and Deschanel, who is the department store clerk who Buddy falls for. There are a few parts where they sing, and Deschanel has a wonderful voice, with Ferrell's not being too bad either. James Caan does a great job and is cast perfectly as Buddy's reluctant and tough-guy father, who at first wants nothing to do with Buddy, but eventually softens. And Bob Newhart is solid as Papa Elf, who raises Buddy to be more elf than human.<br /><br />There are some great laughs in the film as well as a few memorable lines. At one point, Buddy overhears that Santa is coming to the department store the next day and he screams out "Santa!" When the "phony" Santa arrives, Buddy sniffs out that this is, in fact, a fake and is on to him, saying "You sit on a throne of lies", which follows with a major altercation between the two.<br /><br />The nice thing about this film is that it is a family friendly Christmas film with humor and a feel good attitude. The latter part of the film probably isn't as good as the first half, and we can probably predict how things will turn out, but that doesn't deter an over all good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>Who would've thought that Will Ferrell, Saturday Night Live alumni, would be the one to create a new Christmas classic? Thanks to the wide-eyed silliness of Ferrell, the deftly smart direction of Jon Favreau, and a cleverly funny & heartfelt script, "Elf" turns out to be a real delight. In a decade awash with disappointing Holiday films, this one truly earns the title of "brand new Holiday classic".<br />And the whole cast is good: James Caan as Buddy the Elf's gruff, cynical father who's lost touch with his true spirit; Mary Steenburgen gives solid support as Caan's wife; Bob Newhart lends his dour, low-key presence as Head Elf; Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest, a rather cynical & untrusting department store worker; and Ed Asner as a sort of world-weary Santa. But ultimately, this is Ferrell's movie all the way, as his sweetly innocent but comical Buddy navigates his way through the gritty jungle of New York City, and eventually succeeds in re-connecting the town with its lost Holiday spirit.<br />Both an engaging tale & a charming satire of Christmas movies, "Elf" is definitely one of my favorites to watch around Christmastime!</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>Not being a real fan of Saturday Night Live since the days of John Belushi and Bill Murray, my only exposure to Will Farrell came with the movie Old School. And while Farrell was the best part of the film, it wasn't like I would rush right out and see a movie with him as the star...So I missed Elf last year and finally saw it on DVD last night. This is a great holiday movie, and Will Farrell is hilarious. The story of Buddy adjusting to human life after being raised at the North Pole is enchanting, and Farrell's wide-eyed innocence gives you a chuckle as he wanders the streets of New York dressed in his elf attire. This really is a great family movie, kids will love to see Santa and the North Pole, and Buddy's antics will have them laughing as well. But this is not a "Kids" movie in the way that "Santa Clause" is. The jokes also target an older demographic that will have adults laughing too. This is the perfect time of the year to watch Elf, the holidays are right around the corner, and you can't help but catch a little of the Christmas Spirit after watching Elf. Also, any movie that features Bob Newhart's dry humor is worth your viewing. Newhart's Poppa Elf character just had me chuckling whenever he appeared on screen, not since Jack Benny has a comedian been able to express so much by doing so little. Great cast, great writing, great holiday sentiment....you can't ask for more than that.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>well, once again, my mail order company broke a street date, and my  'ELF' dvd arrived this past friday. i must tell you, in earnest, i totally laughed till i cried! will is great as the 6ft 3" elf. the role was made for him. the cinematography at santa's north pole, nyc during  the bustling holiday season, i could really go on and on here i even liked it more than shrek 2! this dvd will become a holiday classic brought back every season, and never wear out it's welcome! get it for your loved ones-get it for yourself, as i did-you will not regret it at all. the supporting cast, the swift direction, the ac-3 sound, the choice of either wide or full screen on 2 packed dvds all add up to  great laughs that will continue every time you view it. this and 'gone with the wind' the new 4 disc restored version, are my 2 very favorite and most cherished dvds of this rather sad war torn year! bravos and kudos to both dvd companies for warming not only mine, but i am sure many hearts this holiday season!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>ELF is a warm humorous family Christmas tale.  Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy who in his own words is a "human raised by elves."  That's elves like Santa's employees not the ones that inhabit Tolkien's Middle-earth.  Needless to say Buddy has several differences from his adopted family and friends most notably his size which provides quite a few laughs in the first few minutes of the film.  The major plot point occurs when Buddy gets to meet his biological father, a stern man played by James Caan, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City.  There are misunderstandings at first between the naive Buddy and his city smart dad but a happy ending is in store for father, son and extended elf family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>If you are anything like I am, then you are a sap for almost any sentimental movie that comes out around Christmas time. This may have been caused by too many viewings of RUDPOLPH on television or the fact that the first time I ever saw IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE I was fortunate enough to watch it in the company of creator/director Frank Capra. In any event, put enough sentiment into a movie and I am gone.<br /><br />That being said, this movie isn't overwrought with sentiment but it does have its share. More than sap, it offers us a truly funny movie that doesn't rely on the most total of gross jokes to make you laugh (although a well placed burp does occur). Instead, it offers us the na?ve charm of a character that is so innocent that every move he makes becomes touching and funny at the same time.<br /><br />Will Ferrell of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE fame stars as Buddy. When a baby in an orphanage, Buddy crawled into Santa's sack and was taken to the North Pole. There he was adopted by a kindly elf (Bob Newhart) and raised until he was about 30 when he discovered he was a human and not an elf. Like I said, Buddy is quite na?ve throughout.<br />Learning his true lot in life, Buddy heads for New York to find his real father, a man Santa tells him is on the naughty list.<br /><br />Buddy's father Walter is played by James Caan. Walter is a publisher of children's books who is looking for a hit. He's also one of those workaholics that have no time for anything from the holiday to his own family. Needless to say when Buddy arrives rather than welcome him with open arms, he sends him away and refuses to believe.<br /><br />Buddy finds work (and a love interest) at Gimbels in the Christmas department naturally. A tussle with a store Santa (you see Buddy KNOWS he's not the real one) and he loses his job. But not before Walter takes him to his doctor to discover that yes, Buddy IS his real son.<br /><br />Moving in with the family, Buddy is filled with Christmas cheer non stop. He decorates the apartment, he eats everything with syrup on it and he becomes friends with Walter's other son Michael (Daniel Tay). It is through watching and being exposed to Buddy that several of the characters change by the films end.<br /><br />But before that happens, a destitute Buddy watches as Santa's sleigh falls from the sky into Central Park. The magic that kept the sleigh soaring in the past was Christmas spirit which has been lacking lately. An engine was put on by Buddy's adoptive father to help Santa along. But the engine has fallen off and only Buddy can replace it and help Santa. But can he do so before the park police catch them? Or will there be a way that the spirit of Christmas will rise again, enough to get the sleigh running once more?<br /><br />This movie is filled with simple jokes that are funny, mostly visuals that lose something in the translation when described (for instance Buddy's joy in running around in a revolving door...see? Not funny to read but funny to watch). Ferrell is fantastic, providing the right about of simple mindedness to Buddy but at the same time offering that hopeful attitude that most of us have lost along the way.<br /><br />Caan does a great job too as the frustrated father who never knew about Buddy but is struggling to not only come to terms with that but his whole life as well. Mary Steenburgen adds just the right support in her role as Caan's wife. Zooey Deschanel is a bright star as the object of Buddy's affection (with a fantastic singing voice as well). And stand out but used only for a brief moment is Peter Dinklage as Miles Finch, a high priced creative genius in the world of children's lit who buddy mistakes for an elf (Dinklage is actually a dwarf).<br /><br />The movie offers some hilarious moments and some touching ones as well. And it also takes a moment to remind us all of the real spirit of Christmas. The joy of giving and not just waiting to see who got you something. It makes you realize that this is a special time of the year. And above all else, it makes you feel one of the simplest things at this time of year. Warm and fuzzy. Don't miss this one.<br /><br />Oh yes, one more thing. If you too grew up with RUDOLPH you'll love the stop motion credits and characters at the North Pole who seem slightly familiar. Created by the Chiodo brothers (of CRITTERS and KILLER KLOWNS fame) it is a tremendous tribute to the classic Rankin/Bass creations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny and sweet and original and did I mention funny yet?  I love Will Ferrell and so maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but I can't help it.  I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'm reminded of why I love it.  The story is about a young orphan who ends up a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slips into Santa's big bag of toys.  When Santa finds out he has a new guest he leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) who never found love and thus never was able to have the children he wanted so badly.  When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he's not like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find his real parents.<br /><br />This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), his father, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's `bad list' year after year.  The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficult for anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the viewer is moved to love him more and more with each passing frame.  This is a perfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the top antics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendly performance that's as funny as it is charming.  As Buddy strives to gain his fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect the Christmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supporting performances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, `Elf' is a delightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>I forgot how much I liked this movie until just watching it a 2nd time. It's quite funny and very charming. Let's face it, there are so many bad holiday movies, so it's always a welcome surprise when you find one thats as good as this one is. Plus, it's one of those rare occurences when both children and adults can watch a movie and have a good time. Watching this helped me forgive Will Ferrell for Bewitched and Melinda and Melinda, his last two movies that really stunk. He is perfect here, innocent, hilarious, very fun.<br /><br />Will Ferrell obviously has a gift for physical comedy, but his delivery in "elf' was right-on, his sadness when he realizes most people's X-mas spririt generally sucks was perfect, and the chemistry he has with his real father, played well by James Caan , is wonderfull. You see Buddy (Will Ferrell) was an orphan baby raised by elves, mostly by Papa Elf played perfectly dead-pan by Bob Newhart, but he feels he does not fit in with the rest of the elves so he heads to New York City to find his real dad.<br /><br />Upon arrival in the Big Apple, Buddy goes through all kinds of mis-adventures, all very funny and sometimes sweet and sappy, but thats ok here, it fits and does not feel thrown in our faces like most holiday fare. He finds his dad is on the naughty list and also helps Santa (Ed Asner, great casting by the way) get the world back into some Christmas Spirit. Buddy also finds some time to fall in love with a department store elf he works with played lovingly by Zooey Deschanel, whom I am really starting to enjoy, this is the 3rd movie I've seen her in, and I like where she is heading.<br /><br />So, great cast, lots of laughs, harmless fun, any problems you ask? Not really, Mary Steenburgen plays James Caan's wife and she  really didn't provide much, she used to be such a good actress, but as of late it seems, um, lacking....? Also at only 95 minutes, this could have been a little longer, maybe show us more Buddy trying to 'get' New York, but over-all, not a whole lot to complain about.<br /><br />So, here is the perfect night's viewing for you and your kids if you ware looking for an X-mas night 1.Elf 2.Polar Express 3.Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey 4.The Little Drummer Boy, and finish it up with It's a Wonderfull Life, I'm telling you people this is fool-proof, great viewing, I promise.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />acting...........4 stars, Ferrell and Caan are magnificent<br /><br />directing........4 stars, Jon Favreau (Swingers, Made) does comedies very well.<br /><br />special effects.....4 stars, X-mas settings are beautifull, as are the North Pole shots<br /><br />comedy rating......4.5 stars, I laughed alot, Bob Newhart is priceless!!!<br /><br />quality...........4.5 stars, Simple yet a joy to watch</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>This Christmas, discover your inner elf... At least, that's the tagline for Elf, one of the funniest films of 2003. Packed with a cast of Hollywood all-star talent, Elf is guaranteed to make you laugh. The touching story about an adopted elf who discovers he's really a boy is sort of a bizzaro-Pinocchio story that opened to such widespread critical acclaim that it unanimously swept zero Oscars at the 2004 Academy Awards ceremony! Nevertheless, Elf is worth the price of admission. Although Christmas Vacation still holds the title as the top Christmas comedy, Elf is still a great night's entertainment...<br /><br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) is an oversized elf working away at the North Pole. Always wearing a smile, he dwarfs his comrades and never seems able to find his niche in the toy-making arena. Eventually, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is forced to reveal the truth to Buddy. He's actually a human. He's not really an elf at all. The elves love buddy just the same, but Buddy feels the need to strike out on his own and try to find himself - and maybe even his family too...<br /><br />Scouring the streets of New York City, Buddy must learn the urban rules of life. In due time, he manages to track down his biological father, a successful publishing executive named Walter (James Caan). But despite the prodding of his wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen), Walter is reluctant to start a relationship with the over-eager grown-up child...<br /><br />In the meantime, Buddy spends his days working at Gimbel's department store where he stars as a department store Santa's elf and a Christmas season decorator, creating a magical wonderland that thrills customers and employees alike. Striking up a relationship with fellow employee Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), Buddy's life is slowly transitioning from elf to human... But will he be able to survive in the big city? Will he be able to rekindle a relationship with his father? Elf thoroughly entertains us while we find out...<br /><br />With a great cast of writers, Elf manages to keep the laughs rolling throughout the entirety of the film. Although lacking in some areas (it's not one of the greatest comedies of all-time), Elf is a hilarious movie in its own right. Will Ferrell turns in an amazing performance as Buddy. Like Tom Hanks in Big, he's actually believable as the innocent man-child roaming the streets of New York City. It's this farcical innocence that provides Elf with the charm necessary to keep the audience involved in the story beginning to end. Because of its laugh factor, and the surprisingly small number of decent Christmas-themed movies, Elf is a definite must-see film... Check it out this Christmas!<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I rented this during the holidays this year.  I think it's a nice film for the entire family with a few laughs.  It's perfect to watch right around this time of year, which is exactly what I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The focus of Elf, is on a man named Buddy(Will Ferrell). When he was two years old and living in an orphenage, Santa visited the orphenage that he was staying at. He managed to sneak into Santa's bag of gifts and be taken back with Santa to the North Pole. When Santa and his elves realize that he brought back a human child, they decide to raise him as one of their own. Buddy is then taught to live like an elf and Buddy himself believes that he is one, until his 30th birthday. His surrogate father dubbed Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), tells Buddy the story, and that his real father is a man named Walter(James Cann) that lives in New York. Buddy sets off for New York to find his father and integrate himself into Walter's life that includes his wife Emily(Mary Steenburgen) and a ten year old son. The only problem is that since Buddy has been raised as an elf his whole life, he does not know how to act like a normal person. Buddy soon discovers that life in the big city is much different and much more difficult than life at the North Pole.<br /><br />I was probably more skeptical than I have been in a long time going into watching Elf. I cannot stand Will Ferrell and the idea of a grown man acting like an elf sounded ridiculous to me. But due to the fact that Elf received such praise from moviegoers, and since I am a huge fan of James Cann, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give Elf a shot. Let's just say that I was wrong with my intial reaction to this film, because it turned out to be funny and enjoyable. Since this is the type of role that Will Ferrell was designed for, he was suprisingly tolerable in this film, and despite the fact that the plot looks ridiculous on paper, it works well for the film. Will Ferrell makes the character and his situation believeable. You really start to accept the fact that the guy is a 30 year old elf. Ferrell literally brings the character to life. James Cann who is usually known for his dramatic and tough guy roles, puts on a solid performance in this movie. The reason why Cann is so funny in this film, is because he plays an uptight executive who is forced to accept a long lost son who is seemingly crazy. No matter what he does, he cannot get rid of Buddy and begins to feel obligated to take care of the son he never knew he had.<br /><br />Overall, Elf is a film that is perfect for the whole family. It provides quality laughs and makes you feel good about Christmas in general. The extra features are great. You get three different featurettes, deleted scenes, and more.<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Its funny and non-stop laughs.  I saw it when it came out in the movies last year and bought it the day it came out.  The deleted scenes are funny.  Zooey Deschanel is hot.  I think everyone should see it.  And as funny as Will Ferrel is and as he is funny in this and old school he is also funny in starsky and hutch and is funny in his worst movie anchorman which sucked.  His others are great!!!!  But not anchorman that just sucked.  Sucked a whole lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a cute holiday film that is fun for the whole family. Will Ferrell is charmingly funny in the role of a human who is brought up by elves from the time that he was an infant. Through happenstance and fate, our very human elf,  named Buddy, after  the brand of diaper that he was wearing when he ends up in the North Pole, spends his days working in Santa's toyshop. Since he is over six feet tall and towers over the diminutive elves, Buddy sometimes feels a little bit out of place, especially as he is not much of a toy maker.<br /><br />When he accidentally discovers that he is not an elf at all, he is told the truth about his origins and discovers that his biological father is alive and well and living in New York City. So, he leaves his Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and goes  off into the wild blue yonder to hook up with dear old dad (James Caan).  He makes quite a journey, only to discover that dear old dad is not really interested in welcoming a thirty-year-old son  of whose existence he was formerly unaware.  Of course, the fact that Buddy is dressed in a bright green elf outfit and sporting canary yellow tights does not help his cause.<br /><br />While Buddy felt a little out of place with the elves, his initial interactions with humans are totally off the wall and oftentimes quite amusing. With time, however, Buddy learns how to interact with humans. He finds brotherly love, true love, and familial love, as well. This does not happen, however, until he has undergone some personal angst. Buddy also discovers that he has a unique talent, one that will make him quite popular with a younger crowd.<br /><br />Will Ferrell approaches his role with a certain wide-eyed innocence and naivet&eacute;  that is endearing. He is also quite funny in this film.  Bob Newhart is, as always, deadpan funny. James Caan is excellent as the reluctant father. An unrecognizable Ed Asner is an effective Santa Claus. The film is well-directed by Jean Favreau, who has created a delightful film that should become a holiday favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>"Elf," the new Christmas family film, stars Will Farrell as Buddy, a would-be elf.  It seems Buddy was an orphan who sneaked into Santa's bag, was taken to his workshop, and adopted by elf Bob Newhart.  Now Buddy is grown up, and he goes to New York City to meet his biological father (played by James Cann), and the predictable problems of an innocent elf in the big city begin.<br /><br />Parts of this movie are very likeable:  Will Farrell is charming and likeable as Buddy.  Bob Newhart is equally loveable and funny as the Papa Elf. Ed Asner was an odd choice as a grumpy, cold, and definitely not jolly, Santa Claus.  James Cann is dull as Buddy's biological father, a serious, unscrupulous children's book publisher. The middle section of the movie, which focuses on Cann's business problems, was tedious for me.  Will Farrells' scenes are joyful, however, and his fans will certainly enjoy "Elf."</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I must confess: I don't care for Will Farrel. Watching him on Saturday Night Live was like taking a cheese grater to my hand. This was the first movie of his that I saw, and I did so only because my roommate assured me that it was warm and entertaining.<br /><br />From the very beginning, with Bob Newhart's understated delivery, and the intriguing imagery that followed as the beginning credits rolled accompanied by warm Christmas music, I knew that he was right. Elf was going to be something special.<br /><br />The concept of a human being raised by elves at the North Pole is an intriguing and original one, as far as I'm aware. So the movie gets credit for that. At some point, of course, the "misfit" who can't fit into his bed, and can barely get into the bathroom, needs to find his real family. So, by himself (and this is slightly unrealistic - wouldn't he be accompanied by someone or something: New York isn't a place for an adult child who thinks he's an elf; in the "real" world, he would have been dead in an hour) he seeks out his real father. Who, as it happens, is on the "naughty list".<br /><br />His father, as it turns out, works in children's book publishing. I can not for the life of me imagine a more innappropriate job for that man to hold. He's callous, unkind, doesn't seem to be interested in children - and those aren't qualities that lend well to the creation of children's books. Nevertheless...it is a good fit for the ending.<br /><br />Farrell pulls off the innocent elf gig pretty well. Despite some uncomfortable moments (him dancing on a table on the mail room - that was a bit over the top), his performance was believable. Less believable was the pretty blonde girl falling for him, but we are being asked to suspend disbelief, and I think we can do so with that.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'd watch it over and over, and I wouldn't say that it has found its place in the canon of Christmas classics, but I would watch it again, and it is a decent Christmas film.<br /><br />However, I'm probably wrong. It will probably be played on television every Christmas for the next fifty years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Elf is a movie that will have you either loving or hating it. Although not drop dead funny like the Santa Clause, Elf does have its moments. Most of the time them being Will Ferrel being....well...Will Ferrel.<br /><br />Eg. Buddy (Will Ferrel)dancing for the mail room guys.<br /><br />Buddy asking Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy) out for food. Code named for date.<br /><br />The keebler elfs tree catching on fire while making cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise, its an entertaning movie to say the least, but while children will be amused, adults will likely be bored.<br />James Caan is pretty interesting as the father, but while Mary Steenburgen could have been, she never had enough scenes to be enthralling. Ed Asner as Santa is pretty cool, but no Tim Allen.<br /><br />Plot is pretty basic, Will Ferrel as a child crawls into santa's bag. Is adopted by the elves, and as he grows up begins to realize he's in a class of his own. So the truth comes out, and our hero (Or not) goes off to the magical land of New York to find his father. Who happens to be on the naughty list due to his cynical tactics in the work force i.e childrens books.<br />They pair meet up, and must deal with the differences of a chemically unbalanced elf, and a rather selfish-hard boiled father. Thrown into the mix of this self same elf falling in love and coping in an unfamilier world.<br /><br />Basic plot however funny and entertaning I found it. A truly enjoyable christmas movie, Will Ferrell is not to be missed. however rent it first. Right after watching The Santa Clause with Tim Allen, and you'll be sure to have an enjoyable holiday.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Very funny, with a hilarious role from Bob Newhart as Elf's father.  Will Farrell is great in this feel good comedy, good for the whole family.  My nine year old son was rolling in the aisles.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This movie is a sweet and sometimes touching holiday treat for the whole family with a touch of hilarity and a little sadness it could be added to any holiday collection.<br /><br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's (Ed Asner) bag as a baby and is eventually adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). Buddy grows up making toys for Santa but never quite gets up to the speed of the other elves and after trying a few odd jobs at the Pole he overhears the fact that he is really a human being and not an elf. This sets Buddy off on a search for his real human father in New York City. Buddy does his best to snuggle up to his father Walter (James Caan) and his step-mother Emily (Mary Steenburgen) while having a hard time dealing with all of the harsh chaos of human life.<br /><br />This film is a sweet portrayal of a human being brought up among elves in the faultlessness of Santa's home. It takes an innocent, positive person and places them right in the middle of all the negative human behaviors that seem to be magnified during the happiest of holidays. It places a smile back on the faces of anyone who lost the magic of Christmas and the joy of Santa Claus. And it definitely makes you look at your own attitude towards the people you "love" and care about while sadly showing all of the lost virtue of humanity. With Will Ferrell cast as the childlike elf it never ceases to be funny but some of the gags are a little far stretched...especially the burping scene! James Caan is great as the shut down, stressed-out and angry father. And who could forget Ed Asner as Santa! Overall a great message stems from this Christmas movie and you might even find yourself hoping for one last meeting with Santa Claus before your heart freezes over for good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>I laugh from beginning to end.

Buddy the elf is a human orphan that sneaks into Santa's bag during a stop.  Raised by the elf in the North Pole.  At some point he learns that he is human and about his real Dad.  He goes to live with his real Dad.  Of course he had trouble adjusting to New York city after living most of his life at the happy North Pole.  His Dad has trouble accepting that he has a son, especially one that is so happy all the time.<br /><br />Of course Santa faces trouble with less people believing in him and having trouble making his deliveries.  He crosses paths with Santa again and now helps to save the day.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Being a former cast member of Saturday Night Live doesn't guarantee a comedian a real chance of movie stardom.  For every Mike Myers, there is a Jimmy Fallon (attn:  Mr. Fallon---big mistake leaving SNL).  Fortunately Will Farrell is not one of those guys that will fall to the wayside.  He proves this with "Elf", a charming Christmas tale perfectly suited for him.<br /><br />  In this story a young baby accidently ends up in Santa's bag of toys and is taken back to the north pole.  The child is raised by one of the lead Elves (played by the wonderful Bob Newhart) until Buddy (Farrell) realizes he must find his real father.<br /><br />  The journey takes Buddy to New York where his work driven father (James Caan) finds out he has an adult soon and is, of course, convinced that his son, who believes he is an elf, is a complete nut case.  Will Farrell's innocent portrayal of Buddy is perfect and he makes the character lovable.  I hope this film finds its way into the list of Christmas classics that we see on TV every December during the holiday season.  It certainly deserves to be. I recommend this film for all---a funny movie to enjoy with family or friends.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>...The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead stars<p>Though the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.<p>Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The silliness is funny and Zooey is enchanting. You can finally admit to seeing and liking one of Will's movies. (remember Zooey in Almost Famous?)</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>This review took me some time to write, rewrite, and confirm my thoughts.  Over the course of two days, I had to think about this film to make sure that I was putting my correct words down on paper.  This film was reminiscent of an airplane take-off.  As the plane begins for take-off it taxis around the runway (opening credits) and then gets its engines up to full throttle before eventually lifting into the air (the beginning of the film), but once in the air, we coast and outside of some brief turbulence, you have a smooth flight the rest of the trip.  That is how I felt about the film Elf.  Director Favreau (of Swingers fame) bursts onto this film with such raw imagination and humor that by the time he gets to New York City, he is panting for air and eventually tired of the entire endeavor.  With a medium to medium rare Ferrell, Favreau starts this story with amazing imagery, some moments of classic Christmas television memories, and powerful creativity, but in the end it all reads like a Hollywood playbook.  Everyone is in their positions, let's play a good game.<br /><br />Ferrell is a very funny actor.  In fact, I praise him for the return of the "funny" comedy with his work in Anchorman, but in this film it just feels as if he is going through the motions without the emotion.  You could tell that he just didn't feel as comfortable in his role of Buddy as he did as Ron Burgundy.  Farrell, and perhaps it was more the writers fault, provided no really memorable lines that the kids will be quoting for years to come nor did he do anything that wasn't already expected of him.  I don't think this was his sled, for lack of a better word.  Then again, perhaps it didn't work for me because he didn't have the backup he needed.  Ferrell is one of those comic geniuses that play off other actors very well and some of the most memorable Ferrell moments are when he is ad-libbing with others.  James Caan was a horrible choice as the father.  He is cranky, yes, but not from acting.  I couldn't help but cringe when I saw him at the end of this film, he was pathetic.  I couldn't tell if he was interested in this film, or just needed some extra cash.  I felt the same about the rest of the cast that surrounded Ferrell.  Deschanel and Steenburgen were completely miscast and literally just walked through the motions spewing lines from their mouths to pay for their new car.  The best example is when Zooey says to Ferrell, "You missed" during the romantic scene.  It was worse than poor and amateurish.  Wasted talent from Sedaris and Richter only angered me further.  The only saving actor from this entire film was Dinklage.  He was hysterical and commanded the screen for the few minutes he was on literally stealing the scene from Ferrell.  It was a plus in an already full film of minuses.<br /><br />For this film to really be pinnacle Christmas achievement, it needed some powerful writing that would just have you in your seat laughing because of the words behind Ferrell.  Sadly, that could not be found in this film.  There wasn't enough originality in the script to make this film really stand out.  I saw a glimmer of it when the film began with some of the CGI animals, but that was lost indefinitely after the first ten minutes.  When I first started watching this film, I saw it as a combination of all of our favorite Christmas programs.  This perception ended when Buddy made it to New York.  Riding in a clich&eacute; drawn horse and sleigh, we follow Buddy through New York as he attempts to bring humor to the simplest of situations.  It felt as if when Favreau found a joke, he never let it go, nearly killing the fun each time.  The syrup joke is the first that comes to mind.  The second was entire Central Park episode.  Everyone involved couldn't pick up the pieces from that "crash and burn".<br /><br />While it sounds like I am sitting here furiously upset with this film, I am not.  I went into the film with high expectations, but was left with only medium results.  Ferrell was funny, but not Ferrell-funny.  He was scripted, almost to the point where you could count his beats.  This was a holiday movie, but not one that will be played over and over again in this house.  Overall, it was disappointing, but thanks to a little help from Dinklage, it seemed just a tad bit better.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This movie had humor, I will admit that but its not great to even watch all the way through.

It's cute, goofy and harmless fun. Will Ferrell (Old School) is in top form as a big dork named Buddy who grew up in the North Pole  and he..thinks he's an elf. He is shocked and horrified to find out that he's actually not an elf. He then decides to leave the Northpole and find his real father (James Caan) and hold hands and eat sugar-plums with him lol. Caan isn't exactly a nice guy though and doesn't want to believe that Buddy is his son but who could blame him there. Elf delivers laughs as Buddy for example gets hit by taxi's, attacked by racoons and beat up by a midget that he keeps calling an elf. With lame Christmas movies like Christmas with the Kranks and Surviving Christmas in theaters now you are better off staying in and watching Elf.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>Elf is a Christmas story with a twist.<br /><br />The twist is provided, in the midst of a cute Christmas story, by the writing of Jon Favreau and the performance of Will Ferrell.

It's a Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy, children and adults alike, as it appeals to both the kid in all of us, as well as our more adult sensibilities.<br /><br />The Infinifilm edition includes 2 discs: One contains the Widescreen version and special features and the other contains the Full Screen version and special features.  There is plenty on the interactive DVDs to keep you busy for quite a while, including quality featurettes, deleted scenes, games you (or the kids) can play, commentaries and even DVD-rom features.<br /><br />This is a new favorite to add to the Christmas list.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This movie is a suprisingly funny tale of Buddy, a human baby that accidently got into santa's bag at the orphanage, and ended up at the north pole.  Santa had a softspot for babies, so Buddy (named after his diaper brand)  was given to an Elf (bob newhart) to raise.  Well, as buddy grew up, he was noticably different. After a series of disasterous attempted jobs at the north pole, the secret leaked out that buddy was a human.  So papa elf share with buddy the secret of his origin. It was at that point Buddy decided to go on a mission in search of his human father (mother unfortunately passed away), played by james caan.  We then follow Buddy to new york city at christmas time, in search of his day. Well from here, the story takes of, the adaptation of an Elf in the human world, let alone at christmas time.  Let's just say he was suprised at "SANTA" when he showed up at the department store.

Just don't give in to that first impression.  This is a very funny, often witty, sometimes delightful film.  It has a very good heart and Will Ferrell gives a performance with an amazing innocence.  Yeah, I know.  This is the same guy who gave us "Old School" and "Anchorman".  But this is better (although I liked "Anchorman").<br /><br />Here you have a guy, Buddy, who ends up being raised at the North Pole among Santa's elves as if he were just another Elf.  A huge elf.  There are some very funny scenes at the North Pole that lead to him being told by Papa Elf (drolly played by Bob Newhart) that he is a human.  Buddy is sent to New York to find his father (played to perplexed perfection by James Caan) who is on the Naughty List.<br /><br />Much of the fun in the film comes from the predictable cluelessness of someone raised as an Elf at the North Pole trying to find his or her way in New York City.  However, there is such freshness to the approach in this film that it is positively joyful.  Buddy interprets things literally with a good heart and everyone views him as being impossibly clever and full of cynical motives or dangerously insane.<br /><br />One of the great moments in the film comes when Buddy takes his new friend who happens to be a girl, Jovie (played by Zooey Deschanel with an inviting softness), around New York for a tour of his favorite places.  I won't spoil this delight for you.  However, one of the great lines is simply a toss away, "Watch out for the yellow ones.  They don't stop!"<br /><br />Did I expect a movie like this?

Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is very proud of his adopted son.  There's just one problem, Buddy is a human, not an elf.  In addition to his enormous size, he doesn't have the talents for toy making that all his friends do.<br /><br />When Buddy learns the truth, he sets out for New York to meet Walter (James Caan), his real father.  Walter works for a children's book publisher, but his ideas aren't selling.  He's also on Santa's (Edward Asner) naughty list.  And Walter isn't thrilled to discover he has an adult son, especially one who insists on dressing like an elf all the time.  Will he ever accept Buddy?  Will Buddy ever fit in New York?<br /><br />I avoided this movie because I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan.  This movie didn't exactly change my mind, but it wasn't as bad as I had feared.  In fact, it started out very cute and charming with several great laughs.  Then, Buddy moves to New York and things go downhill.  I'm not a big fan of embarrassment humor, and that's pretty much what happens as we watch Buddy making a fool out of himself time and time again.  I was cringing instead of laughing.<br /><br />Something happened, however, as we reached the climax.  While it was completely predictable, I found myself caught up in it.  And I found I cared for the characters.  I wanted to see them all happy.  Unfortunately, it did feel a little force, like it didn't quite follow from what came before.  But at the time I didn't care.<br /><br />This isn't the Christmas classic it wants to be.

Raised by one of the older elves, Buddy has no idea that he is actually human until he overhears some of the other elves talking in reference to his decreased productivity at toy-making when compared to the other elves (he builds 85 Etch-a-Sketches an hour while the genuine elves can build a thousand). Buddy decides to go back to his roots and find his human relatives, but is distraught when he's told that his real father is on Santa's naughty list. Still, he sails off on an iceberg from the North Pole bound for New York City.<br /><br />Elf is hilarious as only Will Ferrell movies can be.  When Buddy finds a department store Santa Clause pretending to be the real deal he tells him, "You sit on a throne of lies."  This movie is full of great one liners and watching it is a great way to get in the mood for the holiday season. I'd highly recommend it as a funnier alternative to some of the old classics like Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story, or simply to supplement your holiday movie library.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Elf" is a cute Christmas movie with a great (and funny) script, great character acting, and a great Christmas soundtrack. Elf was a surprise hit a couple years ago and is (If I remember correctly) Will Ferrell's highest grossing film. The movie stars Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, and Faizon Love. The movie begins when Santa (Asner, who is perfect for the role) is making his rounds at an orphanage and a young baby crawls in his bag. Santa doesn't discover the baby until he returns to the North Pole and one of the elves, Papa Elf (Newhart) volunteers to raise the baby who is named Buddy. Well, Buddy grows up and at the age of thirty finally realizes that he is not in fact an elf.<br /><br />Buddy then learns that his father is on the naughty list (god forbid) and begins his journey to New York city. When Buddy meets his skeptical father Walter (Caan) a workaholic children's book publisher, he is thrown out of the building but doesn't let it get him down. Buddy migrates to Gimbels where he meets the store manager played by Faizon Love. This is easily the most underrated character in the film, Love delivers several jokes which had me bawling. Love is very good with physical humor as well as verbal...But anyway, it is at Gimbels that Buddy meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, who I've seen in several other films but looks absolutely gorgeous in this movie). I'm glad the Jovie character existed in the movie, because Deschanel is great (and very hot) but Buddy and Jovie don't make an extraordinary couple. Anyway, after Walter discovers that Buddy really is his son Buddy moves in with Walter and his wife Emily (Steenburgen) and son Michael and then well...See the movie. I have to add that in the movie Deschanel sings the song "Baby, It's Cold Outside" and I need to add that she's got a great voice. She's an amazing singer, she was so good in fact that I bought the soundtrack. But, yeah this is a great Christmas comedy and is destined to be a Christmas favorite.

A Christmas comedy that all ages in your family will be able to sit down and enjoy together.<br /><br />The movie begins when Buddy- a human raised by elves learns that he is a human. Which explains why he has had a beard since he was 15 and is ten times taller than the other elves. He learns that his real human dad lives in New York City- wanting to know his true father and find where he belongs Buddy leaves the North Pole for NYC. When Walter Hobbs meets his son- Buddy who he has never known about he is a little concerned- he has a a son and wife at home and is a hard-working book publisher who has lost the true spirit of Christmas. When Buddy shows up his whole life is turned upside... at first he chooses to acknowledge Buddy- but slowly decides to take Buddy in out of concern for his mental health- fearful Buddy is crazy... since he walks around in an elf costume, talks about the north pole, and puts sugar on spaghetti. Buddy slowly begins to fit into his family growing close to half brother Michael the two spend time together chopping down Christmas trees and throwing snowballs. Once Buddy begins to fit in- Walter out of anger yells at Buddy causing him to runaway. On Christmas-well all of a sudden Buddy finds himself needing to rely on his human friends and family when he finds Santa's sleigh in Central Park- and needs that Christmas spirit...<br /><br />The movie is cutesy to a point... no one can watch this movie and not be charmed by this movie. There is something very sweet and childlike about Buddy that makes you fall in love with him. Will Ferrell as always is a LAUGHING riot as the Christmas elf that brought him to super stardom.<br /><br />Children will enjoy the story and Buddy. Parents will love Buddy and love the popular culture jokes that kids may not pick up on... No matter how many times I watch this film I always LAUGH at the same parts. This movie will be one you'll enjoy again and again each Christmas and definately one I would recommend you own!<br /><br />The DVD features are possibly the best special features I've ever seen with two disks jammed with games, and interviews... this DVD is hours of fun for you and your children to enjoy.<br /><br />This is NO "Christmas With the Kranks" or "Surving Christmas" you'll actually enjoy watching this holiday flick more than once- making possibly the best Christmas comedy movie since "A Christmas Story" or the "Santa Clause"Definately a movie to buy or own this Christmas!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Playing the lead in the tale of Buddy, a human brought up by Santa's elves, Will Farrell gives a thoroughly engaging, non-ironic performance in this spritely and adorable Christmas movie. Farrell is convincingly sweet and innocent, which is a relief considering how many modern films seem incapable of presenting Christmas without its dark and hypocritical elements. Buddy unabashedly loves Santa and all things Christmas, discovers (through a series of slapstick height-based miscues) that he really isn't an elf. He determines to travel to New York City to meet his real Dad. Predictably, Dad (played with understatement by James Caan) is a businessman with a teeny, tiny heart of stone. Buddy can decorate a room with hand-made Christmas glitz in the blink of an eye. Guess who will change by the end of the film?<br /><br />The last third of the film droops like an underwatered Christmas poinsetta, as the plot requires Farrell to help Santa (Ed Asner) rejuice his sleigh, which has crash landed in Central Park. A few potential gags about the vaucuity of the media are left hanging, and the ending relies a bit too heavily on the movie clich&eacute; of cynical, seen-it-all New Yorker. Nevertheless, "Elf" was fun to watch, had un uplifting message about the Christmas spirit, and just might become a Christmas classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A human baby, accidentally taken to the North Pole in Santa Claus's (Edward Asner) bag, is raised by elves.  Although Buddy (Will Ferrell) believes he is an elf, he knows that he doesn't fit in-and not only because he is four feet taller than everyone else.  Shocked at the news that he is really a human, he travels to the human world to meet his real father (James Caan), a cynical publisher who is facing a crisis in his professional life.  In a film like this, it goes without saying that everyone will be the better for having met Buddy.<br /><br />This film is a real delight.  Ferrell shows that he has what it takes to carry a film; he should enjoy a long and successful movie career.  Genuinely sweet and happy without becoming cloying and phony, "Elf" is perhaps the best Christmas movie in recent years.  The eclectic cast is one of its greatest assets.  Besides the abovementioned actors, it features Bob Newhart, the beautiful Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen, Faizon Love, and the Howard Stern Show's Artie Lang in a memorable cameo as a department store Santa./</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>There's somethnig about Will Ferrell.  About the way a man nearly 40-years-old can display such a child-like innocense without it being cloying and condescending.  Don't get me wrong, there are points in this movie when it is so sickly sweet that you just have to roll your eyes.  But it has such a great message about Christmas, about family, about diversity, about what is really important in life that you can overlook the sickly sweet moments and enjoy the film.  Ferrell is at his best when he is playing these innocent misfits.  Best of all, this is a film the entire family can sit down and watch.  A few bad words may be in there, but they are so fleeting that I can't even remember what they were.  This is a very enjoyable holiday film with some great moments and a lot of child-like humor.</p></br></body></html>

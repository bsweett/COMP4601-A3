The writing will definitely not win any awards and the storyline could have been a  better.  But let's face it, this is an action movie----a popcorn movie that allows you to sit back, not think too much, and just enjoy the ride.  If you think of "The Day After Tomorrow" in those terms, then you are in for a treat.  The story basically is this----there is a huge climatic change in the earth, due to global warming, that triggers a new ice age.  There is a predictable plot of Dennis Quaid's character trying to find his son (played by talented young actor Jake Gyllenhaal), the authority figure (in this pic, the Vice-President) who doesn't heed the warnings of our hero and the belief in mankind to surmount unsurmountable odds.  But the true star of this movie is good old Mother Nature.  From horrific mutiple tornadoes destroying Los Angeles to massive waves flooding the streets of New York City, it is the weather and the awesome power it can display that will hold your attention.  The special effects are incredible (as to be expected from the man who brought us "Independence Day" and "Godzilla").  Should you see this film?  If you want a thrill ride, absolutely!  Strap yourself in and just have fun.  And don't forget the popcorn!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to this film for a few months but I should have known better. After all, our friends in Hollywood only come up with two or three original plots or ideas every year, and most of those are on the indy front. <p>Special affects wise, this was a really solid display of visuals. Plot-wise, this movie stunk up the theatre. The blatant political spin was hilarious. They are, as usual, so very subtle. You might find your stance on homelessness, atheism, global warming, immigration, gas usage and your views on the third world being challenged. The third world becomes the place to be, American usage of natural resources is ridiculed, and the great philosophers of the film happen to be a homeless man who steals hot dogs and an atheist with a warm spot for Western society. As for immigrants? You will no doubt change your view on immigration and welcome anyone into our country who wants our way of life (sarcasm).</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>- but I ran into problems trying to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />One very good point is that "global warming" doesn't necessarily mean that everything gets warmer everywhere. It does mean that the world's weather is a mchine driven by heat, and that warming is like nitro in the gas tank. Hots get hotter, colds get colder, everything becomes more of whatever it was, and not necessarily where you'd expect. Another good point is that indirect effects, like shifts in ocean currents, may exert surprisingly strong control over the climate.<br /><br />For dramatic purposes, all those effects were compressed from decades to days or even minutes. Rising ocean levels were crammed into a single wave that flooded New York to waist depth on the Statue of Liberty. Nice effects, but I just don't think many buildings would be left standing if hit by a wall of water ten storeys high. Maybe, opposite of the intuitive result, global warming could trigger a new ice age. That would certainly be dramatic, but I suspect that it would take more than the hour or two shown here.<br /><br />Set your expectations properly: it's just a disaster movie, about as plausible as those asteroid movies a couple of years ago. If you've already dedicated yourself to a useless evening, you may as well watch this.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a great movie. It is also scary to watch. People say this is a warning that this movie will one day become part of our life's. I heard that the person who wrote this movie is a person who has been warning people about this happening. No one was listening to him. So that is why he made the movie. I don't know if that is all true. But I hope we can make a change in our way of living so this wont happen to us.<br /><br />Besides that this is an awesome movie. That you don't want to miss. The sadist scene for me is with the cancer child who's parents didn't go for him and the nurse stayed by his side the whole time. My sister had cancer around that little boy's age. I know that is just a movie, but I can't see how his parents couldn't go be with him. That scene makes my eyes water.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on "global warming," but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was, but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that.<br /><br />The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the "fun parts" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.<br /><br />After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake's father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him.<br /><br /> Yes, it's very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn't overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.<br /><br />Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy-adventure story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of "State of Fear", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say "oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of "V-The Mini-series" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).<br /><br />On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.<br /><br />One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be "An Inconvenient Truth" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.  I like to think of it as more "a convenient half truth".<br /><br />(PS - If someone else has used that, sorry, I didn't read all 700 reviews.)</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>While I consider myself reasonably environmentally friendly, I never did pay much attention to all the political hulabaloo that surrounded this film. In fact, I never even bothered to see it until it came to DVD.<br /><br />And I will happily say that this is a movie worth keeping around, assuming you are one of those people that love a good fluffy adventure every now and then.  I know I do, and the wild special effects and insane plot twists are enough to keep me happy.  Warning or not, it's fun, fairly mindless entertainment that just looks freaking cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>All of our main characters survive that in reality most if not would have died had these events really happened.  They built a pretty good story around a worst case scenario and the acting wasn't bad, not great but 3 stars.  I've watched this movie a couple of times and I think that's all the life I will get out of it, worth watching, but not worthy of library space.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>As improbable as `The Day After Tomorrow' really is, it doesn't have to be realistic to fulfill its purpose.  It's not there to really engage us emotionally or mentally as much as visually, and in that visual sense `The Day After Tomorrow' soars.  Now director Roland Emmerich is no stranger to the science fiction disaster film, and not unlike his previously successful entries, this one also sports some amazing special effects.  From twirling twisters to tidal waves and that slowly creeping icy air, `The Day After Tomorrow' sports an amazing lineup of natural disasters.  Watching the multiple tornadoes rip through the California city is impressive, and watching gallon upon gallon of water drown New York City is nothing short of breathtaking.  So, it's safe to say that what `The Day After Tomorrow' lacks in brains it makes up for in cool CGI effects.<br /><br />So, what of this plot?  Well, it appears that weather patterns are showing an alarming possibility that soon, within the next hundred or so years, we could undergo yet another ice-age.  That's where Jack Hall comes in, a climatologist who discovers the evidence to support this.  Of course no one will pay attention to Hall and his discovery will prove true, except not even Hall expected it to happen so soon.  The real story though involves Jack's son Sam who has traveled to New York with some class mates and ends up in the middle on a flood that destroys the city.  Jack then has to race to his rescue before he freezes to death.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot is plenty far fetched, but the action more than makes up for it.  As Sam and his friends try to survive they must find food and medical supplies while fighting the increasing cold, the rising waters and a pack of temperamental wolves who happen to escape confinement during the flood.  The wolf pack has been met with mixed reviews, as in some loved it an others found it ridiculous and unnecessary.  I loved it.  It was an interesting and intense inclusion, even if it wasn't the slightest bit realistic.  When the movie as a whole is completely unbelievable and, yes, unrealistic, then there's nothing wrong with adding even more layers of complete and utter fiction as long as it looks good.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, it's all decent.  Your standard action film acting if you so desire to label it.  Dennis Quaid is one of those actors who I've always enjoyed yet felt he never really tapped into his potential, save except his performance in 2002's `Far From Heaven', and here he delivers but again it's nothing beyond acceptable.  Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor with a future, that's for sure, and his performances are always believable and effortless.  Here he does a great job juggling emotions amid a hole-riddled plot.  Emmy Rossum should really stick to singing, as her grandest performance was in `The Phantom of the Opera' but at least here she delivers a stronger performance than her `Poseidon' disaster.  The strongest performance here though came from the actress with the least screen time, Sela Ward.  She is just the definition of class and she manages to instill emotion in a rather emotionless film.<br /><br />So, in the end `The Day After Tomorrow' delivers some extraordinary eye candy and is worthy of any science fiction action movie buffs library.  No, it's not smart, but it doesn't need to be; and to answer the question of some in regards to the movie's title, it refers to the day `AFTER' the calamity, when everything is not what it once was.  Come on people; is it really that hard to figure out?</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>"Nowadays" between New York and Los Angeles. A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) needs to find a way to save "the world" from global warming. His son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is hiding with a group of friends in the New York Public Library and is experiencing first-hand the major weather changes.<br /><br />Special effects were all wonderful. I was only disappointed in the wolves: they did not look real at all.<br /><br />Keep in mind when watching this movie that it requires a *lot* of suspension of disbelief. Most of what happens is beyond belief and rather predictable.<br /><br />That said, it is still enjoyable entertainment, and Dennis Quaid proves that he is an excellent actor. Gyllenhaal is not the best, but the casting was decent enough for this movie.<br /><br />Pure Hollywood entertainment. What else can one expect from a director like Roland Emmerich.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>I'm sorry. I just couldn't get into this movie. But, just to please the masses, I watched it the whole way through. I admit that the sepcial effects were great but I have got to tell you something: CGI and WOLVES do not go together. Not in my book. If you wanna present danger than get real wolves. Don't toy with my emotions. Also, it's kind of hard to believe that the scientist would plead to death about dealing with the situation and no one listens. Believe me, after all the things that the earth goes through you'd think that someone would listen. Anyway, That's what I have to grip about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Say what you will about the charachters, the weird science, or the silly wolves, but you can't deny that the day after tommorow knows how to destroy, freeze, or superfreze the world into a very chilly ice cube.<br /><br />Inspired by the book "The coming global superstorm", the day after tommorow follows the idea "What if a new ice age happened this week?".  The story concerns a weather science guy as he tries to rescue his son, who's trapped in manhattan after a nasty tidal wave.  All the while, all of humanity must try to survive as temperatures plunge and earth essentially becomes an ice cube.<br /><br />While one can debate the questionable physics of the movie (walking from Washington to Manhattan in a few days during a massive snowstorm, how warming up the planet causes an ice age, etc.), one cannot deny the incredible atmosphere and visual destruction the movie unleashes.  The movie's greatest strength is it's atmosphere.  One really gets the feeling that this really is the end of the world (at least for the northern hemisphere).  The destruction shown, the massive amounts of human life lost, the destructive weather, all of it adds up to a very effective and belivable atmosphere.  I'm not ashamed to admit that at times I actually felt cold while watching the movie!<br /><br />The special effects are, as one would suspect, terrific.  The tornadoes, blizzards, all of it looks perfectly belivable and realistic.  The standout sequence occurs when the massive tidal wave barrels through manhattan in a scene that gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.  If you want a movie where you get buildings trashed by tornadoes, the british isles getting buried under fifteen feet of snow, and tidal waves washing through manhattan, then this movie is for you!<br /><br />Like the effects and the atmosphere, the film also does a standout job audio-wise.  The music is very good and effective at creating a sometimes tense, sometimes haunting atmosphere.  The main theme in paticular, is very effective at conveying despair, yet at the same time, hope.  The sound effects do an astonishing job of conveying howling wind and freezing snow, all of it adding to and enriching the atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />But atmosphere and visuals will only take you so far.  What about the charachters, on whom the movie puts it's backbone on?  Regrettably, the charachters are not very effective.  All of the actors in the movie, major or minor, do a very good job in thier respective parts, but a lot of them are not very interesting.  We get two primary chrachters (the scientist and his son) and close to two dozen secondary charachters, most of whom have little to do.  It's a sad fact of movies that if you have a secondary chrachter on screen for a grand total of five minutes before he/she dies, you don't get emotionally attatched to them.  Such is the case with The day after tommorow.  I couldn't remember over 3/4th's of the charachters names except Sam and Frank (and only then becuase the father keeps shouting, "FRANK!").  Instead of names,  you have to go by, "Library guy" "Library woman" "Homeless guy with dog" "Government guy who argues with father" "Father's sidekick".  That doesn't mean that these side charachters are boring, per se, it's just that we don't really care about them.  The only real exception is the policeman, who has a small part, but is portrayed very well and very effectivly.  He was the only real charachter I cared about.<br /><br />I really don't care about the bad movie physics here (In real life, the statue of liberty would have toppled over the moment the tidal wave hit it).  The way the movie does present the physics makes it look belivable, and that's fine with me.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with the day after tommorow is it's pacing.  The first two acts of the movie are gripping and holds you attention very easily.  The third act however, falls and stumbles, failing to hold our attention as well as it did previously.  A big part of this is the fact that the climax of the movie (the superfreeze) takes place approximatly fifteen minutes before the end of the movie.  You've no doubt heard about the silly wolves sequence, and i'm sad to say that the wolves part of the story is very silly and pretty much pointless.  It would be much more effective if the wolves were replaced by starving, crazed humans who have lost thier mind.<br /><br />The emotional climax is a bit flat, not really bringing things to a satisfying end.  One rather unfortunate reality of this type of story is that there's no villian, no antagonist to focus all the negativity on.  Here the foe is mother nature.  So, how do you plan to defeat mother nature and win the day? (Hint:  You don't).  It is admittingly very tough to write an ending to a movie where your villian is the forces of nature, who cannot be defeated by lots and lots of guns.<br /><br />But in the end, the movie is an excuse to go and experience a great atmosphere and see lots of destruction, not to see emotionally involving charachter stories.  The overall message of the movie, that we shouldn't mess with mother nature, is the main point of the movie, regardless of how we get there.  I have to say that it's message is conveyed fairly well, as it gets you thinking about how humans are polluting the planet and what the consequences might be.<br /><br />So in the end, see the movie for it's effective atmosphere and special effects.  Don't go in expecting extremly involving charachters and a satisfying climax and ending.<br /><br />Don't forget your snowshoes!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>The Day After Tomorrow is an exciting movie with a throwaway plot, but it has some of the best special effects in recent movie history.  At an United Nations Conference, climatologist Jack Hall states that in as few as a hundred or as many as a thousand years, global warming will be begin to change the Earth's climate in drastic ways.  No one pays much heed to his warning.  Only weeks later, the severe climate changes come much sooner than Hall expected, plunging the world into another Ice Age.  When Hall discovers his son is trapped in New York, he decides to march from Washington DC to NY to rescue him along with two close friends.  If you couldn't tell, the plot is more than a little predictable, but that is beside the point.  What makes this movie worthwhile are the extraordinary special effects, whether it be countless tornadoes ravaging dowtown Los Angeles or a huge tsunami-like wave flooding the streets of New York City.  Equally impressive are the shots from the space shuttle orbitting Earth of the changing face of the planet as the ice moves farther and farther south.  Don't buy this movie for the story, get it for the amazing special effects.<br /><br />  Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall, a scientist who must travel to New York to save his son.  Even though the science in the movie is pretty far-fetched, Quaid makes it believable when he tries to explain what is happening all over the world.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jack's son, Sam, who must try to survive in the Public Library with a small group of survivors.  Ian Holm stars as Terry Rapson, a scientist working in Scotland who believes and supports what Hall is trying to explain to the world.  Sela Ward plays Jack's wife Lucy, a doctor trying to save a young cancer patient.  The movie also stars Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, and Tamyln Tomita.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, two different commentary tracks, two deleted scenes, plenty of CD-ROM offers, and sound demos for eight scenes.

Emmerich has been (rightfully) backlashed for soulless stupidities like GODZILLA, THE PATRIOT, etc.... So, when he does a movie about a serious subject, where the action is a lot more slow paced, he fails again...<br /><br />Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so "big-budgeted".</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Although the message of the film is unrealistic as it is based on the fictitious global warming hype which is a weird theory by a number of scientists and greenpeace fanatics to get government grants and so forth, the special effects in this flick are very well done. The plot is the age-old, but usually always interesting father saves son story. And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script. But the humanistic message in this movie is good and encouraging. This flick makes for a nice popcorn crunching evening at the fireplace with warm blankets all around. And once you see this movie you probably won't look forward to the winter anymore. But as mentioned before, the special effects are great as these show us unrealistic scenarios in this well-done disaster flick and it's fun to stimulate our imagination once in a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"The Day After Tomorrow" is one of those movies, that when it was written, did not focus more on the dialouge and the plot, because the writer knew that it would be all about the special effects. I don't have a problem with that, because I knew that this movie would have just that, a terrible plot. They have to give us mind numbing drival to get us to the special effects. There is nothing new, and nothing exciting this storyline. The movie was also led by Dennis Quaid. I've seen only a couple of his movies including "Far From Heaven" and "The Alamo" and he was awful in both. He overacts to much, and he does that in this as well. He presents his lines with too much urgency, and too much anger. I've come to realize that he is not a good actor.<p>The movie stars him as Professor Jack Hall. He studies the weather, and has come to realize that the problem is global warming is rising. The world would be entering a new ice age soon. The vice president does not take the warning seriously, and decides to ignore it completly, even after his findings are verified by another professor Terry Rapson. The changes in weather occur right away, and it is reported that within days the Nortghen hemisphere will be gone. The problem is that Jack's son Sam is in Manhattan for a knowledge competition. A massive tidel wave hits Manhattan, eventually will be frozen, and Sam and a large group of people stay idel in the city library. It is too cold for anybody to even think about going outside. After people see others walking on the icey roads out of Manhattan, they want to leave, but Sam warns them. Jack, meanwhile, goes from Washington to New York to find his son, while his doctor wife takes care of a sick child.<p>There is absolutly nothing special about the plot, because the writer didn't care about it. He only cared about description to base the special effects upon. The good thing about the movie is that it gets right to the point. At a little over two hours, I didn't feel that this movie dragged on at all. Some breathtaking special effects sequences include twisters in Hollywood, the tidel wave in New York, and the first person to interact with the air after it is too cold to go out. I thought it was called global WARMING! "The Day After Tomorrow" has great special effects, a terrible plot, ok acting, but it is an incredable time. I recommend seeing this in the big screen because it'll make the experience so much better.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for intense situations of peril.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>With a fair few summer blockbusters stencilled in this season, including Spiderman 2, the third Harry Potter movie, both of which are bound to do well, The Day After Tomorrow gets in early.  Not only is it timed well in this respect but its themes of global warming reaching catastrophic circumstances are surely the most apt thing to create worry lines across most people's foreheads.  And so we have, in effect, Roland Emmerich's follow-up to his enormously successful Independence Day.  Only this time it's Mother Nature trying to wipe us out rather than a planet of pesky aliens.<p>The reliable if slightly dull Dennis Quaid leads the cast as a scientist who predicts that global warming will speed up the effects of a new ice age which will occur amid floods, typhoons, hurricanes, blizzards and hurricanes.  This will all take place in about a week.  All more's the pity, because Quaid's son (played by rising star Jake Gyllenhaal) is stranded in New York with his best friend a girl he's secretly in love with.  Stop me if you've heard this...Okay, so the plot's pretty much a given from the start, with expendable characters clearly labelled early on.  But Emmerich sure does know how to pull out all the punches as far as special effects are concerned, and the flooding of New York is spectacular stuff, just perfect for summer  edge-of-your-seat excitement.  All in all it reeks of a man who knows how to make pretty rubbish popcorn movies very well.  And that's what this is - something you know isn't anything special whilst you're watching it, but still manages to drag you in.  The acting is all good, and with any luck this will raise the highly talented Gyllenhaal to a new audience after his astute performances in Donnie Darko and The Good Girl.  And did I mention that the special effects are superb?!<p>Of course, for the man who's done it all before with Independence Day this is old hat, and Emmerich seems to have caught onto the fact that Godzilla wasn't successful because it didn't really tap into anything around at the time.  Just as Independence Day rode on the success of X-Files and Men In Black, so The Day After Tomorrow allows a certain pseudo-science eco-warning that can create a spectacle interesting enough to hold its audience for an hour and a half.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite stand up against Independence Day though, partly because CGI has become somewhat old hat now, and there's no enduring image like the destruction of the White House in the former.  However, it's not without its trite charm, and it's safe to say that if you've enjoyed Emmerich's previous movies then you'll definitely enjoy this because, for what it is, this is very very good.<p>Still, the complaints that no audience is yet quite willing to watch the destruction of New York just yet, have surfaced not unjustifiably, and this iminges on what enjoyment you might receive from watching things being rapidly obliterated before your very eyes.  Worse still, there are some cringe-worthy subplots that seem wholly unnecessary, in particular a child with cancer unable to leave the hospital he's being taken care in, and an appallingly set-up chase scene involving wolves that escaped from a local zoo.  All this and there's some terrible stereotyping of the British, where the whole of Europe can be wiped off the map and nobody really cares because America's okay.  Yet even the usual heavy dose of patriotism seems tempered by Emmerich laying all the blame for the disaster on America's shoulders, having them begging to reside in third-world countries.  These heavy-handed and seemingly contradicting politics might confuse you, but they don't take away from the enjoyment of the film.  Though it probably won't be the best film you'll see this summer by a long way, the time you're watching it on the big screen will feel thoroughly worth your time right up until the credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>The FX in this movie are excellent (except the CG wolves). The storyline was cliche' but stll pretty good overall (I seen much worse recently) and the science was very Hollywood but loosely accurate. The global warimng issue is very real as well as other topics (money is god). Overall I enjoyed this film and I will be getting it on DVD when it comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>"The Day After Tomorrow" is one of those movies that can be rated as worth seeing, as long as nothing else of importance is going on.  This movie takes a big-budget, special-effects-filled look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age. The acting was sub-par, at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>OVERVIEW: I believe there are two ways to watch "The Day After Tomorrow". The 1st way is to go in with lofty expectations and look for real-life happenings backed up by facts and real-world stuff. The 2nd way is to go into this movie not expecting much at all --> hey another Hollywood disaster flick with some cool special effects! I went into this movie with no expectations... and for the most part enjoyed it. The storyline was weak at best, the acting was uninspired, but the movie as a whole was brought together by the terrible weather. Severe ice and snow storms, tidal waves (hence flooding), tornados, and more reaking havoc on planet Earth.<br /><br />THE GOOD: The special effects were awesome. The huge waves coming into NYC looked incredible. The waves engulfing the Statue of Liberty and taking over the streets were very cool. The numerous high speed tornados in Los Angeles were nicely done, but even the average viewer could tell they were computer generated. The rain and snow looked good and the freezing effects were believeable. Jake Gyllenhaal put in his finest performance since "October Sky" (1999).<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: The cast is weak. Dennis Quaid (as father Jack Hall, special-meteorologist-predictor-guy) is just not on my "top actors" list. Quaid is a better "made-for-TV" movie actor than one on the big screen (let alone to carry most of the movie). Outside of "Frequency", "The Parent Trap" and "The Rookie", it's been too many years in between since I've really enjoyed one of his movies. Jake Gyllenhaal ("October Sky", "Donnie Darko", "Bubbleboy") was fine as Sam Hill (the son of Jack) and I truly believe he is an up-and-comer in Hollywood, but, he and his agent just haven't found that next 'right' script. Sela Ward is present briefly as the supportive Hall wife. Other than these 3 movie family members... you won't recognize anyone - the remaining cast of hundreds are no-names. Was Quaid the first choice here, or did every other actor decline the lead role for this movie? There are so many impossible (or nearly impossible) things going on in "The Day After Tomorrow" that if you sit and analyze everything that's happening you won't enjoy the movie. For example, after Jack Hall's truck gets stuck in the snow, he decides to trek from Philly to NYC to rescue his son... no small feat to do when the severe cold is killing everyone who walks outside in about 15 seconds. Did anyone mention the distance of 100 miles between the two cities? Or the tennis rackets he duck-taped to his feet so he could walk on the 50-foot snow drifts? The wolves chasing Sam on the ship were notebly exaggerated computer-made knock offs. The tidal wave coming into the city arrived in seconds, yet young Sam could run half a football field and back to save the girl and get back inside before the wave hits them. What about the rest of the world (this movie concentrated solely on America)? It would have been neat to see France's Eiffel Tower blitzed by the deep freeze or at least knocked over by a twister. The list goes on.<br /><br />MISC: The extras on this DVD are minimal. There are 2 commentaries to choose if that's your thrill. One with director Emmerich. The 2nd with the co-writer, editor and director of photography (yawn!). Did Quaid & Gyllenhaal decline? There are 2 deleted scenes (yawn), and a making-of footage for your PC (what the?). If you're looking for an accurate rendention of the effects of global warming - you'll be sorely disappointed (the Bush administration has not endorsed this movie). Come into this movie with few or no expectations and an eye for some cool weather related special effects and perhaps you'll get more out of it. Rating: A generous 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich learned his lesson.<br /><br /> The director, who was stung by critics and audiences when he drilled boredom into the first hour of &quot;Godzilla,&quot; packs the opening act of &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; with computer-generated mayhem: Giant tornadoes prowling Los Angeles, tidal waves flooding New York, volleyball-sized hail pummeling Tokyo. Global warning has triggered a massive, three-headed frozen hurricane descending from the North Pole.<br /><br /> Never mind the science. Or the politics. Just watch the destruction. It's epic and a little scary. Summer movies are about scale and spectacle and &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; rumbles with the best of them. The human element is average and the dialogue unmemorable. But the message - don't forget those Third-World countries, American capitalists - isn't bad and the actors - unlike those in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Indepedence Day&quot; - are content to play it straight without pretention.<br /><br /> Dennis Quaid is Jack Hall, a weather scientist (paleoclimatologist if you want to get into it) warning the world's governments of impending metrological disaster while the American vice president (a Dick Cheney clone) scoffs. Cue up metrological disaster. Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhall) is in New York for an academic decathalon while Jack's wife (a wasted Sela Ward) burns midnight oil with a young cancer patient in Washington D.C. A third subplot involves Jack's Scottish colleague (Ian Holm) and his small team trapped in an observatory with the storm bearing down. Their findings help formulate an evacuation plan that, while belated, could manage to save some American lives.<br /><br /> The strength is the special f/x; in a year loaded with visual goodies, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; actually deserves to be in the hunt come Academy Award time. The LA tornadoes is the movie's showpiece, a ten-minute, seven-funnel assault on the record and movie district. Though the movie drags in its second half - Sam indulges a crush on a brainiac ingenue (Emmy Rossum) while his father comes to rescue him - it finds a climax involving the eye of the storm at the deadly cold air inside it.<br /><br /> Conservative wags have lightly dismissed the picture (though not too harshly - it was released by Fox) but &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; ends on a hopeful note of global cooperation, a worthy aspiration should we face mass destuction (weather, weapons, or otherwise) in the near future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Global warming and the resultant melting of the polar icecaps results in a sudden catastrophic rearranging of the global climate, leaving mankind to scramble for cover.  A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) treks to a frozen New York to find his lost son (Jake Guyllenhall).  This is big, dumb summer fun that is more about special effects than anything else, and those special effects are impressive indeed.  The twisters that decimate LA and the massive storm surge that inundates New York are the highlights of the film.  But therein lies the problem, because those scenes occur about halfway through the movie.  The story must rely more on the characters after that, but the characters just aren't interesting enough to sustain the film.  The perils that they face become much smaller in scale as well.  Who cares about wolf attacks, blood poisoning, and frostbite after we've seen the destruction of two major cities?  I didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I went and watched the movie on it's release date.  The beginning was sort of slow, when it finally got into the the movie it's self it was great.  The special effects where Awesome as most of you seen on the commercial.  If you liked the movie Twister you will this one as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall in this spectacular thriller about the effects of global warming on the Earth.  Due to the rapid warming, the polar ice caps begin to split, hail the size of softballs begins to fall in Tokyo, huge tornadoes are spawned over Los Angeles, and a tidal wave with waves as high as the Statue of Liberty engulf New York City.  The after-effects of the storms are perhaps the most catastrophic, as temperature drops of as much as ten degrees per second occur, instantly freezing anyone who ventures outside.<br /><br />Jack's son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is in New York City participating in a scholastic competition when the weather starts to change.  Cut off from escape, Sam and a band of fellow survivors take refuge from the tidal wave and ensuing temperature drops and snowfall inside the New York public library.  They survive by burning books inside an old fireplace and eating chips and candy from vending machines.  But, with nowhere to go and no one to rescue them, will they survive or will they all perish from the bitter cold?  Will Jack make it to rescue his son before its too late?  What will become of the people in the southern United States who were evacuated to Mexico?<br /><br />I'm a big fan of special effects in movies, and this film has some of the best effects I've ever seen before.  Perhaps the best scene of the film is the formation of the tidal wave that slams into New York City.  Watching this wave form and ultimately engulf the Statue of Liberty, which stands well over 800 feet tall, was one of the high points in the movie for me.  The tornado sequences over Los Angeles, and the opening scenes of the fissure cracks at the poles were excellent as well.  Dennis Quaid , Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast give top notch performances.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  The special effects will blow you away, and the thrilling story will keep you captivated throughout.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Not wanting to address what personal issues Wolfgang Petersen has going on, with this, his latest venture in World destruction, one can't help drawing comparisons with his apparent penchant for portraying the end of mankind, in other movies like Godzilla, and Independence Day.<br />Dennis Quaid plays a paleoclimantologist (cross between a weather expert and a fossil expert I presume) who warns of the end of the World and is predictably ignored by the powers that be until his warnings begin to unfold in dramatic and horrific fashion. He is then summoned to offer his advice (albeit too late) to the President and try to set out a plan to save mankind. Despite the advances in believable CGI representations on screen recently, what plays out before your eyes is arguably amazing and gripping viewing and builds the tension nicely. Those expecting much more than has seen in the trailers may be disappointed, but the power of the visuals I feel lies more in the eerie tiny points of realism that paint much more of a complete picture than pure in your face graphics. Sadly from this point onward the storyline takes something of a nosedive on the credibility scale, and leaves you thinking EH? Mr. Quaid is continually battling with his conscience for not spending enough quality "Dad" time with his Son Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and against his own advice to everyone else, sets off on foot to snow covered New York to save him. This is a valiant effort to portray intimate human drama amidst a morass of human annihilation, but the message gets lost and unlikely and ultimately leaves you not caring due to the implausible nature of it all. The story continues to center on a handful of characters trapped in New York but is disjointed as it tries to make you believe the importance of whether Sam should tell Laura he loves her whilst seconds before you have been told that entire continents are being obliterated, and most people in the Northern Hemisphere are likely to perish. This is NOT a bad movie, and will be undoubtedly be a big early summer hit at the box office for the main reason that the special effects are just about enough. The huge visuals successfully manage to carry the movie and make you endure a plot that is about as deep as a child's backyard swimming pool. The undertones and messages of human ignorance and perhaps timely warnings of global warming add some intelligence behind the eye candy, and make you sit up and pay attention throughout the 2 hours, which moves fairly quickly. It's just a shame that there are too many niggling and unanswered inconsistencies along the way to really pull off the story completely. 3.5 Stars at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>Besides the fact the special effects are really terrific. This is a story about survival again all odds. Dennis Quaid along with other actors did a fantastic job of pulling it together. The ending was the icing on the cake.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich may have scored huge with ID4, but the film was crippled by gung-ho flag-waving and a reluctance to explore the dark nature of the story. I think that Emmerich is a far better director than writer, but even though he once more pens the screenplay here he wisely opts to make it a much more serious film. Where he once destroyed the Big Apple and the Big Orange with fire, now he does it with water, but no one's laughing. And Will Smith isn't in it.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid (brother of ID4's hero) stars as a climatologist who predicts that a new ice age will freeze Planet Earth within the next few hundred years. An enormous chunk of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica breaks off and melts into the Atlantic, shutting down the gulf stream. Hurricanes form all over the world, with twisters and storms ripping though major cities. A flood submerges New York, trapping Jake Gyllenhaal and his classmates in the New York Public library. With nowhere to go they wait it out as dad Quaid promises to rescue them.<br /><br />There's no winning this time round. Everyone is a loser as the world goes into a deep freeze, covering most of America and Europe in a hundred feet of snow. But this film is about the journey, and the destination, not the end result. There are some cliches and a little bit of humor, but they're all subdued and do not annoy as much as they did in ID4. The only disappointment is Harald Kloser's bland, uninteresting score with is a far cry from the sorrowful, romantic themes from Armageddon by Trevor Rabin, an approach which really could have worked here.<br /><br />While it ain't no masterpiece, it's one of Emmerich's better movies and, despite the exaggerated portrayal of climate change, will last for the ages, unlike it's alien invasion older brother.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a striking 2.40:1 1080p transfer with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich should have been making movies with Irwin Allen in the Seventies, given his delight in providing different ways to visualize New York and LA getting it. Here Emmerich doesn't even try for the tongue-in-cheek levity that saved "Independence Day" and attempted to (but could not possibly redeem) "Godzilla"; everything is done with an absolutely straight face as the laws of physics and logic are broken repeatedly. The fact that he cast genuinely talented actors like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward and jake Gyllenhaal to speak his wretched dialogue seems, paradoxically, actually to raise the camp factor considerably, as does the fact that this film is made with a genuine message. Global warming, we learn, is bad... spectacularly bad, of course. The resulting storms must naturally head for the world's two most important cities (according to Hollywood), New York and Los Angeles. We get to see various landmarks of these cities (like the Capitol Records building) obliterated, as if to prove that we are not in Kansas City or Milwaukee. The British royal family is also threatened, as if that were the only thing outside of the USA equivalent to the Hollywood sign or the Statue of Liberty. It's easy to scoff at Emmerich, but his films are not simply schlocky but also, fatally, incredibly visually unimaginative. Opportunities for at least some visual cleverness proliferate themselves throughout these films, and yet his expensive shots in this film of an oil tanker adrift along the flooded Fifth Avenue (for example) are not made to look to look beautiful or even remarkably absurd--just expensive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Huge amounts of dramatic situations, of which we all know the outcome; a foe that is much stronger than humankind; impossible scientific considerations; separated groups of people stranded, and trying to reach each other. We have seen this before, haven't we? Yes, but who cares? I don't. <p>Before heading for the theater, the viewer HAS to know what "The day after tomorrow" is about: a movie based on a completely absurd premise, with stunning, thrilling scenes (jaws hanging) portraying the fury of the nature - something we all, morbidly, enjoy watching, as long as it doesn't happen in our own backyards. Hurricanes, floods, the sea like a wall, heading towards New York, people freezing instantly. That's what you'll see in this movie. If you are the kind of people who keeps saying "But that is impossible!", do yourself a favor and don't go watch it. Stay at home, tuned to the Discovery Channel, or National Geographic Channel, where you are presented actual facts. "The day after tomorrow" is an exercise in fantasy, where Roland Emmerich imagines what would happen if the world would suddenly turns colder. <p>In fact, the horrific parts of the movie are presented when Dennis Quaid is on screen. Unfortunately, completely lame acting from my childhood hero from "Inner space". On the other hand, Jake Gyllehaal and Emmy Rossum (the pretty girl from "Mystic river") both do a good job. And it's good to see Sela Ward is still beautiful and a competent actress. <p>But the best part of the movie (at least to me) is that my country will be only a little bit chiller, and its external debt will be pardoned by the IMF. I can't wait for the new Ice Age to come.<p>Grade 8.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Many were not given the full scope of the movie before it's release.  The Day After Tomorrow has suspense throughout the movie and you keep with the story throughout.<p>What peaked my curiosity about this movie, besides the fact that I like Sci-Fi and I am from NYC originally is that I heard just a few weeks ago that recently a large amount of fresh water was released into the northern Atlantic Ocean due to the melt on top of a glacier that released an iceburg.  <p>What appealed to me so much that the story goes that too much fresh water can actually slow down the process of the flow of warm to cold water and back in the Atlantic leading to colder weather eventually.<p>This movie is a lot better than the critics make it out to be, and to be sure there is an environmentalist message in it, yet, it does strike one as a serious attempt to tell a story and to get a message across.<p>The plot is excellent and the movie moves very quickly.  Unlike some disaster movies, this one is rather suspenseful throughout.  I was impressed at how fast the time goes while watching this longer than normal movie.<p>I felt cold after the movie was out, I guess it gave me a chill.  Interesting that it has been released at the beginning of the summer.  <p>The scene of the devastation of Los Angeles was horrific.  NYC being covered by water and snow?  Well, you really sense the devastation in the movie.  The trailers on a smaller screen do not do the movie justice.  It really looks like midtown Manhattan.  Wow, they did a good job here.<p>The development of the characters was very quick and Quaid does a credible job as a dad who has a promise to keep with his son.  Sela Ward does a great job as a working mom who has responsibility and lives up to it.  You really think that Jake Gyllenhaal is a very smart person and Emmy Rossum does a good job as his very smart teammate. <p>The casting and storyline worked very well together.  The Day After Tomorrow is a worthwhile flick.  I look forward to the DVD with the trailers and how it was made.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Years ago, I had the pleasure of seeing "Rent" on Broadway.  I thought the play was hilarious.  But while watching it I noticed something peculiar: I was laughing when no one else was.  Many times during the course of watching DAT I had a similar experience.  What made it so funny for me were the clich&eacute;s piled so high they practically snowed New York under all by themselves, and the general plot holes, PC speechifying, and all-around sloppy writing.<br /><br />The clich&eacute;s, oh lord the clich&eacute;s.  U2 actually made a very good song out of a nonstop string of clich&eacute;s ("With or Without You"); I guess the writers of DAT were attempting to do something similar here.  They failed.<br /><br /> Here are but a few of DAT's kitschy, classic clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The lines:<br /><br />* "Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight; the only one who hasn't taken a break."<br />* "If we don't act now, it's going to be too late."<br />* "Let's get you out of those wet clothes."<br />* "I have to do this." "I know."<br />* "Sam might not have one more day."<br />* "I made my son a promise. I'm going to keep it."<br /><br />The scenes:<br /><br />* The boy with leukemia. The writers should've had the guts to just go ahead and name him "Timmy."<br />* If you're an ethnic floor polisher, or an ethnic New York City bum, your chances of surviving a disaster are very good indeed. If it's a choice between you and a bunch of white yuppies, you are practically guaranteed to survive.<br />* The speech-to-the-roomful-of-important-military-and-civilian-personnel scene. The only thing missing was Peter Sellers in a wheelchair with a German accent.<br /><br />Now, some of these clich&eacute;s might not rise to the level of "Dammit Jim, I'm just a simple country doctor, not a miracle worker!" but they all at least come close. I think the only way the movie could have been more clich&eacute;d would be if Michael Bay had directed.<br /><br />The plot holes, the PC-ness, the lack of common sense:<br /><br />* How exactly does cold weather cause wolves to get smart enough to bust out of the Manhattan Zoo? Also, since when does the Manhattan Zoo have wolves? Sea lions -- yes. Penguins -- yes. Polar bears -- yes. Wolves -- no.<br />* Is it just me, or is Sela Ward a dead ringer for Michael Jackson?<br />* Again, how exactly does global warming cause a new ice age?<br />* Why did Jack come to rescue his son in the first place (and have one of his teammates die along the way, in yet another great clich&eacute;d scene -- the only thing missing was Quaid yelling "N-o-o-o-o-o!" in slow motion as his traveling companion fell to his death)? So he could be there when the rescue helicopters came?<br />* When he comes to rescue his son, why didn't Jack see the smoke from the burning books rising from the New York Public Library?<br />* Birds migrating south before the storm. Yeah, yeah, they're smarter than humans, I get it.<br />* Dick Chen -- er, Vice President Becker, giving a mea culpa, sorry-for-America-destroying-the-world-and-looking-down-on-Latin-America speech at the end of the flick. It sort of reminded me of the end to "The Jungle."<br /><br />I encourage you to buy this movie cheap, or to rent it.  I can't exactly call it camp; the movie cost too much to make to call it that.  F/X saves it from total ignominy.  Anyhow, watch DAT for the laughs, and maybe keep track of the rip-offs from every other disaster movie ever made and all the logic errors and propaganda along the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>I have to say that this film really reminded me of Armageddon.  Not in story or plot, but in the way that the movie can be so enjoyable and make little sense when it comes to science and common sense.  The movie is loosely based on the book THE COMING OF THE GLOBAL SUPERSTORM and concerns massive climate changes and how they affect life as we know it.<br /><br />The movie begins on an ice shelf where a climatologist is taking core samples.  These samples combined with events on the shelf drive the scientist (Quaid) to hypothesize that a new ice age is in the near future unless we change our ways now.  To keep things movie, Quad is wrong on the time frame and things begin happening very quickly and drastically.  Like ID4, we follow a number of groups as they are affected by the events, especially Quaid and his almost estranged family.<br /><br />Typical of this type of film, politics and politicians are painted as bad guys although some do come to their senses.  The action never lets up and the special effects are absolutely stunning.  There are a couple of deleted scenes on the disk that really help link a number of events better than they were in the final product, but the movie worked well without them.<br /><br />If you are a fan of disaster films then this is one of the biggest you could see.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Let me begin this review by saying one thing, The Day After Tomorrow is an excellent movie. I loved it. The special effects were outstanding. It's good fun for a date movie.<br /><br />But,....trying to take this movie seriously is actually hard. The story revolving around global warming and the world being hit hard within a week is a bit too hard to swallow. Too, there's just some things in the movie that I just don't see happening quite the same way if they were to happen in real life. I'm not saying that we shouldn't take the threat of global warming seriously but the way it is presented in this movie is ridiculous. If the writer of the film took more time to research the material on global warming, I think he(and Roland Emmerich) could have made an even better film. As much as I love disaster flicks(having collected the majority of them that has come out in recent memory), I really don't know if I could recommend this one for people to buy.<br /><br />However, if you're hankering for a disaster flick to watch on a Friday night with family and friends eating pizza and popcorn, then- this is a rental that's sure to please.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>The movie is clearly a popcorn thriller with apocalyptic intentions and some neat special fx to show for itself, which unfortunately are terribly frittered away because the film doesn't quite seem to be able to make up its mind -- should it have been a special fx entertainer, or should the characters have had depth? <p>Either/or would have been fine, but the Day After Tomorrow ends up being a cold mesh of predictable yet doozy disasters and empty characters/plot. <p>The message is noble. Save mother earth, prevent global warming. But it is drummed in too stridently with vacuous science (such events would take years, not days to transpire) and countless empty scenes thrown in (most scenes with the president of US, who got killed for the most moronic of reasons; a street beggar and his dog who add zilch to the film;  a rich fratboy and his brother stuck in Philadelphia, about whom nothing happens; the whole thing about Dennis Quaid's wife and the child she is supposedly saving in a hospital; references to the third world; etc etc). <p>Then there are zillions of cliches to deal with. The minor character who sacrifices himself; the character who puts his/her life in grave danger for most inane of reasons; the ignorant authority figure who dismisses the intelligent warnings and puts dozens/hundreds/millions of lives at risk; etc etc. All here to comprehensively irk.<p>Political correctness savants were busy too. As you may expect, all races are factored in: the NASA representative amidst all this mayhem is a Japanese woman; a friend of Dennis Quaid's son is an African American; an important conference is held in New Delhi; you get the picture. <p>As though that were not enough, the plot gets suicidal with some obviously ludicrous elements, not the least of which is a couple of men floundering from Philadelphia to NYC in 24 hours, on foot, in metres and metres of murderous snow. <p>Some fx are cool, I admit, but nothing I have not seen in some form or the other before....hurricanes (Twister), frozen worlds (A.I.), airplane turbulence (Turbulence, Passenger 57), big wave floods (The Core) etc. <p>Overall, a watchable popcorn flick but the net result is rather pale and baleful in comparison to other movies from this genre. Especially when you think back about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I love disaster films. Absolutely love them. So when a movie comes along that has not only tornadoes, not only tidal waves, not only the blizzard of all blizzards, but a preachy message on global warming, I'm "down with it," as they say.<p>Yes, the plot is cheesy, but so what? EVERY disaster movie plot is cheesy. It's part of the charm! Of course we have the earnest scientist (Dennis Quaid, looking great; age becomes him), the nonbelieving government officials (look for the Cheney lookalike playing--surprise, surprise, the Vice President of the United States), the romance thrown in for good measure--the hero scientists who risk their lives for the Greater Good--I mean, what more can you want?<p>The special effects are spectacular, especially the tornadoes destroying Los Angeles and the tidal wave hitting New York. As a person who does not enjoy flying at the best of times, I have to say that the turbulent airplane ride was much too real for my tastes. I found my palms sweating!<p>The premise of a new Ice Age is pretty scary. And maybe the stuff that happens in this film can't really happen, as our real-life scientists say. But the message on global warming might, just might, reach a few close-minded people, because if this film can't happen, something bad is sure to be in the offing, right? I just hope it's not a tidal wave over Philadelphia (where I live).<p>Really, this is a fun film, a great summer blockbuster, and a visual stunner. I recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) is trying to convince some stuck-up politicians that the Earth is going do go through some serious climate changes (maybe even an ice age) in the next 100 to 1000 years. But he's wrong. It's coming 'The Day After Tomorrow.' He's also having trouble with his son (a boy genius who get's stuck in New York when some bad-boy weather begins to brew), his wife (a doctor who refuses to leave a cancer-ridden child even when the weather turns into a giant planet-wide storm), and the Vice President (who's more concerned with money than lives). <p>Needless to say, our climatologist finally gets his point across when the weather patterns change so drastically that people freeze spontaneously if they go outside, giant waves inundate New York City (and trap our hero's son in the NY Library along with some other holdouts), and three massive hurricanes cover North America, Europe and Siberia.<br />****************************************************************<br />Where this film runs into problems is in it's believability, it's corny lines, it's status quo characters, and so many characters that you don't become emotionally involved with any of them in any way, shape or form. <p>#1--Wolves DO NOT attack humans. EVER. There has never been a documented case of a wolf attack on a human being! Not to mention the wolves that do escape from a holding pen and start roaming the NY streets are computer generated (and it's WAAAAY too obvious that they are). <p>#2--Climate changes wouldn't occur in such a widespread pattern in such a short period of time. Ever. Even in past ice age research there's no evidence for this. Ask even the most vehement environmentalist with any knowledge of climatology and they'll confirm this. <p>#3--Let's see how many characters we can shove into one film: We've got the President and Vice President; a climatologist and his family; a weather researcher (Ian Holm) and his cohorts stuck at a weather station and doomed to freeze to death; a group of teenagers stuck in the NY Library; Astronauts on the space station viewing the destruction from the safety of their cozy tin can; and a child with cancer who needs to be moved out of a hospital before the big freeze sets in permanently. <p>Add to this quagmire some bad dialogue and character personalities we've seen MILLIONS of times and...well...you can see where problems would arise. <p>The makers (or screenwriters) of this film, couldn't even keep the climate changes permanent! In the end, they had to make it warm and fuzzy for...Oh, who the hell knows why!<br /><br />So this film didn't impress me at all, as you can see. Unlike other disaster films that set a new standard for films in this genre (The War of the Worlds, etc.), this film is bound to be forgotten.<br /><br />D rating.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I cant write a reveiw on what the plot was about other then the world freezes over and it shows what might happen, with people trying to act around it.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but CGI overkill with no plot at around it except for a guy looking for his son. thats about all, oh and expect that romance crap around it that happens in every other movie.<br /><br />This is another excuse to use SFX and CGI in a movie without bothering to concintrate on a story line around it, the CGI might look good, but you do not have a good movie based on that alone, when are these people going to learn that CGI do not carry a movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I wish I can say something super positive to say about this movie but I have to say that this is one dismal film. Directed by Roland Emmerich who also happened to be an environmentist, the concept of global warming causing the sudden appearance of the ice age may sound neat on paper but I think it has much creditablity as a toliet paper.<p>If Emmerich managed to create a great film that is one thing but the film itself lack credidability as the concept. First, the special effects, which overall wasn't all that bad but it does have few major flaws. One good example would be that beautiful space view of ice encrusted Europe, from Norway to Italy. Nice graphics but with the rising of ocean and freezing of the European continent, won't the shore line be drastically altered? If so, why does that ice encrusted Europe still looked like the latest edition of Rand McNally map book? Computer graphic wolves looked like something from one of them werewolf movies. As for actors, they got an unforgivably bad lines, bad dialogues with cliches couple with the fact that they have to behaved so stupid for being such a smart group of folks. Funny how Dennis Quaid and rest of the cast never looked dirty, tired or worn out. They all looked like they just step out of their dressing rooms for a take. Quaid do have a weak 5 O'Clock shadow but otherwise, looked pristine. The kids in the library looked like they had a slumber party. It was also funny how two guys carrying a injured third guy managed to outrun the weather....right...just like in Mummy Returns but that was a fantasy...but so is this! Of course, as one Alaskan asked another in the theater...where are their vapors? Its supposed to be cold but there is no tall tell sign of it by their breath! I supposed they are just supposed to pretend its cold! The movie talked about how the Atlantic currents are affecting the weather. But it doesn't say a thing about the Pacific Ocean, world's largest. It may be an oversight but won't the Pacific Ocean have some influence in off setting the ice age if it was not affected?? Another dumb thing is this...if half of the US was covered with ice, why are all these people running into Mexico? Is Rio Grande River some sort of a magical barrier?? With the ice coming down, won't the Rio Grande be flooded making it almost impassable? It looked most of the southwest, Texas and deep South reminds free, why do people and our own government run to a foreign country when half of our own still remain untouched???<p>I sure hate to think of the political outcome of this ice age. United States reduced to a third rate status. Europeans becoming the homeless trash of the world and Third World nations unaffected by ice age taking over world leadership. <p>This is a silly movie, badly scripted, badly directed and badly concepted. Instead of warning us about global warming, it make the subject into a big joke. I supposed many of the undemanding members of the audience will go for this but the more acute ones will probably see it for what it is, poor movie hiding behind a lot of smoke and mirrors. If anyone who read this want to see it, wait until its on rental. With Harry Potter, Shrek and other decent movies out there, there should be no reason why anyone wants to waste their money on this film....but its your money,eh?<br />(On the bright side, any movie that destory Los Angles can't be all bad!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>If a good disaster film is your thing then "The Day After Tomorrow" will satisfy your thirst. Filmed with the latest special effects possible, "The Day After Tomorrow" deals with the problems of global warming and its effect on the planet. Places that never get snow suddenly become frozen with blizzards and ice, and places that are never hit with tornadoes are suddenly destroyed by the wrath of nature's wind and destruction. Starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal, the true stars of this epic are the jaw-dropping special effects: the film looks so real one has to remind themself they are only watching a movie. Sure 1970's disaster movies like "Earthquake" and "The Towering Inferno" are fun to watch, but thanks to modern technology movie makers can make the most simplest form of storytelling into a real, and sometimes, freightening experience. The DVD comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary and deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: DOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT THIS IS "REEL-EE" BAD SCIENCE?<br /><br />Did it matter that "Independence Day" by the same Director had even less of a connection with possible future scenarios? NO, but "Independence Day" did not rely so heavily on special effects [though it was full of them] and therein lies part of the difference. "Independence Day" also had a unique chemistry that seemed to give it a connection to 50's-style, alien-invader flicks, thereby cultivating an affinity from those fans --including me.<br /><br />After all, does "Superman" [the "good alien invader"] need to be believable? - - - - -<br /><br />DOES STAR WARS NEED TO BE GOOD SCIENCE TO BELIEVE IN THE FILMS? DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE FORCE?<br /><br />Of course, the science is ridiculous in almost all of these speculative fiction flicks. Remember this is Hollywood film fiction and this fictional account is not "Gone With The Wind". On the other hand, I found "THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW" to be so much more watchable than "Men In Black" which suffered from an excess of humourous, flashy, fanciful, madcap, silly, glib and goofy moods to be watchable for me.<br /><br />This film appears to be trying at least to make a go of it. By that I mean making the unbelievable less, well, unbelievable. Dennis Quaid as a scientist-husband-father does well to keep us connected emotionally to the horrific events lending some much needed empathy to this spectacle. Ian Holm as the Brittish scientist is, well, Ian Holm; which is to say he always turns in a top-notch performance and his sequences are much needed in making the most unscientific theories work well enough to partially suspend our disbelief -- hopefully for at least 123 minutes.<br /><br />Going against the film is the obvious post-9/11 sentiment, making the destruction of American cities, shown principally to American audiences, somewhat worse than politically incorrect. To some people it may have seemed like rape victims watching a rape story movie, very sordid, but I did not realize that until I heard it from other people. Perhaps because I did not see the film until over 3 years after 9/11? If that is the case, the destruction of cities may be less offensive if you are NOW seeing the film for the first time, but that is just speculation.<br /><br />THE DVD & FEATURES<br /><br />Despite its inherent flaws, it plays somewhat interestingly, especially in this widescreen format. You can play it in "English", Spanish", and French" and there are subtitles available in English or Spanish. If you want the "DTS Surround Sound" this is available in English only. There are also some neat features like 2 separate commentary tracks and an hour-long featurette ["the making of"]. Of course there is the scene-selector feature and there are enough scenes that you won't have trouble getting to where you wish to go. There are also "deleted scenes" and an "audio anatomy-interactive sound demo".<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The sound and video quality are great, which is as it should be on a new, high-budget release. The film is bad science, "reel" bad science, but it does retain a decent, and spectacular story, though more than a bit ridiculous. Ridiculous sometimes works in fantasy, though it is a bit harder sell in science fiction. In any event, the choice is up to us, the movie viewing public.<br /><br />Recently, this DVD has been heavily discounted and is now available widely for about half the original price, or about $10.00.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy.  Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck.  He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with "Independence Day," in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him.  Two years later, in "Godzilla," he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification.  Now, in "The Day After Tomorrow," Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us.  This is mass-market filmmaking with a social conscience.<br /><br />"The Day After Tomorrow" is what people generally have in mind when they refer to "mindless summertime popcorn entertainment" - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations.  This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins.  The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in.  The "plot" involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.<br /><br />As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned "Independence Day" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment.  In "The Day After Tomorrow," once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm.  The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off.  Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow.  The characters barely register as people and we really don`t care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet.  The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat.<br /><br />"The Day After Tomorrow" is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup.  You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway.  You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage.  So it is with this movie.  The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin`.<br /><br />My only question is what can Emmerich possibly do for an encore?</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I first heard about the production of this movie on the George Norry (not sure how to spell his name) show (fomerly wacky UFO and supernatural freak - Art Bell), so I thought it might be a little strange.  I had also heard that the movie was very political and was a basic slap in the face to my fellow Republicans.  But it was NOT that bad, concerning a political slant, at all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the special effects.  The acting was not bad - I almost always enjoy everything Dennis Quaid does.  The story line could have been a little more believable, but all and all, this is a film that delivers great scenes, good dialogue and some very attractive people on screen.<br /><br />I can't think of a single part of the film that I found myself getting bored - that's a good thing.  I would suggest this movie to people of all ages.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is awesome on the screen.  She manages to have that girl-next-door look and supermodel look going at the same time.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (from "October Sky" and the shockingly terrible "Bubble Boy") does a great job in this film!  I really think he took the role as far as it could go.  I couldn't picture anyone else plaing this role.<br /><br />I say buy it - I really think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich has this reputation of creating this huge blockbuster disaster films like Independence Day and to a lesser extent Godzilla. Yet we critically forget his 2 finest films: Stargate and the Patriot. It's been 8 years since ID4 and he again destroys the world(and New York for the 3rd time) but it's more spectacular than that despite logic and dialogue.<br /><br />Jack Hall(why is main characters always Jack for some reason?) is a paleoclimatologist which means he studys the weather that exists 1000's of years ago. He says that melting ice caps will disrupt the climate flow which means we'll enter a new ice age. Of course, no one believes him, including a Dick Cheney look-alike. And he still doesn't believe him afterwards. But soon, Scotland is hit with a hurricane where the eye of it is -150 F and instantly freezes you in about 7 seconds. Hail the size of footballs crash into Tokyo. Tornadoes ravage Los Angeles and a massive tsunami hits New York and then freezes, blanketing the Big Apple in snow.<br /><br />Come for the effects if you have to. My favorite scene is probably the tsunami hitting New York even though it has an incredibly lame tension builder(super cute Emmy Rossum goes back to a cab when the tsunami is blocks away to get....a bag? Whatever). The LA tornadoes are next where you have those annoying newscasters right in the middle of a disaster reporting when they should get out of here getting nailed by LA's favorite billboard, Angeline. Some CG isn't that great: the wolves don't look realistic and for some reason the New York tsunami wave looks a bit too dark while Deep Impact's wave(also hitting New York) was in broad daylight.<br /><br />Don't come here expecting to get research for a paper. The chances of it happening that fast is really stretching it and don't ask me to explain the science of certain things like the idea of the super-freezing hurricane. Like the Core, it's awesome and cool to behold but your brain should be off as to not end up spending the entire movie figuring out the science of it. But still, go for the effects...and Emmy Rossum.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>When the movie made its big-screen debut in 2004 - and continuing with the various DVD releases - debate oftentimes degenerated into questioning the actual validity of the global warming/cooling that is depicted, while seemingly forgetting that this is a Sci-Fi action adventure. It would be like giving opinions on The Da Vinci Code and One Million Years B.C. as if the films are based on historical facts.<br /><br />Produced, directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, the special effects are absolutely incredible, but the story stumbles due to the generic characters that can plague this genre; arrogant politicians, misunderstood scientists and practical voices continually lost in the wilderness of society.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is climatologist Jack Hall who valiantly tries to make the top political leaders in Washington, D.C., understand the harsh ramifications of the emerging storms worldwide. After tackling this tough task, he sets forth on a journey through massive ice and snow to rescue his son (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York City. Throughout the sojourn, both characters play off the themes of friendship, family and the will to survive.<br /><br />There is a nice mix of special features - including scenes edited out of the film - that are interesting. But the storms steal the show and wash away a script that was built around the big bang of special effects and had cardboard cut-outs for characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Smashing special effects.  Very detailed, vivid, and exciting.<br />*Some memorable scenes.<br />*Storyline is relatively engaging; hardly boring.<br />*I suppose this is somewhat relevant to today's issues concerning climate change.<br />*Acting was not too bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Highly unbelievable.  Even if supercell storm systems have some kind of wierd cold air front, there's no way helicopters could freeze over in seconds and crash.  Some parts are downright silly; people were literally running away from growing frost.<br />*Sometimes, the characters act dumb; a few parts where you could yell at the screen for the people to run and seek shelter.  However, some of this stupidity is believable.<br />*Heavy focus on drama can be seen as sappy.<br /><br />Only a step better than other disaster movies like "The Core," this film has a typical plot with typical characters.  It is well made, with fantastic special effects, some interesting imagery, and adequate acting.  Some aspects can also be relevant to modern-day issues in climate change (and possibly immigration).  It is still a little shallow and highly unbelievable.  Fans of disaster films, or people who like good special effects, should probably check this out.  Otherwise, it is quite weak.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>Here we are with another love it or hate it film. "The Day After Tomorrow" was done by the same crew who brought you "Independence Day".<br /><br /> Well, it's July 5th, and all h**l is breaking loose.<br />It all starts with the Larsen "B" ice shelf breaking up and falling into the Ocean (which was a real event, I might add). What happens from here, is best described as pure fiction (Science Fiction?).<br /><br />Baseball-size hail in Japan, snow in India, tornadoes in Los Angeles, Helicopters freezing in flight above Scotland and a 100+feet storm surge in Manhattan. I think the only thing missing was fish and frogs raining from the sky in Kansas! All this leads up to three "superstorms" that signal the beginning of the new Ice Age.<br /><br />Much time is given in the film to it's actors explaining away these occurrences, with Dennis Quaid leading the charge to think proactively, to protect the citizenry of the U.S. (it seems our government is only interested in money-WOW! big surprise, there!) The dramatization of the characters seems superfluous at times, with dialog that's just banal enough to put one to sleep. All the actors in this film make brave attempts to lend credibility to the story, but just can't get past the weather, which is the real star of this film.<br /><br />The crazy weather IS interesting, though, especially when the choppers froze in mid air. The guy flash-freezing at the hatch of his helicopter is pretty good, and where better than Los Angeles, to get the "Wizard of Oz" treatment! Manhattan always seems to get the brunt of damage in disaster flicks, and one wonders why it's still standing!<br /><br />It might seem that I'm bashing this film. On the contrary, there IS one thing that saves this film, and it happens to be my favorite part. It's when the "new" President of what's left of The United States gets in front of TV cameras and microphones, and ADMITS his fault in the handling of the disaster! I love it!!<br /><br />The Scientific Community essentially dismissed this film outright, because of it's most glaring errors- The weather. Some said it was an "overly severe" example of the coming of the next Ice Age. Some even went so far as to say that many of the anomalies would not even occur! While I'm no scientist or meteorologist, "The Day After Tomorrow" is a pretty good example of "Escapist Reality"!<br /><br />Some of the extras are interesting. There is a breakdown of the sound elements of a specific scene in the film, the usual deleted scenes, and commentary tracks. The Making-of segment is accessed by DVD-ROM.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I saw this movie at theater and it was impressive.

This is no exception but at least its a fun ride. Its kind of long too, but I didnt mind it so much. The action is the best part in this film. I loved the helicopter scene where they all just froze. Pretty amazing effects. I'm sure this film has a message that we should all be listening to, but it was awfully ridiculously quick how everything happened, and while I'm no scientist, I cant see all that happening in a span of pretty much 1 day. Other than that, its a pretty solid made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>... and sleeting, and snowing, and hailing, and storming, and the sky is falling, etc. Yeah, okay, it's a fun movie, and the first hour or so is a visual joyride. They didn't miss a trick.  Everybody has their own favorite scene in this movie, whether it's the tornado shredding the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, or hail the size of soccer balls falling on the beach in Malibu, or the rainfall guysering up through the manholes in Manhattan... my own favorite is the giant wave about to engulf the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor and getting ready to flood out all of the Lower East Side and midtown. The first hour of this film is a special effects fanatic's delight.<br /><br />And a good thing, too, because once the special effects are done, what's left of the movie falls flatter than the proverbial pancake. Alas, Roland Emmerich never realized that great special effects do not a great movie make. Once the deep freeze outside is on, the movie freezes up as well. We've heard it all before -- the lone, unregarded scientist, preaching doom and gloom, ignored until too late; his super-bright, nerdy kid who solves complicated calculus problems in his head, competing for the cute coed against the rich kid from the Ivies... is there a cliche that Emmerich forgot to add to this film? Well, the general plot line is interesting, if not altogether original -- global warming leading to a global deep freeze, although this time the deep freeze happens in days, not centuries (there's progress for ya!), but the "human interest" side plots add absolutely nothing to the script and are at best a big yawn and at worst just plain irritating. The acting is adequate, but just barely. The rain, snow and hail have more personality than the actors.<br /><br />If Emmerich thought he was giving us a deep film that would sound a global alarm on the dangers of global warming, he's too full of himself to be taken seriously. As if anyone would take this movie seriously. It's a fun movie, and taken as such, it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV. Kick back with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>.....notice how the Vice-Prezzy in the movie resembles our current occupant, even down to the sneering unwillingness to listen to anything remotely scientific. Additionally, do you believe that Quaid could have survived the walk to New York (for his son) in the subzero arctic temperatures...? That's what makes it a piece of movie fiction, I guess. How come no one thought to fire up (really fire up) a nuclear reactor is beyond me. That would have melted those mutant ice floes for sure...to say nothing of creating genetic anomalies all over the joint...to say nothing of creating massive amounts of water everywhere. It is an entertaining though flawed and claustrophobic disaster flick that will hold your attention for a spell. I however think that if there were massive weather changes because of greenhousing and ozone depletion, we'd be more prone to fry in boiling temperatures...but I am no meteorologist...</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>"The Day After Tomorrow," the surprisingly successful disaster flick from director Roland Emmerich, serves as pretty much mindless entertainment. I mean, there are so many points in this movie where you have to wonder if they lost pages in the script, or if the writers have actually experienced the mildest winter at all. But then again, I think it's safe to say that any movie that comes out between May and August is meant strictly for entertainment. And in that way, this movie works. It's a story about global warming. You see, the pollution our Earth is subjected to is creating a greenhouse effect, melting the polar ice caps, which in turns floods the closest land -- of which New York seems to be the primary victim, with Canada being wiped out completely (?) -- where the water level reaches unimaginable heights, and, (in)conveiniently freezes, creating a new ice age. The movie centers around a father and son who are in totally different places at the time of disaster. The son (I forget names in this movie), played by "Spider-man" understudy Jake Gyllenhaal, is trapped in a New York City library with some of his friends and a crowd of lucky people who are waiting out the storm. His father, played by Dennis Quaid, the scientist who saw it all coming, and thus, is filling in for Jeff Goldblum, heads to New York with two of his headstrong buddies to save his son. There are a few little subplots thrown in between, but they are so half-hearted and under-developed that they have no meaning. They could have easily trimmed 30 minutes off of this movie and received the same effect. The characters are downright dumb, with a hobo and his dog being the intellectual standouts. But then again, we didn't come here to see good acting, did we? Nope. The special effects and the action sequences are where the money's at, and this movie makes good on it's promise. All of the special effects are accomplished well, even if they play out better on the big screen. This is definitely a good movie to show off your new system with. Even if there are some parts that are impossible to believe, such as when Quaid and Co. are travelling through the storm, they obviously can't see the road or where they're going, or anything for that matter, but don't crash (for a while anyways). In real life, they would have made it about 500 yards before landing in a ditch or getting stuck in the snow, or worse, taking a wrong turn into the woods. But anyways, it's still a fun movie, with some shades of political satire -- The President is dumb and useless (and dies very easily), while the Vice President is still dumb, but obviously the man in charge. One of the few minor plots that actually works. Overall, it's an entertaining little romp, if you just detach your brain. If you liked "Independence Day," or God forbid, "Godzilla" (I actually did), this one will be right up your alley. Just don't take it too seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>In the tradition of 'Twister' and 'The Perfect Storm,' where the good guys face off against Mother Nature, we now get 'The Day After the Tomorrow.'  The premise of the movie is as follows:  Jack Hall, a scientist played by Dennis Quaid, discovers that the polar ice caps are melting and the Atlantic current is disapating.  As a result, a new ice age is about to hit Earth.  To make matters worse, Jack's son, Sam, is caught in the middle of its path in New York while on an Academic Decathalon trip from his college.<br /><br />What this movie comes down to is just another disaster flick where on some level, the weather is suppose to be the bad guy.  Ultimately, the goal of the film might have been to get human's to look at what they are doing to the environment, as pollution is the ultimate culprit in making the polar icecaps melt.  However, its just hard to take this movie seriously and believe that in a manner of days, the icecaps could melt, the current could cease to exist, and the weather would go absolutely haywire.<br /><br />Hall's rescue attempt of his son isn't even compelling.  None of the characters are especially charismatic.  Sam has an action sequence that is really unnecessary, not very exciting, and almost laughable in the later half of the movie that only serves to prolong the lenghth of the film.<br /><br />I remember this movie being billed as 'The Movie that President Bush' doesn't want you to see (wait a minute, wasn't that Farenheit 9/11?).  I'm not sure why.  The omniboding apocalypse that is foreshadowed by the melting of the ice caps is so implausible that He couldn't have been worried.  Perhaps the critic that made that statement thought President Bush was concerned we would fall over laughing from the horrible CGI wolves in the end.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie at all.  There were some excellent special effects in which Los Angeles was wiped out by Tornados, and New York was flooded and then frozen over.  After that, there isn't much to like in this movie.  If your interest is peaked, just rent the movie and stop watching about half way through.  However, I will note that my wife really enjoyed this movie, so I could be all wrong.<br /><br />NOTE TO HOLLYWOOD:  Please quit making movies where Mother Nature is the villain.  Nobody has done it right in a long, long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>You'd never know that the special effects juggernaut that is the Day After Tomorrow was based on a book by Whitley Striber, but the one thing you will know is that the never ending surge of CGI enhanced weather disasters are brought to you by the same team that brought us the special effects turkey Independence Day.  There's no point of going into the story since there isn't much of one to describe, just that Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are wasted in their roles as a father and son who are caught in the middle of an end of the world-esque weather phenomina that catapaults the planet into chaos.  Make no mistake that the CGI effects are a sight to behold, and the Day After Tomorrow can be taken as a guilty pleasure, but other than that it's as lame as it looks.

However, if you have just average speakers and a normal sized TV and couldn't stand Independence Day, stay away from this movie...far, far away.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>The Day after Tomorrow was made, apparently, for one reason: To wow the audience with its special effects and for a few moments make us feel like we are also dodging tidal waves and tornadoes. In that way, for me, it succeeded.<br /><br />You can't approach effects vehicles the same way as hardcore drama's that are filled with the do's and do not's of life. You have to step back and ask: Do I care enough about these characters to worry whether they make it or not? I felt so. I am a massive Gyllenhaal fan, and can't wait for the day when Dennis Quaid gets to show off his true capabilities as an actor. (Check out "Frequency" or "Dragonheart").<br /><br />The Day after Tomorrow will no doubt become a show-off disc for my home theatre sound system, and for those who can be willing to have simple minded fun for a few hours this will be the showcase. Though I know some of the savor will be lost as far as scope, it will still be a good dvd to own. ~saos~</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich, known for his smart disaster movies such as Independence Day, pulls it off again with this great film.  As an aspiring climatologist, I was especially glad to see that behind every minor weather problem there was some truth behind it, not necessarily behind the major climate change however.  The story though is more than just about the weather.  In fact it is really just a good tie-in for a father-son relationship in need of healing, or is that vice versa, plus a few other relationships made along the way.  Either way, the special effects were great, not obviously fake, and the relationships that were formed or deepened, although sped up for movie time, were still powerful and as awing as the storm.  This is not just another epic disaster film, and it should not be treated as one.  I found The Day After Tomorrow to be a great and amusing film, and definitely one to kick off the summer blockbuster season.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Hollywood has a long history of recording how the world may come to a spectacular end.  Most of these films are long on special effects but short on human interest. In THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, director Roland Emmerich continues this tradition with Dennis Quaid as a climatologist who correctly predicts the onset of a world crunching ice age.  Much of the attendant controversy of this film is spun by comparisons with the nonfiction doomsday thriller book, THE COMING GLOBAL SUPERSTORM by Art Bell, that suggests that global warming would melt the ice caps and the resulting intrusion of massive amounts of fresh water into the salty oceans would deflect the equatorial air and water flow that warms the western hemisphere.  DAT is also a thinly veiled political allegory that suggests that the Republican refusal to accord with the Kyoto Protocols to reduce global warming is the primary reason for the cataclysm.  The actor who plays the movie vice president is a dead ringer for Dick Cheney, who later sees third world countries like Mexico as the savior of what remains of America.  <p>On a technical note, the hard science of DAT falls short of credibility since basic meteorological principles render it most unlikely that the Northern Hemisphere could be subject to a deep freeze in the time scale depicted.  Still, other end-of-the-world-films like THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE (1961) offer superior scripts and acting to involve the audience even if the special effects were shoddy by today's standards.  In DAT, the special effects range from convincing, computer-enhanced tornadoes wrecking Los Angeles, a tidal wave inundating Manhattan, and bowling ball hailstones pelting Tokyo.  The human element revolves around Quaid hiking to Manhattan to find his son who is holed up in the New York Public Library.  Director Emmerich did not hesitate to lift entire scenes and characters from an earlier film ICE AGE (1998), which dealt with similar themes: a president who is the last to leave the White House, a book lover arguing whether Dante's Inferno ought to be used for fuel, the hero risking death to find his family.  What emerges from the frozen muck of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a film that is surprisingly fun and involving.  The viewer may not be convinced that we are headed for a real life Big Freeze, but that viewer almost certainly had the visual ride of his life.</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>The Day After Tomorrow is a film you see for a dazzling array of visual effects.  Directed by Roland Emmerich who made one of the biggest hits of 1996, Independence Day and one of the biggest disappoinments of 1998, Godzilla.  He also made the enjoyable The Patriot in 2000.  You don't see this type of movie for a story since it's so cliche, and not too mention a tad unbelievable.<br />  The story uses the lame father-son tale, pretty much Dennis Quaid goes to try and rescue his son who is trapped in flooded New York City.  SPOILER: And of the course the film has a happy ending, considering none of the major characters die.  Are you buying the realism?  Didn't think so.  The disaster sequences are nothing short of remarkable, this film had a $125 million budget and it definitely shows.  The disaster sequences while great could've been longer, they seemed to have gone by pretty quickly but this film goes by pretty fast considering it's 123 minutes.  Jake Gyllenhaul, Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, and Ian Holm give fine performances.  Wow, weren't expecting good acting in a film like this huh?<br />  The Day After Tomorrow is rated PG-13 for Intense Situations of Peril.  The disaster sequences look incredibly realistic and believable and could scare some people.  The images of the tornadoes destroying Los Angeles and the flooding of New York are intense.  There's also a fake-looking, completely CG, wolf attack sequence which is used as a mindless digression.  Though this film could upset some considering it targets the Bush administration in a negative way, Vice President Cheney is portrayed as arrogant and rude, which I must say did upset me.  Overall this is an enjoyable film and worth seeing in theatres, just don't take it seriously in terms of the plot.  If you don't catch at the theatres, definitely check it out when it hits the shelves of Blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>Hurricanes...tornados...hail storms...sudden climate changes in the region...hmm, I don't see a big problem with the world right now, but the people at 20th Century Fox tries to shows off these CG weather conditions, in a much darker tone.<p>[REVIEW]<p>The Day After Tomorrow, yearly waited for its release, promised itself to be a disaster film with social commentary, enacting what would happen and what people should think if people keeps messing with Mother Earth, and its director Ronald Emmerich that will take the job showing the message.  People should know him for directing the addicting sci-fi action flick, "Independence Day"...and also directed the nuclear disaster that is "Godzilla."  Emmerich decided to put away the toys of big monster movies, and pick up the building blocks of disaster films.  The result of direction and idea is a movie that visually stunning and shocking from its brink of impending doom, and a little humorous.  It's beautiful and thrilling...but how beautiful and thrilling this movie is?<p>Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his group of 'paleoclimatologists' were in Antarctica studying the climate of the continent when a huge crack the size of Rhode Island happened in front of them.  We should all thank global warning for that, as Jack Hall mentions in a international conference, when he said that the new ice age might occur much sooner than they think, thanks to the information that gives early warning signs, but does anyone pay attention to these early warning signs?  NOOO!  Later on, his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), was on a plane trip to New York(which is basically Quebec in real life) for a Decathlathon, along with his buddy and love interest, fearing that danger might lure its ugly head.  And danger does lure itself in the world, and thanks to people who don't pay attention to the weather channel, heavy hail storms occur in Japan, hurricanes occur in India, and catastrophic tornados occur in the popular city of Los Angeles(at least the people there don't have to worry about smog).  Other weathering cataclysms occur in different places, and soon the NYC will experience disaster...yet again, thanks to a huge wave that will flood the whole city and the people in it.  At an even worse situation with the earth, Jack reported that the entire northern hemisphere will be covered up in ice, thanks to some holes in the atmosphere that will instantly solidify anything that surrounds these holes.  To put it short: the survivors up north were out of the frying pan, and into the freezer.  Jack and his paleocli-whatever buddies decide to go north, risking themselves to find his son struggling to survive uptown before the final stage of the new ice age commence.<p>The cinematics are hot.  Nevermind the story, the people are going to spend what they have to see some good, over-the-top special effects.  The special effects and CGI scenes were great, though, much improved over "ID4"...or any world-troubling film for that matter.  The director did a good spending most of the movie's budget on perfecting the simulation of the dangers of global warming.  The cast consist of Disney and Nickelodeon-fame, but their performances were decent to say the least.  This movie is solid when it comes to its whole production process, though people that were looking for a piece of cinema that's remarkable may want to look elsewhere.<p>I hate to be the bearer of negative criticism, even to a movie I loved from the previews, but The Day After Tomorrow is a pretty standard disaster flick.  People who've seen the past disaster flicks would come to familiarize the formulas that this movie follows from Disasterology 101.  Big authority ignoring early warning signs of doom: check!  Pessimists are psychic of upcoming danger: check!  Catastrophe strikes during rush hour: check!  People making good use out of a bad situation: chii-eck!  It all follows the rules to make a disaster flick, and the executing is very average.  The movie also dulls down by being too predictable.  For example: in one scene, if a guy is hanging to dear life by a single rope to avoid a deadly fall, and two other guys were trying to pull the rope up, and one of the other guys said, "We're not gonna make it," what's the guy holding the rope going to do to help them?  I probably knew what you're gonna say.  I'm also a little annoy by movie's intentional tone in emotion; it starts off easy, then thrilling, then slow, thrilling again, sadness, shocking, slow, depressing, intense, and by the film's ending, uplifting.  Any movie (disaster or not) that ends uplifting from everything that's sad and climatic in the beginning is just being cheesy and not believable.<p>The Day After Tomorrow promised me social commentary(it said so on its official website), but what it got me is nothing but linear.  For what it's worth, though, this is the most realistic and practical disaster film I seen.  There's no aliens, big lizards, or 'the Earth's core' to rid the earth in a fake manner, this is hardcore catastrophe based on scientific theory that might be an actual fact.  The message and referential concept made this movie my favorite disaster film, next to "Airplane", but it doesn't excuse the fact that the movie is banal and its plot structure that acts like a 10-piece puzzle: easily put in together without putting much thought.  As I end my review, one question remains: is this movie a high-budget blockbuster, or a warning?  That's the question you must think for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich, known for his smart disaster movies such as Independence Day, pulls it off again with this great film.

While not perfect by any means, "The Day After Tomorrow" delivers quite a thrilling ride, for the movie-goer who likes a lot of action, good special effects and drama thrown in.<p>As I said, it isn't perfect. Unfortunately, it suffers from a very mediocre script. In addition, some elements of the plot are highly cliched. For example, the homeless man who goes from social outcast to one of the heroes who survives all the peril. In addition, I found the obligatory love story between the son and that girl almost laughable. <p>But that's really all the negative comments I have. The rest of the movie works. Dennis Quaid hands-down gives the best performance out of everyone; in fact I would say that his character is the one whom the audience can connect to the most and therefore care about. We can care about the other characters too, but IMO his performance makes his character the most "human" and vulnerable while also determined.<p>Finally, any movie that can make one think after they leave the theater is a good movie in my book. And "The Day After Tomorrow" does just that. I walked out of the theater realizing that the scenario I just saw could very well happen in real life (although I think it would be a lot messier and more chaotic than Hollywood's choreographed and CGI version of it). Still, it does make one think, all politics of the movie put aside. The dangers are real no matter what the politics are, and that seems to be the movie's true message. While I doubt it will win any Academy Award, it's definitely worth seeing, especially on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>This could have been a great movie. The dynamic of father and son provided an excellent chance for the writers and directors to have a truly dynamic story, but alas it failed to deliver.<br /><br />The special effects were awesome. If that's all you want from a movie (Giant tornadoes, snow-covered landslides and mountains of water filling the streets of coastal America) you'll be pleased with this movie.<br /><br />If, however, you want a plot, storyline and viable conclusion, you will be (as I was) greatly disappointed.<br /><br />For a movie of this type to work, you have to care about the characters. Writers and directors of the future, take note of that!</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>Did it matter that "Independence Day" by the same Director had even less of a connection with possible future scenarios? NO, but "Independence Day" did not rely so heavily on special effects [though it was full of them] and therein lies part of the difference. "Independence Day" also had a unique chemistry that seemed to give it a connection to 50's-style, alien-invader flicks, thereby cultivating an affinity from those fans --including me.<br /><br />After all, does "Superman" [the "good alien invader"] need to be believable? More importantly - -<br />DOES SUPERMAN NEED TO BE GOOD SCIENCE TO BELIEVE IN HIM ON FILM?<br /><br />Of course, the science is ridiculous in almost all of these speculative fiction flicks. Remember this is Hollywood film fiction and this fictional account is not "Gone With The Wind". On the other hand, I found "THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW" to be so much more watchable than "Men In Black" which suffered from an excess of humourous, flashy, fanciful, madcap, silly, glib and goofy moods to be watchable for me.<br /><br />This film appears to be trying at least to make a go of it. By that I mean making the unbelievable less, well, unbelievable. Dennis Quaid as a scientist-husband-father does well to keep us connected emotionally to the horrific events lending some much needed empathy to this spectacle. Ian Holm as the Brittish scientist is, well, Ian Holm; which is to say he always turns in a top-notch performance and his sequences are much needed in making the most unscientific theories work well enough to partially suspend our disbelief -- hopefully for at least 123 minutes.<br /><br />Going against the film is the obvious post-9/11 sentiment, making the destruction of American cities, shown principally to American audiences, somewhat worse than politically incorrect. To some people it may have seemed like rape victims watching a rape story movie, very sordid, but I did not realize that until I heard it from other people. Perhaps because I did not see the film until over 3 years after 9/11? If that is the case, the destruction of cities may be less offensive if you are NOW seeing the film for the first time, but that is just speculation.<br /><br />THE DVD & FEATURES<br /><br />Despite its inherent flaws, it plays somewhat interestingly, especially in this widescreen format. You can play it in "English", Spanish", and French" and there are subtitles available in English or Spanish. If you want the "DTS Surround Sound" this is available in English only. There are also some neat features like 2 separate commentary tracks and an hour-long featurette ["the making of"]. Of course there is the scene-selector feature and there are enough scenes that you won't have trouble getting to where you wish to go. There are also "deleted scenes" and an "audio anatomy-interactive sound demo". The sound and video quality are great, which is as it should be on a new, high-budget release. Recently, this DVD has been heavily discounted and is now available widely for about half the original price, or about $10.00.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>As usual, someone needed a vehicle for some special effects.  Hence this silly pieace of nonsense.  We are asked to believe that certain weather conditions cause instant havoc on the planet.  Twisters, snow, rain, floods, and yes, let's not forget the instant ice age.<br /><br />In the film, a news crew flying in a helicopter reports on the twisters that are popping up all over town.  Mind you, there flying amidst the twisters instead of wathing them from a safe distance away.  Not even storm chasers would do something so looney.<br /><br />Dennis Qaid gives the finest performance a piece of driftwood can give.  Emotionless and expressionless is what I would call him here.  He's got all the excitement of a hangnail.  Of course he's the smartest man on the planet but the President of the United States doesn't listen to him.<br /><br />This is your usual, my dad never spends time with me, I'm a teenager feeling sorry for myself, I'm so misunderstood, I don't have any friends, oh no my kid's in trouble I've got to rescue him because I can do what no other man in the world can do becasue I'm so brave story, (yawn).<br /><br />Of course at the end we get the "we better take care of the planet or else" speech.  Borrrrring!<br /><br />If it's sleep you want go get some sleep aids.  This thing isn't even good at putting you to sleep because it's just so darn annoying.  Run, do not walk, away from this movie.<br /><br />GOOD GRIEF!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I am a fan of Roland Emmerich's films. This one is almost as good as Independence Day! I saw this in the theaters, and when it came to DVD I snatched it right away.<br /><br />This movie is full of great action/disaster scenes. It also has a surprisingly good score by Harold Klauser, "a composer who is not that well known." I am used to hearing David Arnold scores on Emmerich's movies, but Klauser has proven himself to be a worthy oppenent. Also, Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job portraying the scientists who nobody believes. In fact, all the actors do a splendid job!<br /><br />A must see for action lovers!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I finally decided to do it. After much deliberation, I've finally decided to review Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow". I must admit I liked his work on "Independence Day". The special effects in that movie achieved the loftiest of heights, creating a truly mesmerizing experience that entertained even though the whole thing suffered under a slew of plot holes the size of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Emmerich decided to indulge his appetite for left-wing politics with "The Day After Tomorrow". The subject? Global warming, of course! It's the new religion for millions of idiots with sad lives who have nothing better to do with their time. I think the whole global warming phenomenon is a bunch of bunk, a pseudo-scientific con job bolstered with shoddy "facts" that appeals to the media due to its lurid, sensationalistic potentialities. This film does absolutely nothing to advance the idea of global warming. In fact, it probably hurts the cause in ways unanticipated by the director. Oh well. No global warming induced sweat off my brow. Of course, none of this means I wouldn't watch the film. I'll always give a mindless action flick a go, even when said flick reeks of far left-wing pabulum.<br /><br />I initially wept over the appearance of Dennis Quaid in the role of main character Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist (say that five times real fast) deeply concerned about warning signals he's receiving from Mother Nature. Then I decided to forgive him and just watch the movie. Hall claims that computers tell him that a new Ice Age is coming down the pike. He tries to warn people at some conference, but laughter essentially ushers him right out of the room. In films, laughing at leftists means disaster in the near future. And sure enough, weird stuff starts happening. Like what? Oh, the usual. Snow in warm climates, heavy winds knocking planes out of the sky, killer tornadoes wiping out Los Angeles, a tidal wave and freezing temperatures engulfing New York City, England icing over, massive super storms sending temperatures plunging in the northern half of the globe. Like I said, the usual. The special effects showing the disasters unfolding are pretty cool. I liked the reporter in L.A. dying horribly as a result of the tornadoes destructive power. I hope he believed in global warming. The New York scenes work well too, especially the tanker floating through the city streets. Pity about England, though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough talk about the effects. Emmerich, having heard something about "characters" and "a story" somewhere in his career, tries to pull at our heartstrings with myriad plot lines both big and small. For example, Jack Hall's precocious kid Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) just happened to head to the Big Apple before the weather took a turn for the worse. He'll spend most of his time trying to get fellow student Laura (Emmy Rossum) to warm up to him (pun intended) during the time they seek shelter in the New York City library. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward), a doctor by trade, spends her time weathering the disaster by taking care of a terminally ill cancer patient. Ian Holm shows up as a Scottish meteorologist long enough to turn the lights out in England. As for Jack, he foregoes helping the United States survive the storm in order to take a nice trek up to New York in order to save his estranged son. How heroic! How stupid! All sorts of threatening situations unfold, usually laughably, before this two-hour piece of propaganda shudders to a stop.  The conclusion plays around with the irony of Americans having to head to Mexico in order to survive the disaster. Awww. Ain't that a kick in the head!<br /><br />A laugh a minute, this "The Day After Tomorrow". It's less a film and more a collection of jaw dropping inconsistencies, cackhanded dialogue, and shock and awe special effects. I won't kid around about the effects--they're awesome and superbly rendered. The unfolding calamity is the only reason to watch the movie. The rest of what we see onscreen is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks. Are we really supposed to believe these super storms, the size of continents, could form this quickly? And why isn't the southern hemisphere affected in some way? How can the temperature drop to at least minus 150 degrees yet we see characters ambling around outside? How can you drive and walk from Washington, D.C. to New York City in these conditions, and do it in a matter of a few days? The answer to all these niggling questions, and others, is simply this: it's in the script. The almighty script trumps all manner of problematic plot holes. Maybe we should use copies of the script to plug the hole in the ozone layer, or provide shade for our rapidly warming planet. You got a better idea?<br /><br />If you're willing to turn your brain off before starting the DVD player, you'll probably make it through "The Day After Tomorrow" relatively unscathed. If you don't turn your brain off before watching, though, you risk serious and irreparable damage on such a scale that you'll resemble Al Gore for the rest of your life. Extras on the disc include a couple of commentaries from Emmerich and assorted personnel, a couple of deleted scenes that add nothing to the monstrosity we just watched, a sound demo, and a DVD-ROM featurette that I didn't bother to investigate. Not much for a "blockbuster," but I see a double disc release has also come out. If you really like the film, pick that up instead. Lastly, an aside: Sela Ward is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her presence in the film eased some of the pain I felt from watching such a huge piece of misinformation. I'm ecstatic that she survived the film and went back to her career in television. Call me, Sela!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Roland Emmerich has done it again.  He's found another way of destroying major cities on the big screen.  This time around, it isn't a giant lizard or aliens, though.  This time, it's Big Momma Nature.  I caught this one in the cinema, and I'm sure that it has a better payoff there than on the TV.  It's still worth a look though.<br /><br />The premise of the story is a little wild, but all in all this is just another disaster flick.  There's no moral to this story(unless you're a tree-hugger who took this film to be a warning on mankind's affect on the environment).  Nope, nothing here but lots of things freezing up, Americans crossing over into Mexico, twisters in La-La land, and a really quick trip from Philly to NYC.  But everything looks pretty cool while all of this is happening.<br /><br />The film, if taken as nothing more than a reason to show off some neat special effects, is pretty good.  It does drag along somewhat, but let's face it, freezing things isn't as cool as watching them blow up.  The tornado scenes were some of the best bits of this flick, though they make a rather quick exit.  I also enjoyed the scenes involving the wolfpack(though they looked pretty fake).  The acting is standard and there's nothing really "great" about this picture.  But, as stated before, this flick is all about spectacle and light on story.  Nothing wrong with that, right?<br /><br />On the other hand, if you do consider this an environmental warning, WAKE UP!  This is nothing more than popcorn fun, and it suffices.<br /><br />There are better end o' the world movies out there, but this one won't let you down.  It's okay, but you might want to rent it on DVD before you lay down hard cash for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>There has perhaps been no other film that has the quality of special effects as seen in "The Day After Tomorrow".  The vision of tornados venting destruction upon Los Angeles or monumental floods seeping across New York City are truly spectacular.  Few will forget the scene of a cargo ship floating aimlessly down a flooded Manhattan street until it is stopped below the surface by the debris of wrecked cars and buses.<p> Yet films cannot rely upon special effects alone.  Indeed, it is on this point that the film fails.  The plot is flimsy at best.  The "facts" are so implausible as to be ridiculous.  It would take a particularly gullible mind to accept that the world's climate can change to a monumental degree in just a few days.  However, it is this line that the film's makers want us to believe!<p>I must state now that I am no greenie so there may be some who claim my views are jaundiced.  Be this at may, the film's undertone is very preachy.  If only we stopped using cars and so forth and the world could be saved.  Oh really!  Take a reality check!<p>In spite of my criticisms, the film is worth seeing...but only just.  Special effects can only take a film so far.  At some point, plot and acting ability must raise its head.  Unfortunately, this film never quite reaches that point.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>All I can say about this movie is if you want to test out how good your home theater system is and show off for you friends and neighbors,this film will do it.However,if you looking for a film with just the slightest bit of substance, it falls far short.<br /><br /> This one goes up amongst the worst of the 2004 summer films,and with the many other horribly made "BIG BUDGET" Hollywood films.The plot was your basic formula-one Hollywood disaster film.The were so many CGI effects in this movie,nothing seemed or looked real.The only time I was at least excited about this movie was when multiple tornados were ripping though Los Angeles destroying it.<br /><br /> The storyline was beyond pathetic.Weather scientist/super genius work-A-holic dad who neglecs genius like teenage son who in turn goes through cliche-like growing pains.Pararents are cluesless to family problems,horible catastrophic events are predicted by genius father,and he gets a big,"I told ya so" throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br /> Then there is the world wide spread panic&everyone running around like their heads got chopped.The storyline has to throw in the teenage love interest,he nearly dies,and girl of his dreams saves him,then she nearly dies&teenage boys risk life&limb to save her.Father risks himself&puts himself in harms way to save son&find would be surviors.The cliches are endless,and the badly written script,not only makes what good actors there were in this film look bad,you are guaranteed to drop a few I.Q points just watching this movie.<br /><br /> Ebert&Roeper plastered their "Thumbs Up" approval on the front cover of this film.My question is,where where they cramming their thumbs?I swear Ebert's review skills have depleted next to zero since the untimely departure of Gene Siskle.Roger Ebert,its time to retire,and Roeper...you need your head examined,and you need a different job,because you suck at the one have now.If you have any brains,you will not buy this dvd,or vhs...renting it is a big enough insult.If you paid money to see this film in the theater this summer,I can only take pitty&feel sorrry for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>On reflection, I suppose it's unsurprising that America should turn the environmental disaster it's almost single-handedly creating into a banal piece of summer entertainment for us all to watch in over air-conditioned theatres.

Setting aside, too, the insulting "science" served up in this nonsensical faux-green potboiler, I could almost forgive Roland Emmerich for all of it if he'd made something that was even half-way entertaining.  Instead, he just does what he's best at - the wholesale destruction of American cities is yet again presented in lovingly rendered mind-blowing CGI.  And he does what he's worst at, too - attempts to tell a story.  This time, a fatuous family-values plot is grafted onto the three or four effects-intensive set pieces with all the seamless realism of your average Californian D-cup implant.  The result is a diabolically inept monstrosity of a film which lumbers from jaw-dropping visuals to lame attempts at tear-jerking with metronomic regularity.  Forty minutes in, I wanted everyone to die - including me.  I feel sorry for Gyllenhaal, Quaid and especially Ian Holm - three exceptionally talented actors.  The gravitas Holm brings to the few scenes he's in only demonstrates the banality of the rest of them.  Last year's "28 Days Later" was hardly a masterpiece, but it was vastly better than this.  Why?  Because it actually had something to say about mankind and the types of thinking and behaviour that might cause our destruction.  Emmerich's film says nothing.  That's no crime, but it's the lost opportunity I really resent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Despite some of the negative comments, this is well worth seeing for the awesome special effects alone. I wish the armchair critics would stop trying to analyze the "logic" behind this project and sit back and enjoy a good blockbuster thrill ride, which is obviously the aim of director Roland Emmerich. It's not meant to be a serious documentary about global warming. Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.<br /><br />My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.<br /><br />Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize that scientifically, it's all in the realm of creative imagination rather than fact.<br /><br />The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the thrill ride!! Yeah, baby, it's cold outside!!</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>That's the only way to enjoy this mess. Thw worst thing in this kind of disaster flick is that the producers try to give reasonable scientific background to explain all the absurds that happens in the film! That's annoying! Dennis Quaid's character would never get to New York.... And what abou that stupid "RACE AGAINST THE COLD"? Never saw something like that, it was so stupid that I must give credit to the producers. I laughed a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Okay, nitpickers.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a slam-bang, special effects laden what if movie.  And on those merits, it's a darned effective movie.  When you rented or bought this movie, what exactly were you looking for?  If you want realistic, true to life stuff, go to the Discovery or Weather Channel.  This is fiction, people, and I for one didn't buy it to see any extraordinary acting or plotline.  I wanted to see the effects...hail as big as grapefruits; tornadoes ravaging Los Angeles; New York flooding and freezing.  That's why I bought this movie and was not the least bit disappointed.  Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, Dash Mihok, Kenneth Welsh, Jake Glyenhaal, Emmy Rossum...they all did fine, because they knew the audience would root for them no matter how ridiculous their dialogue was.<br /><br />So sit back, eat some popcorn and just marvel at these state of the art effects in the best disaster movie in years!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>It's a Popcorn film. It's big, it's blustery, and it's a way to while away some time with some great "gosh-golly-gee-whiz" views and FX.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Holm, his performance, as well as various others were typically excellent.<br />I absolutely love the Cheney clone, and the dig at the view about the "Kyoto" accord. But if the best that people who claim to be conservatives can say is that it is "liberal rubbish" ... what I want to know is ... Why do you watch this material ??<br />If you have a surround sound system, crank up the levels, and this DVD is absolutely great. An absolutely superb ride.<br /><br />Worth every penny ( Especially at Wally Worlds Prices :-)<br /><br />AFTER SEEING ALL THE MATERIAL  AGAIN:<br /><br />How anyone could approach this film as a "message"  film is beyond me.<br />The Special  effects are brilliant, and work superbly. And eveything works around the FX. The commentarys do a brilliant job of illuminating how this work came together, and whilst there are elements of a "message", it is so hidden, as to be irrelevant. There are even notional political elements, but once again, if you watch this movie for some sort of political pot shots, you should really go in for analysis. Its pure ( or, "impure") entertainment, and thats where it excels  better than most disaster type films that Roland  Emmerich  does. Its not that the Emmerich family can't do decent pieces which have some depth ( FREQUENCY for example), it's just that when a film is done on this scale, they obviously want to make a BIG lot of dollars, so its lowest common denominator time, and its a  rare  film that can do both message, and mega-dollar  deals. This is another of the grand popcorn films. There are sequences in this film that are just eye popping in visual stuns, but if you want illumination about what the world of humans is doing to the planet, search elsewhere... this is a vacation from reality, not a reality tour-de-force.<br />Anyway, its Damn fine fun, and brilliant at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>The buzz around this film when it hit the big screen was awesome special effects. That was not enough for me to head to the theatre. I waited and rented the DVD instead. I really didn't see any reviews before I watched it, so I did not know what to expect.<br /><br />Well, the special effects did not disappoint, but they were not enough to carry this movie into the blockbuster area and my DVD collection. In this technology age, there are plenty of movies with special effects accessibility. But budgets can cut into the writer's script research. Special effects should enhance the believability of a movie script.  It should not try to carry a movie.  The movie must have at least a good plot. The Day After Tomorrow disappointed me in this must do area. Can we believe that global warming will dive us into the ice age within a week? (Days) Is an instant freeze within a hurricane like storm that rotates and then dissipates into nothing possible? Would this only affect North America?  This movie does nothing to answer any scientific questions. There are so many loopholes in this movie it could become a trivia question on How not to write a movie script. Can you count them?<br /><br />This movie's budget is all special effects.  If you want to see Los Angeles/Hollywood sign destroyed on purpose by tornadoes and New York in a hell freeze rent this DVD. I think there is a hidden message behind those chosen cities. Does Roland Emmerich hate the Hollywood scene? Or that New Yorkers are cold! Maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This film has alot of good special effects but the dumb plot seems like an afterthought. The whole story centers around global warming triggering a new Ice Age. There are scenes where people are instantly frozen to death, tornados and hurricans flooding and tearing up cities.<br /><br />The movie fails to depict the true ramifications of such a climate upheaval: Society would end and a new "Dark Age" would ensue. Billions of people would die, not just from the weather but from starvation and the wars that would follow. The movie softballs the whole story, especially the subplot about the father who travels through the tundra on foot to rescue his son (simply ridiculous).<br /><br />Just like Independence Day, the movie works if you don't think too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>For me, "The Day After Tomorrow", a doomsday epic about the sudden onset of a new Ice Age in the present day, is a disappointment from writer/director Roland Emmerich. His 1994 sci-fi epic, "Stargate" is one of my favorite flicks in that genre. His 1996 effort, "Independence Day" is immensely entertaining.<br /><br />The special effects in "The Day After Tomorrow" rival [and sometimes outdo] Emmerich's previous efforts. The problems are in the story. "Stargate" and "Independence Day" were both about mankind's doing battle with alien beings. Since the vast majority of us have never met an alien being, the logic of stories of such encounters is acceptable. What proof do we have to the contrary? The adversary in "Tomorrow" is Mother Nature, a force we are all familiar with. Suddenly, she has decided to unleash her full fury on us. Unlike alien invasions, though, we are all aware of Nature's wrath, albeit on a smaller scale.<br /><br />As the movie moves a long, the scenario gets less and less plausible. For example, the movie blames our leaders for ignoring global warming [a position that is likely true], thus igniting a sudden Ice Age, yet fails to resolve why this event has occurred countless times in the past, with no human intervention.<br /><br />The other problem with the script is that Emmerich seems to have lost his tongue-in-cheek humor. "Tomorrow" is relentlessly earnest. This is essentially the story of a dour-faced father [Dennis Quaid] determined to rescue his equally sullen son [Jake Gyllenhaal], who is trapped in a super-blizzard of epic proportions in New York City. The triumph of love over adversity is a time-honored one in movies, but here it plays out as hollow and predictable, as well as a bit boring.<br /><br />The movie is another example of modern special effects playing a disproportionate role. Early in the movie, Los Angeles is devastated by a hurricane that spawns a series of devastating tornadoes. Visually, this is by far the movie's best segment. The story never once returns to this catastrophe, instead concentrating only on the New York story. So, why was the LA portion even in the movie? Because highly sophisticated computer special effects deemed that it could be?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Day After Tomorrow brings to the screen the likely scenario that the planet can no longer take the punishment inflicted on it by mankind and begins going through a process of rapid climatic changes, which threatens life on Earth.  The likelihood of such a phenomenon is presently great indeed and hopefully the film will get many people thinking.<br /><br />The movie has very good special effects i.e. very realistic, and a much needed message of the dangers of the Green House Effect.<br /><br />My only reservation is in relation to the plot, and specifically in relation to the "duty bound" mother/doctor and her unrealistic "devotion" to her patient at a time when the world is falling apart while her husband and son are out of reach (Has she no parents of her own/brothers-sisters?).  In addition, the top scientist/father (Dennis Quaid) with access to the high-ups in the White House and contacts across the world, drops everything in an instant and begins a trek walking from DC to NYC in search of his son...  (Has he no parents of his own/brothers-sisters?)  Moreover, people like that are usually kept under guard for "National Security" reasons, especially at a time when their services are of outmost importance to their country.  So it's plot-wise that I believe that there are some weaknesses.<br /><br />As a result, I am going to agree with a previous reviewer and quote him by saying "Good Effects, Bad Plot!"  It is a very good movie, it's an eye opener, definitely moving, and worth watching.<br /><br />In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality, entertainment and messages it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for the weakness in the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much going in (Emmerich Film!), but I at least expected to be entertained and entranced by the special effects. In truth, all the SFX you see on the previews are what you see when watching the movie. The only difference being you have to sit through a long....two hours of horrendously written mumbo-jumbo talk and bad acting (people in the theater were actually laughing at the actors everytime they said something stupid, which was practically in every scene). The only reason for two stars is that the effects are pretty good and look epic on the big screen. If I were you I would wait to rent this on Dvd. I'm not usually harsh on movies and rarely give them lower than three stars, but this no-brain stinker deserves it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>The Day After Tomorrow should be seen on the large screen.  The special effects are utterly fantastic.  It was fun to watch Los Angeles destroyed by tornados and New York City covered by freezing ice.  Director Roland Emmerich, however, should have picked a script with better dialogue.  Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum and Sela Ward are provided lines so lame that I sensed they barely uttered them with a straight face.  These people are supposedly suffering from hunger and the pain of losing loved ones.  They always, though, appear well fed and fairly cheerful.  What about having to go to the toilet?  Sanitation concerns are ignored. A vending machine containing snacks is left untouched until the main characters think of breaking into it.  Is everybody else seeking shelter in the huge library a complete idiot?  As a global warming propaganda vehicle, this film fails miserably.  I totally forgot The Day After Tomorrow's political message.  The story line is too ridiculous to be effective. Escapist movies still have to be somewhat logical.  Emmerich seems so preoccupied with the weather disasters that he barely had time for anything else.  Perhaps he should have focussed on these scenes and allowed someone else to direct the rest of the movie?  Did his ego get in the way?  Why didn't anyone say something?  Couldn't the producer sense that something was wrong?</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>The plot is implausible and ridiculous.  The dialogue is laughably bad.  The characters are clich&eacute;d and hollow.  Environmentalist preaching is conspicuously and annoyingly included.  Yes, this is all true.  And you know what?  I DIDN'T CARE!  All you have to do is sit back and RELAX to enjoy Roland Emmerich's rip-roaringly fun and exciting "The Day After Tomorrow".<p>The "genius" of this film is its ability to draw the audience into the story and make you feel as if you are there and that all of this chaos is actually occurring right outside the movie theater.  Now, of course, in a utopian society people wouldn't enjoy watching disaster and destruction to such a great extent, but we humans have an odd fascination with disaster and therefore this film satisfies our craving.  <p>"The Day After Tomorrow" also has an uncanny ability to convince us (at least up until we leave the theater) that this whole scenario is plausible and scientifically justified (Dennis Quaid's scientist character gives several convincing, if not preachy, global warming speeches).  Upon leaving the theater, you do reflect back on the film and realize how ludicrous the scientific reasoning is, but it does manage to convince you temporarily and add to the realism and level of audience involvement throughout.<p>The dynamite cast of Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal (yum!), Ian Holm, Sela Ward, and Emmy Rossum do a spectacular job.  Though they are often forced to utter some of the most outlandish dialogue I've heard in ages, they do manage to retain their dignity and credibility as actors.<p>"The Day After Tomorrow" is a fantastically entertaining and engaging film; the perfect summer blockbuster, that delivers the goods as long as you don't take it too seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>There is nothing specific about this movie that is particularly bad.  The story line okay.  The acting is not necessarily Oscar material, but nonetheless is fair.  The special effects of the flooding and freezing of New York City is pretty spectacular.<br /><br />My only quibble in terms of belivability is that in spite of cold temperatures there is no breath visible -- which given the amount of money that was spent on the special effects is an unacceptable oversight -- could have easily been done with digital post processing.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>True, the story line is a bit far fetched, the movie dove into the plot with confusing speed, and some things (such as the wolves) were predictable . . . Still I liked it.  "The Day After Tomorrow" passed my prime tests for a film even if it doesn't stand up well as a social statement.  Then again, I wasn't in the mood for a social statement when I watched it.<br /><br />Test #1  It kept me glued to my seat.  The action came with enough speed that I didn't want to slip out for popcorn for fear I would miss something.  I wasn't watching my clock, and when the movie was over I didn't feel as if I'd wasted the evening.<br /><br />Test #2  Although much of it was a formula film, just enough was different that I didn't feel like I was watching a remake of something I've already seen before.<br /><br />Test #3  The next day I would have been willing to watch it again with another member of my family.<br /><br />Test #4  I could actually imagine someone adding it to their DVD collection.<br /><br />So what if it doesn't seem realistic (like most of Hollywood makes sense???).

We pillage and plunder our planet's natural resources, carelessly and indignantly burn our fossil fuels, and throw caution to the wind for our wanton irresponsiblity.  <p>Well, to coin a classic phrase, "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."  And she's one broad you don't dare want to mess with, as the disaster-laden THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW attests.  In a movie that must have environmentalists and tree huggers worldwide grinning from pierced ear to pierced ear, we humans are forced at last to atone for the sin of global warming--a sin that melts the polar caps and brings on another Ice Age (in about the time it takes to play a baseball game). <p>Forget the plot.  It's worse than bad--it's trite, banal, hackneyed, threadbare, and worn-out all rolled into one.  Dennis Quaid is the climatologist who predicts doom but is subsequently ignored by his greedy government; he also has a son who ends up trapped in New York.  The beautiful Sela Ward plays the standard this-disaster-epic-must-have-a-female-lead-who-spends-her-time-wringing-her-hands-and-looking-worried-and-then-cries part.  Ian Holm, for goodness sake, is Bilbo Baggins, not some Scottish scientist about to go into the deep freeze, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Quaid's and Ward's son, has a constant smirk on his face that I could never figure out.<p>As I said, forget the plot.  This movie's strength is its visual onslaught of destruction and disaster on a global scale--from tornadoes ravaging Los Angeles (Why do LA TV reporters feel compelled to cover a twister a stone's throw away on live TV?) to three cataclysmic "blizzard hurricanes" that devour the Northern Hemisphere.  The special effects are well-done, and jarring; seeing a huge tidal wave overtake the Statue of Liberty and then sweep relentlessly into Manhattan (Why didn't Brooklyn and Queens get equal time?) is bone-chilling.  Throw in a pack of hungry wolves escaped from the zoo and an eye of each storm that plunges the temperature minus 150 degrees in a matter of seconds, and you've got a virtual kitchen sink of gloom and doom.  Our fearless government reluctantly acts; in a huge twist of irony, the U.S. is evacuated, with its citizens streaming into Mexico, and the northern states take on a popsicle effect.  It's all great fun to watch.<p>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW succeeds on the visual, and fails dismally on everything else.  Now I've got to go get my twelve-pack out of the freezer.

This wasn't meant to be taken as a great docu-drama, go see An Inconvienent Truth.  This was made to be a silly, fun, popcorn type movie.<br /><br />Watch this and take it for what it is.  It sucks when people break down movies that are just supposed to be fun.  No plot is right.  But I had a  helluva good time!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW has widely been ridiculed as one of the silliest movies of recent years and was the recipient of utterly awful reviews when it was released.  Having heard all of this, I was hardly tempted to watch it for some time.  But recently I was in the mood for a disaster movie, and having recently watched the Val Guest British classic THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE, I was interested in seeing it destroyed by ice as well.  Although this is one of the most thoroughly panned films of recent years by critics, I thought it was, in fact, a very entertaining film.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is silly.  Rather, it is impossible precisely as presented.  I am not an authority on the subject, but I have read that the central scenario is not impossible, but that it would take place over a much longer time frame than seen in the film.  An ecological disaster is not impossible, but it won't occur in a week.<br /><br />The film has a decent cast, but honestly, who cares?  A film like this is not driven by the cast but by the special effects.  The effects found in this film are among the most memorable one will find, with one exception.  The exception is the CGI for the wolves that attack Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends.  They look absurdly artificial and computer generated, which is made worse by the fact that so many other things in the movie look so great.  There is a great deal of silliness:  the ship that floats up Fifth Avenue and comes to a halt in front of the New York Public Library.  It is absolutely impossible to plot a feasible path for a ship to take to reach the library.<br /><br />Still, once one gets past the silliness, the film is unquestionably quite entertaining.  The tornadoes hitting Los Angeles are amazingly well done and fun to watch while one scene after another is a delight to watch.  We all enjoy movies in which the world comes to an end or at least comes to an end as we know it.  As a kid I loved reading J. G. Ballard's novels that imaginatively bring the world to a close in one way or another, whether by wind, drought, or water.<br /><br />Unless you are completely unable to get past an initial absurd premise, I definitely thing most people will enjoy this.  Besides, much has occurred the past two years to make the idea of ecological disaster more plausible.  Numerous books detailing global warming have appeared, an official in the Bush administration has finally acknowledged that global warming is real, there have been numerous fractures in the Religious Right over global warming, and even Pat Robertson has stated that he was wrong on global warming and now acknowledges that it is caused by humans and requires that we dramatically reduce greenhouse emissions.  And Al Gore released his superb documentary.  So while we won't get any ecological disasters precisely as found in this film, it isn't as unthinkable as it used to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>Yeah right.  Global warming causes a modern Ice Age.  Come again?  Oh, well, forget the science.  (After all, this movie does.)  I can never get enough of watching New York City and other urban blights get destroyed and this flick has great special effects.  I loved the shots of the superhurricanes from the space station.  The escaped wolves prowling the streets of The Big Apple were a nice touch too.  Ice Age here we come!<br /><br />I cannot believe how bad the acting and dialog is in this one.  Dennis Quaid is a good actor, but I guess his Yacht payment was due the month he made this film; nothing else explains why he would agree to star in a turkey like this.<br /><br />This is a flimsy, politically correct end of the world flick.  To the limited extent it is worth seeing, watch it for the special effects.  I don't know but that this flick would be a better viewing experience with the sound turned off.  The cheesy dialog is nothing but a distraction anyway.<br /><br />Two stars because I was able to watch it to the end, but just barely.  Just barely.  By the way, the end of this one is so awful as to make one want to gag.  Geez, I am a tree hugger myself, but here the politics are so in-your-face as to defy belief.  Awful, just awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>The end of the world is upon us again and this time its The Day After Tomorrow which plunges the world with fierce tornadoes, basketball sized hail, a tsunami of water hitting New York and also the air gets so cold everything it touches it freezes to death. Always in movies like these there is gonna be a scientist whose gonna give some sort of speech about the world being in peril and the government laughs at him saying " oh it isnt gonna happen" and then the next minute you know that guy is being impaled by a bus. This movie has different parts of the world being plunged into the end of the world and one city is New York where there is trapped son of Dennis Quaid (Frequency, upcoming Flight Of The Pheonix), Jake Gyllenhaal (Highway, October Sky) and soon after Quaid talks to his son about whats going on, he and 2 other guys, Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thin Red Line) and Jay O. Sanders (Kiss The Girls, Daylight) rush out to go and save his son and the people trapped inside the library. Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal is trying to survive with the others till his dad comes. A movie like this should of been way more better and way more, just, awesome. Only some of the disaster scenes (examples being tidal wave scene, city being frozen scenes and the flock of birds scene) are pretty cool but Dennis Quaid cant quite save this, only Gyllenhaal rises above material. It would be scary to think this would happen in real life but on the big screen it isnt that scary or interesting. Glenn Plummer (Speed, The Salton Sea) is wasted playing a homeless man and Ian Holm (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The 5th Element) as an old scientist. Also starring Emmy Russum (Mystic River, The Phantom Of The Opera), Sela Ward (The Fugitive), Nestor Serrano (Bringing Out The Dead, The Negotiator), Adrian Lester (Primary Colors), Austin Nichols and Arjay Smith.

There are more than 150 movies released in HK per year, and this one was the # 1 at the box office for the entire year! Isn't that something! People must be starving on special effects and anorexic of good storyline. I gave 1 star for this movie, and the other star is for Jake Gyllenhaal for having the courage to do a career-suicide movie. I mean I totally loved him in The Good Girl(Jennifer Aniston), and I am stunned that he did this movie. It's got more special effects than human characters. Even Dennis Quaid is in It! I mean he just did his career revival Far From Heaven less than 2 year ago, and now he adds this to his resume. It's as bad as Twister, and not as good as Deep Impact or Ammagedon. After some 20 minutes of seeing the disaster on earth, the story and the special effects started to go downhill. This is probably last year's Battlefield Earth, but it didn't lose any money. I am glad I just rented it, and not bought it or paid a regular admission at the cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Global warming, that old chestnut that divides not just scientists but the world in general, is often discussed in the media and we still have no definitive answer on the threat it poses. On the big screen the disastrous (couldn't think of a better word) Waterworld (1995) and Al Gore's enthralling but frightening An Inconvenient Truth (2006) both depicted the suggested consequences of global warming. Okay, Waterworld was very loosely tapping into the scientific zeitgeist by having the ice caps melting and flooding the world, but An Inconvenient Truth laid the argument bare and put forward evidence that global warming is a very real and significant threat. Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow is in a similar vein, throwing the world into turmoil and giving us an insight into where this contentious `global warming' may lead us and our descendants.<br /><br />The film begins with paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) drilling for ice samples on the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Suddenly, the entire shelf breaks from the rest of the continent leaving Jack to conclude that global warming is to blame and through further research he predicts calamity for the world in 100-1000 years unless steps are taken to minimise damage to the earth. Jack's prediction proves to be correct but the only problem is the timescale he has suggested, with multiple disasters occurring worldwide within days rather than centuries! While the impact of global warming is felt throughout the world it is the northern hemisphere that faces the biggest threat in the form of an approaching Ice Age! Jack has the added problem of his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is in New York and directly in the firing line of Mother Nature.<br /><br />A film of this type will always put more emphasis on the visuals than anything else and in this respect it doesn't disappoint. Personally, I do believe global warming is real and a threat to the planet so it was quite frightening to see giant hailstone hitting Japan, freezing conditions grounding helicopters and turning pilots to ice in seconds, Los Angeles devastated by multiple tornadoes, while the Statue of Liberty is firstly engulfed by the rising ocean which then pours relentlessly into the heart of New York. If tornadoes and rising water levels aren't bad enough the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere face blizzard super storms causing plunging temperatures and manifesting themselves as all-conquering snow and ice. At one stage those temperatures plummet to -150F when the eye of the storm passes over New York. Anyone outside is instantly frozen while the cold pours into buildings in the form of rivers of ice that traverse floors and walls as if they are flowing water! It's a terrifying spectacle watching Mother Nature run riot and an important reminder that mankind are not the most powerful force in the world, no matter how much we try and convince ourselves otherwise.<br /><br />Though depicting a worldwide disaster the film is in essence about father and son, Jack and Sam, who have a fragile relationship at the outset but are both instrumental in helping many during the global crisis. After Jack has spent most of his time trying to convince the US government about what is going to unfold, he sets off on a journey through the snow to rescue his son. In New York Sam is attending an academic competition with student friends, including love interest Laura (Emmy Rossum), and takes heed of his father's warnings by having survivors of the flood hit city hide out in the New York Library. Many eventually leave and take their chances in the snow but Sam persuades a small group to stay behind or face death in the plunging temperatures outside. Aside from a brief foray outdoors for medical supplies, Sam's biggest test is keeping everyone alive and warm in the library, emptying vending machines and burning pointless books - a collection to do with taxes for instance, which I had to salute. While Jack and Sam continue their individual struggles for survival the rest of those in the northern hemisphere are forced to turn south in search of sanctuary. I was amused by the Americans forcing their way into Mexico by smashing the fences along the border whereas previously the Mexicans had faced stringent rules if they ever wished to head north. There's a spot of irony in there somewhere.<br /><br />Acting-wise I wasn't astonished by any of the cast but that's not saying anyone was awful either. A film on this scale is always going to draw the audience towards the visuals rather than the characters and acting, but that is often what makes a huge box office hit and it did this film no harm. I didn't feel many of the characters had much depth to them and the central storyline of a father and son building bridges amidst a global disaster is one with an outcome that is easy to predict. That said, the film doesn't resort to a typical Hollywood ending by having some scientist flick a switch and all is well. Though a global disaster, the northern hemisphere is the area of most concern here, whereas many other parts of the world are untouched by any calamity. A future remains for much of the population but for many it is a fierce struggle for survival from which millions perish.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow is a decent depiction of the kind of disasters that Mother Nature can deliver with mankind's defences powerless in offering any opposition. While the characters were not particularly engaging I still found myself interested in the eventual outcome and was pleased I didn't get a clich&eacute; Hollywood ending where all is well again and that global disaster was a minor inconvenience. The disaster in this film is a devastating one and still leaves mankind in a precarious position as they face an unknown future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>It start off with a scientist drilling in Alaska. Then we go to a press conference in England. The plot unfolds as storms start hitting the entire surface of Earth. We watch it as it turns colder and colder until it suddenly goes into a new ice age.<br /><br />I love seeing New York city under water it was great special effects when the sea turn into a giant wave it got taller then the Statue of Liberty people start running which was so go about this movie cause it was like Hurrican Katrina distroyed New Orleans.<br /><br />What didn't make since to me was a cop in this movie who saw a couple in a Taxi the couple were beating on the window for help but that cop kept on saying "I can't understand what your saying" cause they speak French it's obvious that they wanted to get out cause of the storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>This movie makes you wonder if were heading toward this fiction for real.I could not stop watching this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>We have all heard the warnings to stop destroying our planet and this movie makes us look at just what might happen if we don't listen.  I sat glued to the TV as this movie played before me watching the total destruction of the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards that devoured a good part of the northern world. Seeing New York City destroyed was blood chilling and the human element that was weaved into the storyline brought it right on home.<br /><br />This was a great movie, the special effects were outstanding.  I never saw a building freeze and crumble before. Wow!What a twist on total devastation.

This was just like an "Ice Age" movie, but with a human and his ice cores rather than a squirrel and an acorn.  But it was downhill from there on.  The problem wasn't that I'm a bit skeptical of the whole global warming thing (at least the part where humans did it and humans can fix it) but rather that I found the characters so dull.  Spectacular effects cannot make up for boring characters, at least not for me.  So, I'll be returning this movie to where I rented it from today, not the day after tomorrow.</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>I have beendying to see this film since it came out in the cinema, i never actually sawit in the pictures just in case i couldn't stand it therefore would have to sit through it all. Anyway, i enjoy watching disaster films as they are made brilliantly and it makes you see what happens in real life, and of course there's a lot going on in them like dante's peak. I expected the same in this, it is nothing like i thought it was going to be though now i have had it. I suppose i will get a little bit used to it. Some of the actions in the film are great but others by looking at them you can tell they are computer imaged. Basically it's about tornadoes, a massive tsunmi sort of thing and there's a lot goin on but i didn't particuarlly like the acting in it or anything.

Several actors (Ward, PLummer, Holm, even Quaid)were pretty much wasted. Much of it was predictable. It's very watchable, but do be aware it's definitely cloying/gagging/clicje Hollywood in spots. Sam comes off as a grinning simpleton with occasional flashes of semi-brilliance. The scene of the freighter sailing down Fifth Ave. is engaging. Seriously, more detailed and prolonged destruction scenes would've added a lot. After all, isn't FX what these films are all about?</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>There was a 1983 made-for-tv film called THE DAY AFTER about the nuclear holocaust. The "creative team" behind this current film decided to tack on '...TOMORROW' at the end. Thus, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is the name of the film almost in the same ballpark of humans on the verge of being destroyed by a disaster. The 1983 film, to reiterate, was about a pre and post nuclear attack brought on by other humans.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is about the onset of a new ice age out to destroy mankind which is a natural disaster. Nothing new here except that digital special effects can do anything in spectacular fashion. Therefore it allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and see if the characters of the film and the whole human race in general can survive this catastrophe.  This is a rehash of ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE CORE,DEEP IMPACT, EARTHQUAKE with a slight new twist. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a pure popcorn summer action disaster movie. However, it is not very memorable story wise or character wise and the film will probably leave the viewer feeling empty and cold (no pun intended!). Lastly, the creators could have come out with a more inventive title. It sounds more closely to the recent inane James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) film titles (TOMORROW NEVER DIES, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, DIE ANOTHER DAY ...).</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>For being called a disaster film i expected more disaster.  All that happens is theres a few tornadoes, some water, it gets cold, then everything goes back to normal, o yeah and some people freeze in the process.  Wow i havent seen that before (the core, deep impact, its been done).  Sure its about global warming, but then why is it so damn cold... im not saying it wouldnt be cold, but if it is so cold then why do the wolves last so long out in the blizzard, and the people and buildings feeeze in a second, are the invincible wolves, NO.  The rest of the movie makes sense they did a pretty good job with science and explained what they needed to.  The visuals are good but not oscar worthy, i mean come on what was with those wolves, the hyenas from exorcist the beginning looked realer (and that was a much better overall film too, much better), and all those shots of NY covered in snow and ice looked hand drawn almost, the tidal wave looked the best out of them all, the tornadoes were alright but you only see them for 2 mins.  Overall the film is decent, decent performances (not good) decent, no intense situation of peril (all the disaster stuff takes up like 10 mins of the movie all together, not impressive), the visuals are pretty good, there is too dramatic of a score for the movie because there is no drama, we need more background info on the characters, ID4 and Godzilla are better, Rolands best film is the patriot, its pretty good.  Ill give it a 5 out of a 10 for the attempt at some good mayhem, but it falls alittle short.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>i got my dvd today, and boy was i pleasantly delighted!  a great disaster flick that is wildly entertaining and thought provoking, especially with the current boonies in the white house, who could care less about global warming! the disc is superb looking, as is the dts sound! get it you will be entertained-not disappointed!  it's a winner.........</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is exactly the type of movie I expected it to be. There weren't any major surprises, the acting was decent, and the special effects were big. I was kind of disappointed there weren't a few more natural disasters added into the mix, but other than that things were good.<br /><br />The story revolves around climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who after years of research comes up with a theory about global warming and a possible coming ice age that most other scientists blow off as being too extreme.  However, not long after, Jack's theory seems to be coming true as tornadoes rip through L.A. and softball size hail rains down in Tokyo, Japan. Reports come in that the temperatures of the world's oceans are decreasing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam is off to a scholastic competition in New York. A day or so later, New York gets hit with a tidal wave and then it starts to snow. Jack realizes that New York will soon be at the center of a major deep freeze and he sets forth to rescue his son.<br /><br />The movie play out the way you expect it to play out and other than a few plot holes, is rather enjoyable. As a sidenote, the theory about global warming in the movie seems far-fetched. However, I found it rather fascinating. The film portrays a possible way that tropical climates could become areas of frozen ice and snow in a matter of minutes. In general, modern scientists don't believe it's possible for nature (science) to act so rapidly--after all evolution takes time. That's why the theory in the movie has been thrown off by "real" scientists as having little validity and an impossibility. But what seems most unlikely is sometimes the thing that is most plausible--is there a better explanation about frozen woolly mammoths found in artic areas containing tropical vegetation in their stomachs? Once you set your hands to the plow, there's no turning back.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Yes, this is yet another summer blockbuster disaster flick with an earth-shaking score and some rather amazing visual effects.  This film is director/writer/producer Roland Emmerich's baby, and he does give the film some lavish attention to production.  The story isn't too bad, even if it is absolutely unbelievable that the events that unfold happen all at once.  Roland Emmerich, who's best film is still "Stargate," but is mostly remembered for his mega-plex phenomenon, "Independence Day," very nearly gets extra bases for "The Day After Tomorrow."  However, the acting is wooden; the characters, two-dimensional.  I could actually see myself watching this film again someday on a rainy afternoon, too feverish to care about acting or the story's plausibility; just soaking up the dazzling special effects and trying to ignore the rest.  This is not a bad film, but it will be forgotten by next season.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The Day After Tomorrow impressively wowed me with terrific special effects, yet came up way short as a movie worthy of classic status.  The scientific concepts behind the appocalyptic disasters pictured in the movie were fascinating but not on a scale of say Jurassic Park.  This was basically a heavily advertised holiday released disaster movie which succeeded in generating major revenue.<p>The acting performances were not noteworthy and the dialogue was incredibly thin.  A passionless, Dennis Quaid proved himself to be a B level actor, playing Jack Hall a paleo-climatologist.  Sela Ward playing his wife was mere window dressing in the film.  The love story between Quaid's son Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum was sophomoric and added little to the plot.<p>The special effects alone made the movie entertaining but not enough to make it memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.<br /><br />You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the "Cutters" in "Breaking Away", he was powerful and brooding.  In "Day" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak "save the world" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.<br /><br />Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.<br /><br />The "star" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking...."just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?"<br /><br />I'd buy "El Nino" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.<br /><br />The "fun" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.<br /><br />Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to "make it" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.<br /><br />So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.  If you insist that your movies make logical sense.... keep on moving folks, there's nothing to see here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid leads a large cast in this disaster thriller about extreme climate changes bringing about a new ice age.

Nope...try days.  The Atlantic tides have a drastic increase in temperature with immediately start causing catastrophic weather around the world including baseball sized hail in Japan and tornados in LA, and New York hit first with torrential rains and then a huge tidal wave which floods the city so much that freighters go floating down the street....yeah right.<br /><br />Any way, Hall's son Sam just happens to be in NY for an academic competition and he along with several friends takes refuge from the storm in the NYC public Library.  Why the Library is picked over much taller buildings is anyone's guess but of course with all the books, it makes great fuel for the fireplace as the sole means of warmth.<br /><br />The eye of the storm causes the temperature to drop to -150 degrees...freezing people where they stand.  Jack decides to set out from Washington DC to rescue his son and two collegues join him.  Their van crashes outside of Philadelphia...so they decide to walk...to NY....from Philadelphia...in sub-zero temps...and sleep at night in a tent...OK....<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich is the same guy who brought us Independence Day a few years back.  Another spectacular looking but ridiculous film.  Emmerich sure does love destroying LA though.<br /><br />The effects are pretty cool to see, but there's nothing we haven't seen before in movies like Twister, or Deep Impact.

And if it's in an air-conditioned theater on a hot summer day, you'll enjoy it even more.<p> <p>O.K., it's not great art.  And Dennis Quaid, cast as "the scientist who nobody listens to until it's too late" has been seen in better roles.  He's supposedly based in Washington DC and his 17-year old son, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is stuck in New York when the disaster hits.  It's a whopping disaster too.  The weather is going wacky.  A tornado is destroying Los Angeles.  And the "mother of all blizzards" is burying New York in a mountain of snow and ice.  The temperature is dropping at the rate of 10 degrees a second. Global warming has caused a new ice age and everyone in the northern part of the world is freezing to death.<p> <p>There's a whole bunch of people holed up in the New York Public library, most notably Jake Gyllenhaal and well as his girlfriend who needs some emergency medicine to save her.  There's the librarian who reluctantly understands that they need to burn the books in order to survive.  And then there is the homeless man and his dog who teaches the people how to put layers of paper inside their clothes in order to insulate themselves and keep warm.<p> <p>There's a global emergency and half the United States has to be evacuated into Mexico.

This movie is pure liberal propaganda.  Disgust you to see it.  In the beginning of the movie there is much drama about the US not signing onto the Kyoto agreement, and how this is basically the cause of the havoc that the movie is all about.  Then we are treated to the main human interest characters:  a scientist couple who are divorced (natch) and have a somewhat hostile relationship but who are bonded by their common interest in the welfare of their only child - an unmasculine teenage boy who is afraid of flying in airplanes and who grips the hand of a teenage girl companion for comfort during a bumpy flight.  Real he-man stuff.  It seems to me typically liberal that the scientist couple only had the one child.  Why strain yourself, am I right? And the girl he's got the hots for seems strangely moribund, like she doesn't get enough fresh air or something.  In the scene on the plane, the boy is trying to combat his fear of flying by gobbling candy.  Typical liberal behavior.  Moving right along, once the ice-age storm really gets going, and threatens to engulf North America, there is footage of Americans in droves trying to cross the border into Mexico.  Much reporting on the irony of this "flood of illegal immigration INTO Mexico"  The Mexican government is sealing the border until the US President cuts a deal whereby the Mexican border is opened to desperate gringos ("Ju e-like me ahora, eh gringo?!?") in exchange for - get this - the US forgiving latin American debt.  I'm not making this up.  Yet another example of how meddlesome liberals are.  You can't even see a freaking movie without it turning into a liberal indoctrination center on you.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>If you've seen the 1997 sci-fi hit "Independence Day", then for all practical purposes you've seen this movie too.  The only real difference is that instead of a bunch of ticked-off aliens, the threat of human extinction comes from a ticked-off "Mother Nature".  In the former, however, it was all about "us versus them" and the triumph of the human will to survive.  In "Day After Tomorrow", the message is:  "We have met the enemy, and they are the Republicans."<p>Yeah, the movie is about the epic struggle to survive in the face of an overwhelming natural catastrophe, but it's pretty obvious that the producers were less interested in telling a story and more concerned about sending an election-year political message.  From the early scenes of the movie, the "hero" character (a very forgettable paleoclimatologist played by Dennis Quaid) serves as the "voice crying in the wilderness" against the environmentally unsound excesses of corporate America.  He warns of the doomsday scenario which does in fact unfold throughout the movie, but the heavily stereotyped conservative politicians (who are, no doubt, in the pockets of the polluters) shrug off his warnings.  Maybe it's just me, but I thought the "vice president" character looked uncannily like Dick Cheney.  Coincidence?  I don't think so, but feel free to decide for yourself.<p>The main story is about a dysfunctional family whose members find themselves separated by the unpredictable (yet somehow predicted) chain of natural events.  Of course, the events aren't really natural -- they're caused by foolish and greedy men who fail to pay attention to the needs of Mother Earth.  Somehow, against incredible odds, the family manages to reunite, save the human race, and resolve their own domestic issues all at the same time.  And of course, the tale is duly concluded with the humiliation of America and its (implied Republican) leaders, as well as some cheap jabs at American immigration policy.<p>In short, this is enviro-hysteria at its cheesy best, but election year political propaganda at its worst.  There isn't even a mild attempt to veil the message -- it's right there in your face.  If you're a Bush-hater, you'll cheer.  If you're a little more honest with yourself, you'll see this film for the cheap trash that it is.  The ONLY reason I gave it a second star was because it was chock full of stunning visual effects from beginning to end.  Beyond that, your enjoyment of this movie will stand in direct relation to your political affiliation.  That's no way to make a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I watched this with my wife and parents. By the way, I grew up in Alaska so I know COLD.

My Dad was also an aircraft mechanic and although oil can get sludgy at low temps freezing aviation fuel is almost impossible outside a laboratory. But of course this is explained by some weird new weather phenomena that comes about in a matter of days, apparently.<br /><br />The best part was the United States having to ask permission of Mexico to cross their border.

It is just too difficult to take seriously any message - no matter how important it may be - when you cannot stop guffawing at the messenger.<br /><br />Paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is frustrated that his warnings of a global warming disaster are falling on deaf ears at a New Delhi conference.  However, it soon becomes clear that the danger is closer than anticipated when countries all over the world start experiencing unusual weather conditions.  As the northern United States freezes over, bands of survivors desperately head south to escape the deadly super-cooled air.  Jack, however, heads directly into the danger zone in order to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York.<br /><br />"The Day After Tomorrow" has that big-budget blockbuster feel with its impressive production values and visual effects.  However, while the film gets major brownie points for its "wrath-of-nature" scenes, it gets failing grades for its handling of its characters.  Virtually no time at all is devoted to character development and the situations they find themselves in are either preposterous or tiredly familiar.  Quaid, Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Arjay Smith, Dash Mihok, Sela Ward, Tamlyn Tomita, and Ian Holm all struggle to make something out of the wooden dialogue given to them but they never manage to breathe any life into their respective characters.  In all honesty, the snow in this film should have gotten top billing since it is by far the most interesting performer in this production.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This is a really great movie.

Yes, lots of critics complain that such a thing wouldn't happen that quickly, but I like these kinds of movies for the warning they give us as well as the thought they provoke (What would you do if you were in this kind of situation?) and I loved the special effects as well as showing the various people trying to deal with this situation and the sadness that is inevitable from this kind of catastrophe - the people drowning or freezing to death, and the unique US-to-Mexico panicked immigration was a clever added bit.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Day After Tomorrow / B00005JMXX<br /><br />Although disaster movies are often as a consequence of their very nature somewhat corny and soft-science-y, "Day after Tomorrow" can definitely be called the pageant queen of the disaster movie genre. Though the science is soft, the movie at least admits that what is happening is completely off the charts for expected (i.e. 'realistic') behavior, which is more than most movies are willing to admit (see, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AKCKM">The Core</a>). And though the usual cast of disaster movie characters are present, including the ubiquitous Unreliable Dad Who Comes Through In The End, I was beyond pleased to note that the movie didn't belabor the characters by beating the particularly dead horse of disaster movie character tropes and, instead, just continued firmly on to the action. As such, we are spared all the "This is why we are divorced/separated/whiny!" dialogue between the Unreliable Dad and Sainted Mother as well as the reconciliatory "This is why we fell in love!" crap that is so often tagged onto the end of these sorts of movies. That consideration alone is worth a couple of stars.<br /><br />No, "Day After Tomorrow" is all about the special effects and action, and is *not* about character development, dialogue, or anything else except swiftly and efficiently killing off the majority of Earth's population. If that's what you watch disaster movies for, like I do, then prepare to be delighted. If, however, you want a lot of yammering dialogue to break up the scenes of everyone being slaughtered by expensive CGI effects, you'll be disappointed in "Day After Tomorrow" and will have to go back and re-watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000G3PA">Armageddon</a>.<br /><br />I really can't think of anything I didn't like about "Day After Tomorrow". The vice president is a realistically callous evil jerk without ever going overboard into pure stupid, there are several cutely humorous scenes that the movie wisely chooses not to belabor too much (including illegal immigration in the opposite direction than usual, and burning tax law books instead of philosophy ones), and the soft science is interesting to watch unfold. The protagonist kids aren't quite as smart as I'd like them to be, but compared to the usual disaster movie crew, they're pure geniuses. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed "Day After Tomorrow" because the characters are so smart (relative to the genre) that even when they do dumb things (like trek to an unknown library to rescue a single kid), they at least do these dumb disaster movie tasks in a smart way. And I appreciate that.<br /><br />I am tempted to give "Day After Tomorrow" five stars, but even the best of disaster movies is still a disaster movie at its heart. There isn't a lot of high drama or deep thoughts to take away from this (well, except "Global Warming is Bad", but surely we know this by now). So, instead, I'll justify giving it 'only' four stars on the grounds that I thought the ending was way too optimistic about humanity's chances and I would have preferred the movie go whole-hog and say that there was really no hope to recover and rebuild, an ending that Hollywood just doesn't seem brave enough to make.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>Typical "don't believe the scientist until its too late" plot.

So, I was quite surprised when I found to be liking the movie a lot more than I had originally intended. I am a sucker for a good adventure/action film, and who doesn't love it when it is a giant disaster flick?. Director Roland Emmerich gave us the hit "Independence Day", but then again, he also unleashed the horror of "Godzilla" on us as well. Here, he delivers a pretty solid, interesting, human, and exciting tale of mother nature gone awry. Dennis Quaid stars as Jack Hall, a climatologist working for the government, who is at odds with his son Sam, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The strained father and son relationship is put to the test when the earth is hit by global warming that puts everything and everyone in danger. Tornados level Los Angeles, including some nifty scenes of the Hollywood sign and Tower Records, and cause a flooding of New York City and so on. Jack is stuck in Washington D.C., and son Sam is holed up with some friends and other New Yorkers in a museum in New York City. Sam being there for a school affair with his friend, and female companion who, not surprisingly, he longs for. Other typical characterizations of people litter the crowds of trapped city goers. The first hour sets up the severity of the storms and the destruction and isolation, while the second half spends the rest of the movie with our trapped cast fighting to stay alive from the ever dangerous weather. It is nice to see Dennis Quaid in such a film. I have always liked him and his work, and have always felt he was underrated and overlooked a bit in the grand scheme of things. He's a good actor. It is surprising to see smaller, indie-type actor Gyllenhaal in one. I haven't seen most of his work, but I do like him. He does just fine here. If he had done "Spider-Man 2" because of Tobey's back injury, it might of been okay after all. Both fit pretty well here. Emmerich's movies are always made for the effects and overal epic-ness of it all, and this one is no exception. The father-son storyline isn't a new one, and there is nothing here that adds to the overused plot line, or enhances it. Surprisingly, at least to me, it wasn't tne needless, thankless, lame plot ploy that a lot of people thought it was. I liked it, and it worked for me for some reason. The effects and destruction are quite a spectacle. That is for sure. The New York devastation more so than Los Angeles or anything else. Who doesn't want to see a ship harbored in a hustling section of downtown New York?. The effects are wild indeed, but seem more settled and level than those in Roland' previous opus'. If that makes any sense. While the effects and all that are great, fun to watch, and what most people are only interested in, I found myself being more interested and involved with the second half of the film. Watching everyone trying to live, and Jack trying to trek to New York to resuce his son. Ian Hol, famous from "Alien", has a supporting role here as a Professor. Also expect to see Sela Ward, who has a rather small role as Jack's ex-wife and Sam's mother, who is trapped in the hospital she works at. And Perry King also appears in the film, albeit a small role, as The President Of The United States. It's harmless fun that is definitley fun and entertaining to watch. The scariest thing about the film is that it leaves you with a question....what if?.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>but it did have moments of ok'ness(the multiple tornados in L.A.the flooding of NYC)other than those moments,its a big hackathon.theres really no word sufficient to describe just how bad the acting was.i was actaually rooting for Mother Nature.for those looking for good CGI themed disaster flicks,Dantes Peak and Twister(the acting here is almost as bad as day after thanks to the pitiful jaime gurtz)might fit the bill.for those who dont ask much of there cinematic experiences,or if you find anything on MTV cutting edge then youll love this.btw,jake,you let me down here bud!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>OK...First of all, I know that this hasn't been released yet...so if you are shopping around here for pre-release....for the love of all that's good don't buy 'Day After Tomorrow.'  It's a film that was decidedly rushed into theaters (REALLY shows in some of the special effects that fall flat), relied more on special effects than story, and really wastes talent of otherwise good actors.<br /><br />First of all, let me tell you...if you thought Titanic was good when it was in theaters...then rented it and scratched your head going 'Wha?'...I can almost guarantee the same effect with 'DAT'.  It relies so much on special effects that, once that 'wow' is taken out (which the smaller screens inevitably do to heavily Special-effects flicks), you are left with story.  If that falls flat (and BOY does this one!), you have a DVD that will collect dust because you will never watch it, until you can resell it at a heavily discounted price than from what you bought it!<br /><br />In a nutshell...here's the story:  Global warming has wreaked havoc, and an ice age decends on the northern hemisphere...oh..in about 3 days!  What normally took decades/centuries to happen...the script writers would have us believe happens in a few short days.  Giant hail, inexplicable snowstorms in India, tornados in LA (One of the really cool effects...which lasts about a minute)...everything is going haywire, meteorogically, and we have our empassioned scientist, played by Dennis Quaid, who warned this would happen.  Oh...and for some reason, he decides to don snowshoes and walk to save his son who is stranded in NY:  He's in Philadelphia!!!  This walk presumably takes place over a few hour period.  (I'm NOT kidding).  Jake Gylennhal muddles through his performance with as much enthusiasm as warm milk.  It's like he signed on, THEN got the script...or realized how dreadfully the CGI wolves would look. (trust me...they are Ed Woodian in terms of how poorly this effect is executed!)<br /><br />Bad Story....scant special effects that are doomed to fail on the smaller screens of home theater.  Please...save yourselves and click over to Spiderman 2, a Far superior movie and one with the story to overcome small screen from big screen translation.  There is absolutely NOTHING to see about Day After Tomorrow!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>When this movie came out a few months back, it seemed to be generating an unusual amount of controversy--even despite the fact that it offered an, uh, unconventional take on global warming. I didn't quite get what all the fuss was about: we all know that 50s horror movies like the original GODZILLA reflected something of the anxiety of the day re: nuclear weapons. Nobody was unduly concerned about the validity of the &quot;science&quot; behind such films. It was understood that these post-nuclear films were fantasies--giving expression to our most deep-seated fears perhaps, but not remotely to be interpreted as likely scenarios.<br /><br /> So watching Buzz Aldrin castigate DAT director Roland Emmerich and producer and co-writer Jerry Nachmanoff over the bad science and alarmist nature of their film on &quot;Deborah Norville&quot; seemed a bit of an overreaction itself. So much so, that I almost had to wonder if it wasn't all part of an elaborate promo campaign. What if the former astronaut was on the payroll, helping to stir up controversy and get people into theater. Nah! That could never happen in 21st century America.<br /><br /> After seeing the film, I was even more convinced that all the controversy may have been part of the pre-release hype. Of course, I have no doubt that Buzz Aldrin was sincere in his condemnation of the film's bad science, but his and others' overly earnest reactions certainly played right into the hands ot the promoters. Heck, it got me into the theater (well, that and the promise of incredible special effects). Had I waited longer to catch the general buzz (not Aldrin's), I might have decided it was probably NOT worth rushing out for, and I could at least wait for the DVD.<br /><br /> Because it really isn't a very good movie. By now, you've probably read all about the film's inconsistencies (dramatic AND meteorological), but you may still be under the impression that the special effects may make it worth seeing on the big screen. I was disappointed even on that score. The snowstorm in Bombay is a striking image--which lasts approximately 30 seconds. Same with the hail that seemingly devastates Tokyo (well, that may last a few seconds longer).<br /><br /> Actually, the CGI effects didn't impress me nearly as much as I had thought they might. Those twisters tearing through L.A. didn't look all that real to these jaded eyes. The flooding and freezing of NYC was perhaps a little more impressive...maybe too good though (and now we get back to the logic question). It's hard to imagine a meteorlogical scenario in which NYC would be totally devastated, while Washington, D.C. (some 230 miles away) would be relatively unscathed.<br /><br /> The political undercurrents you've heard about ARE there, but they don't really amount to all that much. Yes, it's VERY IRONIC that Norteamericanos are struggling to cross the Rio Grande INTO Mexico. There's some wit there. But I didn't really think the actor who played the vice president (Ken Welsh) looked that much like Dick Cheney. I thought he looked more like that spooky old Windom Earle from TWIN PEAKS. Wait a minute, Diane, that WAS spooky old Windom Earle from TWIN PEAKS. Now I am creeped out</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>There's no two ways about it...filmmaker Roland Emmerich really despises New York...three of his last four films depict some level of destruction within the Big Apple.  Why does he hate it so?  I have no idea, but he also doesn't seem all that found of Los Angeles, either...<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow (2004), written, produced and directed by Roland Emmerich stars Dennis Quaid (who'd been having a really decent run of good films, up until now, that is...), and Jake Gyllenhaal, who seems to bounce between really good movies (Donnie Darko) to really lousy ones (Bubble Boy, Highway).  Also appearing is Emmy Rossum (who bares a remarkable resemblance, at times, to American Pie's Elizabeth Shannon), Jay O. Sanders (Daylight), Perry King (The Lords of Flatbush), Kenneth Walsh (Miracle), Sela `yowsa, yowsa' Ward, and Ian `Bilbo Baggins' Holm.<br /><br />Okay...Jack Hall (Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist...what's that, you say?  Well, apparently it's someone who studies the weather of the past, using ice core samples from the artic and sophisticated computer programs...more or less a glorified weatherman.  During his research, he's found evidence to support the world is soon (soon meaning anywhere from 100 to 1,000 years) heading for another ice age, but no one is taking him too seriously, especially not the haughty Vice President (Walsh), probably due to the fact the weather reports we get on the TV are usually only right about half the time, so why should we jump through hoops for this clown?  Surprise, surprise, it turns out Walsh is right (but his timing is way off...typical weatherman) as the poopie hits the fan...big time.  Hail the size of footballs in Japan, tornadoes in LA, tide waves and crazy snow in New York (haven't they suffered enough?), all resulting in a global climate change, which doesn't sound all that bad, but basically the entire northern hemisphere is buried under ice and snow...a lot of ice and snow...and temperatures are dropping.  Oh why didn't they listen to Hall?  The fools...the frozen fools...<br /><br />I will say this...The Day After Tomorrow sported some of the best special effects I've seen in awhile.  The wide scale destruction of major cities was very intense (Irwin Allen, the master of disaster, the man who brought us all those wonderful 70's disaster movie, would have been proud)...also, I thought the acting was passable, which is sad, given the experienced cast involved, but they were just doing what they were told.  If I were to rate this film on the special effects alone, it would be five stars, but I have to also consider the other aspects, the story, the dialog and such.  It's these elements (or lack of) that ultimately derailed the film, for me at least.  Emmerich seems to try and dazzle the audience with glossy special effects in hope we won't put too much thought into all the holes, large and small, that riddle the plot.  I remember when I saw Emmerich's Independence Day (1996) for the first time, I was really taken with the film, but subsequent viewings revealed the paper thin construction, allowing the story to collapse in on itself...here, I need not watch the film again as the flimsy nature came through like a sledgehammer to the head...and Emmerich lays on the schmaltzy, maudlin sentimentality, disguised in the form of altruistic self sacrifice and heroism, about as thick as he lays the snows on New York...I would have thought it difficult to top the gushy, slushy, saccharine sweet goo presented in Independence Day, but I was wrong, as here, he turns it into an art form.  The dialog was just awful...I was surprised some of the actors managed to get their lines out while keeping a straight face.  Also, the dialog was entirely predictable, especially between the pregnant pauses meant to heighten the emotional level for the drivel soon to follow...I actually found myself speaking lines before they were spoken in the film, as it was that obvious as to what was coming.  And the film seems inundated with a preachy smugness...yes, we consume fossil fuels and use resources from the Earth, but does that necessarily make us evil and deserving of the scenario played out in this film?  I love it when Hollywood, in all of its shallow gloriousness, tries to teach the rest of the world what's wrong with us.  This is a big difference between Emmerich and Irwin Allen...Allen made disaster films to engage and entertain, while Emmerich seems to use the medium as a means to tell us the error of our so called destructive ways, and showing the ruinous consequences that result.  Ahh, I've stood on my soapbox long enough...here's some scenes to watch for...the one, after New York is frozen, with the homeless man teaching the rich kid, who normally wouldn't have given the filthy man the time of day, how to use newspapers and such to insulate himself by stuffing them in his clothes...can you see the irony here?  The homeless, once a burden on our society, have now, after the disaster, found purpose in advising the uninitiated on how to survive, as they've had to do living on the mean streets.  Everyone go out and befriend a homeless person now, before it's too late...okay, how about this scene...the kids, now stuck in the Manhattan library after the storm, are scrounging for food, and break into some vending machines.  The homeless guy suggests looking in the trash cans, as there's always something to eat in trash cans (yeah, okay...I'll tell you what my stinky friend, I'll eat the potato chips and M&M's and you can have whatever edible, maggot infested morsels you find rummaging in the garbage)...again, infinitely invaluable advice from the homeless...<br /><br />I won't bother going into all the special features on the DVD, as this site lists them adequately, but there's really not that much, as you have to link to the meatier features through a weblink provided on the DVD, which seems very cheap and cumbersome...<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>The 2 stars are for the f/x which were, for the most part, great. However the rest of the film is just one big, sloppy mess.  Dumb story, horible dialogue, overwraught direction. This flick has some good folks in it too - it's a shame they are terribly wasted.  Maybe if you watch it drunk.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Come on, everybody!  What did you expect from HIM?  I know your complaint, but it's Roland Emmerich, who directed 'Universal Soliders' 'Independence Day' or US version of 'Godzilla.'  Story is not only silly, but awfully told, with cardboard characters thrown in, whose presence means nothing before the costly special effects.<br /><br />As I said, the story is something like this: THE EARTH MEETS ANOTHER DISASTER again (after the numerous ones in the decade seen in 'Armageddon' 'The Core' and so on and on).  This time the much-worried global warming is the cause, which brings lots of terrible things to the humans, providing the good occasions for CGIs to impress us.  Blizzards, storms, even hails in Tokyo, which looks more like Chinatown (sorry, but I coundn't ignore the inaccuracy as I am a Japanese).<br /><br />Anyway, people are terrified, but not defeated.  But 'The Day After Tomorrow' features the human relations under this catastorophie, too, and here enter Dennis Quiad and Jake Gyllenhaal as father and son, whose shaky bond is tested by the disater. Reliable veterans like Ian Holm or Sela Ward add some aspects of humanity to the otherwise mundane story.  Ok, but what I really want to say is ...<br /><br />EMMY ROSSUM, what are you doing here?  She provides a love interest for Jake, but all you can see is her character doing nothing but things required in this kind of blockbuster films ... in short, to be saved.  Her stunning presence (and angelic voice) in 'Songcatcher' is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Well, I admit the CGIs are great, but I think we have seen too much of New York City attacked by disaster, especialy when you remember 'Deep Impact.'  To make matters worse, the silly, awfully silly story fatally damages the emotional impact that the film intends to give us.  See the characters do unaccountable things, including the cat-and-mouse chase with the ... er ... wolves on the frozen deck of a ship.<br /><br />ULTIMATELY THIS IS A THREE STAR FILM, but Emmerich, unbelievable as it is, tries to insert social messages directed to the US government, so that only northen hemisphere seems to have to suffer from the disaster.  Please, Mr. E.,  I like your pro-American style in 'Independence Day' which no one took seriously.  And here no one will either.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Man, all of the excitement and incredible anticipation that filled my brain preceding this movie's release all come to a glorious culmination with Roland Emmerich's latest thriller entitled "The Day After Tomorrow" and let me tell you, this movie was worth the long wait and lives up to the hype surrounding it. If you liked "Independence Day", then you will love this newest film from Emmerich and company. No longer are there aliens ready to destroy civilization, but humanity's greatest enemy isn't terrorism, it's Mother Nature herself. Let me tell you now, Mother Nature must never be messed with and this movie is an excellent example of this. <p> It's another hot and oppressively muggy day in New York and things are running normally elsewhere around most of the rest of the world but things start turning strange and freaky when the weather all over the globe starts turning chaotic and destructive when a blizzard buries New Delhi, India, and basketball sized hail pounds Tokyo, Japan, along with the strongest hurricanes ever recorded occurring simultaneously. A meteorologist scientist who studies the climates of the world has made a startingly discovery of the Ice Sheet in Antarctica breaking up and an iceberg the size of Rhode Island (One the Size of France actually did float into the Ocean from Antarctica a while back) breaks away from the Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Professor Jack Hall is alarmed at the trends taking place in the conditions of the atmosphere and the waters of the Atlantic Ocean have turned colder which results in the Gulf Stream coming to a dead stop and this triggers off a catastrophic chain reaction of the world's climate turning MUCH colder in a matter of days. On top of it all, the alarming fact that has gripped Hall's mind is that the world is on the brink of another Ice Age which threatens the entire northern Hemisphere where the bulk of the world's population lives in. <p> Meanwhile his son Jack Hall is on a flight to New York City for an academic competition but NYC is in the midst of an exceptionally severe thunderstorm but the storm won't let up after three consecutive days and they are unaware that a massive Ice Age that is overtaking the northern hemisphere. Now Sam Hall now has to endure the dangers of the massive glaciers and save his son from the freezing climate. The storm systems are also pulling extremely cold temperatures out of the mesosphere and causing an instant drop of over 100 degrees in a matter of seconds over any region above the center of the storm systems and now Jack and his comrades must find shelter before the Antarctic cold spell overtakes the remains of the city and take shelter. During this time his father Sam Hall must find shelter and rescue Jack from the remains of NYC before it's too late and they all freeze to death in the extreme cold temperatures of less than 80 below zero. <p> This movie absolutely lives up to all of the hype surrounding it. While many believe that it is impossible for such abrupt change in climate to occur in one day, it's not totally far fetched for it to happen and this movie really makes it look a lot more realistic. I was terrified at the numerous scenes throughout much of the movie especially in the first hour of the film because such climate changes will have grave repercussions against EVERYONE on this planet and it's a clear message that WE MUST do our part in helping to cut down on greenhouse emissions and help to clean up our environment because if we stand around and do nothing, things like this might just happen and this movie works very well at getting out the message of this. The special effects are especially amazing and make the entire climate effects look really realistic especially with the tornadoes flattening the large skyscrapers and even destroying airliners on the airport runways. The giant hurricanes also are incredibly scary to look at but really the special effects are absolutely stunning and almost realistic looking. <p> This movie does have it's share of flaws such as focusing almost primarily only on American cities but at least it doesn't say that it's the only country being hit by the Ice Age with scenes like New Delhi being buried in a massive blizzard and Tokyo with basketball-sized hail and to some extent this movie could've been better by focusing on other regions like the Middle East, Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere but since I've had a lifelong fascination with severe weather and weather related disasters, this movie is almost like a dream to me. This is everything that "Twister" and "Vertical Limit" wish they were. This movie trashes both of them right out into the Ice Age with a much better plot, more original twist and a much more powerful tone. The acting by almost the entire cast is good but even then, they've all seen better days but the flaws in this movie are more than compromised with a really excellent and powerful message of the possibilities of what Global Warming may do to civilization. I simply cannot understand why people would shun this movie but unless you're some lazy callous SUV driver or some supporter of some polluting industry, this movie is a must see and it should be a strong wake-up call to what may happen if we don't do what we should to take care of this Earth because it's the only earth we have. <p> They may have labeled this as a move sorely made for sheer entertainment but for me, being a highly environmentally conscious individual, this movie is a really important film that I strongly recommend that EVERYONE go and see. This movie is worth seeing several times over on the big screen and it already shaping up to be one of my favorite movies of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film and remeber seeing it when it came out in the theaters.

All of these things become food for our mind.<p>So what are we seeing "The Day" for? To be rocked. Special effects. Giant waves. Tornadoes on Rodeo Drive. It's a trip.

It's like rock 'n roll. 100 years from now they'll still be listening to Bach and Mozart and Puccini. Do you really think they're going to be playing 'Stairway to Heaven' at Carnegie Hall?

One of the best films in which Dennis Quaid starred in very long time.  The movie is, of course, effects-driven, but that doesn't take away from the film.  Just watching that huge tidal wave hit New York was damn spectacular! On a poltical note, it was kinda funny to se the vice-president character made to look and sounds so much like our current VP:  potty-mouth Cheney.

The sad part is that they marketed this movie so much that by the time you do see it you will have seen almost every major scene be it in trailers, clips, or even the 10 minute preview that aired on FOX. What the movie has is the idea of mankind and survival. The title of the movie may seem awkward but the title is symbolically talking about the future. It's kind of saying "what now?". What will the future bring in times to come and how will mankind respond to it? The title is also saying that change is always imminent and at the doorstep and our lives can change at any given moment be it from our decisions or some other force. There was a part in the movie when the girl tells her friend that all the time she spent learning and achieving for her future has gone to waste. There is some thought provoking questions raised by the movie but its then covered up in special effects and cliched scenes of destruction. I lowered my head in shame when a tornado just so happened to form for enough time to touch down, destroy the Hollywood sign, and then disperse. We've also seen a giant tidal wave hit New York city before in Deep Impact, we've seen massive tornadoes in Twister, and we've seen humans surviving incredible icy conditions in Alive. The movie is entertaining though, the special effects are very good, the questions provoked are somewhat interesting, but they are not enough to save this "popcorn flick". This is a perfect example of a movie creating a passable story just so that it can create its special effects. A movie that has a good story and can aid it with special effects is different. The whole father-son idea was not very good anyway.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting is mediocre in the movie. The younger actors in the movie do a so-so job while the veteran actors do a tad bit better. Dennis Quaid is a very one dimensional actor and his acting her is similar to his acting in The Alamo. The characters of this movie really added nothing except for some forced emotion during the poignant scenes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A fun summer movie but it has nothing new to offer the audience. I really cant think of anything that would make the premise of this movie any better because I personally think it shouldn't have been made in the first place. I also don't think that something like that could happen, and if it could it wouldn't happen so quickly and sneak up on us like that. Global patterns in weather that big don't develop that quickly. With all the weather stations worldwide and people in those professions I would think we would see something like that start to develop over time and not be surprised with only a day or two to react.

The film has the appearance of being heavily edited down; for an epic, world-ending disaster, you need at least a two-hour movie.<br /><br />The film presents a dark look at how helpless humanity is in the big scheme of things and how our petty lives and culture mean nothing to mindless Mother Nature.  Yet anyone with any iota of meteorological knowledge knows that disastrous weather does not happen this quickly.  And the way water and ice behave in this movie is truly ludicrous.<br /><br />And what if it did happen, and just as The Day After Tomorrow portrays?  What could we do against a world where the laws of nature cease to exist?  The end of the world (or nearly so) is either a tragedy or a comedy.  Judging from this film, it would be hilarious, indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>And thats just fine by me.  The scene where the tidal wave destroys Manhattan is enough to make up for the silly plot.  Yes, I said silly.  Not the event of the next global warming / ice age...thats not too rediculous...it's the father trying to save his son part that's stupid.  ANYWAYS!!!  Watch it for the tornadoes destroying LA and the tidalwave destroying New York and the scene with the wolves in the ship is pretty neat.  The acting is sub-par...These actors have done much better elsewhere...just watch Jack in Brokeback or even Good Girl and Dennis in Far From Heaven.  Anyways, like I said, the one reason to see this is for the CGI graphics and 'intence peril' as the box puts it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>All the science was not accurate in this film, but to any intelligent person, this kind of film should urge us to think and think hard.  You have to be an ostrich living in the sand to not realize we are radically altering our environment with some chilling possibilities for weather shifts in the next couple of hundred years.  If we care about our grandchildren and great grandchildren, we should ponder the possibility that man is having an effect on his environment in subtle but dangerous ways.  The film's ending is horrible, but the fact that it is such a daring politically incorrect film, that takes guts and I applaud that.<br /><br />Mr. Bush take notice, global warming is real and it IS a threat.

The "Day After Tomorrow" has amazing visuals, and for two hours,it'll keep you interested.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid,as in "Frequency",stars as a climatologist father reconnecting with his son.Jake Gyllenhaal rises above the mediocre script,showing why he is also great in "October Sky" and "Brokeback Mountain." Gyllenhaal's adventures as a math boy genius are riveting.Ian Holm's role as a Scottish scientist is minor&barely noticeable.Similarly,Emily Rossum is a bland love interest.There's a Dick Cheney-like vice president,and this movie was released not too long before Al Gore's Oscar-winning "Inconvenient Truth."<br /><br />The movie's strengths are the plot and special effects.There's plenty of suspense,and the sight of New York City in a new Ice Age is amazing. It makes a perfect two hours of entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>This is a visual movie to be sure.  Most of the special effects look quite good, some not, but the overall effect is still eye-popping. While some of the science is plausable [it's actually happening already, though at a much slower rate], I can't speak on the more technical quotes in the film.<br /><br />Main characters are developed, most especially that of star Dennis Quaid, while others are considerably less so. But that doesn't deter from it, as the adult actors all do an exceptional job with their parts. This is helped by good writing. Movies like these are usually full of cliches, trite one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek acting, but here it's believable.<br /><br />The film also brings up some interesting social issues, such as fleeing US citizens crashing the southern border into Mexico (usually cut, when on TV) and 'what does each person value most' scenarios.  There's more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. It's all certainly thought provoking.<br /><br />I recommend this film, for it's panoramic visualizations and issues to talk about.<br /><br />**For more environmental information, I recommend the following organizations:<br />Conservation International, Union of Concerned Scientists, EarthWatch, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earch Int'l. and World Meteorological Organization, to start.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Who would have thought that one of this summer's most anticipated action films would become the political lightening rod the radical environmental activists have made it today? How did this come about? In essence, 20th Century Fox, owned by conservative mogul Rupert Murdoch, green lit the film to jerk around the liberal activists and they have taken the bait hook, line, and sinker. Grass-roots groups such as the George Soros funded Moveon.org have openly embraced the film, even going so far as to hold a rally mere blocks away from the film's premiere. Among the speakers that were expected to attend was environmental nut-job himself, Al Gore, who spoke in New York City about the subject of global-warming on the coldest day in over half-a-century. That alone should demonstrate the credibility of these people but they continue to embrace the film today, using it as an exaggerated tool to once again rant senselessly against the Bush administration who they claim will lead to the planet's destruction. If this is true then why all the comparisons to Adolf Hitler (for those not in the know, Hitler was a well-known environmental wacko himself as well as a vegetarian and gun control activist). With less then one-third of the country giving the time of day to fretting over the state of the environment, few will find this film to be more then flashy special-effects and unrelenting, if not mindless, destruction.<br /><br />The story centers on the aftermath of global warming as one "rogue" scientist battles both man-made and natural blockades in order to save his son who is trapped in a now ice-incased New York City. Professor Adrian Hall is one of the leading scientists in his field trying to raise awareness over the growing environmental problem the planet will eventually face in the not too distant future but few will listen. That is until numerous natural disasters begin to engulf the planet. Tornadoes rip through California, snowstorms pound Eastern Asia, and gigantic tidal waves slam into New York City, where his son is attending an academic-decathlon competition. While the rest of the United States heads further south in order to avoid continuing cataclysmic disasters, Adrian Hall is the only one marching north all in an effort to rescue his son and save any hope left for humanity.<br /><br />The story for The Day After Tomorrow is ridiculously absurd and laughably clich&eacute;d that you won't hesitate to question the mentality of the radical liberal activists using this film as a launching pad to resurrect a dying, if not already dead, unconscionable environmental proposal. To start things off, the film's entire concept, beyond the fact that the myth of global-warming is being taken for serious scientific fact, is decisively unrealistic. Granted that was the same situation with another Emmerich disaster-flick, Independence Day, but at least that film had a credible script and a group of heroing characters that the audience cared about; something The Day After seriously lacks. The problem lies in the fact that the film becomes tremendously bogged down by so many intertwining characters and their separate story lines that it becomes increasingly difficult for any audience to singularly attach themselves to a particular character within the film which, as a result, makes any actions on screen emotionally-meaningless. And the film's premise contradicts itself before it even has to time to fully get off the ground. How is it that humanity is to blame for the cause of global warming by drastically changing the course of nature but then nature is able to quickly turn around and fight back? Why do these looney environmentalists believe that human beings are bigger then the planet? Why is it they believe that we can dramatically change the course of the planet through our "reckless" industrial activities when we still have massive casualties from natural events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods? Better check up with Al Gore on that one.<br /><br />The supposed hero of the film is Professor Adrian Hall, played to the best of his abilities by the talented Dennis Quaid. As ruggish an actor as Quaid may be, it doesn't fit well with this particular character that is suppose to be a rogue but isn't, namely Hall has to report to someone before any situation even if it concerns the life of his son. While on that subject, why does Hall go to New York after stating just minutes earlier that the best anyone could do for the people stranded in the area was pray? And supposing he did make it to New York then what did he plan on doing? All communications were out so how was he going to get them out of there? And is it asking so much to question Hall's skills as a scientist? All these freakish weather anomalies are occurring around you that apply directly to your theory and yet you let your son go to New York anyway? Does that make sense? And why is it that he is able to have this shocking theory that many slowly begin to accept but only begins collecting data to back it up once the effects of global warming are in full swing? Samuel Hall, played by environmental wacko Jake Gyllenhaal, is a prime example of the typical emotionally depressed teenager always fervent in clich&eacute;d films of this kind. He mopes around because his father isn't around all the time ... Boo-hoo! At least he has a father, it's not like his father is dead or his parents are divorced and he's never around. And the story about the "F" he received for not showing work on his mathematics test and talking back to the teacher ... What bull-crap! Show your damn work even if you can do it in your head (to be sure, his teacher isn't the only one in mathematics within the country who enforces such a policy) and don't talk back. It's that simple! And if Sam is as upset with his father as he appears to be, why does he choose to believe his father's promise to get him in New York if he has failed him so many times in the past? Worse-case scenario or not, it doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Overall, Roland Emmerich and his band of disaster-flick cronies dispatch with all concepts of space and time, not to mention any at all scientific merit, in order to achieve their goal of promoting an overly-drawn out environmental agenda so clich&eacute;d that by the end of the film's nearly two hour run you'll be saddened to contemplate the thought of this being the last stand of the environmental wackos of the world. If these people so vividly believe the ideas that they promote, why would they ever soil their core beliefs by having them mixed together with over-the-top special effects and bad science that, in the end, contradicts any serious scientific merit they are trying to achieve? Time serves no purpose within the film, although humanity seems to be always short of it whenever the script calls for it to be. In what should take it thousands, if not millions, of years, the cataclysmic effects of global warming unfold before our eyes in a time frame of less then two weeks, though that is a rough estimate as no accurate time line of events is given. Granted things need to fit within a two hour film but even for the sake of global warming even that is a little ridiculous. On top of that, the liberal propaganda machine rolls out a weak excuse to lift current immigration policies via a turning of the tables scenario late within the film. In the future has Mexico gone loco when they are dealing with a global catastrophe and they are more concerned about getting even on immigration policies then saving lives? As was said earlier, The Day After suffers severely from predictable and overly clich&eacute;d situations that become more abundantly clear as the movie progresses. So much so that one wonders why not a single studio executive raised the red-flag before letting this get off the drawing-board. Without rambling out an entire list, which would be tediously long, let's say the best, if not the most unnoticed, example lied in the scene in which Sam Hall watches another guy come in and flirt with Laura, the girl he likes, while "You don't want to hurt me ... You don't want to make me cry" plays softly in the background of the cafeteria. And lastly, it is absolutely disturbing to contemplate the filmmakers ever wanting to showcase the destruction of New York City after the catastrophic events that took place on September 11th, 2001, and yet it is prominent here anyway. Haven't New Yorkers, let alone Americans in general, been through enough that they should witness this on screen? How many damn times does Emmerich have to destroy NYC before he gets his final kicks in? Mr. Emmerich, the head of Homeland Security is here to see you. On a more serious note, no amount of eye-popping special-effects can save this film from being anything more then environmental propaganda to warn of an event they themselves have never, and will never, substantially prove.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I enjoy this movie and the whole concept behind it...while some ppl thought it was dumb (still really don't know why after reading their reviews) but it kept you entertain..<br /><br />A bit crazy trying to travel all that way to get your son but when your a parent you will do anything for your kids....</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Dennis Quaid just might be the worst actor for the role of Jack Hall.

It uses all sorts of excellent special effects to make it look like the planet Earth is about to be overtaken by weather- related disasters. But aside from the great special effects work, this film is really nothing special.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is the main star in this film and, once again, his performance is only average. The other actors/actresses in the movie are also average. None of them delivers an Oscar- caliper performance, but none of them are really bad, either. In this area, the film gets a passing grade, but not by much.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this movie is the plot itself. With a story like this- one of such Earth shattering, weather- related proportions- so much could have been done to make the movie more interesting and more entertaining. But the director, Roland Emmerich, decides instead to make the film rather dull and forgettable. To give you an idea, one of the major parts of the storyline involves Dennis Quaid heading for New York to find his son. All of these global weather changes are taking place all around and people are fighting for their lives and here's Dennis Quaid's character hiking through the snow to reach New York.<br /><br />Political messages pop up all throughout this movie and I don't know if the director was trying to push a particular point of view or not, but it seems like he was. The topic of global warming and its potential to be a disaster, the subject of foreign debts owed to U.S. banks, and other political talk come up throughout the movie and it appears that Emmerich is trying to persuade viewers to take political action.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, but only because of its great special effects. The rest of the film- the acting, plot, script, etc.- are average or below average. But watching those gigantic waves crashing through the streets of New York City makes this film worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Independence Day and Godzilla were both silly blockbuster fun and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is something the same, but with a little less spectacle. However after the initial tornadoes and massive tidal wave engulfing New York, the film loses momentum and some rather bad acting comes to the fore. Jake Gyllenhaal seems to be channeling Tobey Maguire, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't hold up to well. There is something really real and quite haunting about seeing a possible future displayed so vividly, but the whole excercise looses realism when the silly comic book ice-chasing-people rubbish starts. Add a nauseating layer of cheese (especially near the end), and you've got a distinctly shaky movie.

This, however, did not detract from my enjoyment of the film.  Despite the political message of the piece, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is principally an event film -- a disaster flick in high-gloss packaging.  Go expecting little more, and you should be easily entertained.  Go expecting an Academy Award caliber film, and you'll probably be disappointed.  Kudos to Dennis Quaid on another effortless performance, but the real star here are the special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film shows scientists in the antarctic, their tests show global warming is increasing. The paradoxical result will be a frozen earth! TV news shows snow in New Delhi, large hailstones fall in Tokyo. The strongest hurricane has been recorded.

Tornadoes in Los Angeles destroying the city! People are squashed like bugs. Typhoons in Australia! Could the North Atlantic current be changed due to melting ice (fresh water)? [It was cute to have a President who resembled Al Gore. But is the rest of the film just as correct?]<br /><br />Their computer projections show a disaster is only 6 to 8 weeks away.

From the 10th to the 14th century the world was much warmer. Greenland was a green island where settlers lived on their crops. Southern England raised grapes for a wine industry.

[Read Barbara Tuchman's "A Distant Mirror" for one view of those times.]</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>Look, I love INDEPENDENCE DAY.  I mean, I loooooooove that movie!  It is one of my absolute favorite films of all time.  So when I heard that there was a new disaster epic from the man who brought us ID4, Roland Emmerich, I was naturally excited.  But THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is, in reality, a poorly-done message movie.<br /><br />For starters, ID4 had an actual adversary with which the humans had to battle.  In TDAT, the only enemy is the planet Earth.  Not a whole lot of room for conflict there, people.  Well, I suppose we the people who caused global warming are the real enemies, but by the time the movie begins there's nothing we can do, so there is still no room whatsoever for conflict.<br /><br />And that brings us to the film's real purpose: propaganda disguised as a summer blockbuster.  The filmmakers have themselves admitted that the president and vice president in this movie were intentionally molded after George Bush and Dick Cheney.  (Please note that I pretty much have no political views whatsoever and am not making this point based on them.)  Let's just say that subtlety is not one of this film's strong points.  The vice president is reduced to a less-than-one dimensional character raving about "ECONOMY! ECONOMY! ECONOMY!" and being unbelievably idiotic when it comes to anything but that.  And all the president does is ask the vice president what he thinks they should do.  Again, subtle, no?  The film's blatant political statements really drag the film down, and approach eye-rolling proportions.<br /><br />Speaking of eye-rolling, howabout the stacking-up of unecessary characters?  ID4 had a lot of characters, but all played important (or at least functionary) roles in the plot.  Not so in TDAT.  The filmmakers introduce numerou8s characters whose only purpose is to make the audience feel sad for them.  The best example: the sick little boy and the nurse saying "Where's Timmy's ambulance?"  Puh-leeze.  I felt sort of bad, but I was laughing in this scene, it was so frikkin shmaltzy.<br /><br />Okay, now for the pros.  Well, perhaps the biggest pro is that it ain't nearly as bad as GODZILLA was. However, the central characters are overall likeable and the acting is more than decent.  And let me tell you, the special effects are some of the absolute best you will ever see!  I mean, the stuff in this movie is remarkable!  Unlike the tidal wave in DEEP IMPACT, the gigantic wave in TDAT truly scared me (and I don't get scared at modern movies very easily), because it just looked so damn real!  For that scene alone it's worth picking up the movie for a rental.<br /><br />However, special-effects aside, it just all comes back down to the script.  Story-wise it's actually pretty good, even if it scientifically ludicrous.  If you go to these movies for scientific plausibility, you need to rethink some things.  The filmmakers do succeed in making the audience not care that this whole thing takes place in a manner of days (as they did in ID4).  And I really liked the aspect of the father journeying across subzero temperatures just to save his sone.  That was pretty well-done.  However, it's all just waaaay to corny.  The dialogue, the action scenes, pretty much everything is cliched and predictable.<br /><br />In conclusion, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a fun disaster flick that, to quote another reviewer, would make Irwin Allen proud.  Put your brain on zero and ignore the propaganda and the not-so-subtle moral to stop global warming and such, and just enjoy the sensational special effects, which in my opinion should have won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Global warming begins to take a serious turn in Roland Emmerich's roller coaster journey as Mother Nature decides that humans have finally done enough destruction to the Earth.  The temperature begins to raise through global warming which initiates a huge melt down of the ice in the Arctic.  This melt down of ice affects the water temperature in oceans, which leads to changes in the ocean currents.  The ocean currents have a huge impact on the climate throughout the world, which the audience is to witness as Mother Nature kicks humanity's (...)with tornados, hurricanes, typhoons, hail, rain, and temperature shifts.<br /><br />The climatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), has a theory that will lead to a new ice age in the next 100 years or so.  However, the vice president ignores Jack as the precautions that Jack wants would cost too much money and affect the American life style.  What Jack does not know is that Mother Nature has sped up the process as the world is about to see a new ice age within a month that will affect the northern hemisphere.<br /><br />In the middle of the climate disaster Jack has to face a family crisis as he has neglected his wife as they are separated.  Jack has also neglected his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), as he is constantly traveling around the world in the name of climate science.  This family crisis is what brings the adventure to the film as Sam is stranded in a flooded New York, and Jack realizes that he must do right to his son by keeping his word.  However, the family crisis becomes a banal situation, as the life of Sam seems less worth than Jack's promise.<br /><br />Day After Tomorrow is a visual popcorn popping roller coaster where the close calls are many and frequent.  The close calls display unearthly hero's that outruns rapid super tides, fast crawling temperature drops of deadly consequence, and long distant snow threading super athletes.  The word cliffhanger had once a meaning, but after the films large number of close calls it becomes a clich&eacute;.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow begins with a promise of suspense, which it delivers, but to the expense of the story and characters.  The film has superb special effects, e.g., Los Angles being chewed by monstrous tornados and New York being swallowed by the Atlantic Ocean.  However, the story takes a back seat to the special effects and all the close calls, which significantly hurts the films potential.  Nonetheless, Day After Tomorrow offers an decent cinematic adventure that will keep the audience's attentions with excitement and weather bombardment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I am eminently capable of enjoying movies with stupid science and/or stupid characters, but there has to be some sort of redeeming quality.  For example, even the pie plate flying saucer in "Plan 9 From Outer Space" sounds good compared to the idea of thinking yourself into the past in "Somewhere in Time," but that film had Christopher Reeve making the grand romance work.  The problem with "The Day After Tomorrow" is that the best part of the movie comes in the first act, and that is not where you want it to be.<br /><br />The stupid science here is to take the idea of global warming leading to a radical shift in climate that creates a new ice age and instead of it happening over centuries or years reduce in to days and weeks.  No wonder scientists were rending their garments over this film, because even though I never took even biology in high school I know that what is being played fast and loose with in this film goes way beyond hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.  However, the whole point of this stupid science is to allow director Roland Emmerich, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff, yet another opportunity to destroy New York City, having taken major bites out of the Big Apple in both "Independence Day" and "Godzilla."  But Emmerich is more ambitious this time around, having tornadoes play havoc with the landmarks in Los Angeles before putting NYC in a deep freeze.<br /><br />In the grand cinematic tradition that goes back beyond Watergate to the science fiction films of the 1950s, a brilliant scientist, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), gets to sound like Cassandra while Vice President Cheney, er Becker (Kenneth Welsh), worries about the fragile economy rather than the fast approaching end of the world as we know it.  Hall gathers data and yells that the sky is falling but nobody really pays attention until giant hall comes raining down from the sky, giant tidal waves flood the Eastern seaboard, and a trio of what would be called hurricanes if they were not situated over the three northern continents instead of tropical waters re-program the planet's climate.<br /><br />The nice thing about identifying the point in this 2004 summer flick where it crosses the line is that Quaid's character actually draws it on a map of the United States.  A trio of killer storms are going to be raging for days over the northern part of the planet.  The temperature is dropping to below -150 degrees, the point at which fuel freezes, where people freeze to death on the spot.  Hall draws a line across the middle of the country and tells the President (Perry King) to order the evacuation of everybody south of the line to Mexico and forget the rest because basically they are dead already.  At that point the voice of sanity and reason in the film announces he is going to go to New York City to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam, the girl (Emmy Rossum) he likes, the rest of the members of the school smart person squad, and assorted citizens of New York are trapped in the New York Public Library which is flooded by freezing water and contains a copy of the Gutenberg Bible.  Sam is smart enough to figure out how to call his father, who tells him to wait there and he will come to get him.<br /><br />On the one hand kids should always call their parents when they are going to be late coming home, especially when a natural disaster beyond imagination is responsible for the delay.  But if our heroic scientist wants the President and everybody else to write off every human being living above his line of demarcation (my guess is that Canada and Scandinavia are no longer contenders for Olympic gold in hockey), he should practice what he preaches.  Otherwise, he becomes a stupid character.  Beyond that, while I like the idea that a Ph.D. can stop you and people who travel with you from freezing to death when everybody else is dying in their steps, I am pretty sure we are back to stupid science (I bet the Ph.D. has to be in a scientifically related area, which means rhetorical studies does not count).  I live in a place where it is winter six months of the year (our first snow is expected tomorrow night), so I know the value of dressing warmly.  But there are repeated scenes of people dressed warmly freezing to death in this movie so unless Hall is carrying the One Ring or has some other magic talisman that can temporarily dispel the coming of a new ice age, he and the other stupid characters stupid enough to insist on going with him on his stupid mission and all going to die stupidly (unless, of course, the screenwriters just stupidly ignore their own premises and continue with their story unabated by reason).<br /><br />Basically "The Day After Tomorrow" is a disaster film more in the tradition of "The Poseidon Adventure" (bad thing happens at the start and people try to survive) versus "The Towering Inferno" (bad thing happens at the end and people try to survive).  Part of the problem is that there are several extended scenes of mass destruction early in the film and then things get relatively boring with ice forming and ice breaking being the key developments.  The other part of the problem is that nobody in the film is as interesting as Shelley Winters.  My favorite character in the film ends up being Jeremy (Tom Rooney), who has decided that if he is to die his final act is going to be to save one very special book from being burned in the effort to stay warm.  Nothing else in the film has the intelligence or the nobility of that moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>First off, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the computer graphics, I enjoyed the irony, I even enjoyed the wolves.  And if you know a little something about some of the science you can enjoy it too.  The only problem I had was the time scale - everything was happening too fast.  The Ice Age could take centuries (or even just a few decades), but its going to take longer than a few weeks.<br />A change in the Gulf Stream's direction, either switching farther north or south, could trigger an Ice Age for different reasons.  But an Ice Age could also be caused by changes in solar output from the sun, lets say by a passing cloud of space dust.  So to me that was believable.  IT would cause changes in weather and we would have tough winters.  REALLY bad many-people-die-in-their-homes winters BUT New York City has HAD such winters and they didn't have packs of wolves and tidal waves to go with them.<br />One irony is that during the making of the film an ice shelf DID break off (just like at the start of the film).  But scientists knew it was going to do that within the next 13 years or so anyway, so no big deal.  No huge storms.  Yet.<br />A mammoth WAS flash frozen.  It was found with food still lodged between its teeth and was in reasonable good health at death as it had a layer of fat under its hairy hide.  There was little or no decay due to the fact that the bacteria had also been killed.  So the massive storms that froze everything and everybody within seconds MIGHT have existed DURING the Ice Ages.  Let me repeat that last part - during the Ice Age, as in, the Ice Age had been around for a couple hundred years ALREADY.<br />I enjoyed it very much, but I made sure I knew the difference between theories, facts and Hollywood magic.  And some of that might still be wrong to boot.<br />Oh, and one spoiler, the dog who was owned by the street person lived.  Just in case you were worried about the poor thing.</p></br></body></html>

A New York cop faces terrorists taking over a L.A.<br />building on Christmas Eve. This is definitely one of Bruce's<br />best and Alan is unforgettable as Hans Gruber. This 2-disc<br />set has good picture and sound plus neat extras. If you<br />like action or Bruce fighting terrorists wearing a wife-<br />beater, get this classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 4/03, 12/03, 1/06, 6/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />1/06: What I love about Die Hard is how real the hero character is. Then, another even greater is how real the villainous character is. Unlike most standard action-adventure movies, Die Hard is a machine that intensifies the plot every minute through scene by scene, woven tied together by two primary parallelisms: that of Bruce Willis and the other of Alan Rickman. The latter, for the role of Hans Gruber, is an Oscar caliber performance, which marked the "finally" we have an intelligent villain to watch. The script is well-done, but it couldn't be done as well without the majority of the help from special effects work. Just like Predator, John McTiernan is able to blend in the special effects smoothly with the surreal adventure of the violent nuked skyscraper. I love the portrayal of how the so-called terrorist group work by the elaborate setup and how did the group go by about it. Die Hard is as real as it gets for me. The poster of Bruce Willis with the building is just awesome.<br /><br />6/11: Die Hard is one intense machine that refuses to let down from start to finish. To this day, the special effects are spectacular as ever. The realism maintained by the characters is what makes the film to work. I still love that performance by Alan Rickman, usually a very funny guy. With a possible exception for next two sequels, I can safely say that Die Hard is probably the only time that Bruce Willis could be taken seriously as an actor. All in all, I can never forget my experience of seeing Die Hard in theaters in 1988. It was an experience. I am bringing the rating of the movie up from '9' to '10'.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>"Die Hard" is one of the best action films of all time. When I think about the best action films of all time, I think "First Blood", "Die Hard" and "The Terminator". In all three of these films, a big reason why they did so well was because they had a good plot and the star of each film did a phenomenal job.<br /><br />"Die Hard" is about New York cop John McClane (Willis). It is Christmas so he is visiting his wife who lives in California (because of a job she could not turn down). McClane goes to the building where she works, because there is a party going on there and his wife Holly has to give a speech. While McClane was in a back room washing up, he heard gun shots. With being a cop McClane goes to the top floor of the building "Nakatomi Plaza", he finds out that terrorist have taken control of the building and he is the only chance the hostages have.<br /><br />Bruce Willis did a wonderful job acting in this film. In my opinion Willis should have won best actor for this role.<br />If you are a fan of action films, "Die Hard" is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Okay, this is one of those action films that really works. Alongside Speed & Face/Off, Die Hard is superb as it delivers a whole lot of high-octane action. The story is...well, who really cares about the story? You already know that it's a bit cliched and doesn't really offer anything fresh. But what's so obviously great about this film is the action. The gunfights and the explosions (as well as the stunt work) are spectacular, and many of the action sequences still hold up today. Both Bruce Willis & Alan Rickman are excellent as the hero & villain, though I do think that the villain here, named Gruber, is way more interesting than Willis himself. Rickman's character is still the best villain in the entire Die Hard series, and his suave but cynical appearance/personality is proof of that. So basically, Die Hard is one of those action films that you MUST see before you die. It's got what you would expect in an action film: intense gun battles, clever dialogue, and a mano-a-mano between Willis and Rickman. The only problem is the music, which can be quite over-the-top at times. But still, this film is solid.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>If there's action star I've not mentioned it would be Bruce Wills I've loved this movie since 96 or 97 Die Hard is an action classic that stars Bruce Wills as New York City Cop John McClane Bonnie Belinda stars as Holly Genero McClane his wife & Reginald Vel Johnson as LA cop Sargent Al Powell. The Plot is straight forward & brilliant at the same time. John McClane is going to see Holly cause she accepted a job there which has a lot of h?** in the marriage. So there's a party going on at the Nakitomi towers where Holly works at some Terrorist's led by Hans Gruber & they really crash the party take some hostages & send The Police & FBI on a wild goose chase making them think it's about political prisoners. Meanwhile John doesn't go in guns ablazing he outsmarts them taking them out 1 by 1. I like how the characters are developed the fight scenes are great effects are too as is the stunt work. Some cool facts Bruce Wills & Demi Moore got marred during filming. Richard Gere was considered for the role of McClane that would have been terrible so was Richard Dean Anderson & Don Johnson. So was Burt Reynolds seriously!? This was also planned to be Commando 2. Ok Die Hard is a great movie if you don't have it don't rent if buy it & put it in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis first big screen staring role was quite a jolt to fans considering its very different tone from his star making vehicle, the TV series "Moonlighting".<br /><br />In Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.<br /><br />The cocky attitude came thru from the TV role, but added to it was a capacity to direct action and violence that was entirely lacking his previous performance.<br /><br />Often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career. Willis was lucky (or unlucky) to hit the mark on his very first try. Although he has branched into other types of roles in the decades since Die Hard, his subsequent roles are always measured against this one.<br /><br />The movie itself is an action delight. It was very unique when made, but spawned the myriad "heros who never give up and defy all pain and obstacles" movies that have been made since. It has been copied so many times and by so many major stars that the list is too long to even begin.<br /><br />Die Hard also gave us the most profane "best remembered line" in the history of movies. LOL</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>New York cop John McClane flies to Los Angeles on Christmas eve to spend the holidays with his family. He arrives at the Nakatomi corp. building for his wife's office party. International terrorists take over the building and hold every one as hostage to steel $600 million of bonds from the vaults of the building. Now its up to McCLane to face the terrorists and save his wife and the other hostages. "Die Hard" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a movie fall together perfectly. The perfect modern action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>I just saw "Die Hard" for the very first time a few months ago and enjoyed every second of it. After watching this movie I became a huge Bruce Willis fan because he's amazing in this movie. The man does all of his own stunts and is a 1-guy arsenal of power and strength. The movie is total action from the moment it starts until the second it ends. Bruce plays his signature character John McClane, a New York cop who comes home to LA to visit his estranged wife for Christmas. When he stops by her office to surprise her little does he know that the entire building is about to get sky-jacked courtesy of a gang of money-hungry German terrorists. What I enjoyed the most about Bruce Willis in this film is that he never gives up and he never backs down to the enemy. Even when everyone else is against him and thinks he is a nut he still doesn't give up. If you have any interest in action pictures you must see "Die Hard" because it truly is the very best. I have since seen all of the other "Die Hard" sequels and enjoyed them all immensely because Bruce Willis stayed true to his character throughout every single picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>'Die Hard' is a must see show for anyone who loves action movies.<br /><br />Bruce Willis stars as New York police Officer John McClane.  He and his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) are separated.  She has taken a job transfer to Los Angeles.  John travels to the West Coast to visit her and the kids for the holidays.<br /><br />The trip starts off with an appearance at her company Christmas party.  This international firm is targeted by European terrorists who seize the office during the party.  Officer McClane is not present in the room when the seizure occurs.  When he hears what is going on, he starts targeting the bad guys.<br /><br />This is full of excitement from start to finish.  Willis does a great job as the hero.  Reginald Veljohnson is another great character as LA Police Sgt. Al Powell.  Although Powell is not central to the heroics, he is a good addition to the plot helping to inject a little humor and human touch into the show.<br /><br />This is really a superb show.  If you have not seen it, you are long overdue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Undoubtedly the best of the 4 Die Hards and possibly the best action film ever made!  It is definately my favorite action film.  John McClaine is visiting his estranged wife at her office, the new Nakatomi building in Los Angeles.  The office is celebrating both Christmas and the opening of the new building.  Suddenly the building is invaded by what appear to be some heavily armed and very high tech terrorists who seal off the building and take all the employees prisoner.  John, a New York cop realizes what is happening and hides out in the empty part of the new building until he can access the situation and forge a plan of action.<br /><br />Against impossible odds, McClaine must save the hostages and convince the unbelieving Los Angeles police department what is going on before the terrorists can complete their evil plot.  This is a movie that will have you cheering out loud and cringing at the dangerous situations that keep presenting themselves.  There are alot of excellent supporting characters, including Al the disgraced patrol car cop as well as probably one of the suavest villians ever.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is a really awesome movie with great action, and great actors! Some terrorists have taken control of Nakatomi Plaza and only one man can stop them; John McClane! He's a loose cannon cop that doesn't play by the rules! Can John kill the bad guys, save his wife, and make it out alive to celebrate Christmas? I highly recommend DIE HARD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This remains one of the modern-day "classic" movies that was so popular that is spawned several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.  The sequels, by the way, never topped this film.<br /><br />The story was ludicrous: one man beating an entire group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another "Rambo" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.<br /><br />I do wish filmmakers would stop the bias against law enforcement. In this film, they show the acting police chief and all the FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Hollywood always does to anyone in authority.<br /><br />But the film gets away with its flaws because it grabs you early on and never lets you go.....a very involving story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>In case you've never seen this one--and it's really a classic, so unless you don't watch action movies at all, you really should see it--Bruce Willis is John McClane, a NYC cop in LA to spend Christmas with his kids and estranged wife. At her office Christmas party in a big office building, he's freshening up in the bathroom when terrorists, led by Alan Rickman's character, take over.<br /><br />Since hardly anyone knows he's there, it's up to McClane to save the day. Tons of action, a good dose of humor, and even some realistic emotional stuff. This movie doesn't miss a beat.<br /><br />Most action movies... heck, most movies period... skimp somewhere. They'll focus on the action scenes and neglect the plot, or the emotional stuff will be tacked on as an afterthought, or any one of a number of other complaints. This one doesn't do that. Everything's well balanced and logical and just sucks you right in.<br /><br />From the walking-on-glass scene that I can never watch (ouch, ouch, ouch) to the good-hearted but not terribly gung-ho beat cop to the dozens of great quotes, there's too much I like about this movie to list it all.<br /><br />I was impressed with the portrayal of Holly, John's wife (played by Bonnie Bedelia). I don't like her in the beginning, but later on, she shows her character, and you can see what John sees in her. This is highly unusual in action movies--mostly, the women are inexplicable.<br /><br />And the terrorists. I loved the terrorists. That doesn't sound right. I loved that they were thieves, not ideologues. It was such a great twist, and so very believable. And Alan Rickman does evil so well.<br /><br />And of course, it's got both Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman from my short list. I'd probably enjoy this even if it wasn't such a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a stunning film.

As sardonic, hard-hitting everyman New York City police detective John McClane, Willis had found his signature role.<br /><br />John McClane arrives in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, planning to spend the Christmas Holidays with his estranged business executive wife (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and their two children.  While McClane waits in his wife's office for a holiday party to break up, terrorists break in and take control of the party-goers and the 40 story office building they work in.  McClane, barefoot and armed with his service pistol, escapes and fights back.<br /><br />The balance of the movie is an often vicious cat-and-mouse game within the highrise between the trigger-happy terrorists and a cunning McClane, who slowly figures out the terrorist game plan and improvises ways to interfere.  McClane is helped by an L.A. cop (Reginald ValJean) outside the building and nearly killed by an ham-handed FBI hostage rescue team.  As McClane eliminates the terrorists one by one, the terrorists in turn resort to increasingly savage methods to kill the one obstacle to their success. The stage is set for a final do-or-die confrontation with the leader of the terrorists, played with snarling charm by Alan Rickman.<br /><br />The nooks and crannies of the highrise turn out to be a surprisingly supportive set for a series of narrow ambushes and escapes.  Supporting actors like a smarmy news reporter (played by William Atherton) add color and sometimes humor to what is otherwise a tense movie that lurches from action sequence to action sequence.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and very effective action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>If there's one thing that sort of bugs me about the whole action genre is that they are incredibly formulaic and a lot of times you can almost guess where everything is going to happen. Well, to be fair Die Hard doesn't try to re-invent the wheel although nowadays whenever an action movie comes out, it's usually billed as "Die Hard on a something". You may see everything coming but damned if it isn't fun anyways.<br /><br />John McClane is a New York City cop visiting his wife on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. The 2 aren't on the best of terms and he's meeting her at the office building where she works and decide how to spend Christmas. Of course no sooner does he arrive that a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber take hostages and try to get into a vault. Luckily John avoided capture and has to figure out how to save the hostages as well as his own skin all by himself.<br /><br />Granted as you can tell, it's probably not the most original plot but what it does with it is the key thing here as the film rarely slows down. I know it's cliche to say that "the film gets going and never stops till the end!" and there are some slower parts but there's a sense of tension running through the whole thing that makes more interesting and not just filler between the action scenes. It's really the editing that makes the film exciting since, like Speed, the film never gets sluggish.<br /><br />And of course the big draw was Bruce Willis and it's funny that the actor was once best known as the guy on that Moonlighting show from the 80's yet we see him as an action star and it's not hard to see why. Physically fit yet with a sense of humor, McClane isn't some humorless guy who makes awful one-liners now and then (Steven Segal, Van Damme) that makes it easier to root for him. And of course no hero can be without a villain and who better than Alan Rickman, probably best known for either this role or as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series. What makes these two work is that they don't seem like enemies who meet for one night but the interplay and battle of wits is what makes them stand out.<br /><br />While the film feels "80's" a lot, it's still nonetheless an engaging movie for those who are finding the recent action films a little lacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Die hard meant a true twist of change in what concerns the previous referential patterns about what it should be a breathtaking thriller, that blended with accurate measure, the required doses of action, suspense, around a complex and well planed terrorist attack into the same entrails of a fortified corporation, butt the presence of this refreshing action hero, who is an outlaw, and beware of this apparently simple detail: a hard fan of John Wayne who meant the most emblematic icon along seven decades in the American Cinema, remit us to many other similar situations.<br /><br />But there is much more to watch. The admirable dynamism and formidable employment of the camera as witness silent that scrutinizes and joins us through tunnels, audacious sequences and countless of adrenaline, from start to finish, spiced with some touches of sentimentalism (the dialogue between Mac Lean and the police officer), conform a formidable movie with a lot of unforgettable sequences plenty of high tension moments in which Bruce Wills signed his name with golden letters thanks among other factors the fact to elevate the dimension of an urban hero that fights in many levels, to establish the raped code of security in order to disentangle the horrid of this terrorist gang, and prove himself as hard to die police agent, capable to make the most unimaginable strategies to avoid by all his means the materialization of the pretended goal.<br /><br />Kudos too for Alan Rickman and Alexander Godunov (prematurely died after this film) who featured with admirable and crude the embodiment of the evilness and nasty repulsion for the audience.<br /><br />Since its immediate release, in 1989 I suspected and foresaw for this film the label of a contemporary cult movie category.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>John MaClane (Bruce Willis) a cop from New York is meeting his estranged wife at her office christmas party in a high rise in LA.

It is brilliantly directed by John McTiernan who utilises all the nooks and crannies of the building to create a real sense of cat and mouse. There is also plenty of warmth and humour in the story to help relieve the unrelenting tension.<br /><br />Like all good films Die Hard contains characters that we really care about.

Their goal: $640 million in bearer bonds locked in the building's safe.  John manages to slip away unnoticed by the terrorists.  Armed with only a service weapon and his resiliance, John launches his own one-man war against the terrorists.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gruber and the rest of his thugs have begun the laborious task of breaking into the building's safe.  Protected by seven different types of locks, it will be a tough nut for even the most experienced hacker to crack.  John has pulled a fire alarm in the hopes of attracting attention to the building, but Gruber manages to explain that its a false alarm and the fire trucks turn around before reaching the building.  However, John is able to obtain a walkie talkie radio, and he calls an emergency frequency to alert the police of the situation.  The dispatcher doesn't believe John, but then gunfire erupts in the background.  The dispatcher then sends a patrol car driven by officer Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) to the scene.  After walking through the building, he believes that nothing is wrong and begins to drive away.  Just then, John throws the body of one of the dead terrorists on the roof of Al's car.  Al immediately calls for back-up (after nearly destroying his car in the process).<br /><br />Soon, the LAPD and FBI are on the scene.  Al and John have maintained contact over their radios, and a deep bond has formed between the two.  John has continued his methodical elimination of the terrorists, but he's no closer to rescuing his wife.  Will John survive, or will Hans and his remaining thugs get away with the money?<br /><br />This is a first-class thriller from start to finish.  Bruce Willis is excellent as the undergunned but determined McClane, Alexander Godunov is perfect as Gruber's right-hand man Karl, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as Sgt. Powell.  The action and suspense continues throughout the film, and there's some funny one-liners from Willis along the way.  Two successful sequels followed this teriffic original film.<br /><br />I give this movie a very  high recommendation.

Well, any fan would know the rest.  If you don't know the rest, and you like good solid action movies, then you need to buy this Five star collection.  Now before you blow this movie off as a mindless violent movie, let it be known that Die Hard was the action flick that changed everything.  Before this one, actions films usually had heroes who were all muscle and no emotion.  Bruce Willis comes off in this movie as an everyday guy.  Yes, he's a cop, and a smart cop, but it is his portrayal as a troubled husband and father with marriage problems that really hits home.  He's not perfect.  He's stubborn and unobjectionable, and that helps us relate.<br />Willis plays John McClane, a New York detective who travels to California to visit his wife at her company Christmas party.  She has moved out there to successfully pursue her career, an idea that an old school Irish cop such as himself is probably not used.  He comes from a family who is most likely holding to values that the wife should be taking care of the kids and not working for a multi-million dollar company.  McClane is not against her working, but he probably holds reservations about it.  They are separated, but it is obvious they miss each other, too.  In a turn of events a group of `terrorists' take control of the building where the party is taking place.  The lead terrorist is played by Alan Rickman, also changing the role of the villain for all time as well.  Rickman plays Hans Gruber, a smart, slick and highly intelligent criminal who does not gloat with evil laughter.  He is single minded and professional.  What happens afterward is a sharp game of cat and mouse as Gruber tries to figure out who this monkey wrench in the works is and McClane gathers information about the terrorists and tries to get help from the outside.  Interestingly, his first ideas are to get help, not take everyone on all by himself.  He constantly stays on his toes and the title of the movie becomes very apparent as McClane takes injury after injury but keeps going.  Add in some humor, some emotional conversations between McClane and a beat cop who he contacts outside the building, and some moments where the fear in Willis' character become very clear, and you get a movie that is so well rounded and entertaining, it's no wonder it's a classic.  Enough said, buy it.<br />By the way, I say it's a guys Christmas movie only because it takes place at Christmas time.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>With it Willis became an international star, McTiernan the foremost action director of the age, and it has been infinitely copied. But the movie itself if very original and perhaps the best action film ever made. Why? Unlike most action films, this movie spends lots of time developing its characters and the plot. It creates people we care about. The acting is outstanding. I cannot think of one bad performance in the entire movie. The scene-stealer is Rickman, who gained his stardom from this film (and has been typecast forever as a villain). It does all this while being the most heart-pounding film of the century, and the directing is incredible, by the way. There is substance here, not just style. If you watch it enough times, you will realize the true genius of this production. McClane and Gruber become not only metaphoric of good and evil, but also of the struggle of the human spirit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>This is one of those action films that actually deserved to be called a modern classic.  In the film, Bruce Willis (currently the brooding lead of such films as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) is a smart-mouthed New York cop who visits Los Angeles to attend a Christmas party at a building where his wife is working.  &quot;Terrorists&quot; arrive to spoil the preceedings, leaving Willis alone, exhausted, barefoot, and the only one who can stop them.  Despite it's numerous and carbon-copy immitators, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5-star DVD release.  First off, you get two audio commentaries: one with director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia explaining the difficulties of starting a movie that DIDN'T have a ending set in stone and filming in a studio-owned building, and a second one with visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund explaining some technical aspects of the film and the secret behind Bruce Willis' &quot;barefoot&quot; performance.  A text commentary (like the text commentary on &quot;The Abyss&quot; DVD) is also available where the film is analyzed through numerous interviews with the actors, producers, and film critics.  On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.  There's a deleted scene (also on the first disc) and some outtakes, trailers, TV ads, articles on the film, the script (NOT just in DVD-ROM form), and a slick little treat called &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;.  Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.  Also, for you people confused with the difference between widescreen and fullscreen, you get a nice demonstration piece to show you the difference.  All in all, if you like the film, this is a definite keeper for your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed action film that is believable in many aspects.  One wonders if the terrorists' actions are over-the-top, but for $640 million...?  I think it's definitely in-line!<p>Alan Rickman plays his villainy wonderfully off of Willis' sardonic bravado.  Our business weasel who tries to &quot;negotitate&quot; his way out is also superb.  <p>It's a rollercoaster ride with enough humor thrown in by our idiot Police Chief to keep it entertaining.  I remember seeing it when it first came out and it had me gripping the edge of my seat.  &quot;There are rules for policemen...,&quot; yet our hero does what is necessary to get the job done.<p>Bravo!  Unfortunately, it's followed by a mirror-opposite sequel that makes me want to cry (see my review there).</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>When I bought the &quot;Die Hard Ultimate Collection&quot; set, I really didn't think they would be able to do much with the very first Die Hard.  It's a pretty old movie.  I really didn't know if they could do much to improve the picture and sound quality of the movie.  Well, I thought wrong, for when I watched this movie, I was completely shocked and stunned.  I said to myself, &quot;I can't believe they made this movie better.&quot;<p>This has to be one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  The picture is ten times more crisper and sharper than the older DVD version.  When the terrorists shoot out the glass windows to trap Willis, you can literally see every single piece of glass landing on the floor.  Also, the sound is explosive and very impressive, especially if you can watch it in DTS.  When I watched this new version of &quot;Die Hard&quot;, it was like seeing it for the very first time.<p>If you are not familiar with &quot;Die Hard&quot;, here's the story:  Bruce Willis is John McClane, a very short tempered New York cop.  He goes to California, hoping to patch things up with his wife, who works at the Nakatomi Plaza.  All of that changes when a group of terrorists, armed to the teeth with guns and explosives, decide to take over the building.  Now, the only one who can stop them is McClane, and believe, he's not too thrilled with the idea, but he knows he's the only one who stands a chance against them.  McClane goes on a one-man war, running around the plaza, taking out the bad guys, and trying his best to stay alive.  As soon as he hears the first gun shot, McClane knows he's about to have a very bad day.<p>This is a must have for anyone who loves &quot;Die Hard&quot;.  I know some might be hesitant since they already have the first box set, but believe me, it is worth it.  Filled with non-stop action and thrills, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a classic, and should be seen by all who loves action films.  Again, I must say this is one of the best transfers I have ever seen.  An easy five out of five, without question.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Off-duty cop (Bruce Willis) saves hostages and dispatches the sadistic bad guys against overwhelming odds; a simple plot, done many times since this 1988 thriller, but never done as effectively.  The difference:  This movie is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  The script balances heart-pounding action with funny one-liners that always make me laugh out loud.  Bruce Willis is wonderful as the Rambo-esque superguy who outwits, outplays, and outlasts the heavily-armed killers, and reveals just enough of his tender side to endear his character to the audience.<br /><br />Willis is backed up by outstanding supporting players who add depth and surprises:  Reginald Veljohnson is the sympathetic cop Willis talks to via radio during his ordeal. Alan Rickman plays the cruel, urbane gang leader with devilish flair.  He is assisted by the talented Alexander Godunov as a ruthless killer.<br /><br />The production values are top quality, the action never stops, and each stunt is unique and utterly stupendous.  I heartily recommend Die Hard to those who love action films and those who just love excellence in film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />"You got thirty or so hostages on the thirtieth floor [of the forty-story Nakatomi Plaza building located in Los Angeles].  The leaders name is Hans...They got a[n]...arsenal here...missiles, automatic weapons and...plastic explosives...They're down to nine [of twelve] now...these guys are mostly European judging by their clothing labels and cigarettes.  They're well financed and very slick...Add all that up...you got some bad-a*s perpetrators.  They're here to stay."<br /><br />The above is what New York city cop John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is on the building's 35TH floor, says on Christmas Eve by walky-talky to L.A. cop Al Powell (Reggie Veljohnson), McClane's cop outside the building contact.<br /><br />How did McClane get himself into this situation?  He has just arrived in L.A. and the Nakatomi Plaza building to spend the Christmas holidays with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) who works for the Nakatomi Corporation and is at the Nakatomi office Christmas party with the other employees.  (The building is empty except for those employees at the office party.)  But as John waits for his wife's office party to end, "terrorists" take control of the building.  As Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his fellow "terrorists" take hostages (McClane's wife being one of them), the bare footed McClain slips away unnoticed with only his service revolver, his cunning, and plenty of chutzpah.  The fun and action now begin as the lone McClaine attempts to save his wife and the other hostages.<br /><br />As the movie continues, others outside the building get involved: the L.A. police department, the FBI, and the television news.<br /><br />Note that McClane is just not fighting the "terrorists" but fighting the building as well as he tries to maneuver his way through it.<br /><br />The acting is in a word: fantastic.  Whether Bruce Willis as John McClane is climbing up an elevator shaft, throwing himself off an exploding building, or racing barefoot across a floor littered with glass, he holds our attention while we as watchers hold our breath.  Willis as a "good everyday guy" trapped in a situation fighting alone against overwhelming odds is the perfect blend of vulnerability, machismo, smart-aleckness, bravery, and funny one-liners.  (In fact, there is humor throughout this movie.)<br /><br />Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber redefines the action genre villain.  His charm lies in a volatile mixture of violence and cunning, all hidden in a gentleman's civility.  Bottom line: Hans is no ordinary "terrorist."<br /><br />All the supporting cast give solid performances.  Noteworthy are Bonnie Bedelia (as the wife in danger), Reggie Veljohnson (as McClane's cop-on-the-outside contact), and William Atherton as a slimy, tabloid journalist.<br /><br />The special affects in this movie are a sight to behold.  All background music adds to each scene especially Beethoven's "Ode to Joy."<br /><br />This movie is based on the novel "Nothing Lasts Forever" (1983) by Roderick Thorp.  It was later renamed "Die Hard."<br /><br />This movie has, so far, spawned two sequels: "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" and "Die Hard 3: Die Hard With a Vengeance."<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has a few extras, all of them interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, with explosions, guns, shattering plate glass windows, and death-defying jumps, "Die Hard" stands out as "the" action movie!!<br /><br />(1988;  2 hr, 10 min;  wide screen;  55 scenes, rated `R')<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>When the action gets going, it's easy to see how this movie became as popular as it did. The action is fast-paced and there is no stoping it once it gets started. Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film as the hero, it's easy to see how he became a huge success after this film. My hat's off to Alan Rickman as well, his portrayal of the villian was as equally impressive. This film is the definition of exciting and after all of these years, the movie is still as fresh as it was when it was originall released. This isn't your typical 80's action flick, this movie has a staying power that will be popular for generations to come!

Bruce Willis established himself as a film star after his stint on "Moonlighting" and Alan Rickman introduced himself to audiences as an actor to be reckoned with.  The beauty of this movie is it's total lack of pretense outside of entertaining the audience.

While out in L.A. visiting his wife, New York cop John McClane finds himself in the middle of a terriorist takeover. Armed with only his Berreta and wise-cracks (and the enemies' cigarettes), he sets out to free his wife and the other hostages from the terrorists.

It s a film that shows just how vulnerable any business or workplace really is to a terrible force but also how one man can stand up to the challenge and ultimately make a difference.<p>John McClane (Willis) is a New York City cop who travels to the Los Angeles area to reconcile with his seperated wife (Bonnie Bedalia) and family, who left him to pursue a lucrative job with a Japanese financial industry skyscraper.  While participating in a Christmas Eve party, the building is overtaken by German terrorists who want to use the hostage Japanese executives to break into the company safe.  McClane watches as the head terrorist (played brilliantly by Alan Rickman) blows the brains out of the Japenese CEO realizes that the game is on.<p>With the help of a gun-shy cop (Reginald Vel Johnson--yes, that's right--Mr. Winslow from &quot;Family Matters&quot;) and to the annoyance of police chief Paul Gleason, McClane runs around like a chicken with its head cut off attempting to save the hostages.  While on the explosive one-man war, Bruce Willis plays McClane in a very believable, humorous fashion--which is the quintessential reason for the film being one of the best of its kind.  &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a non-stop frenzy of excellent action sequences, a superb and witty screenplay written by Jeb Stuart and Steven D. de Souza (adapted from the Roderick Thorp novel), and top-notch, edge-of-your-seat direction from McTiernan.  The Five Star Collection DVD features a deleted scene and some excellent commentary from cast and crew.  One of the best action films of the 1980's.  A superb roller-coaster ride of thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>This was a fantastic action flick, but the deeper message cannot be ignored.  John McLane found himself among what everyone perceived as "terrorists."  He quickly assumed a "cowboy" posture, even going so far as to adopt the name "Roy" (Rogers).  He then acted unilaterally against the terrorists, seeking to kill them whenever he could.  He did not seek to form a coalition, he did not crawl whining to the United Nations, he did not adhere to the principles of diversity, tolerance, inclusion and compassion -- he just got to work killing the terrorists.  The result he obtained was wiping out the terrorist threat because, if  this unilateral cowboy had not killed the terrorists, they would have killed him.  Shouldn't John have reached out to these fellow human beings?  Shouldn't he have sat in the corner doing yoga, asking himself "Why do they hate us?"  Shouldn't he have considered the culture from which they came, or their religious history?  Why did people enjoy this film so much, seeing a guy behave as John did, merely greasing a terrorist whenever he saw one and completely eliminating the terrorist threat?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>It's Christmas Eve in Los Angeles -- but at Nakatomi Plaza in Century City, none of the Nakatomi Corporation's dedicated employees have gone home to their families.

Every other business in town has knocked off for the night, that Special Night, but not so at Nakatomi.  And when Bruce Willis shows up, his estranged wife Holly happens to be away in another room, &quot;faxing some documents&quot; -- presumably to the home office in Japan where, on the other side of the international date line, it's already Christmas morning... meaning that in Japan, somebody is at the office on Christmas morning awaiting Holly's fax from Los Angeles.

However, it wasn't until the late 70s and early 80s that action movies entered a new domain: that of the superhuman who blows lots of things up due to a big budget. DIE HARD set a new template in the action genre because Bruce Willis' character really isn't a superhuman, he's just a good cop who uses his wits to out smart the bad guys.<p>The movie re-ignited Willis' film career and his star performance as the bare-footed hero is rather well done for an action film. Alan Rickman is great as the slimy villian, Hans Gruber and Reginald Vel Johnson is a joy to watch as the befuddled cop who becomes friends with Willis' character over the radio.<p>Overall a great movie that has lots of action, a decent script, a little romance, and an admirable; yet human hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>Despite a lacklustre set of DVD extras, and a better-value boxed set, this  is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films. Influential enough to spawn  a genre of itself (even today, certain films are 'a bit like Die Hard'),  this film combined the '70s disaster movie with a fashionable set of chic  european bad guys and a plot which saw a lone hero use wit, courage and an  MP5 to defeat a numerically-superior opposing force. Put like that, the  film sounds merely adequate, but the beauty is in the execution - 'Die  Hard' is polished. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that,  after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale. It took  Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John  McClane character.

It set the foundation for so many other movies that came after it.  &quot;Under Siege&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; are two movies which were in many  ways replicates of this thriller.<p>&quot;Die Hard&quot; was Bruce Willis'  breakthru flick as far as the box office is concerned.  Instead of an  attitude-laden wise guy, Willis plays a New York cop who just wants to lead  a simple life &amp; has no wish to be a hero.  However, he gets caught up  in hostage situation in an L.A. skyscraper.  From that point on, Willis'  character must fight off the bad guys by himself while the F.B.I. and LAPD  are more interested in making him the scapegoat of the whole  debacle.<p>&quot;Die Hard&quot; does not let up on the amount of action  &amp; has no real dry spells where nothing is going on.  In fact, action  wise, it has probably the most &quot;punch&quot; of any action picture ever  made.  The 2nd &quot;Die Hard&quot; is o.k., the 3rd one is absurd &amp;  silly.  However, the original is by far the best &amp; will forever remain  an classic for those who love an adrenilene rush along w/their popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It seems clear now that the 1988 film "Die Hard" is one of the most important cinematic touchstones of our lifetime, simply because every action film since then can be reduced to being a variation on the theme (e.g., "Speed" is "Die Hard" on a bus).  I am not going to claim that "Die Hard" is more than mindless entertainment, but rather that it is the standard by which all mindless entertainment is to be judged.<p>One Christmas New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies out to Los Angeles to enjoy a nice, quiet Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is climbing up the corporate ladder of the Nakatomi Corporation.  However John arrives at the company office party a few minutes before a group of terrorists, led by the urbane Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), takes over and holds everybody hostage.  While the bad guys begin the long process of breaking into the building' vault, McClane becomes the proverbial "fly in the ointment," on the loose in the building and causing problems.  The only person on McClane's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), a cop on the outside who learns about what is really happening inside Nakatomi tower when McClane drops a dead body on his squad car.  Also working against McClane are top cop and complete idiot Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and sleazy reporter Thronburg (William Atherton).  <p>What makes "Die Hard" work?  First, the film had the virtue of making Bruce Willis a movie star.  Prior to this point he had failed to make his success with television's "Moonlighting" translate to movies.  Leading roles in "Blind Date" and "Sunset" were disappointing enough that the best part of Willis's cinematic resume was being a courtroom spectator in "The Verdict."  But in John McClane he had a character that allowed him to get off his one-liners but was also involved in some big action sequences and still found time to use his brains on several occasions.  I also like the adding insult to injury twist of fate that finds McClane barefoot when things start happening.  The result was that suddenly Willis was promoted to the A list, which almost always makes a bigger splash than when the star is there to begin with.<p>Second, there were the action sequences, the best of which remains McClane's jump off the exploding top of the building with a fire hose wrapped around his waist.  Everything else pales next to that one, but the common theme you have with all of the key sequences is that McClane is an ordinary guy facing long odds in a series of extraordinary circumstances.  Another common denominator is that for what McClane comes up with usually involves some thinking as well, such as using an office chair and a computer to create a detonator for plastique explosives.  McClane might be unlucky, but he is not stupid.  Add to this the fact that the action is pretty much non-stop once it gets started, and this is by no means a boring film.<p>Third, there are actually some emotional elements to the story, with McClane obviously worried about his wife being held by terrorists being at the top of the list.  But there is also the relationship between McClane and Sgt. Powell, even though it exists almost entirely over the radio (but has a nice double payoff in the film's denouement).  The scene where McClane asks Powell to pass along a message to Holly provides a sense of despair that usually does not enter into one of these films.<p>Ultimately, John McTiernan's film achieves a solid balance between characters and actions.  If an action film succeeds on the basis of the villain, then Rickman certainly provides that (I like the way his character is introduced), and I have always thought that VelJohnson's show "Family Matters" was an obvious and intelligent effort to capitalize on how great of a character he created in this movie.  Then there is Bedelia's Holly Gennaro McClane, who has it all, including a good right hook.  You might not understand how those two ended up together in the first place, but can sure appreciate why he wants to stay married to her.<p>Even the fact that "Die Hard 4: Die Hardest" is currently in pre-production can distract from the reputation of the original.  Actually the two sequels are better than most of the imitators that have come down the road ("Speed" is definitely the best of that bunch).  Besides making Willis a big time movie star it certainly set the bar higher for all the action films that have been made since 1988 and showed that you needed to have some heart and a sense of style to go with all the witty one-liners and explosive pyrotechnics.  "Die Hard" is still a lot of fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Every year when Christmas rolls around I like to have some friends over to enjoy a cup of cheer (potent Egg Nog recipe available upon request), put on some nice Christmas music, light some candles, prepare some delicious h'oure dourves, and gather around into my humble but sufficient cinema and watch a wonderful holiday favorite.  This year I'm going to watch Die Hard and to me Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it.<br /><br />John McTiernan's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008K76U">The Hunt for Red October</a>) classic action yarn that spawned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HIY0">three explosive sequels</a> never seems to get old, no matter how dated the hair, clothes, and portrayal of hip California cocaine addicts may get.  Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) to his quasi-wife's (Bonnie Bedelia) Christmas party in a skyscraper on the west coast.  He is a New York cop whose wife and children moved out west as she takes a great opportunity and adjusts.  Evidently, they are having some marriage problems but it is downplayed just enough.  The building is empty with an exception of the group who is having the Christmas party on one of the highest floors.  "Terrorists" lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues.  Gruber's plan would've worked out just fine if John didn't get away and slowly begin to take out each of his minions, while tipping off the local authorities.  The feds soon come in and the film blows up into an action classic....and also a Christmas classic.<br /><br />It has perhaps as likable and convincing a hero as you can get in John McClane and Bruce Willis upstages every other action hero by making John not only smart and funny but easy to relate to with very little drama.  It's an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">Indiana Jones</a>.  Just little fearless remarks coupled with a cynical look on his face make John go from typical good guy to what every boy dreams they could become under these circumstances.  It's fantastical and it's kitschy, but that's forgivable because it's a holiday movie and even more importantly, action is still the priority in Die Hard.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Die Hard's greatness is completed by its formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber.  Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying "I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."  Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end.  His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc.

William Atherton's performance as a reporter is also worth noting, as is John's limousine driver, Argyle.<br /><br />Even the edited for television versions are worth enjoying where the swearing is replaced by wonderfully light little curses like *slug of a ditch*, *melon farmer* and *bad mother cruncher*.  Those of course make it both amusing and accessible to all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited television movies.  But that is of course not what makes it a great movie.  I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made.  Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*...and happy holidays.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Every year when Christmas rolls around I like to have some friends over to enjoy a cup of cheer (potent Egg Nog recipe available upon request), put on some nice Christmas music, light some candles, prepare some delicious h'oure dourves, and gather around into my humble but sufficient cinema and watch a wonderful holiday favorite.  This year I'm going to watch Die Hard and to me Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it.<br /><br />John McTiernan's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008K76U">The Hunt for Red October</a>) classic action yarn that spawned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HIY0">three explosive sequels</a> never seems to get old, no matter how dated the hair, clothes, and portrayal of hip California cocaine addicts may get.  Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) to his quasi-wife's (Bonnie Bedelia) Christmas party in a skyscraper on the west coast.  He is a New York cop whose wife and children moved out west as she takes a great opportunity and adjusts.  Evidently, they are having some marriage problems but it is downplayed just enough.  The building is empty with an exception of the group who is having the Christmas party on one of the highest floors.  "Terrorists" lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues.  Gruber's plan would've worked out just fine if John didn't get away and slowly begin to take out each of his minions, while tipping off the local authorities.  The feds soon come in and the film blows up into an action classic....and also a Christmas classic.<br /><br />It has perhaps as likable and convincing a hero as you can get in John McClane and Bruce Willis upstages every other action hero by making John not only smart and funny but easy to relate to with very little drama.  It's an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">Indiana Jones</a>.  Just little fearless remarks coupled with a cynical look on his face make John go from typical good guy to what every boy dreams they could become under these circumstances.  It's fantastical and it's kitschy, but that's forgivable because it's a holiday movie and even more importantly, action is still the priority in Die Hard.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Die Hard's greatness is completed by its formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber.  Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying "I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."  Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end.  His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc.  In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with.

It has more heart and emotion than the sequels. Bruce Willis plays a N.Y cop who goes to L.A. for a christmas party at his wife's work building. Soon after getting there, everyone gets heald captive by terrorists who want money that is inside the building. He finds that he's the only hope for all the hostages inside since he's the only one not being heald by them.<br /><br />  After  killing some of the bad guys by himself he manages to befriend a cop outside the building "well played by Family Matters'  Reginald VelJohnson". They contact each other back and forth by walkie talkie with Willis letting him know what's going on inside the building. The relationship between Willis and VelJohnson adds a nice human touch to the film. They manage to have good chemestry without actually talking face to face throughout the movie.<br /><br />  VelJohnson says he never used his gun since he accidently shot a kid. Which leads to me always getting teared up when he actually uses his gun again at the end. It's a very emotional and powerful and under-rated scene. That scene alone makes me question how Roger Ebert could give this film 2 stars but part 2 ***1/2 and part 3 ***. Samual L. Jackson's scene with Willis in part 3 has nothing on Willis' with Reginald VelJohnson. VelJohnson is so good here that it makes me wish that he didn't get wasted on Family Matters for years as just that fat guy Steve Urcle pissed off all the time lol. Plus to throw in there, Alan Rickman gives one of the best slimy villian performances in the history of film. You can go rent some crappy action film of today with bad acting and bad writing but you're better off just watching Die Hard on cable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Die Hard is an exciting action packed movie directed by John McTiernan (Last Action Hero).<br /><br />The movie stars Bruce Willis as troublemaker New York cop John McClane who visits his wife in her Los Angeles workplace, a big firm called Nakatomi Corporations, at the same time a group of European terrorists take over the firm and hold everybody hostage. But they're in for a surprise, McClane is going to drive them up the walls in a cat and mouse game all around the building while the clueless LA police stands aside.<br /><br />The movie is similar to the Rambo films in that McClane alone battles the entire group of bad guys, but Die Hard maintains its own identity thanks to Willis' sense of humor and catchy one-liners.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Of course, everyone has probably heard of this excellent film starring Bruce Willis. While there are 3 films in the series, this one is really the only one needed. The 2nd and 3rd are descent but not great films. Bruce Willis stars as John Mclaine who goes to a party which ends up being interrupted by a group of terrorists. Mclaine, the cop, obviously has to do something about this.<br /><br />This is the best action movie ever with some wickedly cool scenes. Bruce Willis proves that he is a great actor with some great lines (yipikaye mother f#$%^*) and when he curses at the lady at the police station on the phone because se thinks that it's a prank. This movie blows the Bond movies and all of the other action movies out of the dust and will remain the true great action movie, and the movie that trully jumpstarted Bruce Willis's career.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>This movie has no compelling message, no inspiring dialogue, no noteworthy acting, or anything to make it an outstanding movie.  Except that it is one great action movie.  It's has one man (Bruce Willis) vs. a large gang of international terrorists who have come to rob the US headquarters of a large Japanese corporation.  He has this skyscraper at his use to try and outfox these bad guys and he makes the most of it.  It's one exciting scene after another and, all the while, he has to worry about his wife being a hostage of these terrorists along with her fellow office workers.  Bruce Willis was made for movies like this and he comes across like some sort of redneck Jackie Chan.  There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the movie and we find ourselves frequently on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />I usually expect to be inspired, touched, or otherwise impressed before I consider a movie to be great.  However, sometimes I just want to sit down, relax, and not have to concentrate in the least.  Unfortunately, there aren't many movies for that mood that are worth watching.  However, "Die Hard" is one I can watch and enjoy anytime I want to take my mind off everything else.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>"Die Hard", the film that made Bruce Willis a worldwide star, holds up rather well as it approaches the fifteenth anniversary of its release.  Hot off the success of "Predator", director John McTiernan delivered a tight, action packed number that seems shorter than its 2:12 runtime.  Boasting no big stars, Die Hard's success is largely attributable a focused, well paced plot, and the talents of Bruce Willis.<p>As most are aware, the story takes place on Christmas Eve.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis) arrives in LA to meet with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who works downtown in the Nakatomi Plaza.  While the company Christmas party is in progress, a criminal band led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) takes over the building in an elaborate attempt to steal some valuables locked in the company's vault.  McClane evades capture, and proceeds to do whatever he can to thwart the criminal's plans.<p>It's guerilla warfare between McClane and the baddies.  With the barefoot cop slowly improving the odds, picking off a crook or two at a time, during the various encounters.  Gruber the group's leader, played with a mixture of class and menace by Rickman, slowly goes from being in complete control, to struggling to hold things together.  A ruthless and worthy opponent to the very end.  For the isolated McClane, radio communication is used both to establish the confrontational relationship with Gruber, and a bond with sympathetic LA beat cop Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson).  With a reduced emphasis on dialog, the film's focus turns to the action sequences.  And since the efforts of the law enforcement authorities prove ineffectual, indecisive, and plain stupid, McClane is the only hope.<p>Die Hard's finish is still OK by today's standards, but just barely, as movie finishes continue to rise to more spectacular levels.  The success of this film would result in two sequels (so far) and spawn numerous imitations attempting to replicate its appeal and box office take.  Die Hard is still enjoyable, but not quite cutting edge.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Die Hard, 1988 film<br /><br />The story begins with an airplane landing. One passenger carries a concealed weapon. He lights a cigarette. [That dates this story.] A woman makes a call to her home. The limo driver plays Christmas music. Mclane visits his wife in a tall office building. She has a new Rolex watch. A large truck enters a parking garage. Two criminals surprise the desk clerk. That truck is a "Trojan Horse"! Gates drop to lock entrances, elevators are disabled, telephone cables are cut. The gang has submachine guns, and gathers the party. The gang leader tells of his plans. He wants the head of the corporation. The gang leader demands the $640 million in bearer bonds from the safe. "Who said we were terrorists?" The gang leader is ruthless. Can they break the code to access the safe? Can a fire alarm bring help? Not if it is cancelled. "We are in charge." Then the elevator arrives with a passenger.<br /><br />Can a CB radio broadcast a Mayday on channel 9? Will they send a police car to investigate? There is a gunfight on the roof, three against one. Can the hero escape through an air duct? Yes. "Thanks for the advice." There is an event that warns the policeman, and he calls for assistance. Inconvenient timing? The gang leader gets bad news. Mclane sends news to the cops. A TV truck arrives to cover the news of the terrorists. There is subtle humor from the plans to invade. "They'll be coming." There are lights to show the building. "Send in the car." Can an anti-tank weapon stop it? Mclane drops a bomb in the elevator shaft. "It's him." Will one of the hostages betray Mclane? They want the detonators, Ellis says. A deal? No. Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson speaks to Hans Gruber. "Hello." "Who cares?" An author speaks about the "Helsinki Syndrome". A fantasy? "Not any more."<br /><br />Hans is a clever actor! Mclane runs a check. [This is too cute to be believed.] They shoot their guns as if their ammo was free. "Only John can drive somebody that crazy." Broken glass can cut bare feet. What will happen when they cut off power to that building? Will the government agents agree to the gang's demands? Will Mclane make a mistake? Will a TV reporter exploit two children? Helicopters arrive at the building. [The action builds towards the climax.] There is a terrific fight scene. The roof explodes! There is a final meeting between John and Hans. "Happy Trails." The ending is what you would expect from this action movie. [Are those the bearer bonds floating through the air?] Will a terrorist pop up for a dramatic ending? "He's with me." Holly answers that TV reporter.<br /><br />Can you see how this story was carefully crafted to appeal to a wide range of customers? Note how the story jabs at some authority figures in a crude way. The story has a failure in the over-elaborate plan to rob a safe. Too many hostages can identify the robbers. Being trapped in a tall building is a poor plan for any robber who wants to get away with the loot. [Did they issue untraceable bearer bonds in that era?] This story is "too clever by half", but worth watching once. The story about one man winning against great odds echoes "Red Harvest". The story of a gang taking over a business goes back to "The Painted Desert".</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is a review of Die Hard 1, 2 and 3. My favorite would be DH2, but DH1 really set the mold and probably should win the award for best creativity. I prefer the winter airport and snowmobile scenes of DH2 to the city skyscraper scenes of DH1 &#65533; it probably has a significant amount to do with where you grew up. Probably the same for the underground scenes of DH3, although I think DH3 was less well done from many perspectives (plot, acting, cinematography, sound). Through all of them, though, one cannot help but cheer on the good guy and be thrilled when he pulls another one off. Get all three and watch them some relaxing night.</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>this movie has some great action scenes, but is way to long.

Yet, the film upon close inspection is really just another &quot;shoot-'em-up&quot; production that ultimately wears out its welcome long before the final baddie is gunned down.<p>John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a New York police officer who has arrived in Los Angeles for Christmas.  His wife (Bonnie Bedelia) has accepted a vice-president position with Nakatomi Corporation.  While McClane is attending a Christmas party at his wife's new office building, a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize the high-rise so that they may steal millions of dollars in negotiable bonds.  McClane takes it upon himself to defeat the terrorists and free the hostages they have taken.<p>&quot;Die Hard&quot; does introduce some novel aspects to the genre - it's a nice change of pace to see an everyman hero instead of the typical secret agent or military super-soldier at the center of an action film, it's nice to see an action hero with a sensitive side, and it's also nice to see a villain with a degree of sophistication.  But &quot;Die Hard&quot; intermixes these elements with so many loud explosions and gunfights that one becomes numb after awhile.  Throw in too many supporting characters who are deficient in the intelligence department and one inexcusable resurrection at the end, and all you're left with is a film that is great to look at but nothing more.  Willis more than proves he can play an action hero and Bedelia adds a welcome degree of charm to the proceedings.  Yet, &quot;Die Hard&quot; turns out to be only a smidgen better than its action contemporaries from the period and that is not enough to make it something special.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Die Hard is not 'your typical action film'. No way. And anyone who would view it as such really ought to stick with Twilight and Narnia.<br /><br />In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0848803752">The Detective</a>, which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345287819">Nothing Lasts Forever</a>. was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren. Two decades later, the skyscraper becomes Nakatomi, the daughter becomes the wife, Leland becomes John McClane and the title becomes Die Hard.<br /><br />To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates modestly wealthy. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.<br /><br />Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's cold performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. This is not some hammy guy in a chain-mail shirt with a Freddy Mercury mustache. Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.<br /><br />His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.<br /><br />The terrorists even have names. And we remember them. Most action movies these days have unidentified heavies, played by stunt men, who are lined up and knocked over.<br /><br />In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI.<br /><br />McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.<br /><br />John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.<br /><br />Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth-gritting every single time. It's lost some of it's respect in recent years as action films, post-1999, have tried endlessly to imitate The Matrix and use digital effects in place of real stunts (I'm point a big finger at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQ6">Live Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray</a>], which doesn't exist to me), which is a really big loss and signaled the beginning of the end of the true, tough guy action film.<br /><br />If you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture on Blu Ray. It looks brilliant in 2.35:1 1080p, and it retains most of the features from the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Here's the Good Flick Test.  While channel surfing, you come across a movie on cable you haven't seen in years--often several years.  You are only surfing due to boredom, or you are fleeing from another show's commercial break; in any event, you are only going to surf for a few minutes, then go about the business of your day or evening.  You have no intention of altering your plans. . .until you come across that Good Flick.<br /><br />Yep.  DIE HARD is one of those.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  More than once?  We're all familiar with the story:  blue collar New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) suddenly finds himself in a strained long distance marriage, with his voluptuous wife (Bonnie Bedelia) now employed at a brand new LA high rise.  During a Yuletide visit to the tower (an office Christmas party) the building is suddenly seized by snarling Euro terrorists--while McClane is able to sneak, undetected, to the upper floors still under construction.  From there, he wreaks the havoc all DIE HARD fans have come to know and love, then utters an immortal "Yippee-kie-yay" epithet as the bad guys go down.  Yes, it's all silly and farfetched; yet Willis is as likeable as he is self-deprecating ("Come out to the west coast," he deadpans as he crawls through a ventilation shaft under machine gun fire, "have a few laughs. . ."), and there is not a better villain in all the cinematic land than Alan Rickman.  We even get to hate a  snotty, arrogant reporter (William Atherton).<br /><br />Forget the plethora of sequels; they're all nonsense supreme and merely take the McClane character to cartoon proportions.  Go with the original DIE HARD; it's darn fun to watch, and worth stopping what you're doing to take in on cable.  Yes, this flick passes the test.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Forget this being the best Die Hard film of the current four-film series, this is arguably the number one action film ever created.  It is hard to believe this is over 20 years old, but honestly as the saying goes...they just don't make them like they used to.  While the recent "Live Free or Die Hard" was more than I expected and quite an action blast, it still could not surpass the level of the original, which is a very easy watch even by today's standards.<br /><br />The story and plot are simple, about terrorists taking over the "Nakatomi Plaza" building, yet amusingly, many films have borrowed this idea dozens of times over (especially B-movies) for an excuse to present some comparable action.  The end results generally have been laughable in comparison to the level of quality that Die Hard has pulled this off with.  This is definelty about tremendous action, but its also about Bruce Willis as "John McClane" - the hero who can most likely can be found on any list of top movie heroes of all time.  Plus you have Alan Rickman as the movie's main villain "Hans Grubber" who without a doubt, goes down as one of the best movie villains as well.  On the sidelines is the sympathetic cop played by Reginald Veljohnson (who ironically went on to play a cop on the tv series Family Matters) who grabs your attention along the way with his loyal support of John (and the two never even meet face to face till film's end).  Even the boss' gang of men seemed quite intelligent for the most part, and are not the typical goons you might usually expect from similar movies.  Each man gave McClane a good fight at some point, whether it was guns a'blazing or fist pounding, wall-smashing one on one's.<br /><br />As exceptional as some of the characters are, and the incredible details director John McTiernan makes out of a rather simple plot, its really the action this film offers that keeps us on our toes.  The excitement actually begins sooner than I thought in the film, and I wondered how the remaining almost two hours was going to keep me engaged, but McTiernan pulls it off with action scene after action scene nearly every step of the way.  More than anything else, there is a "ton" of gunfire throughout the film, and if you have a decent audio system, it actually sounds better than most shootouts in films.  If you are like me and you prefer the more manly approch of raw fist pounding fights, there are not a whole lot, but several that should satisfy with decent intensity (let's just say bodies smash into things often in the fights).  Like explosions?  Oh yes, Die Hard is well known for them.  I can't count how many explosions are shown on a tv commercial for this film.<br /><br />It took me over 20 years to finally watch this film.  I highly doubted Die Hard was gonna live up to today's standards of action, but boy does it by actually making some of today's films feel like they are missing something that this classic has offered.  Action fans - Die Hard is an absolute must OWN, not rent, not borrow, but own.<br /><br />Action - 5<br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Arguably, `Die Hard' is just an action movie.  Inarguably, `Die Hard' is `the' action movie; as in the action movie that all other action movies can only aspire to become.  `Die Hard' is intense, absorbing, entertaining and completely `edge of your seat' worthy from start to finish.  Director John McTiernan did a masterful job of getting the action just right, of editing the film in such a way that each scene brilliantly leads right into the next, never losing its intensity or losing its audience.  Add to that one of the greatest action performances ever and you have one thrilling movie that is prime for repeat viewing after repeat viewing.<br /><br />`Die Hard' introduces us to John McClane, NYPD.  You'll want to remember that name, for next to Ripley it's the only `action star' name you'll ever need to know.  Forget Ethan Hunt or even James Bond (well, you can remember James Bond I guess) because John McClane is the definition of action star.  Well, I guess I should say that Bruce Willis is the definition of action star, but you get my drift.  When the LA building his wife happens to be in is taken hostage by a group of terrorists planning a robbery, McClane takes matters into his own hands and wages a war against the terrorists from inside the building.  The LAPD isn't making things any easier, but John has the help of one particular officer.<br /><br />The plot is fine but it's the action that really makes `Die Hard' an instant classic.  It breathes new life into the genre and pushes the envelope in ways that no other action film has done.  `Die Hard' is a movie that will never get old or become outdated.  It holds up even today, twenty years after its release, proving to be just as good if not better than most of the so called `action' films that get released today.<br /><br />The acting is also a highlight, especially that of Bruce.  It saddens me that the Academy can often be so dense and blind.  In my personal opinion Bruce gave one of the best performances of the year.  He was natural and witty, charming and brooding all at the same time.  He created an iconic character, and that is hard to do.  John McClane is a household name.  Alan Rickman is also a pleasure to watch here.  As Hans Gruber he creates a prime bad guy, someone cunning, masterful and of course evil.  Reginald VelJohnson feels like he playing a lengthened version of his character on `Family Matters' and comes off a bit mechanical, but it's forgivable.  Bonnie Bedelia nails her performance as McClane's wife.  She filters through her characters emotions well.<br /><br />In the end `Die Hard' is a classic film that I'm sure many of you have already seen.  If you haven't seen it then I urge you to go out and see it ASAP.  `Die Hard', like I've already mentioned, is a film that stands the test of time.  It is just as up-to-date as the films being released today.  There is no other film like it, and there most likely will never be an `action' film that can top it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>You can tell it's loosely based on the communist radical raf groups of West Germany and europe and other LIKE-Minded silly radicals, And I enjoy that he is fighting these commies in this movie, plus you got officer winslow from Family Matters.

And in this building McLane's wife is also among the group. The thieves are prepared and have everything planned out. They have weaponry, technology, and professional men...but there is one thing they weren't counting on...John McClane. He is in the building and ready to rock. Die hard till this day is one of the best and probably the best action movie ever made, and it's probably because it's a fresh story, we can relate to the character. He is a character who gets the job done but doesn't want to be there, he just does what he has to do because there is no other choice. And also we have someone who bleeds; we see every bruise, every cut. The character is human so it feels real. These are the qualities that make die hard till this day one of the best action movies of all time. This is a must own by all movie fans out there. "Yippee Cay-Yay.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING:  5 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>This really is a terrific action movie.  It's not perfect; I concur with another reviewer here who noted that in order to make the hero, John McClane, seem more heroic, they made the LAPD (except for Sgt. Powell) and the FBI look like hyper-aggressive morons, and it wasn't really necessary, as they could have been portrayed as competent law enforcement officers who just got outwitted by an adversary who did his homework and read their anti-terrorist playbook ahead of time, and so anticipated their every move.  A minor quibble is McClane's carrying a loaded gun on a commercial airliner.  I've been a cop for the last five years, and a detective for almost the last two, and I can tell you that unless you are on official business for your department, such as prisoner transport, for example, you are NOT going to be allowed to carry a gun aboard a passenger jet, badge or no badge.  In fact, until the passage of the National Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act in July of 2004, a cop had no more legal right to carry a gun in another state than any ordinary citizen did.  But this is the kind of detail most people probably wouldn't notice, and the writer was obliged to arm Officer McClane somehow in order to make it plausible for him to survive his first encounter with one of the terrorist hostage takers.  The rest of the movie is top notch, the action is gripping, the movie is fast paced and exciting, the actors are perfectly cast, and the hero, being human and vulnerable, was a refreshing change from the invincible quasi-superheroes that dominated action films in the years before "Die Hard" hit the theaters.<br /><br />Most people have probably never read the book this movie was based on, Roderick Thorpe's "Nothing Lasts Forever".  And most are probably also unaware that that book was a sequel to a novel called "The Detective", which was made into a film of the same name starring Frank Sinatra in 1968.  The hero's name in both novels, and in the Sinatra film, was Joe Leland.  I guess that didn't sound macho enough for the writers or the director.  There were a lot of other changes from the book as well.  Leland is a retired cop, and about twenty years older than McClane.  He's now a pretty highly regarded security and anti-terrorist consultant -- which makes it more plausible and realistic for him to have a gun, but the movie makers probably changed this not only to make McClane younger, but to make him more of an "everyman" than a highly trained anti-terrorism specialist would have been.  Given the superhero characters like Rambo so prevalent up to that time, this may have been a very wise decision for broadening the movie's appeal.  Leland comes to visit his daughter, not his wife (whom he divorced, and she later died) at Klaxon Oil's skyscraper in Los Angeles.  Unlike the movie which cut to scenes focused on both the terrorists and the hostages, as well as the LAPD and FBI outside, the book only follows Leland, so unless he's spying on the bad guys or fighting them, we don't know what they're doing at any given moment.  Also, whereas in the movie, the terrorists are actually just using terrorism as cover for a robbery, in the book, they really are terrorists with a political agenda.  Klaxon Oil is involved in corrupt dealings with the miltary junta ruling Chile.  Leland's daughter may, it turns out, be willingly involved in these corrupt dealings (at least Leland believes she is), and she gets her comeupance too.  Where McClane's wife was rescued, Leland's daughter goes out the window with the head terrorist (who is called Anton "Red Tony" Grueber, instead of Hans Grueber).<br /><br />But a surprising amount of the book made it into the film.  Most of the action sequences, from throwing a dead terrorist out the window to attract the attention of the police, to dropping a C4 laden chair down an elevator shaft, to taping a gun to his back for the final showdown were taken from the book.  So are many others.  Most of the characters from the book made it to the movie in at least very similar form to their book prototypes: good guy Al Powell, bureaucratic stuffed shirt Dwayne T. Robinson, savage Karl and his brother whom the hero kills, and even the slimy Ellis.<br /><br />Some things, however, are very different.  McClane is far more of a wiseass than Leland.  Klaxon Oil is changed to the Nakatomi Corporation in the movie.  As I've read elsewhere, this was probably done to reflect the concerns about Japanese companies buying out American ones that were really a big issue in the '80s, but the ironic result of this is that the 1979 book is less dated than the 1988 movie.  The Japanese economy is simply no longer the alarming juggernaut it appeared to be in the 1980s, and those concerns have faded into history, but "big oil" is as much of an ogre to many as it ever was.  The overall tone of the movie is much lighter.  Not only does McClane's wife not do a two-and-a-half gainer out of a high rise window the way Leland's daughter does, but the issues are a lot more black and white.  The movie terrorists (who are not really terrorists) are unadulterated bad guys.  The book's terrorists (who really are terrorists) have a legitimate reason to hate Klaxon Oil, and it's a reason that even Leland agrees with. However, as they are ruthless terrorists, they are still the enemy.  But it's interesting to note that Leland himself, after he kills the terrorists, fulfills their goal of throwing Klaxon's bonds, documents and money out the windows to the people below.  He does it because he regards Klaxon's corruption as the ultimate cause of his daughter's death.  In the book, of course, the terrorists have no such selfless aims.  And while some might decry this as Hollywood wimping out yet again and compromising the artistic intergrity of a film by caving in to public desire for happy endings, I personally regard this as an actual improvement over the book.  After all, there are any number of movies featuring terrorists as villains.  I think it was brilliant to portray thieves masquerading as terrorists in order to carry out their plan.  Think about it.  What better cover could there be in this day and age of terrorism for such a high profile and high stakes heist?  It's fiendishly clever when you think of it, and would cause the authorities to approach the entire incident from the wrong direction entirely.  Everything that they would thus be trying to anticipate would be wrong, and almost their every move thus miscalculated.  I think that was a great story idea, and it's part of what makes this movie so entertaining.  Action movies are all too often mindless, overladen with special effects, and formulaic.  This one was innovative and clever, balanced effects with great acting by a great cast, and remains as exciting and entertaining to watch now as it was nearly twenty years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It is Merry Christmas in Los Angeles.  New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife where she works in the Nakatomi Building in an attempt to resolve their marital issues.  John is apparently the only one paying attention when a group of men take over the whole building and hold a large group of people hostage, including John's wife Holly Gennero McClane (Bonnie Bedelia).  Being an intelligent take action kind of guy, John immediately sets out to try and see if he can do something.  He also quickly realizes that he is outgunned and outnumbered.<br /><br />John does something you rarely see in action films; he calls for help.  However, the police he calls with a radio stolen from the bad guys suspect he could be a terrorist or kidnapper, as they have described the men in the building.  John is really struggling to get any support as the authorities tell him they have everything under control and that he should stay in a safe place while they handle the situation.<br /><br />Several things happen to make us realize the authorities are far from having the situation under control.  The police send in an armored vehicle which the suspected terrorists blow up with an anti-tank missile.  The FBI arrives to take charge and follow their standard playbook in dealing with the terrorists, which also turns out to be another mistake.  A helicopter is sent in with a SWAT team and it too is neatly dispatched.  The "authorities" come across as bumbling and ineffective.<br /><br />John realizes that the authorities have little such and of course he has already decided to take action himself.  However, John is no iron man Chuck Norris.  John gets cut-up, blown-up, banged-up and is continually on the run from the terrorists.  John does get lucky more than once, but there is some plausibility in his luck.  John also gets unlucky more than once.  John struggles to make headway with the terrorists as he is typically outgunned, but he keeps his head and manages to stay alive, which in this movie turns out to be really difficult.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as vulnerable hero John McClane.  John is far from being a superman, making numerous mistakes that get him hurt and cause significant damage to the building.  He is very human, as is revealed throughout the course of the building.  He often does not know what to do next, and he does get scared.  His type of hero is much more real than the stoic iron man often depicted in movies of this type.  He has real life problems, including a wife from whom he is separated and children.<br /><br />The supporting cast is remarkable.  Alan Rickman plays Hans Gruber, the leader of the bad guys.  Hans is borderline psychotic and has everything meticulously planned out, except for the intervention of John McClane.  When Hans threatens Holly, who ultimately takes a leadership role amongst the hostages - no shrinking wallflower she, John gets really angry, which of course is one of John's motivations for dealing firmly with the terrorists.  Reginald VelJohnson plays Los Angeles cop Sgt. Al Powell, another down-to-earth family man who believes what John says and supports him even when his boss and the FBI do not.  While there are a few moments when the interaction between John and Al gets a bit maudlin, the pairing is effective.<br /><br />William Atherton plays Richard Thornburg, a caricature of a tabloid journalist of the type we all like to hate, and we quickly come to dislike Richard Thornburg.  Richard is being set up for a rather predictable and enjoyable scene near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Action movies have certain characteristics that often make them predictable.  We know that the bad guys are really bad.  We know that the authorities are ineffective for one of a host of reasons.  We know that there will be one man who overcomes the odds to defeat the bad guys.  This one man seems bullet-proof and all-knowing as he avoids getting killed.  This man is generally unemotional except to the innocent.  Bruce Willis helped to redefine the hero of action movies as someone who meets none of these requirements.<br /><br />While Bruce Willis was creating a vulnerable hero we are entertained by a well-plotted movie that has a number of surprises, including why the terrorists are in the building and how they plan to escape.  I was entranced as much by the mysteries in this movie as by the action.  This movie is a winner for the combination of action, intelligent plot, and character development.  Try "Die Hard" as an alternative to mindless action movies where the main character never does wrong, never gets hurt, and has way too much ammunition.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>John McTiernan's star has been fading lately, but it shone like a supernova with 1988's Die Hard, a taut and exciting action thriller that made Bruce Willis an international star and began a trend of explosion-laden action thrillers that followed its basic formula -- sometimes successfully, but more often not.<p>The story takes a basic Western-movie plotline (lone hero faces off against a band of menacing black hats) and pulls it forward into the late 20th Century.  N.Y. Detective John McClane (Willis) arrives in L.A. for a Christmas vacation with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children.  At a Christmas office party in the still unfinished Nakatomi building (where Holly has an executive office), a band of what seems to be a group of well-financed terrorists takes most of the partygoers hostage.  It is up to McClane, who luckily is in a rest room as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his thugs crash the party, to foil the villains and rescue the hostages.<p>McTiernan, working from a screenplay by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza, blends in various types of styles into Die Hard.  With the relationship between McClane and L.A. police Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald Veljohnson) he inserted the "buddy picture."  With the police angle, he uses the "cops and robbers" theme.  The screenplay and movie also highlight wit and droll humor -- especially on Gruber's part. As the prime mover of the action, it's Gruber who's the protagonist, with Willis as the heroic antagonist.<p>The 5-Star Collection DVD is one of 20th Century Fox's best releases to date. The widescreen format and sound are great, the new interactive menus are eyepopping, and the extra features on both discs are excellent.  Although perhaps a bit more expensive than either the VHS or original DVD release, the new Collector's Editions of the Die Hard films are worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>The movie that made John McTiernan (Predator) the hottest action director in Hollywood, created an explosion of inferior rip-offs and with Bruce Willis, started the long line of sweaty vested heroes while making a huge box-office success. <p>The movie of course, is Die Hard. The first (and best) in what would become a trilogy, Bruce Willis' first major action man role carries the distinction of being heralded as the greatest action movie ever made. It's title is debatable, but regardless, this movie is great! The action, stunts, uber-cool villains, one-liners, impressive FX and big noisy things exploding make this one of the all-time greats. McTiernan would go on to direct Die Hard with a Vengeance after Renny Harlin's mediocre Die Hard 2 and influenced countless other action films throughout the 80's and 90's.<p>This special edition DVD is one of the best on the market, loaded with extras.<br />Disc 1 includes a commentary by director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia, and Disc 2 has outtakes, deleted scenes, the whole flippin' screenplay, awesome trailers, TV spots and DVD-ROM features with script-to-screen comparison and game demos and more cool stuff for die-hard Die Hard fans (Hey, that's where the saying comes from!) See? This movie has truly influenced countless action films but has also become a statement for all things sweaty and extreme. Yipee Kay Yay!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>When this movie first came out, it was the one who redefined the word &quot;blockbuster&quot; for the 80's movies.  Willis was shot to stardom after this action-packed turn that allowed him to use his trademark smirk and cocky attitude to the fullest extent.  Some of the greatest action sequences on film are in this movie (including the infamous &quot;jump from the roof with a firehouse around him&quot; shot that you see in all the trailers for it).  You will watch this again and again, as all characters are fairly solid, and Rickman's villian is absolutely the most suave bad guy you'll ever see.  The second one was as good as this one, but the third in the trilogy just went too far and lost the essence of the first two.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XFZN4MWNKK4.html">A35XFZN4MWNKK4</a><br/><p>A powerful, action movie which keeps you in suspense throughout! Bruce Willis plays a cop who battles with terroists who have taken over the building where his wife and children are. The visual effects are stunning, dialogue fast and very sharp and as always a great, beleavable performance from Bruce Willis. Amongst the rest of the cast include bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alan Rickman and Paul Gleason. One of the best action movies i've seen. A definite classic! Highly recommended!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>When &quot;Die Hard&quot; was first released it set a new standard for non stop action. I think one of the reasons for this is that virtually the whole movie was squeezed into the confines of one building. Bruce Willis may have struggled to shake off the Die Hard stereotype and make a success of other films but the Die Hard formula had no such problems. The number of Die Hard rip offs that have been made since '88 are too numerous to count.<br /><br />Credit has to go to the director John McTiernan for a lot of the appeal of the film. The tight shots on dramatic acting sequences, good use of claustrophobic spaces and the many visual surprises all went a long way to ripping our hearts from our chests. Of course this movie also had a fine script, not so much for the dialogue as for the story telling style. We are forced easily into the same misconceptions that the hero, John McClane, experiences and we are just as surprised as he, at each twist and turn in the plot.<br /><br />Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop visiting L.A. over Christmas in order to patch up his relationship with his Wife, Holly Gennero McClane, played by Bonnie Bedelia. Holly is a senior executive with a Japanese corporation, Nakatomi. John finds his Wife still at work in the Nakatomi building along with many other employees, having a Christmas party. Their reunion is not going well when the situation takes a further dramatic turn for the worse, as a group of terrorists take over the building.<br /><br />John, of course, is the only one quick thinking and lucky enough not to be taken hostage and proceeds to try and ruin the terrorists plans. On the plus side, they do not know he exists and he has one police issue revolver. On the down side, he has no shirt and no shoes. Neither of which seem like major issues but by the end of the film he will sorely regret not having foot ware and his singlet will be a write off.<br /><br />The terrorists are led by the coldly competent Hans Gruber, played very well by Alan Rickman. He makes a good adversary for Mr McClane because he is well prepared, ruthless and has a team of very well trained assistants. Unfortunately for him, John McClane is not a conventional thinker and is therefore hard to pin down.<br /><br />Along for the ride we are able to enjoy a few interesting minor characters, a sassy but thoughtful limo driver by the name of Argyle, a manic psychopath in Hans' group, called Karl, a nearly as manic heartless reporter, Thornburg, a twinkie munching sensitive cop, Sgt. Al Powell, a pair of blinkered FBI agents and a ridiculously incompetent police captain, called Dwayne T. Robinson. As you can see, Die Hard is chock full of deep and meaningful characterizations, which all go towards enhancing our viewing pleasure.<br /><br />For every success that John has, it seems he accumulates more injuries and more enthusiasm from his opponents. He is forced to crawl through air conditioning ducting, jump into elevator shafts, fall off the roof of the building, walk on broken glass and worst of all he is forced to make witty comments throughout the entire film.<br /><br />All in all, for non stop action that doesn't take itself too seriously, you can't beat Die Hard.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>This is the film that would influence hundreds of action films for years to come, made director John McTiernan a household name, and made a global superstar out of Bruce Willis.  Willis stars as New York Detective John McClaine, who goes to Los Angeles to see his wife (Bonnie Bedilia) and family, but finds himself running and gunning for his life when a group of terrorists take over the Nakatomi building holding hostages (including his wife), and only McClaine can stop them.  As the Amazon review says, Die Hard would set the stage for action films for years to come such as Under Siege, Passenger 57, and Executive Decision; but none of those films could ever match the intense action (possibly some of McTiernan's best directing in his career), engaging cinematography (courtesy of Jan de Bont who would later helm another action masterpiece with Speed), and fantastic performances from Willis (his wisecracking one liners would also set the stage for future big screen heroes) and Alan Rickman as the nefarious head terrorist Hans Gruber.  This Five Star edition of the film is great and is undoubtadly one of 20th Century Fox's best produced DVD's on the market.  The great picture transfer allows us to see the brilliance of the film, and the commentary from McTiernan is worth the price of admission alone.  The branching scenes don't add much to the film, but they themselves are a nice extra.  This blockbuster would also spawn an inferior (but nonetheless action packed and fun) sequel that was directed by Renny Harlin, and McTiernan would return to the helm for the third and in my opinion best installment, Die Hard With A Vengeance.  All in all, consider this essential viewing if you've ever called yourself an action film fan.</p></br></body></html>

FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is one of these awful gems; it's nonsensical and silly and gruesome and bad and as much darn fun as one can ever hope to have watching a cut-'em-up (plus in this case, bite-'em-up).  In fact, after the first uber-violent, utterly ridiculous bloodletting orgy I jumped from my couch to give FROM DUSK TILL DAWN a standing ovation.  Now that's entertainment.<br /><br />Made in the mid-Nineties before anyone knew who the hey George Clooney was (or is) and directed by Robert Rodriguez with screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (who also stars as Clooney's warped brother), this is one bad flick about two violent robbers who kidnap a family and flee to Mexico to seek refuge at some hole-in-the-wall off-road bar. . .a bar offering anything but refuge.  Needless to say as dusk ensues the vamps come out of the woodwork while the violence is sloshed by the bucketful as mayhem spins madly with the occasional clever zany quip.  Other performers I particularly enjoyed include Fred "The Hammer" Williamson, Tom Savani (when he tries to hide his "changing" into a vampire from his fellow companions I was rolling on the floor), a surprisingly subdued Harvey Keitel, and Cheech Marin (in multiple roles).  But nothing--and I mean NOTHING--compares to a heart-thumping striptease performed by a gorgeous, stunning Salma Hayek; it's visual Viagra that's instant money, and it's yet another reason why FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is nonstop, goofy fun.<br />--D.

Salma Hayek has a hot little dance number with a snake and i can't say anything bad about this film. Good fight scenes and good everything. I love the daughter of the main family. She's funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>The Geko brothers kidnap a small family and their RV as they escape to Mexico after a bank heist. Once they are all safely across the border, a quick stop at a local strip joint turns into a night of terror when the bar becomes a haven for vampires after dark! FROM DUSK TIL DAWN has two distinct personalities, the first being a brilliantly scripted crime drama with signature Tarentino exchanges and a shrewd dark humor, while the other becomes a gratuitous and mindless actioner. Most of the comments below are in regards to the first half, which is easily the strongest part of the film. Each of the cast members deliver memorable roles, with Tarentino, Clooney, and Keitel offering some of the best performances of their careers. The Geko brothers are perfectly written and played in direct juxtaposition of one another, and they are far more interesting than the one-sided vampires that replace them as the central villains in the second half. DAWN also boasts excellent cameos from Horror icons like Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Greg Nicotero, and others. KNB is sure to deliver more gooey gore FX, however their make-up for the serpentine vampires range from unique to downright goofy. Rodriguez brings the same frenetic energy to the high-powered gunfights in the end as he had in DESPERADO or EL MARIACHI, but once the action starts rolling there is an immediate shift in tone that feels quite uneven. The crossover into Mexico marks a dividing line where the plot becomes all boobs, blood, and bad CG. Despite the dramatic change the film undergoes, the lightning pace never lets up and fills every moment with laughs and blood even if it is entirely without scares. This match-up between Tarentino and Rodriguez was a sure-fire hit with most fans, and the film remains a staple 90s Horror entry that is clearly above average.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 1996 classic is not usually my kind for film because the description included the word "vampires".  But it was starring Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis.  It was also on cable TV and was certainly worth a look-see.  Well, it sure was something different for me.  And I must say I wound up loving it.<br /><br />The film starts with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a pair of bank robber brothers on the lam.  They stop by a liquor store and Quentin Tarantino brutally murders the clerk and a cop.  Immediately we see he is the demented one and throughout the film George Clooney tries to rein him in.  Well, the film gets more complicated when the brothers kidnap a family driving a mobile home and force them to sneak them over the Mexican border.  Harvey Keitel is cast as a former pastor who has lost his faith and is taking his two children, Julliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, on a vacation to Mexico.  So far, this seems like a formulaic gangster flick.<br /><br />And then the group stops at a weird and wild Mexican strip joint where Clooney and Tarantino are supposed to meet up with a connection.  This is just the beginning of a whole new aspect of this weird and wonderful film.  All the dancers are gorgeous, especially Selma Hayek who is the star of the show.  But then we find out that everyone, including all the bartenders, dancers and assorted customers are really vampires.  And that's when the film really gets creepy. The next scene seems to go on forever with blood and gore and offbeat high energy.  It is so strange that it actually becomes fun to watch.<br /><br />Perhaps I would have hated this film if it was produced by a lesser talent.  But it held me captive with its fast-paced explosive special effects.  There were times when I actually laughed out loud at its unique outrageousness.  That's why I must recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The notorious Gecko Brothers, two of America's most dangerous criminals, are on the run from the Texas police and the FBI after a crime spree through the Southwest. Across the border in Mexico, the mysterious Carlos offers sanctuary to criminals on the lam, but first they must slip past the border patrol. Enter the Fuller family: Jacob, a minister who has lost his faith and his children, the vulnerable teenage Kate and her younger brother Scott, on a road trip in their new R.V. The Gecko Brothers kidnap the Fullers and high-tail it to freedom with the promise to let the family go once they hook up with their criminal connection in Mexico. From dusk till dawn, is a weird, but unique movie in it's genre. It's entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>If you're sick of all this Twilight phenomenon that's still occurring as of today, and are looking for different and far more bad@** vampires, then you've made the right decision by finding the movie From Dusk Till Dawn here on Amazon. In this film, we not only see vampires and blood, but also some awesome action and some very dark humor. The first half of the film is basically an action adventure with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino. The second half is where the bigger mayhem is found: vampires, guns, gore, explosions, etc. And it all happens in a strip club: can it get any stranger than that? Everyone does an extraordinary job here: Clooney and Tarantino as the main protagonist; Keitel, Lewis, and Liu as supporting characters; Hayek as the sexy Satanico Pandemonium; Marin as comic relief; the direction, the music, the editing, the cinematography, everything is done with flair and verve. So forget Twilight and its "sparkly" vampires that only teenage girls will love; From Dusk Till Dawn is a real treat if you're into REAL awesome vampires.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>On their way out of Texas, leaving a deadly-crime spree in their wake, two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) scoop up an unsuspecting family (led by Harvey Keitel) and make their way across the border into Mexico. Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires.<br /><br />"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a "shoot 'em up" flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary cod-piece) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, "Grindhouse," a decade later. Those expecting anything but a good time will be sorely left in the cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series) - I saw Dusk Till Dawn with my wife and boys and knew I had made an error taking them to see it as this was not a film for kids. I should have watched it alone. I knew nothing about it until my boys asked to go see it and I wouldn't recommend it for really young audiences.<br /><br />It was chock a block full of dark murderous themes, and excellent special effects but I think it provided almost too many effects. I consider it a good film which was entertaining almost until the ending.  I just question the need for the exceptional magnitude of explicit screen violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>I had the pleasure of seeing this in the theater quite a few years ago, and very distinctly remember the experience, particularly at the halfway point when I asked if they switched movies on us.  The movie starts out as a traditional bank robber chase, then completely mutates into a far different film.  You probably need to be a guy to enjoy (and not just because of the bikini work in the 2nd half.  I really enjoyed the sets though; very creative ti**y bar in its use of lights, construction, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This thoroughly enjoyable film is masterfully put together by Tarantino and is one of his most impressive films. It's well paced and each element is fined tuned as to not cancel each other out. By that I mean, The comedy and over the top action never make the film any less horrifying.<br /><br />Tarantino also has a knack for casting his films perfectly with character actors and or surprising guest appearances by people you wouldn't expect to see in a film...or this type of film. Tom Savini FX wizard and monster maker has a great humorous role as a bad a $ $ biker and Fred Williamson as a bruising trucker!<br /><br />This is also one of the only films that I own that stars George Clooney, who is a likable guy, but I have never been a big fan. He manages to play his smarmy persona to perfection in this fun and gory fright flick.<br /><br />The film starts out like a action crime drama and turns into a hilarious and scary comedy horror film. It's really an excellent piece of work and  it's not an easy thing to accomplish! The acting is heads above films of this nature, the FX are gross.....but in a fun way and the film will breeze by it's hour and 48 minute running length.<br /><br />It's exploitation at it's best with a fair amount of naked skin at the T I T T Y Twister after hours bar! Salma Hayek's erotic dance is also a highlight! The colorful cast includes Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin(in 3 roles!)and Tarantino in a fun role as Clooney's delusional brother!<br /><br />I had seen this film a few times, but it had been a while and watching it now, you can see elements of Tarantino's future projects - The Grind House Films Presents - Planet Terror and Death Proof in this extremely wild movie! The two disc collector's edition is awesome and well worth looking for! It's loaded with feature-ettes, out takes, deleted scenes, a commentary trailers and on and on!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a bloody hilarious vampire movie w/ loads of Rodriguez action and Tarantino attitude. Sort of a strange mixture of DESPERADO, PULP FICTION, and a really good under-siege-by monsters flick; this movie starts w/ a bang and just keeps exploding! Tarantino and Clooney are as humorous as they are menacing as the notorious Gecko brothers. Their crime spree takes them to a biker / trucker bar in Mexico, where they find themselves under attack by an army of voracious, blood-sucking dancers (of the exotic variety), led by the unbelievably hot Salma Hayek! Her snake dance is seered in my memory forever! Watch as the Geckos, aided by their hostages (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis), along w/ a biker (Tom Savini) and a Viet Nam vet (Fred Williamson) do battle w/ the hordes of hell! Taking FDTD seriously is not an option. Just go with it and enjoy the fun...</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>It's hard to do much original with vampires after literally hundreds of films featuring the creatures, including excellent picks like "Near Dark" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula", but "From Dusk 'Til Dawn" is one of a few over the last decade that's injected fresh, vibrant blood into the always popular vampire subgenre, and has helped keep it a healthy subsection of the horror field.<br /><br />  With great performances from an excellent cast that includes George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Salma Hayak, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Tom Savini and Kelly Preston, it's odd in that for almost the whole first half of the movie there's no indication at all that you're seeing a horror movie.  What you've got is a superb suspense thriller/whacked-out crime drama about two convicts (Clooney and Tarantino) abducting a family in their motorhome to make a getaway down to Mexico.  When the horror elements come in, they don't creep in gradually but kick in the proverbial door howling for blood, driven by some of the best monster effects ever seen.  I don't know if this kind of pacing would work in a lot of movies, but it was extremely potent here.  A fantastic horror movie that, because of its superstar cast, has the potential to draw new fans into the entire genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Two dangerous criminal brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) are two of the most wanted criminals in the US.

The film co-stars Selma Hayak, Cheech Marin (In three roles), Danny Trejo, John Saxton, Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, and Kelly Preston with some decent performances and excellent make-up and creature effects from Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger EFX group Inc. The film is extremely violent with loads of gore including exploding heads, mutilation, eyeball ripping to more that nearly got this movie an NC-17 rating.

There really is no middle ground. As a fan of both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, this one practically had me drooling. A cinematic wet dream for movie geeks and Fangoria readers alike, &quot;Dusk&quot; is an excuse to mix underrated movie stars with yesteryear's cult heroes for plenty of violent mayhem and sharp dialouge. <p>Dawn's first half is a crime spree flick with the psychopathic Gecko Brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) kidnapping Harvey Keitel's disgruntled preacher Jacob Fuller and his kids and using them to hop the border. By the second half, it has managed to erupt into a full-out Mexican vampire bloodbath as the Geckos join forces with the survivors of a melee at a Mexican strip bar. Filled with funny one-liners, unrelenting violence, and more vampires than you can shake a stick at, &quot;Dawn&quot; is a somewhat dumb but very fun genre flick. Any movie that includes a jaw-dropping music number featuring Salma Hayek dancing around in a black G-string and matching undergarment with cleavage aplenty is sure to be a winner with at least the male demographic. <p>Miramax's double-disc DVD edition has pretty much every feature you could ask for. Quentin does his very first audio commentary as he and director Robert Rodriguez go back and forth on all the entertaining details of the film's production. If you couldn't get enough information from it, you also get the movie's original production featurette and a full-length documentary, &quot;Fult Tilt Boogie&quot; that covers nearly every aspect of the film's production. There are also a few deleted scenes. While there isn't a whole lot to offer here, there is a cool Salma Hayek snake sequence with some silly-looking digital effects. If you're a true fan of &quot;Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, you are gonna want to pick this DVD up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This is really two movies in one.  First is the ultra-violent crime spree.  Second is the ultra-violent horror film.  Packaging used to concentrate on the first part so I avoided picking this one up until recently.<p>The Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarrantino) are running for the border and leaving bodies in their wake.  One brother is rather twisted.  They kidnap a family and manage to get safely across the border to Mexico.<p>Once in Mexico they head for a biker/trucker bar to make meet their contact.  Unfortunately, the bar is actually a front for hordes of vampires.  Much violence ensues until the final climactic battle.<p>A very interesting film but it does come off as two separate pieces.  There is the crime film and then the horror film as if the film makers had two ideas and only one budget.  My biggest problem was the sheer number of vampires.  There were so many they should have bled Mexico dry years ago.<p>This film is followed by two sequels but they do not have the same characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>From Dusk to Dawn is well acted and directed but it's occasionly dumb too. I mean when the vampire band say "F this place" and just blow up has to be one of the dumbest things I seen in a movie. The movie still makes for an entertaining blood bath though. The performances by Harvey Keitel and George Clooney help make the movie watchable as well. Although the movie starts off like a Pulp Fiction style film in the first half it becomes Evil Dead with vampires in the second half. I mean George Clooney is pretty much like Ash (Evil Dead) and the vampires seem more like the demons in the Evil Dead movies than vampires.  Although the script is all over the place  Robert Rodriguez still manages to make it sexy and fun and it's still one of his better films.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XFZN4MWNKK4.html">A35XFZN4MWNKK4</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarentino stars as a deranged convict who, along with his brother, played brilliantly by GEORGE CLOONEY, kidnaps a preacher (HARVEY KIETEL),  and his two kids (which includes JULIETTE LEWIS of NATURAL BORN KILLERS)  and flees for the safety of a remote nightclub in Mexico, only once they're  there they discover that the club is actually a safe haven for blood  thirsty vampires! The plots twist was as surprising as ever as origanlly i  thought this was settling down to be a hostage drama but then thats the  genius of Tarentinos work. This movie is as compelling as ever with the  dialogue often being very darkly humorous, whilst the performances are top  notch and this film is certainly nothing short of one long, wild adventure!</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>This is a weird film, and the first half seems like just another bland crime thriller, but the second half is full of brilliant special F/X and action. If only the whole film was as good as it's climax.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>In one of my favorite films Aliens, besides one scene involving a chestburster, it's literally gore free. That is until the end when a certain artificial person gets a messy end(doesn't die but might as well be). So what happens is that one moment of gore seems more amplified because the rest of the film was completely free of it. So it is too with this film, it starts out with some violence but nothing too over the top and then boom, gore galore.<br /><br />Seth and Richard Gecko are wanted by many a government officer and need to get into Mexico, only Mexico's border crossing has more cops than before. So they kidnap a small family and break through and end up where they need to:  a seedy biker bar named the T***y Twister. A thing goes awry and the bar's workers shows their real faces: vampires. So begins a fight to survive the night.<br /><br />The 2 distinct styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are shown in a nice hybrid. Robert's penchant for fast editing mixes with Quentin's long takes and Quentin's usual snappy dialogue. It's funny that many people considered Quentin an influential director injecting a new type of film and dialogue into film, despite getting ideas from other films. The guys named after colors in Reservoir Dogs was from a different film, the many references in Kill Bill. So it's nice to see something that isn't so obviously familiar to film geeks.<br /><br />The extras are definately great. You get a long documentary on the making of the movie, a featurette, deleted scenes such as more gory moments(and you thought the human being as a guitar was bad) and Robert doing commentary on his film school like features. Also it contains Robert and the very first and to date only commentary(I believe) with Quentin Tarantino and its neat seeing their differences: Robert, composed calm and descriptive while Quentin is his usual hyperkinetic self.<br /><br />So may not like the obvious split from the Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs like opening to the big Kill Bill 1 ending last half but it's what makes that second half all the more cool and this movie is cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>i have to say this is one great movie, it had acion, horror, and comedy. seth and richard gecko are two outlaws on the run from the law, after blowing up a liqour store, they stop at a desicrated motel. there we find a family of three one father who used to be a preacher and his two kids. there the geckos capture them and steal there RV, forcing them to take them across the mexican border. when they enter the go to the randeavuos point, a seedy bar in the middle of the desert. there they are barricaded inside the bar buy the vampiers that own it. now teaming up with the hostegas and two bikers, its a kill or be killed battle against these vampires. see it it is a good move to wacth when your bored.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>That's the only real problem with this movie. Quentin Tarantino is a silly dweeb on camera, and his effort to portray a homicidal nutcase is, well, completely laughable. You have to stand up and cheer when George Clooney knocks him unconscious.<br /><br /> This isn't Quentin's strongest dialogue either--his trademarked approach of having characters talk about all manner of things to give the story &quot;realism&quot; seems forced. Also, the directing isn't what you'd expect from a Tarantino movie--shots are at times cliche, forced, and anything but subtle. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderfully realized scenes. But Tarantino didn't direct this, and it shows.<br /><br /> Now here's what's good. George Clooney, Harvey Keital and, yes, even Juliette Lewis turn in terrific, engaging performances. Now this isn't Shakespeare. It's Thelma and Louise meets Bonnie and Clyde meets 28 Days Later, with a humor, vampires, and a Holy Water supersoaker thrown in for good measure. Bear in mind, this is one violent, gory, and bloody film. If you've got a problem with that, go elsewhere.<br /><br /> And a review of From Dusk Till Dawn would not be complete without mentioning that Salma Hayek does a dance that is all the proof you need that she may well be the most beautiful, sexy woman in Hollywood. I never want to meet her, though, because I'm scared that when she opens her mouth she'll be dumb as a doorknob, and there's nothing sexy about that.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Directed by Robert Rodriguez with a script written by Quentin Tarantino who also co-stars in it, this film resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl: "When it's good, it's very, very good but when it's bad...." Not much of a plot. Two psychopathic brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) kidnap a fallen-away minister (Keitel) and his two children, commandeer their van, and head south to Mexico to do business with drug dealers at The Titty Twister roadhouse. As in El Mariachi (1992) and then Desperado (1995) which Rodriguez also directed, the emphasis is on interaction between and among characters to create intense moments which may or may not advance the plot, such as it is. Rodriguez is a master of creating a stunning variety of atmospherics (hilarity, menace, confusion, bravado, etc.) amidst truly inspiring posturing by his lead characters. Moments of delicious tenderness are suddenly obliterated by gratuitous violence, both verbal and physical. I probably should have seen it coming but I didn't: Those who frequent Titty Twister roadhouse (only open from dusk until dawn, of course) are vampires. The Gecko brothers and their companions find themselves in harm's way and then....<p>I always enjoy spotting veteran actors in subordinate roles. In this film, for example, Michael Parks (Texas Ranger Earl McGraw), John Saxon (FBI Agent Stanley Chase), Marc Lawrence (Old Timer) and Selma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium). At one point, as the roadhouse band performs "Mary Had a Little Lamb," I wondered if Stevie Ray Vaughan was also in this film. (He isn't.) This film is obviously not for everyone. (For Rodriguez and Tarantino, that may well be a badge of honor.) The quality of acting is superior to the plot; the aforementioned atmospherics are superior to whatever "messages" Rodriguez and Tarantino may have intended to send to their audience. Almost everyone who sees this film will either enjoy it or stop watching it long before its conclusion. Whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Having trouble finding a good vampire flick that's exciting and scary?  Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules?  &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; may be the one to choose.  With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember.<p>The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border.  They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact.  However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers.  You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget.<p>I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an EXCELLENT movie.  It's unpredictable and exhilarating.  You have no idea where the movie will take you until it's all said and done.  This is not your ordinary vampire flick, and that's what makes this movie so great.  It's a breath of fresh air and so much more.<p>The acting really makes the movie what it is.  George Clooney gives a remarkable performance (this was before he was the big star that he is today).  Quentin Tarantino does a great job of contributing dark and chaotic humor to the film with his role.  Other major players include Harvey Keitel, Juliet Lewis, Cheech Marin and plenty more.  The screenplay by Tarantino is great and never misses a beat.  It's packed with snappy dialogue that one would not expect to hear in a horror movie.  Rodriguez does an exceptional job of directing as well.<p>I don't have the fully loaded version of the movie, so I am stuck with the plain version for now.  The picture quality looks pretty good, considering that it isn't enhanced for widescreen TVs.  The sound is really lacking, though.  I had to keep fumbling around with the volume controls throughout the movie, as it kept going from being quiet to extremely loud.  That might be reason enough to get the Collector's Edition of the film.  A theatrical trailer and teaser trailer are both included on the DVD, but those are the only extra features you'll find on this DVD version.<p>&quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; is a wildly entertaining flick that really stands out from the others.  It has some extremely funny moments, as well as some very scary and exciting sequences.  This movie pretty much has it all.  If you're looking for a horror/thriller movie that isn't like the rest, give this one a try.  This is definitely one of my favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I've seen quite a few films featuring writer/producer/director/actor (that last credit is given grudgingly) Quentin Tarantino's involvement in some form or other, my favorite being True Romance (1993) and my least favorite being Natural Born Killers (1994), both of which he wrote.  One thing I've noticed throughout is Tarantino must be one of the biggest movie fans (he seems to thrive on the exploitive) I've ever seen, perhaps even bigger than me.  How do I figure this?  Because his films seem to be comprised of many other films, hucking parts of them into a blender, adding a dose of his own, skewed originality, a pinch of spunk (figuratively or literally, whichever you prefer), and hitting pur&eacute;e.  Many adore him, many hate him (I fall somewhere in-between), but for me, he does entertain, and what more could you ask (a lot, I suppose, but you probably ain't gonna get it)?  From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) features a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Sin City).  The film stars George Clooney (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Harvey Keitel (The Piano), Juliette Lewis (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), and Tarantino himself.  Also appearing is a myriad of notables including the very curvaceous Salma Hayek (Frida), Cheech Marin (The Shrimp on the Barbie), character actor Danny Trejo (Con Air), special effects artist and actor Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead), 70's blaxploitation star Fred Williamson (Hell Up in Harlem, Black Caesar), Michael Parks (Escape from Bogen County), John Saxon (Enter the Dragon), and Kelly Preston (Mischief).<br /><br />The film begins with two brothers, Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, on the run from the law.  Seems these two have been very bad boys, first robbing a bank, and then killing a number of law enforcement agents during their escape (the brothers being the ones escaping, not the law enforcement agents...geez, why would law enforcement agents be trying to escape?  Stay with me here).  As we spend time with the brothers, we learn that the killings probably occurred at the hands of Richard, as he seems to be on the violent and unstable side (great combo, by the way), while Seth appears to be the brains, and possessing a much more firm grasp on reality.  Anyway, the boys make it to Texas, their intent being to take the money from the bank job and live a life of luxury south of the border.  Only problem is the law enforcement types, especially angered at the death of a few of their own, have thrown up a dragnet, and are closing in on the pair.  Seeing their chances of making it across the border on their own ranging from slim to none (and slim just left town), the pair hitches a ride with Jakob Fuller (Keitel), his daughter Kate (Lewis), and Jakob's adopted son, in the family's recreational vehicle.  The group does manage to slip through the border, and end up in the seediest biker bar you'll ever see, where Seth and Richard await contact with an associate who'll take them to the promised land, that is if they can survive the night as the bar turns out to be the equivalent of a vampiric roach motel, humans check in, but they don't check out.<br /><br />I can see where this film might put some off, and I'm not just talking about the copious amounts of graphic violence (the film was actually toned down in this regard, if you can believe it.  Look for the deleted scenes in the special features section to see what was cut).  The movie starts off as one film (and action-type thriller), and then about an hour in, breaks off into an entirely different film (vampires, and those who kill them).  The transition isn't entirely seamless, but I went with it anyway.  Probably the best element in the film is George Clooney, as he not only has many of the best lines, but also delivers them in a convincing manner.  Harvey Keitel is certain worth watching, yet he seemed to take his part just a bit too seriously at times, in my opinion, but this was offset by Clooney and his underlying jovialness.  Lewis, whom I don't care for in general, did alright, and actually looked kinda cute, albeit a trifle skinny for my tastes.  Tarantino was probably the weakest element in the film, but at least he and director Rodriguez had the good sense to populate the film with enough talent to offset this factor.  If you're not a fan of the graphic violence, then you should avoid this one, as its loaded with visceral goriness (I read they decided to go with green blood for the vampires as to get much of the violence past the censors).  I thought the direction by Rodriguez to be very strong, as he kept the film rolling along at a swift pace, and set the mood wonderfully not only with well thought out shots, but also a lot of interesting and applicable musical selections.  I especially liked the song played during Selma Hayek's seductive dance routine.  It was as beautiful as the actress herself...and speaking of Hayek, I don't think I've ever seen anyone fill out a bikini as well as she does...that scene might be worth the price of the disk alone.<br /><br />The non-anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture is very good, and the audio is superior.  Special features include a commentary track by Tarantino and Rodriguez, along with ads, two music videos, outtakes, three featurettes, still gallery, deleted/alternate scenes, and cast/crew bios.  Also included is a 2nd DVD with a full-length feature titled Full Tilt Boogie, a film shot during the shooting schedule of From Dusk Till Dawn.  The film was followed by two direct to video sequels, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) and From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000).  There is a box set with all these movies, but compare the price against the individual releases (I think the latter is cheaper).<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>In the early months of 1995, talented Mexican director Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado, The Faculty) and cunning cinematic guru Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown) merged artistic passions to compose an intricate genre hybrid that evokes both the artists unique sensibilities, emanates mind-bogglingly unthinkable comical insights, and reveals an abrasively hip yet sophisticated screen persona that supplies unforeseen drama within the forum of an exploitation film. Surging with distinctive Tarantino culture dialogue and references, Rodriguez's go-for-broke action sequences, marvelous performances from Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, John Saxon, Tom Savini, and Cheech Marin (in three supporting roles!!!), an unyieldingly concentrated pace, spectacular comedic splicing with its horror elements, splendid gore and make-up effects, and a predominantly mischievous ambiance of unpredictability that leaves any first-time viewer totally in hands of Rodriguez and Tarantino, From Dusk Til Dawn persists in being a heavily  entertaining dual genre piece that attains dramatic grandeur, profound performances, and even moving pathos within the framework of exploitation piece.<p>The film depicts the story of the infamous Gecko Brothers', Seth (George Clooney) and Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino), odyssey from their violent southern Texas exploits to their arrival at the unforgettable Titty Twister bar. Along the way, the Gecko brothers inadvertently blow up a liquor store, hallucinate flirtations and verbal taunts, &quot;accidentally&quot; rape and murder a seemingly docile hostage, and kidnap a disillusioned pastor's family and their motor home on their way to their bar rendezvous across the Mexican border. Though these characters may seem to be the most unsympathetic characters to be rooting for. Tarantino's knack for instilling humanity into his criminals is second to none, and along the way towards the bar and the film's personality switch, through absorbing dialogue, gritty performances, and realistic plot developments (in the Tarantino half), we are given unusually affable characters that allow the audience just enough audience identification with the characters before they are literally placed into hell incarnate.  While watching From Dusk Til Dawn, it crucial to note the film's story arc is essentially one-half Tarantino crime tale/ one-half gory horror gore opus. This was done I believe to introduce the characters, personality dynamics, and innate personal tendencies of the people in their real environments before establishing the horror. What happens quite often in horror films of the last two decades is we, the audience, are immediately transported to the improbable before we even really know our characters. The characters of a movie are our conduits into the realm and the story of a movie. Doesn't it seem probable that if we have an enhanced understanding of the characters we might enjoy the film's narrative a lot more? From Dusk Til Dawn follows this mentality to its most logic summation as character and style overcome commercial convention.<p>Since it release, From Dusk Til Dawn consistently besieges it audiences with an intoxicatingly visceral affront of violence, mayhem, elaborate chaos, and inventive havoc that entertains and delights beyond anyone's expectations. Though definitely not Academy Award material so to speak, From Til Dawn remains a superlative horror extravaganza.<p>As for the film's new DVD Collector's Series edition, FDTD contains an informative Rodriguez/Tarantino commentary track, a feature length documentary entitled &quot;Full Tilt Boogie&quot;, extensive outtakes, deleted scenes, two music videos, the theatrical trailer, and much much more. A Definite Must for any Horror Fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Somewhere in Texas, bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his brother Ritchie are in a tight spot. They've got two gorgeous hostages at gunpoint (who were those angels anyway, and why were their roles so small?), and are anxiously waiting for the local lawman to make his way out of the roadside liquor store they're hiding in. Things don't move fast enough for psychopath Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) when the cop asks to use the restroom, so bullets start flying. Let the bloodbath begin! From here on out, it's carnage candy, Tarantino/Rodriguez style!<br /><br />Seth and Ritchie, who is now shot through the hand, head south for the Mexican border with a ton of dirty money and a slightly less attractive hostage in their trunk (why they let those other two go and kept this one I'll never understand). They eventually stop at a cruddy little motel to eat and plan their next move. Seth foolishly leaves the hostage with his maniacal brother as he goes out for burgers. When he returns, he finds her a victim of rape and murder; brother Ritchie acting like the innocent victim. These guys have problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the completely innocent Fuller family, former Minister Jacob and his two teenage children Scott and Kate, have found themselves at the same motel. Seth eyes their motor home and decides it's exactly the transportation he and his brother need to get them across the border with their money, and to the nudie bar where they plan to meet their shady business associates in the morning. Before we know it, the Fuller family is taken hostage, and the whole gang is on the road down Mexico way. After a brief search by a perverted Border Patrol Agent, our little group of adventurers is given the okay to cross, and soon enough they find themselves at the most boisterous gentlemen's club on either side of the border. Once inside, the gang is treated to a show like most of them have never seen before, featuring Salma Hayek as the main attraction. But when Ritchie gets himself into a scuffle and his bloody hand starts flowing red again, the mood of the hosts begins to change, drastically. As it turns out, the ancient Mexican nudie bar is run entirely by vampires! Soon, our anti-hero Seth is leading his hostages and a couple of new friends on a fight to save their lives, at least until dawn!<br /><br />From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what you'd expect from a Tarantino/Rodriguez vampire collaboration! And, like all the Tarantino films I've seen so far, every second of it is totally captivating. You don't want to miss a moment! Yes, it's violent to the extreme, but you should be expecting that. There's more than that, though. You get a Tarantino style tale of redemption, survival, and triumph of the human spirit over the most evil of adversaries. The entire cast is first rate, including Tom Savini's best work as "Sex Machine," the outlaw biker, reminiscent of the character he played in the original Dawn of the Dead. This film is part "Pulp Fiction," part "Night of the Living Dead," and part "Vamp," all rolled into one kickbutt ball of pure adrenaline. With the awesome make-up and creature effects and the excellent soundtrack, it's easily among the best Vampire movies ever made. And, for me, the real payoff is that pull-away shot in the end, when we get the FULL view of the Mexican nudie-bar. Definitely one to watch over and over again. I also can recommend "From Dusk Till Dawn 3," a pretty decent direct to video prequel that tells the tale of how Salma Hayek's character came to be the leader of this very ancient clan of bloodsuckers. From "Dusk Till Dawn 2" wasn't all that great on the other hand, but hey, it's not unwatchable, and ya gotta have the whole set. Oh, one more thing! I'm serious, where can I find out more about those two angelic hostages in the beginning, Aimee and Heidi? God, they were gorgeous! E-mail me, ladies!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I always liked "From Dusk Till Dawn" but till yesterday when I rewatched it after long period of not watching I didn't realize how much I really do adore this movie. Only now I somehow understood how ingenious and perfect it is. Directing is great (as Robert Rodriguez admits in commentaries it was done with much of a help from Quentin Tarantino), cast is awesome: George Clooney is right on his place here, this was the first movie I saw him in and was pretty imoressed by his acting. For Tarantino as I think this was just the best work ever. Harvey Keitel is amazing as always. Not to mention Juliet Lewis, Denny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini and cameos by John Saxon and Kelly Preston. The film's done perfect technically and visually the plot is hilarious, call it whatever you want - comedy, horror, action, thriller, criminal film - it's all there. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a unique movie made by talents of many people involved. Such set of circumstances happens rather seldom like a solar eclipse. So enjoy!<br /><br />And on the edition itself I'd say it's one of the best I've seen speaking of amount of bonus features. Many deleted scenes (that are really interesting unlike in other movies' editions) with commentaries, on the set features, outtakes that are so funny they worth the whole picture... Anyway you won't be disappointed by this 2-disc edition. I guess I'll watch it again in a couple of weeks :)</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>The commentary from the director and writer was very verbose. They rarely talked about the scenes. This was a commentary that was easier to listen to if you weren't actually watching the movie. Scenes would trigger memories of events happening as they were making the movie and they would go off on tangents for long periods. Although the stories they relate are interesting, I'd prefer they actually talked about scenes in the movie.  Another drawback to the commentaries was you couldn't change them by using the `Change Audio' button, but had to change it at the main menu.  Since you couldn't hear the dialogue during the commentary, it would have been nice to be able to easily switch back and forth. The full-length documentary film `Full Tilt Boogie' was interesting and showed what it was like shooting the film.  This comes on a completely separate DVD. The name of the documentary comes from a line one of the crew uses to describe the shooting of the film. The gallery stills run very fast and aren't that interesting. The music videos include the song used for Salma's dance. This is just lifted from the film and some other shots from the film are intercut, but nothing new. The Zztop song is included and features Clooney and Salma in a completely different location. It looks like someone's expense house. The plot for the video isn't very interesting. The outtakes are mainly actors not getting their lines right and aren't funny.  The cut scenes aren't very interesting either. The longest one being a much more graphic and gross bar fight scene which even I couldn't stomach. The director also gives commentary on how he shot the opening scene and the bar fight scenes. This was along the lines of his commentary for `Desperado', only not as good. Finally the a 30-minute featurette is also included and gives some more interviews with the cast and crew, some scenes are lifted from `Full Tilt Boogie.' Overall, I'd say if you have this film on the previously released DVD, I wouldn't bother replacing it. There is nothing interesting enough that is added.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>The movie starts off great. Instantly you hate George Clooney's character but are intrigued at the same time because he does a bad guy so well. I have always liked Harvey Keitel and Juliet Lewis as well. The acting was pretty good across the board, the music was great, the special effects were good (some really cool looking vampires in this one), and the gore was over the top, so why the low rating? Simple, this movie takes a nose dive when it turns into a vampire movie. Not because vampires aren't cool, and not because they're done poorly (they're not), but at the unbelievable reactions of the patrons. All of a sudden it's as though all of them (the ones not initially eaten) have been expert vampire killers their whole life. There is no surprise, no sense of fear, no sense of amazement, just a sort of attitude of "okay, time to kill a bunch of vampires, yawn" As another reviewer put it, if I saw a vampire, no, make that if anyone saw a vampire they would be gripped with fear. I wanted to see some of that. The completely unrealistic reactions of the patrons turned what could have been a scary, amazing vampire thriller into a cartoon. It was even more cartoon like how they went about killing the vampires. Dropping them on a table leg with a completely flat bottom. Excuse me, but how exactly is that supposed to go through a body, unless the body is made of play dough? The vampires are so easy to kill in this movie it's only their numbers that make them a nuisance.<br /><br />It is apparent the decision was made to turn the vampire half of the movie into a kind of tongue in cheek, comedy, but it didn't work. Robert Rodriquez is a fantastic director. Planet Terror is one of my all time favorite horror movie's ever. That film managed to expertly combine humor and horror, from Dusk Till Dawn does not. This movie deserved a much better treatment of the vampire half. Serious, not "okay, the vampires are here let's start killing em." For the male viewers the movie is worth watching right till the end of the drop gorgeous Selma Hayek's sexy dance, then it can be safely turned off.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I love it.

With Quentin Tarantino's brilliant writing and Robert Rodriguez's flashy direction, how can we go wrong? One of the key elements that adds to this film's good quality is the character development. How often do you watch an action film where two characters are about to get killed, yet there's a character development sequence preceding their death? That's how the movie opens. The tone is set with a conversation between an overworked Texas ranger (Michael Parks) and a puny liquor store clerk. All the other characters are well-developed as well. Yet the development of these characters never seem to ruin the pace. In fact, it brings you into the film even more.<br /><br /> George Clooney is a very convincing villain, and was perfectly cast. Quentin Tarantino is good as his paranoid, whiny, perverse, psychotic brother--though I don't know if that's much of a stretch for him. The great Harvey Keitel gives a brilliant, subtle, underrated performance as a faithless former minister, who now has to regain his faith when faced with these demons (vampires) from hell. I think it's one of his best performances, and definitely a lot different from his usual roles. Cheech Marin is amusing in three (that's right! three!) performances: a border patrol guard, a greasy bouncer and a Mexican dealer. Eddie Murphy, look out! Juliette Lewis, though she's significantly older than the character she's playing, plays a nice supporting role. Another score for Ernest Liu who gives a fine debut performance as Keitel's adopted Japanese son. Salma Hayek is sexy as ever in the role that put her on the map.<br /><br />Personally, I felt the film worked out better as a crime drama than a horror movie. I enjoyed the second half, but I enjoyed the first half a lot better. The horror portion is very well-done, and not the least bit cheesy, but the film seems to go a little off-balance in its transition. Nevertheless, it's still a blast! And Rodriguez is very original in reprising one of the most-known sub-genres of horror: the vampire movie. He does a great job at combining dark comedy with the gratuitous violence and gore. For example, when Cheech turns (into a vampire) he approaches the terrified Juliette Lewis and says, "You know what people say about me: I suck!" One to keep and enjoy over and over again</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>This is an action extravaganza.

They head south to Mexico, but when their forced to face vampire, they have to team up to survive.<br /><br />This is one of George Clooney's best performances.

The first half is classic Tarintino with excellent dialogue and bizarre situations. The second half is entirely different than anything Q.T. has ever done. At first I didn't like it, because I was hoping for another Pulp fiction, but after I let it stand on its own I realized it is very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film is exploitative trash and not in the good sense of the word.  There are three things that redeem this film from the trash heap of total worthlessness.  Harvey Keitel, even in a trashy enterprise like this, delivers a decent performance as a preacher who is grappling with his faith.  Even in junk like this Keitel didn't succumb to the urge to just phone it in.  Cheech Marin has an amusing bit as the strip club's barker.  Lastly, Salma Hayek's snake-dance.  Thank God for chapter search, otherwise, you would have to sit through the rest of this dreck to get to the good parts.  On a final note, Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the worst acting performances known to man.  This is no reflection on the sicko character that he plays, it's just unadulterated bad acting.  Tarantino is a great director but he is no actor.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>The disc is great.

Quentin decided that he wanted to write and act in a film, and he shows he can't act for &%$%&.  He is really bad here.  His script is really boring, filled with cliches, and just used as an excuse to show carnage and gore at the end of the film.

Avoid, avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever.  Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of "From Dusk Till Dawn," and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make.  The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them.  And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a "Pulp Fiction," or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance.  But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality.  And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this "B-" schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.<p>The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course.  Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu).  Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors.  What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.<p>In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers.  Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows.  And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie.  At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.<p>With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs,"-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it.  Straight down into the ground.  The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression.  And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible.  Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.<p>If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all.  Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener.  And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.<p>As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision.  In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.<p>The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge).  A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, "From Dusk Till Dawn" will no doubt find it's own niche in the "cult film" Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand.  If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions.  But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever.  In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time.

There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.<br /><br />However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough.

I don't care, all I know is that this is a really cool flick! The opening dialogue between the Texas Ranger and the unfortunate store clerk is worth the price of the disk alone! I can't believe there are reviewers here who say that this story isn't original! Please name one other movie that mixes so many genre's together in such a successful way??!! When I first heard about "Dusk" I didn't have much hope for it, I mean let's face at the time this was released Clooney was still doing "ER", and basically any movie starring one of NBC's stars from a "Must See TV" show was to be avoided like the plague, "Fools Rush In" with Mathew Perry, or "Ed" with Matt LeBlanc anyone?? So I went to see "Dusk" with some reservation, and I was immediately blown away. I won't go into much detail about the film, because if you don't know what it's about....then buy it and watch without reading further!! Suffice to say, it will be money well spent, and you will get quite a few hours of entertainment from the film and it's extras. If you like horror films, you are gonna like this...Tom Savini's cameo is a real treat. If you like action, cops & robbers shoot 'em ups, you will like this as well. This may be one of the most original movies to pour out of Hollywood in the 90's, and one you shouldn't miss. Go into it with an open mind, and yes there is gore aplenty, but if you are familiar with Tarantino that shouldn't come as any surprise and does not get in the way of the story, any more than the blood quotient affected "Kill Bill". Just sit back and enjoy this bizarre and horrifying journey.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>I truly hate this movie called "From Dusk Till Dawn"...it is horrible!!!  What a loser of a vampire movie this was.  "From Dusk Till Dawn" is about as terrible as a flick can get.  I can only reluctantly write a review about this trash, but if it will save some real horror movie fans' money, I guess I will have to do it.  This movie has Quentin Tarratino's hands all over it and I was apprehensive about it from that standpoint, but when I actually sat down and watched this stinking garbage, I just rolled my eyes and suffered through one of the worst vampire movies ever made.  Here's the bottom line: if you are looking for rotten garbage, buy this DVD...but, on the other hand, if you are looking for a good horror movie or a good vampire movie, avoid this like the plague that it is.  I'm not going to rehash this absurdity of a plot, but I will say that it involves a group of people that end up going to some ridiculous strip club that is full of vampires...yes, I know that the storyline is ridiculous, and the acting is average and that does include Mr. Clooney. Basically, this movie turns out to be an outrageous gorefest signifying NOTHING and with STUPID and cheesey comedy...it's not scary whatsoever or even remotely intelligent.  Ladies and gentlemen, this movie is a total joke!!  If you are a sophisticated and intelligent horror movie fan, you should STAY AWAY from this trash...you'll thank me later.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay to this tribute to B-grade horror films which had Robert Rodriguez at the helm.  Tarantino and George Clooney star as the Gecko Brothers; two looney outlaws on a crime spree that kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Lieu) to get across the Mexican border and are to meet an accomplace at a seedy bar.  But little do they know that this bar is overrun with vampires, and this is where the fun begins.  Honestly to all of those giving From Dusk Till Dawn a bad review have either never seen it or are still whining about the success of Pulp Fiction; From Dusk Till Dawn is a tribute to B-grade horror films of old that Mystery Science Theater 3000 loves to spoof, and that is what makes this film so fun.  The first half is a road movie which establishes the characters so the viewer can get to know them.  Keitel and Clooney are great in they're roles, especially when they have to interact with each other.  The second half of the film is an over the top blood spewing gore fest (of the R rated kind) that will have you laughing your head off if your not one of those delicate types.  All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a blatantly cheesy horror movie that is just a reminder of the days when you could have fun while making a movie, and the audience can have even more fun watching it.  The great cast includes Cheech Marin (in three roles), Fred Williamson (blaxploitation extrordonaire), super sexy Salma Hayek, Kelly Preston, B-movie god John Saxon, and gore meister Tom Savini as a whip brandashing biker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>If you want a movie with a great cast, this is it: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, consistently hilarious Cheech Marin, Juliette Lewis, Fred Williamson, the gorgeous Salma Hayek, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo (who, like Luis Guzman, always makes a movie better), legendary makeup artist Tom Savini (aka Sex Machine), and Kelly Preston even has a bit part!  Some may not be fans of Tarantino as an actor, but there is no denying that the power this cast has easily overshadows Tarantino's limits, and would probably even cover for Keanu Reeves.  Maybe.<br /><br />If you want a visceral gore-fest, this is it: vampire parts fly in gory, green explostions; whole people explode, arms and next get gouged, stakes get rammed, and there's even a scene where Fred Williamson literally rips out a person's heart.  This is a graphically violent film for the lovers of over the top violence.  If your primary reason for watching CSI is SPECIFICALLY to see blood spatter (read: blood showers), then this might be up your alley.<br /><br />If you want a surreal, exploitative movie made explicitly for the thrills, this is it: a Holy Water super-soaker, vampires of all shapes and sizes, a penis-revolver, a shotgun/table leg cross, perhaps the most attractive collection of hookers and dancers ever seen (especially in a grungy P.O.S. bar just over the U.S. - Mexican border), and a corpse guitar are enough to cause a laugh-riot and sensory overload, sure to satiate even the most impatient movie-goer.<br /><br />If you want action-adventure, this is it: Psychopathic and violent, Brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko are wreaking havoc on their way towards a rendezvous with their contact in a run-down Mexican strip-joint/brothel/bar.  Along the way they murder and pillage, then take a family - Jakob Fuller (Keitel), daughter Kate (Lewis), and Jakob's adopted son - hostage to add the tension.  Determining who will survive the ordeal is difficult as is, but when the group finally descends upon the "Titty Twister" (the bar), and the vampire strippers and truckers begin to show their teeth, the action goes to eleven almost immediately after pulling up a barstool.<br /><br />Add in Tarantino's famous tongue-twisting dialogue and nearly perfect screenplay, direction from Robert Rodriguez that keeps the movie rocking, superb camerawork, extras pouring out of the DVD case (commentary from Tarantino and Rodriguez, music videos, deleted scenes, bios, etc.), and THE most seductive table-top dance scene in movie history (courtesy of Salma Hayek), and the result is one best guilty pleasure movies ever made, and just a great time overall.  I actually pity you if you can't shut the critical analysis portion of your brain off long enough to enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>The first half of this movie is very Quinten Tarantino, the dialogue and the way everything is paced reminds me of his other movies alot.  The second half drops a little in quality and the dialogue that is Tarantino becomes average TV movie talk.  Harvey Keitel would have been alot better without his Texas accent, but he was still good.  Tarantino's character was interesting and not what I would have expected, but I wish that they would've spent more time on him once he turned into a vampire.  George Clooney's character, Seth, was exactly like every other character I've seen him play.  Clooney is probably one of the least versatile actors I know of.  As this is a Robert Rodriguez film it wouldn't be complete without his leading lady, Salma Hayek.  This film contains a scene featuring her for not long enough, but it's definately a high point in the movie for any male.  As this is a vampire movie, and it is sold as a vampire movie, one of the things preventing me from classifying it as "Very Good" is the fact that vampires really don't have a big part in it at all.  Sure, they have a long stretch (featuring Tom Savini acting, which is great) but the film doesn't have the feel of a vampire movie's sense of dread.  It may be funny at times, but the vampires aren't used enough throughout the story as a threat.  The police are played up as more of an enemy as the vampires, and that to me is sad.  Another thing is that this movie is about 1 hr. 40 minutes or so, yet it feels like a movie drags on forever.  Anyway, it's still an entertaining film and I recommend it to anyone interested, but I cannot in anyway guarantee that you will enjoy it.<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />This film is for no one under 13 years old.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek and Quentin<br />Tarantino star in Robert Rodriguez's 1996 horror film.

"Dusk" is actually two hyper-violent movies.  The first half tracks the sociopath Gecko brothers (Tarantino & Clooney) as they escape across Texas with the fruits of their latest heist.  Their goal: Mexico, where they will find sanctuary with a crime lord played by Marin.  To get across the border, they hijack an RV driven by Harvey Keitel (as a lapsed preacher) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).  At first hostages, Keitel and co. bond with the crazy Gecko's if only to keep them from killing anybody.  Once in Mexico, things change quickly - Gecko's meeting is placed at some horrid cross-border bar/strip-club/brothel.  At first, it appears to be the Gecko's kind of place - until the bar's owners reveal themselves to be vicious, blood sucking vampires.  Trapped inside the hellish bar, and barely surviving the first battle with the vampires, the Gecko's forge an uneasy alliance with the remaining human patrons - their hostages, as well as a cool vet named Frost (Fred Williamson) and a biker played by horror legend Tom Savini.  Their goal - to survive the night.<br /><br />This was not only an extremely violent, gory and supercharged movie, but seems to exist for that alone.  The script posits gratuitous action for no purpose.  Even the vampire plot seems to drop out of nowhere, ending an interesting rapport between Clooney and Keitel.  Trapped inside the evil bar, it's less a movie than an R-rated Haunted-House ride.  That said, the movie is godawful fun, with Rodriguez painfully and hysterically finding different ways for the humans to dispatch the vampires.  The script is laced with wicked lines - most by George Clooney.  This has to be one of the most wickedly guilty pleasures since "The Last Boy Scout" and about the furthest thing you can get from a chick-flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Rodriquez has got the juice. putting action and horror into one. so radical.

The second half is our heroes fighting off vampires in a strip club. The two don't come together very well, but both halves are executed perfectly with a cutting edge and some very cool dialogue. This film is all about blood, violence, and gore mixed with some T&A, making this a young man's dream movie. Constantly exciting and always taut, "From Dusk till Dawn" is the perfect movie for parties or just hangin out with the guys. The special effects are cool, the direction is slick and the acting is [excellent].</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Evil Mexican Vampire Strippers" -- sounds very cheesy, no? Well, as a matter of fact, "From Dusk Till Dawn" is. It's also weirdly entertaining in a gory, cheesy, bizarre vampire-laden way, with over-the-top vampires, crossbow-wielding teens, and ministers kicking butt alongside killer bank robbers. <p>The Gecko brothers are a pair of robbers on the run from the cops: Seth (George Clooney), a murdering thug with a few scruples left, and Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) a murdering rapist psycho thug who has none. After destroying a roadside liquor, Ritchie "accidently" rapes and murders their hostage (no details are shown), and they take an ex-minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage kids hostage. <p>Soon they ramble over the Mexican border in the minister's RV, to a strip club called... well, I probably can't say what it's called on amazon.com. But when a bar-brawl turns ugly, a snake-charming stripper (a cameo by Salma Hayek) suddenly turns into a not-so-pretty vampire. And Seth, his ex-hostages,<p>This is a B-movie in every sense, and there's something appealingly cheesy about it. It's a bit predictable -- you know as certain moments approach that so-and-so is going to turn around and be a vampire, you know that Jacob is going to regain his faith... but who cares? If you're looking for amazing plot twists, this is not the movie to watch. The first half is a seedy, gritty hostage situation; the second half is an unashamed flying-body-parts-wallow-in-the-black-gore-fest. <p>These vampires are not in the gorgeous stylish Anne Rice mold -- they are, pardon the pun, ugly as sin. The dialogue is mostly snappy except for the occasional line like "Welcome to slavery." The sets are impressively run-down, seedy and dusty, and the torchlit tunnel didn't even make me laugh at all. (Although as a woman, I would have preferred less stripping -- I fast-forwarded through that part. Or was Rodriegez making a comment on stripper clubs by filling them with evil vampires?) And it takes a good director to not make me laugh at vampire heads bursting into flame as a kid flings holy water balloons at them, or the "disco ball" scene near the end.<p>Weirdly, Clooney actually makes us care about Seth; he has virtually no redeeming characteristics until the vampires start up. Then we get to see a certain change of heart in him now that he's seen that, including the surreal but effective scene where he lectures Jacob on God, heaven, hell, and why he now believes in them (now there's irony for you!). Ritchie has no such luck scriptwise; this psychotic creep was more appealing as a vampire than as a human. Keitel also manages a poignant moment, such as the scene where he insists that his kids kill him if and when he transforms into a vampire. <p>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a cult film in the best sense of it: Either you'll love it, or you'll hate it. It's a stupid vampire flick in every sense of the word, which is why (except for the stripping) I guiltily enjoyed it. (Not for the weak of stomach)</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>words for this movie......funny,a little scary and sexy! salma looked darn good in this flick! that band playing that music was funny, and some of those women vampires was scary! good movie to rent or own!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie I tell you starts out as a cops and robber type deal then ends up horror film. No lie I do like the film despite its unevenness. It was kind of hard for me to "switch gears" when it turned horror, but before long, I was into it. I think Clooney and Tarantino made a great on screen duo. I liked the way they were so opposite, even though they were brothers.<br /><br /> To me one of the BEST scenes in this film was when they have the female bank teller hostage in the motel. Clooney goes out for food (Anyone catch the bag from Big Kahuna Burger/Pulp Fiction?) and leaves Tarantino to watch the hostage. Upon his return, he finds that his brother has massacred the teller...they never show her dead...just split seconds of her body intertwined with the twitching expression of shock on Clooney's face. That scene said more than showing the victim could ever say. Now that's what I call a great moment in filmmaking! Towards the middle of the film Hayek does a lewd dance with a snake which probably make any mans shorts explode.<br /><br />My favorite line is when Clooney responds to Cheech Marin, "...Did they look like psychos?! Do psychos explode in sunlight?!..."  This is such a man's flick; I mean the reviewers here proves my case. From Dusk Till Dawn is action, camp, and horror all in one. And might I add, Clooney looks fab and that tattoo is pretty tight! I do like Quentin Tarantino's movies. This is no exception. It's filled with Quentin's wacky characters and twisted plot. This disc is a must for the die hard Tarantino fans or horror movie fans.<br /><br />P.S. The sequels are complete garbage stick to the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This movie is a four star fun fest from the 90's but this blu ray is cut rate with no extras at all , however the picture looks much better than on the truly awful<br />echo bridge blu ray from the states.

Tarantino is the psychotic of the two and Clooney has to deal with him, reminding me of a Steinbeck novel that has nothing to do with this film.<br /><br />Tarantino demonstrates he is as talented in front of the camera as he is behind.

You can bemoan it for robbing you of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or, you can sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, "I can't believe that just happened," speed boat that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's collaborations on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both men. George Clooney steals most every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator brother. Wasn't quite the joyride I'd remembered it as, but still provided a few laughs and a barrel full of blood.</p></br></body></html>

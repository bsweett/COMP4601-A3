Plus I always thought Aurora was by far the most beautiful female character by Disney animators, hehe.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Following in the hard to fill footsteps of Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty is totally and completely detached from the way typical Disney fairy tales are told.  The movie has more of a storybook feel to it than it's predecessors.  The art style is completely original, it resembles a medevil/gothic approach.  The characters are wonderful, and the evil fairy Malificent is one of the most creative and evil of all the Disney villains.  The music is very good and addictive and it whisks you away to another world.  It is a once upon a dream.  See it if you love Disney films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Disney's 1959 groundbreaking, animated epic production SLEEPING BEAUTY Special Edition, the first animated feature drawn and photographed in a widescreen format (70mm Technirama), finally arrives on DVD in a glorious, fully-restored two-disc edition with superb, re-mixed surround sound and a wealth of extras.  It's the 14th Century and evil queen Malificent curses Aurora, the king's infant daughter, taking away her happily-ever-after. Or so it would seem.  <p>The brilliant interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score and the distinctive medieval-inspired art of Eyvind Earle's detailed, pastel-hued, vertical-horizontal compositions, make this timeless romance -- based on a folk tale that arose after the Dark Ages (and a metaphor for the times?) -- a must-have for the digital family library and a masterpiece of animators' art.  Hold on to your dreams.  True love conquers all.  Available for a limited time.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Keyed to the style of Disney artist Ervind Earle, SLEEPING BEAUTY has long been renowned as one of Walt Disney Studio's most artistically beautiful films--and now with this meticulous restoration Earle's vision comes to the home market in a DVD package that is sure to win praise from every fan of hand-drawn animation.<p>The story, of course, is the time-honored fairy tale. Princess Aurora is cursed at birth by the evil Maleficent, who declares that on her sixteenth birthday the princess shall prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die--but fortunately the powers of good are able to mute the effect of the curse; the princess shall not die, but shall instead fall into a deep sleep from which she can be only awakened by love's first kiss.<p>Earle's vision for the story is drawn from a host of sources, some of them more immediately apparent than others. The result is a curious mixture of flat illustration and meticulous detail that imparts both a modernist edge and the quality of an ancient illuminated manuscript--a truly remarkable concept that gives the film a visual style completely unlike any other among the Disney classics.  The DVD offers the option of viewing the film in either its original widescreen ratio or pan-and-scan format--but why any one would elect pan-and-scan is completely beyond me; if ever there was a film that made good and full use of the widescreen ratio, this is it, and you'll want to see every inch of Earle's remarkable work.<p>Earle's style aside, SLEEPING BEAUTY has been influenced by a number of films that are worth noting.  In terms of plot detail, it has been very clearly influenced by Disney's earlier SNOW WHITE, and the designs for the evil Maleficent and her &quot;goons&quot; are very clearly influenced by FANTASIA's &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; sequence--and to magnificent effect; Maleficent is easily among the darkest characters ever created for film.  Interestingly, many visual set-ups also seem to have been influenced by MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ, most notably in the scenes in which the three good fairies rescue Prince Philip from Maleficent's nightmarish castle.<p>Unlike some animated films, the voices are beautifully matched to the characters, with Mary Costa as Princess Aurora and Eleanor Audley (who also performed the Wicked Stepmother in Disney's CINDERELLA) as Maleficent standouts among the cast.  The score, which is based on the brilliant Tchaikovsky ballet score, is also extremely well handled and includes the memorable &quot;Once Upon a Dream.&quot;<p>All of this has been lovingly, shining restored, and quite frankly even if you saw the film in its first release the result here will no doubt surpass it.  There is not a blip, a glitch, or a sound-surge to be found.  And as is usual with Disney &quot;limited release&quot; DVD editions, the package includes a host of extras, some designed to appeal to the younger set (there are two simple games, neither of which require a CD-ROM) for children and a host of interviews and documentaries.  Fortunately, many of the people involved in SLEEPING BEAUTY are still with us--including Ervind Earle and Mary Costa--and their various contributions make the bonus package truly superior.<p>All of this said, it should be noted that like FANTASIA, SLEEPING BEAUTY is more likely to appeal to adults who can fully appreciate the visual charms of the film than to children, who may find the film's tendency to linger over visuals a bit too much for a limited attention span.  But this is indeed a Disney masterpiece, and it belongs in your collection.<p>--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>The Disney heroes/heroines never really did it for me. Maybe, its my slightly warped personality that makes me root for the villains. "Sleeping Beauty" boasts a humdinger of a bad girl in the guise of Malificent, maliciously voiced by the late character actress Eleanor Audley. She had the perfect pipes for the portrayal of one devoid of compassion and love.<p>The actress had previously made a distinctive contribution to an earlier Disney film, the classic "Cinderella" (she was the wicked stepmother). '60's audiences also remember her as Eddie Albert's mother on the comedy classic "Green Acres" and her frequent appearances on that other country-themed comedy "The Beverly Hillbillies".<p>Also, being a dragon fan, I love Malificent's final transformation as she takes on the valiant, handsome, and dashing (although, bland) prince.<p>Unfortunately, the good guy wins.</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1959 adaptation of "Sleeping Beauty" is the last truly great animated film from the studio's early brilliance.  It caps the first era of feature-length animation which began with Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in style, with a simple story told through daring animation and creativity.<br /><br />With the voice talents of Mary Costa, Eleanor Audley, and Verna Felton, among many others, the movie's dynamic animation precedes the digital revolution in animation by at least three decades.  Yet, the available resources of the time are utilized so ingeniously that the movie is literally forty years ahead of its time.  It also boasts unique characters and a script which is not afraid to present its villainess as a purely evil demonic witch.<br /><br />The storyline is deceptively simple:  three benevolent fairies look after a princess, deep undercover because of a vengeful death curse at her christening.  Eleanor Audley's vocal work combined with frighteningly mature animation make the evil fairy Maleficent one of Disney's most potentially terrifying antagonists.  Her name itself is a stroke of genius:  a combination of the words "malevolent" and "magnificent."<br /><br />Also featuring a great soundtrack comprised mostly of Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty Ballet," and including the poetic "Once Upon A Dream," Walt Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" is a superb film, animated or otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>The Sleeping Beauty story never gets old, no matter how old you are or how long ago you saw it. But this Platinum Edition brings out the best in the story with a great-looking digitally restored picture, making it now even harder to forget with colors that jump at you. If you can watch the movie on a widescreen TV you will enjoy it at its fullest as it was the first one that Disney did on 70 mm film.<br /><br />Alongside the unforgettable tale, there are lots of extra material packing the two discs, such as children games, a great documentary on the making of the movie and even a short on the life of Tchaikovsky (whose music is featured on the film) that make this package a must have for Disney fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY is based upon the story of Briar Rose by the Brothers Grimm.  In this version of the tale, a beautiful baby girl named Aurora is born to a friendly king and queen.  After her birth people and creatures from all around come to give her gifts, including three good fairies.  Two of the fairies give their gifts to the child but before the third fairy is able to do so, an un-invited guest, the evil sorceress Malificient, appears and places a curse upon the child.  Before the end of Aurora's birthday she will prick her finger upon the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.  After Malificient leaves, the third fairy bestows her gift: instead of dying, Aurora will only fall into a deep slumber when the event happens and will only awaken with true love's kiss.  The fairies take Aurora and hide her and raise her deep in the woods as their own child.  When Aurora meets her true love, Prince Phillip, it would seem that everything is going to work out as planned.  But in fairy tales, even a Disneyized version of one, nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />SLEEPING BEAUTY had been in pre-production and production for almost a decade before it was originally released in theatres in 1958.  The film was incredibly expensive to make and had it failed it would have bankrupted the studio.  In fact, the film was so expensive that it was the last Disney animated picture to mostly have hand-drawn animated cells for each frame of the picture.  Xeroxing was king after that and a glory age of animation came to an end.  The film turned out to be a huge critical and financial success and remains as one of the most beautiful animated Disney features ever.  The influence of the movie can clearly be seen on modern animated pictures, most prominently Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The movie also contains some very memorable Disney characters, including the most wicked of all Disney villains, Malificient.<br /><br />Besides the visual impact of the picture, the film is also notable for it's very un-Disney-like score.  The film was scored by an adaptation of George Bruns from Tchaikovsky's famous ballet, SLEEPING BEAUTY.<br /><br />As beautiful and stunning a movie that SLEEPING BEAUTY is, it has one major drawback.  Like all Disney animated pictures, the writers in adapting the original story failed to include some of the more dark and graphic parts of the story of Briar Rose, e.g. as the final confrontation between Malificient and Prince Phillip.  Other than that, though, SLEEPING BEAUTY is a meticulously-crafted example of the art of animation and one of the most beautifully drawn pictures ever to grace cinema screens.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Disney films or well-done animation.<br /><br />The special 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of the movie comes with two discs.  The first disc includes the movie in widescreen digitally restored format; "Once Upon a Dream" music video with Emily Osment; song selections that can be played with or without lyrics; a commentary with John Lasseter, Andreas Deja, and Leonard Maltin; "Princess Facts" (pop-up factoids that appear while watching the movie); the short pictorial GRAND CANYON (this was the short that originally accompanied SLEEPING BEAUTY in theatres); and a Walt Disney special entitled "Peter Tchaikovsky Story", which was the first tv program to be simulcast in widescreen picture and stereo sound<br /><br />The second disc is a special feature disc. It includes the documentary "Picture Perfect: Making of SLEEPING BEAUTY"; a featurette about Eyvind Earle; a featurette about how expensive the picture was to make; the original planned opening sequence of the movie; three deleted songs; two storyboard sequences; a virtual tour through the now closed Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland; a Disney special entitled "Four Artists Painting a Tree" (which is really just a long commercial for SLEEPING BEAUTY disguised as a show to encourage young artists); art galleries; trailers for the film; a matching game; and a language game.  I found the documentary about the making of the movie to be really interesting as well as the story about the history of the Sleeping Beauty Castle attraction at Disneyland.  I found the two games to be the least-interesting thing on the DVD.  Disney puts those things on there for young children, but I really think they are a waste of space and time.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>Sleeping Beauty is one of the most original Disney movies to come out ever, no contest. The way the story strings itself together with such clean cleverness assures that this is some of the most masterful storytelling ever put to animation. It's a tremendous, stunning musical with songs to delight the heart and dreamy forest sets and thrilling medievil battles. The film will have you holding on to your pillow in the suspense scenes and have you heart tickled in the romantic loveliness. Every plot point is used no matter what, and even when some scenes are either annoying or slightly boring, that doesn't stop Sleepy Beauty from being an endlessly watchable, spellbindingly fun film for the entire family or just you and your cat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>In comparison to the tripe that Disney produces now, this movie is even  more classic than it was when it was first made. The classic story of  &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was ALMOST never better-produced (I still think  the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; version is best, sadly not produced  anymore)<p>The animation is unusual for a Disney production--it adds length  and the appearance of fitness to the bodies of the humans, while making the  fairies... rotund? But the animation, rather than making the characters  look like the Barbie-and-Ken bodies of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; makes them  look beautiful and noble. In addition, the scenery in the movie is  breathtaking--the interior of the castle, the fields in which Maleficent  and the prince do battle, and the forest where Aurora first meets  Philip.<p>A baby princess is born to a kindly king and queen, who invite  hundreds to the celebration--including three fairies to bestow blessings on  the baby. But the evil witch Maleficent shows up as well--and curses baby  Aurora with death on her sixteenth birthday. But the third fairy is able to  soften the curse into sleep until a kiss wakens her. <p>And for added  safety, the fairies take Aurora, under the name &quot;Briar Rose&quot; out  to the forest to raise her. All goes smoothly until she falls in love with  a young man in the forest, but is told that she is betrothed to Prince  Philip. Guess who the young man is.<p>As her sixteenth birthday approaches,  the fairies bring Briar Rose back to the castle--only to discover that  they're delivering her straight into Maleficent's grasp.<p>Maleficent still  holds the record for best Disney villain--we don't need any explanation for  her evil works, except that she's pure evil! In case the horns on her cap  didn't tip you off! Her acts of evil towards the king and queen, Aurora and  Philip would be acceptable in an adult movie. That's how amazing she is as  a villainess, rather than the blustering morons that Disney has had  recently. She's not obvious--and watch out for her casual jaunts through  her ghastly castle!<p>Aurora was a big improvement on &quot;Snow  White&quot;--the only reason she doesn't decide her own destiny is because  she's royal. And Philip is the perfect match for her--I was in love with  him when I was a kid. He's strong, masculine, funny, and adventurous, and  the final battle with Maleficent is breathtaking in its dark  violence.<p>The music is amazing: the beautiful &quot;Once Upon a  Dream&quot; is a unique song, one that I still remember even though it's  been five years since I last watched the video.<p>And thankfully, the humor  is still sophisticated. Nowhere are the screaming gross-out antics of Timon  and Pumbaa. One of the sweetest scenes in the movie is when the three  fairies get into a massive, impressive fight over cakes and dresses for  Aurora's birthday, one that lasts until the end. <p>A beautiful, dark,  bright movie that adds pizzazz to an old favorite, this movie is a must-see  for any kids who ever dreamed a fairy tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Sleeping Beauty was a childhood favorite of mine and still is! I just love this fairytale classic. I used to watch this film over and over again, I wore out my VHS copy many years ago and can't wait for this to be released in the fall. I highly recommend this gorgeous fable, enjoy future and past generations!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>I vividly remember the release of Sleeping Beauty. I was old enough to go see it myself - just barely.  There I was sitting way up front eating my popcorn and all of a sudden this spectacular dragon materialized right before my eyes.  Popcorn forgotten, I was hooked.  Cartoons never looked the same to me, and I spent the rest of my life inhaling fantasy and science fiction on a quest for the same thrill.<p>Animation has changed quite a bit in the ensuing years, but even today Sleeping Beauty is a towering achievement.  Now I'm more sensitive to the tricks of the art and can see the masterful use of perspective that made the scenes leap out at you.  When I first picked up this DVD I half expected to be disappointed, to find it really wasn't so glorious in retrospect.  This is hardly the case - this film is just as vibrant and alive as it was in 1959.<p>The added dimension now is that I can see how Disney's work was a formative influence on animation even today.  Artist/Directors like Miyazaki owe much to this film and its predecessor Snow White.  And they freely admit it.  As a production, Sleeping Beauty created a sense of legitimacy for animation that proved that high quality animation was something well beyond the Saturday morning funnies.<p>Disney took a great risk when creating this film, pouring a tremendous amount of resources in making it something as perfect as was possible for his time.  While the studio reaped the financial benefits, the audience was the real winner, as a whole genre exploded before our eyes.  Even now, with anime rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, this film stands out for story, art, and music.<p>The additional features, especially those that retell the making of the film, are excellent as well.  All captures in fine detail on this DVD.  This is a must see for anyone who still loves a fairy tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>This movie is one of the great classics of animation, especially for Disney.  The DVD version is significantly improved compared to the previous VHS tape.  The picture and sound were both greatly enhanced for this release.  Furthermore, both widescreen and full screen versions are available in this package.<p>As with Disney's other classics, some liberties were taken with the original story of Sleeping Beauty.  Disney took the classic story and made it unique and special.  In some ways the story is less violent and dark than the original fairy tale.  In other ways, such as the portrayal of Maleficent, the movie is dark and forbidding.  While the movie is generally a children's movie, Maleficent's dragon and her general demeanor can be somewhat frightening for some in the pre-school and younger set.<p>Aurora was the first love for many a young boy, and was also the model for the aspirations of millions of girls.  The romantic love story of Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip enchanted would-be princesses everywhere, and in some cases became the measure by which future spouses were measured (and many of us struggled to meet the ideal).<p>Of course, the romantic story and the evil of Maleficent were balanced by the comedy of the animal characters and the three bumbling, good-hearted fairy godmothers.  While their goodness may appear a bit too vanilla and sweet for some, it is perfect for those longing for the innocence of their youth.<p>While the movie is the most important part of the DVD, this two CD set contains a phenomenal number of extras.  I found the audio commentary by various key individuals to be absolutely fascinating.  I planned to listen to portions of the commentary in preparation for my review, and instead found myself listening to the entire thing because it was so incredibly fascinating.  Mary Costa (Princess Aurora) and others provide their perspective on the creation of the movie, as well as personal memories of Walt Disney and his influence on the film.  The audio commentary by itself is worth replacing your VHS tape, particularly for aficionados of Disney movies.<p>In addition to the audio commentary are numerous, emphasize numerous, other bonus features.  Some I felt were less than worthwhile, others, such as the shorts "Grand Canyon" and "The Peter Tchaikovsky Story," were excellent bonuses.  The number of bonuses on this two disc set was so large that there is a navigational overview included in the DVD that categorizes 38 features found on the second disc.<p>With the movie and the wealth of bonuses, this movie is a must-buy for those who have yet to have "Sleeping Beauty."  For those who have the VHS, the bonus material is nearly worth the cost of the DVD.  Certainly those who are collectors of Disney memorabilia and historians of Disney will find the DVD to be a concise compendium of some of the best information available regarding this film.  I highly recommend this DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Disney's &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is one of the most macabre and dark pictures ever. The tale of good versus evil is magically brought to life through an astonishing visual display of elite and sinister animation, combined with our heroes and villians, and a well-rendered musical score that is taken from the very music of Tchaikovsky. There is no doubt about it: this is a meticulous and excellently crafted motion picture which remains one of Disney's most ambitious and intriguing. <p>The story remains the same: the princess Aurora is born into King Stephen's royal court, the pride and joy of all the kingdom, where celebrations and gifts are bestowed upon the small child. Tragedy strikes when the lone misfit of the kingdom, the evil and crafty Malificent, rains on their parade to place a curse on the child: &quot;Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, she shall prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!&quot; The kingdom is in peril with this news, and so the three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather conceal the child deep within the forest in a hidden cottage, raising the child under the assumption that she is of no royal relation. <p>But what Disney movie would be complete without the obligatory second act of villainous treachery and heroes saving the day? This movie follows that same pattern, but in such an intense way that outweighs some of the live-action suspense we get from mainstream films. Malificent's curse comes true, and so it is up to Prince Phillip, whose love interest in the young princess drives him on his journey to seek out and rescue the maiden while defeating the creepy witch. <p>Everything in this movie screams the word &quot;medieval,&quot; from the animation of the elaborate castles to the creation of the forests and acts of mysticism and nature which accompany them. Attention to detail is great, focusing on such things as woven tapestries decorating the walls and ceilings of the castles, while the clothing worn by the characters dances between the elite society and the middle-class quite nicely. Other important settings in the movie, such as Malificent's castle, are given a gloomy, ominous look, dark and stormy, full of rotting and decay. <p>This is also a classic evil-against-good story as well, attributing its successful execution to thr dazzling displays of magical powers as well as swarthy swordfights. Prince Phillip's treck through the forest of thorns still brings a certain amount of heightened suspense to an audience, while Malificent's character brings unease and restlessness to viewers. She is the embodiment of true evil, which is easy to see, while Prince Phillip is everything we want in a hero: dashing, morally just, and committed to his one true love. <p>Comical relief is provided stupendously within the efforts of the three fairies, whose arguments amongst one another are hilarious and laugh-out-loud funny. Flora takes on the serious role, the one with the level head who makes sure that everything goes according to her plan. Fauna is douty and bird-brained, yet sweet-natured and high-spirited. Merriweather is the rebel, and her machinations in rebellion of Flora's perfect plans bring some funny moments, especially in a battle of the wills at the small cottage as they prepare for Aurora's birthday. <p>The musical score plays throughout almost the entire film, unlike certain Disney films which have breaks in the score. The musical numbers sung by Aurora and Prince Phillip sell us on their love for one another, while the dark and brooding music of Malificent's power and evil fit the scenes perfectly. There are times when the music is frightening, and times when it brings cheer and delight to us. <p>&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; remains one of my favorite movies, maintaining all the classical elements of the original work while giving it a wondrous and invigorating look. The visual style is comething to be admired and adored, while the story and the characters are crafted with heart and wit. This is Disney's darkest yet most complex piece, perhaps ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>My 6-year-old son and I watched this movie last night. I had seen it years ago in the theaters and a couple more times over the decades, but I had never seen the color of it like I did on this Special Edition DVD. Wow! Everything is so vibrant! My son and I are color fanatics, so it had our attention right from the start.<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty is visually arresting. Aurora is one of the most lovely creations of our time and Mary Costa's beautiful voice is perfectly suited to the artwork. The green of Maleficent's cruel visage practically leaps off the screen. The backgrounds are intricately detailed and thoughtfully stylized. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are delightful, especially Merryweather and her petulant intonations (you may recognize her as the well-bred Lady of "Lady and the Tramp"). The reworking of Tchaikovsky's classic melodies lends a lovely, lilting tone to the settings and characters.<br /><br />The digital transfer and restoration is wonderful and I like that you have the option of viewing the film in either wide- or fullscreen format. I invariably select the widescreen, but I do understand that others do not care for the black bars. The features on the second disk are pleasant and informative for the entire family. There are plenty of fun activities for the children such as the "Princess Personality Profile", the "Sleeping Beauty Ink & Paint Game", and the "Rescue Aurora Adventure Game". Nostalgia buffs will enjoy the inclusion of vintage programming such as "The Peter Tchaikovsky Story" and "Four Artists Paint One Tree".<br /><br />Don't miss the chance to add this classic to your movie collection right away!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>The blu ray version of Sleeping Beauty looks absolutely beautiful.

Following the fairy tale of sleeping beauty who is cursed by a witch to sleep until woken by her one true love this film has a great story for kids, some musical numbers and is interesting enough for adults to enjoy as well. The witch, Maleficent, is quite sinister at times and the parts of the film which feature her are quite dark and small children may get scared, but not excessively so. It is funny to watch this film after it was so brilliantly parodied by 'Shrek', but that doesn't detract from the charm of this film in the slightest, in fact it seems all the better for it. The extras are what we have come to expect from Disney re-releases, a making of feature, music video of the theme song, deleted scenes and various games for younger viewers. I always feel the extras have more to offer kids than adults but I guess this is essentially a children's film despite the obvious enjoyment adults will get from it as well. This is a classic Disney film and whilst it lacks the excitement or artistic skill of films such as 'Pinocchio', this should still be added to your Disney collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Like so many other Disney films based off fairy tales, all the dark, nasty parts have been cut out and lots of music has been put in. The original versions sometimes had as many as a dozen fairies to give Sleeping Beauty various blessings, but in this movie, the number has been pared down to three (not including the bad fairy)<br /><br />The bad fairy has been given a considerably more prominent role in this film, and Sleeping Beauty (Aurora) is not raised as a princess - the fairies foster her in a cabin hidden away in the woods and name her Briar Rose. Considerable liberties have been taken with this tale, such as causing the Prince to fight Maleficient, but this movie is actually a pretty good retelling of the Sleeping Beauty tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>Sleeping Beauty is considered one of Disney's most artistically beautiful films, and the new Platinum Edition 2 Disc DVD release is a fitting new polishing of the Disney gem. The story is about Princess Aurora, who was cursed as a baby by the evil witch Maleficent due to the fact that she was not invited to the christening. Fated to an eternal sleep upon reaching the age of 16, she is given somewhat of a reprieve by one of the Good Fairies who bestows upon Aurora the blessing of being reawakened by true love's kiss. The 3 Good Fairies (Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna) take Aurora into the woods as a baby and raise her as Briar Rose in order to keep her away from Maleficent, hopefully avoiding the curse in the first place. However, on the crest of her 16th birthday, Aurora happens to meet Prince Phillip and naturally falls in love. Neither knows the true identity of the other and that their kingdoms have already decreed that they marry each other. When she is returned to her parents, the King & Queen, Aurora is upset that she cannot marry her boyfriend from the woods, and instead, must marry a Prince she has not met (as far as she knows). Maleficent finds the Princess and carries out her original curse. Can Prince Philip save the Princess with true love's kiss?<br /><br />The film looks and sounds spectacular. Shot in Super Technirama 70, the widescreen (2.55:1 enhanced for 16x9 TVs) film has been restored using state-of-the-art technology, and will fill up your speakers with its 5.1 enhanced home theater mix. For purists, the restored original theater track is also included. Either way you choose, Mary Costa (the voice of Aurora) sounds incredible. It would be hard to imagine anyone else vocalizing the Princess with such warmth and beauty. Eleanor Audley also deserves kudos for her vocalization of the evil Maleficent. She is definitely one of the most scary and memorable Disney characters.<br /><br />This project was special to Walt; it was the last feature based on a fairy-tale (until 1989's "Little Mermaid"). Since the studio had already done a similar tale with "Snow White," Walt wanted to make it different by adding a classical music inspired Tchaikovsky score and giving the film a less cartoony and more artistic visual representation. Breaking all box-office records, this film succeeded on all levels.<br /><br />And the extras...wow! On Disc One, in addition to the feature, you get:<br /><br />*Music & More: "Once Upon A Dream" music video performed by Hannah Montana's Emily Osment, who updates the song with a pop rock beat<br /><br />* Disney Song Selection: Instantly access your favorite songs from the movie<br /><br />* Backstage Disney includes audio commentary for the film (John Lasseter, film critic Leonard Maltin, and Disney animator Andreas D&eacute;ja), Princess Fun Facts (pop-up trivia fact option while watching the movie), "Grand Canyon" short (1959 Oscar winner for best short subject film and features the music of Ferde Grof's "Grand Canyon Suite"), and The Peter Tchaikovsky Story. The Peter Tchaikovsky story was featured on the 1959 Walt Disney Presents anthology. It was a historic telecast due to the fact that home viewers could listen in true-stereophonic sound, by turning on two additional radios with ABC simulcast of the necessary stereophonic channels. Disney explains the process at the beginning of the featurette. You can choose between this version and the version that replaces Disney's explanation. Although the featurette was first broadcast in black and white, it was shot in color. The remaining color footage is here on this DVD set.<br /><br />* Naturally, there are trailers/promos for other Disney films, including the upcoming theatrical release "Princess & The Frog" and the next Platinum Edition DVD release, "Pinocchio."<br /><br />Extras on Disc 2:<br /><br />Games & Activities:<br />* Briar Rose's Enchanted Dance Game: Learn to Waltz, taking on the role of Princess Aurora or Prince Phillip.<br />* "Sleeping Beauty" Fun With Language Game. This one is definitely for VERY young children who must identify the most basic of words using visuals from the film.<br /><br />Backstage Disney:<br />* Picture Pefect: The Making Of "Sleeping Beauty" (43:32) A wonderful documentary detailing the making of the movie. Features interviews with animators and Mary Costa, who is still beautiful today. Watching this will definitely enhance your appreciation for this movie as the artistic masterpiece that it is.<br />* Eyvind Earle: The Man and His Art (7:33) is about the man responsible for the artistic backgrounds and overall look of the film. Disney stepped up everyone's game at the animation studio by having Earle oversee the design. Features interviews with Alice Davis and John Canemaker.<br />* Alternate Opening (3:28) is recreated with storyboards and sketches. After viewing this, I'd say they made the right decision, as the music intended for this sequence was more pop-oriented and not fitting the classical Tchaikovsky score.<br />* 3 Deleted Songs<br />* 8 Art Galleries, including visual design, character development, storyboards, publicity, and a detailed look at the Storybook featured in the film's opening,<br />* Original Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough attraction, unseen for years, presented in a virtual digital recreation which is BREATHTAKING. Almost like being at Disneyland. "Tour" it yourself, or with host Tony Baxter explaining your tour as you go through. There is also a featurette explaining the history of the walkthrough.<br />* Sequence 8 (Forest Scene) (5:30) is a featurette that shows the detail and labor that went into this sequence put together by Disney's famous "Nine Old Men." This sequence alone cost the studio over $10,000. It is also interesting to note that only about 8 drawings were able to be done per day because of the precision required; considering it takes 24 to make a second of film, well...you do the math.<br />* Publicity features 3 trailers (teaser, original 1959, and 1995 re-release)<br />* "Four Artists Paint One Tree" (16:08) is a 1958 featurette that has four Disney artists (Marc Davis, Eyvind Earle, Joshua Meador, and Walt Peregoy) painting the same tree, each showing their own personal style. Walt Disney himself encourages each to "be themselves." An excellent lesson for budding young artists.<br />* Storyboard sequences<br />* Live-action reference footage. See three of the black and white films that were shot to aid the animators. Especially fun to watch is the sequence where Prince Phillip fights the dragon.<br /><br />For those wanting the Blu-ray, here is the exclusive content:<br /><br />* Maleficent's Challenge - Go head to head with one of Disney's most infamous villains.

The classic story of the princess  Aurora, hidden from the evil clutches of Malificent in a forest cottage  with three fairies, is brought to life with beautiful animation matched  only by that of Beauty and the Beast. The songs, most of which are taken  from the classical score by Tchaikowsky's ballad, sweep the viewer into a  lush and sometimes gothic epitaph that never fails to bring each character,  as well as their surroundings, to life. I'm pleading with Disney to please  bring this movie out on DVD so that everyone can enjoy the widescreen  release of this totally enthralling film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sleeping Beauty was one of the first Disney animated films I remember my folks taking me to see.  As a child during my `dinosaur' phase, I loved watching Maleficent turn into the dragon and fight Phillip. The story, you should know by now of course, young princess whisked away by three fairy `godmothers' to protect her from evil sorceress, raised in the forest unaware of her heritage, meets prince charming unaware he's a prince, eventually finds out they're betrothed to each other as prince fights sorceress.  The re-mastering technique employed on this DVD yielded incredible results, the image was actually more vibrant and colorful than originally aired in 1959 and it looks marvelous on today's widescreen HDTVs.  I was quite taken with the art, quite unlike anything Disney has done before or since with it's angular geometry and perpendicular themes.  Aurora and Maleficent duel for most beautiful Disney female forms to date.  The extras on the DVD are quite interesting as well.  The original theatrical companion pieces The Grand Canyon was sublime and the snippet of how four artists paint a tree helped glean a bit into the mindset of the brilliant artists on the Sleeping Beauty project.  Highly recommended, not just as a child's story, but as an impressive art piece and study of mood and texture.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Disney's classic fairy tale SLEEPING BEAUTY is timeless.  It is as lovely today as it was in 1959.  Full of warmth, saturated colors, and an enduring story, SLEEPING BEUATY continues to enchant princesses of all ages.<br /><br />We purchased this DVD for my three year old as a Christmas gift, but could not resist a sneak peak at Grandma and PawPaw's house over Thanksgiving.  The animation was stellar in 1959, and I must say, it certainly holds its own against any animation of today.  The vibrancy, detail, and charm still capture the imagination, submerging the viewer the fairy tale world.  The story itself is eternal:  good triumphs over evil and love, true love, concurs all.  The music is a perfect accompaniment to the tale, and "Once Upon A Dream" ranks up there as one of the all time best Disney songs.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed watching this with my two girls and the rest of my family.  It was a beautiful way for the entire family to spend a small part of Thanksgiving week doing something memorable together.  I was surprised about how much of this movie I did not remember from when I saw it 40 years ago, and I was surprised how much detail my 11 year old remembered from the first time she saw it.  The three year old was simply enchanted by the entire movie; from the fairies to Princess Aurora.  She was enraptured the magic and the majesty of the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dvd as a treat for the entire family.  Little ones, teens, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles will all have a wonderful time together.  It will make your time together a little happier and a little brighter.  And that is what memories are all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty got a G rating, but this movie does not deserve a G rating. This deserves a PG rating. This movie may frighten young children than to charm them. And this movie is coming out of the vault on video and dvd in America on September 9. This animated movie does not have a lot of familar voices (or at least to me) but a lot of them has gone on to perfrom more voices in Diseny's later movies like The Sword in the Stone, and the Jungle Book. As the movie opens, a baby is born to King Stefan (Taylor Holmoes) and his queen. They name the baby Aurora (Mary Costa). And then at a celbration, three good faries show up with the gifts. Flora (Verna Felton) gives Aurora the gift of beauty, Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) gives Aurora the gift of song, but before Merryweather (Barbara Luddy) can give her gift, an evil fairy named Maleficent (Eleanor Aldey) shows up uninvited, and to prove she is not upset by not getting invited, she does give Aurora a gift, which is before the sun set on her 16th birthday, Princess Aurora will prick her finger on ths spindle of a spinning wheel and will die. Merryweather changes the speel form death to sleep if this does happen. Princess Aurora was promsied to King Huevert's (Bill Thompson) son Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley). And King Stefan who is afraid for his daughter's life, has all the spinning wheels in the kingdom burned. And then the 3 good faires comes with a plan to become 3 peasents and raise Princess Aurora and protect her from Maleficent, and they change her name to Brair Rose. And for 16 years, Maleficent is so frusted about worrying about where Princess Aurora is hiding for 16 years, and she sends out her pet, to search for her. While the 3 good fairs, are planning a party for Briar Rose.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>I have always loved this movie, and it just gets better every single time I watch it. It's the only Disney film I can think of that I have enjoyed more over the years; I suppose I can now appreciate certain things more now that I'm older. For instance it is, quite possibly, the most beautifully-drawn Disney Animated Masterpiece ever. And the music is pure enchantment, ingeniously drawn from the works of Tchaikovsky. But by far the best of all. . . . . Maleficent is without a doubt THE BEST DISNEY VILLAIN EVER!!! She used to scare me half to death as a little kid, and she's still just as sinister and enjoyable to watch today, if not more. The only other Disney villain who comes close is "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" 's Frollo.<p>Now, I'll be honest, the story is sort of cliched when you look at it. But I'm talkin' BARELY, here. Plus, even if you think so too, you'll be totally entranced and enchanted by everything previously mentioned to even care. I'd also like to add that the humor is among the best you'll ever see in a Disney cartoon. Though the film is not exactly bursting with it, the laughs are kind-hearted and of good taste. Notice, that this is the exact opposite of most modern Disney films, which are usually overflowing with lame jokes.<p>"Sleeping Beauty" is definitely among Disney's top five.  It is certainly the best of Disney's "traditional" fairy tale adaptations, as well as their "Princess" brand films. I mean, in their previous princess films "Snow White" (which I absolutely hate) and "Cinderella" (a major improvement, but still entertaining mainly for the animation), the prince is just some pretty boy waltzing around catching the heroine's eye. You never understand why exactly the princess falls for him! Hence, the "Happily Ever After" ending simply felt extremely contrived. But this is not the case in "Sleeping Beauty", which paved a new tradition for the prince's characterization that would be carried on in such other Disney masterpieces as "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty & The Beast". Indeed, Prince Phillip at times seems more of the main character than Princess Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)!<p>The new "Special Edition" DVD is gonna rock! With the new remastering technique used for the "Snow White" Platinum DVD (which, regardless of the actual movie, looked absolutely stunning), and all those special features, you can bet your butt that this is one Disney classic that they will NOT shove back into the vault before I get my hands on it!</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region-A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1 / High Profile 3.2 (BonusView)<br />Aspect ratio: 2.55:1<br />Running time: 1:15:10<br />Movie size: 18,36 GB<br />Disc size: 37,69 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 24.05 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4459 kbps  7.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 4459kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  4.0 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH<br /><br />Number of chapters: 30<br /><br /># Original Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Walk<br /># Alternate Opening<br /># All New Documentary Picture Perfect: The Making of Sleeping Beauty<br /># A New DVD Game, Briar Rose's Enchanted Dance Game<br /># Four Deleted Songs<br /># Grand Canyon (HD)<br /># The Peter Tchaikovsky Story (HD)<br /># Four Artists Paint One Tree (HD)<br /># Fun with English Game<br />#Maleficent's Challenge<br />#Dragon Encounter<br />#Cine-Explore (BonusView)<br />#Restoring The Sound Track<br />#Customized Living Menu<br />#Disney BD-Live Network - Movie Chat / Movie Mail / Movie Challenge / Disney Movie Rewards Live<br />#DVD of Sleeping Beauty</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>In 1987, as a wide-eyed 6-year-old, I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY during it's cinema re-release.  It was probably the first time I ever went to the movies.  The experience definitely stayed with me and fired my love of Disney movies which had begun when I was a toddler with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and MARY POPPINS on video.  Now so many years later I have relished collecting and revisiting all the Disney classics on DVD, and the 2-disc edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is something really special.  Six years in the making, the movie made history for being the first animated feature shot in 70mm and was the 2nd highest-grossing film of the 1960s' (second only to BEN-HUR).<br /><br />The story is well-known: Beautiful Princess Aurora is cursed as a baby by the cruel Maleficent.  On her 16th birthday she'll die from pricking her finger on a spindle.  Good fairy Merryweather remedies the curse by changing death to sleep, and the awakening of Aurora by the kiss of true love.  However, to ensure that Aurora does not meet this fate at all, the fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather take the infant deep into the forest, where they pose as three spinsters and rename the child Briar Rose.  On her 16th birthday the girl will be quietly smuggled back to the palace with Maleficent none-the-wiser.  However things take an unexpected turn when Briar Rose falls in love with a handsome Prince, and the princess is ultimately discovered despite the best efforts of the fairies'.<br /><br />The production design by Eyvind Earl takes it's cue from medieval tapestries and paintings.  The score, freely-adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet, is lush with "Once Upon a Dream" and "I Wonder" the main standouts.  Mary Costa, later one of the leading opera singers of the 60s' and 70s', performs the role of Aurora/Briar Rose and does a fantastic job.  The character of Prince Phillip (voiced by Bill Shirley) is the first prince in a Disney fairytale that takes an active role in the story.  The prince-roles in SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA are quite static and uninteresting.  Eleanor Audley (who also memorably voiced CINDERELLA's icy stepmother Lady Tremaine) works her magic again with Maleficent, still one of Disney's strongest villains.  Verna Felton, Vera Vague and Barbara Luddy play Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Disney fans will remember Felton from CINDERELLA (the Fairy Godmother), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (the Queen of Hearts) and LADY AND THE TRAMP (Aunt Sarah).  Barbara Luddy's voice you'll also remember as that of Lady in LADY AND THE TRAMP.<br /><br />Disney has done a terrific job in restoring SLEEPING BEAUTY for this 2-disc Special Edition.  The film is presented in its  Technirama 70mm proportions with 5.1 sound mix (as well as an optional DTS mix).  The colours are strong and vibrant with the use of High Definition Video employed to clean up every frame of animation.  Some great extras are included, featuring a 'Making Of' segment with Mary Costa and Eyvind Earl both extensively interviewed.  There's also a recreation of the original Disneyland 'Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through attraction' which features early concept art by Earl.  The lovely Disney cinema featurette THE PETER TCHAIKOVSKY STORY is also included along with a cute set-top adventure game 'Rescue Aurora', plus lots more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>For all of the thirty two years I've been on this planet, "Sleeping Beauty" was one of the few Disney films that I never viewed.  My wife and daughter have watched it numerous times on VHS, but I either wasn't home at the time or I was interested in something else.  My wife considers this film to be her favorite Disney movie.  Having watched it for the first time tonight, I understand why.<br /><br />The Disney version of this fairy tale is inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet.  With the wonderful "Once Upon A Dream" waltz, a cast of likeable characters including the fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather and a classic Disney villain in Maleficent, "Sleeping Beauty" is two parts love story and one part action yarn.  Humor is provided by the fathers of Aurora and Prince Philip, as well as the fairies.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, Maleficent casts a spell on the infant Aurora.  On her sixteenth birthday, she is to fall into a deadly sleep.  Luckily the kind fairy Merryweather had not yet given Aurora a gift.  In order to save her life, Merryweather casts a protective spell that prevents Aurora from passing away but puts her into a deep sleep.  This slumber can only be broken by her true love's kiss.  From there, the story has magic, a dragon, and an ending that's both beautiful and funny.<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Walt Disney's classic is a masterpiece.  The film looks beautiful.  It is set in a widescreen format and has been digitally restored to a colorful and eye-popping presentation.  The sound is also excellent and the music is simply wonderful.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with special features.  It includes an alternate opening sequence, a game in which you can learn a waltz, a look into the life of Tchaikovsky, the musical "Grand Canyon Suite" and much, much more.  Heck, even the standard Disney Channel television star music video is good.  This time around it's Emily Osment's popped-up version of "Once Upon A Dream."<br /><br />I can honestly say that "Sleeping Beauty" has worked her way into my top ten list of Disney films.  It's a wonderful film for the whole family and deserves a spot on everybody's DVD (or Blu-ray) shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.<br /><br />Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Sleeping Beauty, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Sleeping Beauty (and Snow White) has some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.<br /><br />But you should take advantage of purchasing Sleeping Beauty or any of the other "off-the-market" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy Sleeping Beauty or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This was one of those movies my niece watched all the time and I myself saw it in theaters when I was a kid. An evil sorceress puts a spell on a lovely girl and only a kiss by a handsome prince can awake her. In the end the witch turns into a dragon in a showdown at the end. And of course it has a happy ending. One of the best Disney movies along with Show White.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>This is another classic fairy tale given the Disney treatment.  The story is rather familiar.  When the Princess Aurora is born, she is presented to her kingdom.  Yet the celebration is short lived when the evil enchantress Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) shows up uninvited.  As retaliation, she curses the baby to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die by the evening of her sixteenth birthday.<br /><br />Fortunately, the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are there to soften the curse.  Aurora won't die, just fall into an enchanted sleep so only love's first kiss can wake her.  They even plot to hide and raise Aurora as their own to keep the curse from coming true.  Will that plan succeed?  Is there any way to defeat Maleficent?<br /><br />This movie is often praised for it's look, and rightly so.  Based on artwork from the Middle Ages, it provides a stylized look.  The amount of detail in the backgrounds alone is amazing.  The characters fit this stylized world while still looking real.  Additionally, the background music is majestic.  It is adapted from bits and pieces of Tchaikovsky's ballet based on the fairy tale, and it fits the look of the film perfectly.<br /><br />And as much as it looks and sounds great, this isn't my favorite of the Disney princess movies.  There is only one song from the movie that is at all memorable.  "Once Upon a Dream" is great.  The others are choral pieces that slow things down.  Speaking of slowing things down, the prologue, while needed to set up the story, is very slow.  Once we get to Aurora's sixteenth birthday, things pick up.  But even then, the princess comes across as a boring character.  The thing that saves this film story wise are the fairies.  The three good fairies are wonderfully funny.  And Maleficent is an exciting evil villain.  In fact, she might scare young kids.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie.  But when compared to Disney's other fairy tales, it is a little weak.</p></br><a href="../users/AY39CRKDV5L8S.html">AY39CRKDV5L8S</a><br/><p>Purchased this for my grown daughter - VHS just doesn't cut it - by the time a new format comes out - she'll have to buy her own</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>"Sleeping Beauty" is a magnificent adventure now in widescreen with sumptuous detail. The backgrounds have a lush intricate medieval design while the characters seem to float through each scene effortlessly. I found the movie to be especially calming and filled with luminous beauty. Each scene is exquisite, like a painting in motion. The handmade animation has been restored to a new level of brilliance. The colors are gorgeous and keep your attention even more than the storyline, which is a bit slow in places.<br /><br />The basic story revolves around three good fairies who protect princess Aurora for sixteen years. Nothing too interesting happens until Maleficent (an evil fairy) transforms herself into a dragon and then the story finally has a formidable villain, which makes it a bit more exciting. However, prince Phillip seems unable to slay Maleficent until he is helped by the three good fairies. They keep the story alive and fresh with all their magic. It is fun to watch them triumph over evil. Still, the fairies are not able to undo Maleficent's curse on the princess Aurora who falls into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle created by the evil fairy. The only way she can awaken is to receive a kiss from her true love. Maleficent tries to make this an impossibility, but somehow good overcomes evil in the end.<br /><br />Since this was my first time to see Sleeping Beauty I had never realized it was a story about an arranged marriage. Fortunately princess Aurora meets prince Phillip in the forest before the wedding takes place. To me, princess Aurora looked twenty not sixteen. The only other difference from the story I heard as a child was that Princess Aurora doesn't sleep for a hundred years. Everything else was exactly as I imagined it to be. This movie has a perfection that is rare and beautiful and it is definitely a movie worth collecting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>When 'Sleeping Beauty' was first released it was the target of critical villification--perhaps because of the more stylized art work. The art work is actually a leap forward from 'Snow White' and the earlier classics. It took me awhile to get used to the new technique when I first viewed the film--but now I recognize how effectively it manages to convey the "feel" of a genuine fairy-tale.<br /><br />A nice discussion of the art work is featured in 'The Making of Sleeping Beauty' which accompanies the latest VHS release of the film. Aside from the richly textured backgrounds and brilliant animation, 'Beauty' is blessed with the rapturous singing voice of Mary Costa's light soprano doing full justice to the ballad, 'Once Upon A Dream'. The idea of using Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty' music for the background score and songs was an excellent decision. Music is used throughout to emphasize either the bright or darker moments in the story, always very effectively. Choral work is superb, as are the orchestrations.<br /><br />This is a film that can be enjoyed on so many different levels--music, animation, story, art work--it ranks with the very best of the classic fairy-tales from Disney. And yes, Maleficent, in all of her wicked glory, makes the most impressive fire-breathing dragon you're ever likely to see!<br /><br />Just acquired the 2-Disc DVD version and it's a fascinating Collector's Item for anyone truly interested in this animated classic, with all the extra features giving you "the whole package" on Disney's back story and illustrating how the film was conceived from the start. It also gives you the option of Fullscreen or Widescreen versions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>Music, sound, color, and motion were what Walt Disney once said about exploring the world of animation. This movie has it all! The pure use of the classical backdrop of Sleeping Beauty Ballet embraces this animated feature with a children's book come to life in a 3D manner, when 3D was looked upon as a cinema gimmick. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 3D movie, but seeing this film on the big screen theatre, makes one feel they have entered those magic castles-firsthand.<br /><br />The gimmick here is to give the three good fairies each a unique color, which they relish, even for their change into peasant women, harboring the young princess in the middle of the forest in order to shield her from the witches curse.<br /><br />The witch, of course, is dark, sinister, and very gothic. Not wanting to give into failure for her announced wicked spell cast upon the young princess since birth.<br /><br />During an outdoor walk, the young princess stumbles upon a male stranger, who happens to be her once betrothed, and whom she is bound to marry. Not knowing he is the prince, and him not knowing she is the princess, they both fall in love with each other amongst cute trailing animals.<br /><br />The miscommunication goes further down the road as they announce their love for each other with the people who have been protecting them, and then think they have fallen for some stranger.<br /><br />It's the witch who becomes the first to find out they have mistakingly bonded, and captures the prince as hostage. (For he alone can break the spell, with love's first kiss).<br /><br />It's not enough that she finally set the spell upon the princess, when she finds out her hostage has been set free. Ultimately transforming herself into a raging demon, in order to thwart his advance towards the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Fine animated tale, and incredible execution style for a film developed in the late 50's.<br /><br />Thank God the home video big screens are getting bigger!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>At a hefty cost of six million dollars and six years in production, Walt Disney?s "Sleeping Beauty" promised to be the most ambitious animated feature ever produced. However, changing public tastes resulted in a majestic glossy-looking effort that, despite its technical innovations, failed to become the blockbuster the studio had hoped for. The story, slightly changed from its Grimm?s fairytale origins, charts the birth of Princess Aurora (vocal by Mary Costa). The young Princess is cursed by the evil Maleficent, a horned sorceress visually realized by animator, Mark Davis, that has to rank among the all time great Disney villainesses. Before her sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. But three good fairies believe otherwise. They usher off the baby Aurora into the woods and raise her as their own.  But Aurora meets up with her future in a big way when she comes across the brooding Prince Philip (vocal by Bill Shirley). He instantly succumbs to her charms, not realizing that she is the princess he is supposed to marry. But when Maleficent discovers their romance, she is determined to see that tomorrow never comes for the couple. The magnificently staged final show down between Prince Philip and Maleficent is chillingly good entertainment on every level and the story is as fresh and appealing to seniors as it is for the young at heart.<br />"Sleeping Beauty" was shot in Technirama - a Cinemascope-style 2:35:1 aspect ratio that, in the past, has suffered on 1:33:1 television displays in a cropped off pan and scan image. On disc one of this two disc set we get both the Technirama transfer and a full frame copy ? to satisfy those who have yet to realize that full frame means fifty percent of the image is missing from their television screens. The review herein will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film which, in a word, is beautiful! Colors are rich, vibrant, bold and have been carefully rebalanced to provide a very smooth and crisp looking transfer. Black and contrast levels are fully realized.<br />A few problems - minor digital noise and a halo effect during portions of the forest sequence that flashes so quickly you almost have to stop and think, "Did I just see that?" The audio, remixed to 5.1 but strident, strangely lacking in bass - I say, strangely because "Sleeping Beauty" was recorded in stereo that, while, of course, should sound dated by today's standards, usually has a strong sonic bass characteristic that is curiously absent here.<br />Extras too are something of a disappointment. We get the "Once Upon A Dream" featurette - billed as a ?new? documentary on the making of the film. Created for the previously issued laserdisc and VHS copies this featurette is too short - not covering the scope of production. Next, there's the Peter Tchaikovsky Story - a badly acted and largely fictional account of the man who was inspired to write, among other things, the "Sleeping Beauty" ballet. The transfer here is terribly faded, suffers from chips and scratches and digital noise, edge enhancement and shimmering fine details. We also get the "Grand Canyon" featurette that accompanied "Sleeping Beauty" on its original theatrical engagement, but again, as with the Tchaikovsky Story, all the same criteria apply and - this time - the Technirama image HAS NOT BEEN ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISION DISPLAYS!!!<br />There's a really, REALLY awful music video, some benign child's play and a few short featurettes that, among other topics, explain how the film was shot, the techniques used in the animation and the restoration process employed for this new DVD.<br />Over all, I could have done without these studio junkets, especially since none of them were even moderately cleaned up for inclusion into this special edition. Still, for its stunning art of animation and a near pristine anamorphic transfer of the film - once upon a dream no more!</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>Before SLEEPING BEAUTY, Disney had previously made two other &quot;Princess&quot; movies.  Now, I personally cannot stand SNOW WHITE, believe it or not; the princess is so darned obnoxious, and the prince has no personality whatsoever.  Then came CINDERELLA, which was a much better film but still not really great.  For one thing, the princess was a very likable character; but once again, the prince was so incredibly lifeless that when they finally lived Happily Ever After, one couldn't care less.  Eight or nine years later, Walt Disney delivered SLEEPING BEAUTY, by far the best animated fairy tale so far.  Though the princess isn't as intriguing as those of more modern Disney films, Princess Aurora is along the same lines as Cinderella.  But the one thing that I found the most groundbreaking about this film (storywise) is the prince; he finally had a personality, maybe even more so than the princess!  Thankfully, the trend lasted throughout the rest of Disney's Princess films, but that's not to say that it's the best thing about this film.<p>Although this film obviously borrows some elements from SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA, the viewer couldn't possibly care less, thanks to all of the film's strengths.  Besides the aforementioned Prince Phillip, there's also the art to consider: in many ways, it is the pinnacle of Disney animation (and that's saying something!)  The entire film truly looks like a moving illustration/story book, more so than any film before or since.  And the backgrounds seamlessly compliments the characters, and vice versa.  Thanks to the ingenuity and style of artist Eyvind Earle (whom I have actually met in person), SLEEPING BEAUTY remains a beautiful work of art.<p>Another aspect of the movie that I have always loved dearly is the music.  Adapted from the Peter Tchaikovsky ballet, its a masterful composition, indeed.  For the score's highlight(s), view scenes 26-28 . . . . . . . . absolutely riveting.  That one part where Prince Phillip leaps across the bridge on his noble steed, and Maleficent rises to her tower to deliver an onslaught of black magic, sends shivers down my spine every time.  A perfect blend of animation and music if ever there was.<p>And now, this all-new 2-disc DVD enhances the film further than ever before, with one of the greatest transfers of all time.  The picture really is, quite frankly, flawless.  All except for one single shot of the castle tower. Aside from that, utter perfection.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound brings the music to extraordinary life like never before.<p>The extras are where the set begins to waver a bit.  For starters, the Making-Of &quot;documentary&quot;, is only 15 friggin' minutes long!!!!!!!!  I HATE how Disney does this.  But no matter how short it is, it delivers interesting tidbits.  But don't give up hope too quickly, as I did.  There's a lot more spread out across this disc; it's more like they broke up the full-length making-of into seperate sections here and there, and if you put it all together, it's quite good.  But the best extra for me was the original 1950's featurette &quot;Four Artists Paint One Tree&quot;.  It's a fascinating look at different artists and their diverse, unique styles.  Also fascinating is to see how seamlessly all four styles were molded into the art for SLEEPING BEAUTY.<p>Conclusion:  With the releases of this and THE LION KING, Disney has changed their DVD style: focus more on the actual film, and not wholly on the extras (like they did with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  SLEEPING BEAUTY is a classic film to be cherished as long as the art of the motion picture remains, and this Special Edition DVD is to be treasured just as long.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF.html">A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF</a><br/><p>This is a classic a still must have after so long being out I liked it I enjoyed it Walt Disney has some of the best cartoons of all time and I enojoy them I would reccommend anyone to buy all of Walt Disney's classics!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>For some reason, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm really not into Sleeping Beauty. I adore Disney movies and have seen pretty much every one, with the exception of a couple. This does not rank high on my list.  The story never really interested me, the music was just OK. It came as a bit old fashioned for me.<br />That said, It's certainly not a bad movie by any means, just not as enjoyable as some of the other brilliant ones out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Woe is me!<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this most recent release of Sleeping Beauty for a long time - my VHS tape was wearing out, and when my young son discovered the film, it was getting significantly higher playing time.  It is, in my opinion, the best of the classic Disneys (herein defined as those that Walt personally supervised).  Thus, it was was with great relish that I made this my first-ever Blu-ray purchase.<br /><br />The film itself is as good as ever, obviously.  The sound has been cleaned up some, but is still not fantastic.  That's okay, because there's something charming about the thin-ness of these old films.  The video looks better than ever.  The extras are numerous and range from ho-hum to fascinating.  The audio commentary by Pixar guru John Lassiter, film critic Leonard Maltin, and others is informative but unspectacular - it tends to cheerleading at times.  There is a Wonderful World of Disney fictionalised account of Tchaikovsky's life, most interesting as a period example of what was being shown on the WWD TV show.<br /><br />In fact, Disney really dug around in its vault for this disc!  Also included is a short film on the Grand Canyon (apparently the preview short shown in the theatrical run) and another WWD episode on the making of the film.  The best extra, though, is a short film (15 minutes) on four Disney animators playing artist for the day.  They all take the same subject (a particular tree) and make a "picture" of it.  The four pictures are as diverse as the personalities of the artists, and makes for an interesting case study, as well as showing art in progress.  There are also a number of original songs that were written before the decision was made to blend in the Tchaikovsky ballet score, so they sound more like traditional Disney pop songs.<br /><br />So why the 3-star rating?  Well, this Blu-ray disc was so incredibly annoying that I wish I'd bought the DVD instead.  The menus are not easily navigated and worst of all, if you stop the playback, there is no memory, it simply re-starts from the very beginning (including the FBI copyright warning and the ads - and WHY MUST I WATCH ADS WHEN I'VE PAID GOOD MONEY FOR A DISC! ARGH!).  This is not a problem with my Blu-ray player (a PS3-80GB) as all the other DVDs and Blu-rays I've tried retain memory of location and will not restart cold, even when ejected from the machine.<br /><br />My recommendation: buy the DVD instead.  You don't get the same number of extras, but there are lots on the Platinum edition, including the commentary and the alternate songs.</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>I was not impressed with this dvd at all. Even though it's older you should not keep producing movies that stink. I could hardly sit through the entir movie. The sound for the movie is incredibly awful as well. I do not recommend this movie to any child. Parents who just watched it as a child &amp; say that it is good. You have to know the truth!! Don't make any kid sit through this pathetic peice of junk!!!!!! HORRIBLE I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Most new Disney editions have been improvements over what has come before, but this new edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is an unparalleled improvement on all previous editions.  Before receiving the new Platinum DVD copy I dipped back briefly into my old VHS copy that I had for my daughter when she was a child.  4:3 ratio, poor color, in general nothing special.<br /><br />I then put in the disc for the new Platinum edition.  I was utterly and absolutely astonished.  Widescreen instead of 4:3.  The improvement in the color was unbelievable.  Now, I have to offer a disclaimer.  I watched the Platinum edition on a Philips up-conversion DVD player.  Unless you own an up-conversion DVD player and a high-def TV it won't look this good for you (though it is also available in Blu-ray -- I would love to have checked this out on Blu-ray through my Sony PS3, but I only had the regular DVD).  But with my set up the results were nothing short of spectacular.  I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  Even if you have a relatively low-tech DVD set up, this is going to be a vast improvement over the old VHS edition.<br /><br />SLEEPING BEAUTY has always had special emotional importance for me.  My Dad and I never did much stuff together.  I don't have many childhood memories of just me and him.  But for some reason he took me, when I was a very small child, to the theater to see SLEEPING BEAUTY.  I believe that it was the only movie that only he and I ever saw.  My mother took me to many, many movies, but my father only this.  We would later go as a family to many movies, but this one was just the two of us.  This alone would mark this as a special movie.  This new edition brings back the original big screen experience that I had at the Markham Street Cinema (since torn down) in Little Rock, Arkansas as a small child.<br /><br />As an adult SLEEPING BEAUTY is both a wonderful experience and something approaching self-parody.  There is A-List Disney and B-List Disney.  SLEEPING BEAUTY is without any question A-List.  It was one of the last feature length films done before the institution of the Xerox process.  I consider it the end of the Golden Age of Disney.  It ends the era that began with SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  The self-parody comes out in the endless take offs on elements contained in the film.  The recent (and exceptionally good) Disney film ENCHANTED takes off on the aspects of this film that shows Aurora as intimate friends with wild animals.  It is also seen in SHREK when Princess Fiona sings and makes wild birds explode.<br /><br />The was the last Disney film to be completely hand painted.  ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, the next major Disney production, utilized a xerox process that eliminated the need for most of the background painters.  The difference between this and subsequent films is palpable.  While the economics of the industry dictated that the switch to Xerox be made, it is truly said that the transformation was made.<br /><br />As a child, I found this to be far and away the most terrifying of all the Disney films.  I stil vividly remember the horror I felt as the Prince chopped his way through the barrier of thorns that surrounded the castle and the terrifying transformation of Mileficent into a terrible dragon.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of SLEEPING BEAUTY then this is a must-owen film.  If you don't know the movie, this is the only edition that you should consider for your first encounter.  As I've learned first hand, all of the Disney re-releases of their movies are utterly first rate.  But this is one of the great Disney movies.  We get not only a exquisite version of a Disney movie, but a first rate version of one of the greatest fims that Disney had mde.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>For a fifty year old animated movie, Sleeping Beauty holds up exceptionally well for the modern viewer.  While a bit light on story (evil queen threatens new born princess with curse of death, fairies cause the curse to be limited to slumber, fairies raise princess as a peasant to protect her from curse, curse strikes, etc), Sleeping Beauty tells that story quite well without relying too heavily on over-the-top musical numbers.  Visually, Sleeping Beauty is one of the stronger works of from Disney with a striking Maleficent, contrasts between light and darkness, and one incredibly creepy castle for the evil queen.  Outside of the fairies, the good side is a bit boring, but the three fairies carry the story and breath life into Sleeping Beauty.  Of course, the movie relies on a bit of stupidity on the part of the fairies to actually have a story, but beyond that, the movie works.  This one truly is a classic.<br /><br />This is the two disc "Platinum Edition", however, and there is an abundance of special features.  This set has a commentary track and a trivia track that are each, unfortunately, buried in the bonus features menu on Disc 1.  Rather than having those two features which are designed to play along with the feature be on the main menu, they are each tucked away and easily missed.  The only other features on disc one are a music video from Emily Osment singing the signature song "Once Upon a Dream",<br /><br />The second disc has the bulk of the special features and this is broken into "Cottage" and "Castle".  "Cottage" is designed for the younger viewers with a poorly designed dancing game and a language game so horribly narrated that it is best avoided.  The good stuff (for adults) is in "Castle" with a making of, alternate scenes, a 30 minute video with visuals of the Grand Canyon set to music, the original broadcast of a Disney documentary, and all told, if you're looking for bonus footage, this is the disc to get.<br /><br />On the strength of the art, the fairies, and Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty is a Disney masterpiece.  The Platinum Edition is the DVD to own.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Sleeping Beauty" was one of my favorite Disney animations when I was little, along with "Alice in Wonderland". Watched it quite a few times, and know all the words to all the songs, and pretty much all the dialogue, both of which are pretty good.<br /><br />A princess, Aurora, is born, and three fairies come with gifts to give. Only two, beauty and song, are given. The sorceress Malificent interrupts the ceremony, and gives a gift of her own, a promise that when Aurora touches the spindle of a spinning wheel on her sixteenth birthday, she will die. Luckily, the third of the fairies, Merryweather, has her gift to give, and she counters the spell. If the princess does prick her finger, she will fall into sleep rather than death, and can be awoken with true love's first kiss. Still, the King is not convinced, and has every spinning wheel burnt, and the fairies take the child into the forest, to be raised as a peasant under the name of Rose. Will this be enough, or will Malificent get her way?<br /><br />The animation and scenery has a medieval flavor, while the augmented Tchaikovsky score and additional songs really add to the atmosphere. The sorceress Malificent is probably my favorite Disney villain, she's a very carefully crafted character, from the crack of her staff, to her flowing robes to her soft voice. The chatter and squabbles between the good fairies is pretty interesting too, as is the discussions between the two kings. Fine characters all round, though I do feel a bit bad calling Malificent "fine"...<br /><br />Worth a look for fans of fantasy and lovers of animation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>First of all, this comes in Widescreen or Fullscreen. You chose when you hit play.  This was the first animated film to be made in 2.35 aspect ratio.<br /><br />Aurora is the first child of the king and queen.  There is a royal baby shower and everyone is invited except the evil witch Maleficent.  The first two fairies give Aurora her gifts when Maleficent arrives and gives Aurora her gift, "She will prick her finger on a spindle and die."  As Maleficent has the strongest magic, the final fairy, Merryweather, cannot change it but modifies it to she will sleep until awaken by true love's kiss.<br /><br />To prevent this from coming true, the king burns all spinning wheels and sends Aurora to be raised by the fairies in the forest.  Aurora grows up as Briar Rose and just before her 16th birthday she meets a gallant stranger in the forest.  Thinking it is safe, Aurora goes home and there is a big party for her.  Maleficent fulfills her curse.  To spare the kingdom the loss, the fairies cast a spell across the entire land putting everyone to sleep until Aurora awakens.<br /><br />As it turns out, the man in forest is Prince Philip, Aurora's betrothed.  And it is his kiss will wake her up.<br /><br />This is a beautiful classical Disney animated film.  The colors are vibrant and the widescreen gives the film extra depth.

It's a gorgeous, elegant, and absolutely amazing landmark in animation; a film so charming, memorable, and beautiful that it has been hailed as the most incomparable film in the animated genre, and with good reason. Detailed backgrounds, glorious colors, outstanding visuals and beautiful music are all contributing factors to the grandeur pageantry that &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; enthralls on its audience.<p>Up until the last few years, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was actually considered one of the few Disney 'failures.' That means, a poor box-office success. But that was 1959. Since then, the film, like &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia,&quot; has returned to theaters many times and made way on video for new generations to enjoy, earning large estimates of money and critical praise, not to mention being the most requested Disney film on video after &quot;Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot; <p>It was finally re-released in a fantastic Special Edition DVD, and looking back, I can't believe this was once considered a failure. As if! This is not just a timeless tale of good and evil; the plot is elegantly portrayed with rich textures and stunning animation.<p>Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's best animated films, EVER, and a must-own DVD for any collection. If only Disney still made films like this. I don't think we could be so lucky. Don't delay, get this before time runs out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This is a new release of a Disney classic that first appeared in 1959. As is my custom, I much prefer to watch an animated feature film with several of my younger grandchildren (ages 3-7) and did so again with Sleeping Beauty on its 50th anniversary.  Once again, they were engrossed in the story line whereas I was somewhat more interested in how the quality of animation measures up (after 59 years) when compared and contrasted with recent films such as Toy Story and Toy Story 2, the three Shreks, Ratatouille, Cars, and Wall-E. It measures up remarkably well. Just as there is a certain charm in black-and-white classic films from the 1930's and 40's (e.g. Casablanca, The Little Shop Around the Corner, and It Happened One Night), the same is true of older Disney features (e.g. Dumbo, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Pinocchio) despite relatively less sophisticated animation.<br /><br />There were also generational differences when my companions and I examined the special features that include "Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough (a fully immersive virtual tour), an all-new "Enchanted Dance Game," the "Dragon Encounter Audio Sensory Experience," and an all-new "Making of Sleeping beauty." Predictably, my grandchildren much preferred the supplementary games whereas I was (as always) intrigued by the "behind the screen" material such as a discussion of the film by John Lasseter of Pixar, the film critic Leonard Maltin, and the Disney animator Andreas Deja. The production values in this new edition are superb, especially in the Blu-ray version.  The running time of 75 minutes seems just about right. Whatever the ages of those who see this film and one or more of its numerous special features, they will find much to enjoy and appreciate.<br /><br />The story line is strikingly similar to the one in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  A daughter named Aurora is born to royal parents and then cursed to die by her 16th birthday by an evil fairy, Malificent. To protect her, three good fairies take her away, re-name her Briar Rose, and raise her themselves. A handsome prince meets her by chance, they fall in love, and agree to meet again soon. However, on the night of her 16th birthday, as she prepares to return to her parents and be crowned a princess, the evil fairy locates her and then.... Fortunately, everything eventually works out for Aurora as it also does for Snow White, Belle, and other Disney heroines.<br /><br />I highly recommend this 50th anniversary celebration of one of Disney's most delightful animated films. Although it was under-appreciated when first released, I think it will now receive the praise it so clearly deserves.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>It has been over two decades since I last saw Disney's animated film SLEEPING BEAUTY. I was just a small child in elementary school when I first saw the film. Once again, Disney digs deep into their vault and re-releases the classic animated film as part of their platinum edition series. The two dvd set includes the remastered version of the film and a slew of bonus features that the family is sure to enjoy.<br /><br />The story of Aurora, princess to King Stefan, she is a welcomed into the kingdom with a lavished celebration. The infant is greeted by King Hubert and his son Prince Philip, whom Aurora is betrothed to marry later in life. Then Aurora is paid a visit by the three good fairies Fauna, Merryweather, and Flora. Flora and Fauna are able to bless the child with the gift of beauty and song but before Merryweather could bless the child, the evil witch Maleficent drops in unexpectedly. Displeased that her presence was not wanted at the celebration, Maleficent curses the child that she will die at the age of 16 with a single prick to her finger by a spindle. Thankfully Merryweather weakens the curse to simply a deep sleep. Reluctantly, King Steffan allows the three good fairies to take Aurora out of the kingdom until she is the age of 16, to protect Auroa from Maleficent's curse.<br /><br />As mere mortals, the three fairies raises Aurora as Briar Rose in the forest without raising a suspicion. In the meantime, Maleficent has her army (who are totally incompetent for comedic value) out searching for Aurora for 16 years. When she realizes her army's mistake of looking for a baby for 16 years, Maleficent sends out her pet raven Diablo to search for Aurora. With the assistance of the fairies, Prince Philip goes to rescue the princess who had fallen under the evil witch's spell.<br /><br />Everything you expect in a Disney animated film is there, song, comedy, drama, and a anti-climatic ending is here in the lavished remastered film. This was the first time I have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY since I was a child. I almost forgotten how good this film is. The colors in this new version is vibrant. The music is beautiful. The music in today's Disney animated films lacks the beauty and elegence of the classic Disney films like the orchestral score for SLEEPING BEAUTY. Once again Disney does a wonderful job at remastering and re-packaging SLEEPING BEAUTY.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>I first viewed `Sleeping Beauty' during its original theatrical release in '59. It was a birthday present. I had just turned seven (you may now do the math). I loved it then and only recently have watched with my nineteen year old daughter at her request.<br /><br />`Sleeping Beauty' stands at the end of phase I in the history of Disney's production of feature length animation films. Following such early classics like `Snow White' (37), `Alice in Wonderland' (51) and `Peter Pan' (53) and preceding the modern masterpieces `Little Mermaid' (89), 'Beauty and the Beast' (91), `Aladdin' (92), `Pocahontas' (95) and `Mulan' (98) you can easily observe both the gains in production values from the earlier and the shortcomings in comparison with those that followed.<br /><br />Yes the characters are grossly undeveloped when judged by today's standards and the animation falls noticeable short of what can now be done, the colors are brilliant and alluring the three good fairies Flora, Flauna and Merryweather enchanting and the music memorable.<br /><br />Whether you love it or just like this film it's a piece of Disney history and should ultimately be judged by its main target audience, children.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>I was probably about three years old, when I first saw Walt Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY in the movie theater.  It was re-released in the mid-1980s, and, no doubt, many of us Generation Yers, as well as people who were children when it was first released, a good thirty decades before, will recall just how beautiful a film it truly is.  For starters, the use of color to tell this oft-told tale, with great attention to detail.  Particularly, I recall the scenes that take place in the forest, when the beautiful Princess Aurora, who carries a curse on her head, bestowed on her by the evil and vindictive Malificent, is hiding away with her fairy godmothers, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather.  It's so green in these sequences that I can almost smell the earth.  What's more, Princess Aurora is drop-dead gorgeous.  It's easy to see why the jealous Malificent cursed the blonde-haired beauty at her christening.  [Yes, though most of you probably know about the plot already, for those of you who aren't familiar with it.  Aurora's curse is that, before sunset on her sixteenth birthday, she will fatally prick her finger on a spindle.]  What's more, the music is just beautiful.  For those of you familiar with the original score, by Tchaikovsky, you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>Disney really gave this film the art-treasure treatment. The film is nearly 50 years old, but the colors glow and the sound is wonderful. A painstaking frame-by-frame restoration was conducted, and the soundtrack remastered, resulting in a film which probably looks better now on DVD than when it was originally released. This film has always been a favorite of mine of all the Disney classics, and I think the music has a lot to do with it. "Once Upon a Dream" is truly beautiful, which is a given considering the classical composition it was based on. The artwork is superb, even for Disney in its heyday. This movie is rightly considered a classic, and has finally been given its due on DVD.</p></br></body></html>

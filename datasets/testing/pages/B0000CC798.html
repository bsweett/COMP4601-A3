This film, in particular, allows us to spend a little time with some of the "secondary" characters and really builds up their personalities, particularly Ice Man and Pyro. Nightcrawler is a wonderful addition to an already strong ensemble cast.<br /><br />I do wish that Cyclops had been given more--his character is probably the most poorly used of the series--but other than that, there is little to complain about in this film. It's a whole lot of fun and well worth the watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>This was 100 times better than the original! The visual effects were so enjoyable, and the acting was greatly improved. I wasn't really looking foward to this film, but now that I have seen it I can't wait for another. Great buy.<p>Great extras as well!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Actually give this one 4 1/2 stars.  Much closer to the spirit of the comics than the first movie.  General Stryker hates mutants even though his son is one.  He has a beef with Professor X and his school and begins his hunt against the mutants.<p>Not only that, but Stryker knows Wolverine from the past and while not going into detail, it's clear he was the one who gave Wolverine is adamantite claws and bone augmentation as a weapon.  Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.<p>Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.  <p>We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.  <p>Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.<p>Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.  Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler get the bulk of the character development at the expense of Cyclops and Rogue who have rather minimal roles in the movie.<p>The DVD is loaded with many extras and multiple commentaries.  One of the best DVDs of 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>With the huge success of X-MEN, it was only natural that a sequel would eventually follow. Indeed, X-MEN proved to be the harbinger of the current trend of high budget superhero films based on the Marvel comics.  X-MEN UNITED is that rare sequel that both builds and improves upon what has gone on before in the first film.  Basically picking up where the original left off, things get off to a rollicking start when a strange blue-skinned mutant attempts to assassinate the President.  Later, it turns out that government agent William Stryker (Bryan Cox) is behind the attack in order to further a plot to destroy all mutants.  As a result, the heroic X-Men must join forces with old foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop Stryker's plans.<p>Like any sequel should be, X2 is a bigger, better, and more fun film than the original.  With much of the set-up already taken care of, the film starts off quickly and never lets go.  Most of the original cast reprise their roles and they never miss a beat. Hugh Jackman leads the way as the surly Wolverine, remaining a solid focus for the audience to identify with.  Patrick Stewart's Professor X and McKellen's Magneto again provide the film's philosophical center with their solid performances.  Compared to the last film, Halle Berry actually gets more to do as weather-witch Storm and she makes the most of it with some touching moments.  Famke Janssen also scores effectively in the pivotal role of Dr. Jean Grey.  As the "new mutant on the block," Alan Cumming adds both humor and warmth as the blue-skinned Nightcrawler.  Bryan Cox brings both pathos and menace as the nasty Stryker, while Kelly Hu brings the right touch of darkness as Stryker's aide, Lady Deathstrike.  Director Brian Singer directs with a sure hand, while creating a coherent story despite the rather large amount of characters.  <p>With its intelligent story, solid cast, and riveting action, X-2: X-MEN UNITED succeeds where many comic films tend to fail, which makes this a film well worth recommending to fan and non-fan alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>An attack on the President of United States by a mysterious Mutant heightens the tensions between Mutants and Humans and prompts the authorization of an assault on Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. The President gives a secretive former military man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) unprecedented power in detaining and questioning Mutants. Unbeknownst to the President, Stryker has acquired vital information from the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan) regarding Cerebro, which Stryker plans to use to carry out his own agenda against all Mutants. Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), Cyclops (James Marsden), Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and the students find themselves on the same side as Magneto and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as they race to foil Stryker's plan.  <p>"X2: X-Men United" is the second film based on the "X-Men" Marvel Comic. Whereas the first film spent a lot of time introducing the characters, this one introduces only three new characters: Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Nightcrawler, and those introductions are well-integrated in the plot. The first film's coherence suffered considerably from all the backstories. But "X2: X-Men United" is able to concentrate its energies on plot with improved results. The story makes more sense and is much more satisfying than the first film. Both films suffer from having too many characters, which sometimes seem to be like so many gadgets, each with its own gimmick. But I think we're stuck with that problem. Director Bryan Singer has done a good job. "X2" is a lot of fun. It may not be as socio-politically complex as the comic books, but it does manage to raise issues of abuse of power, constitutional protections, minority rights, and the politics of fear, if only briefly. The public is told by their leaders and by the media to fear Mutants, and so the public is inclined to look the other way when their rights are violated and they are flagrantly persecuted. Entertaining and recommended, but if the cast gets any bigger, they will need to wear name tags.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>"X2: X-men United" is the movie that SHOULD have been put out instead of 2000s X-men.<p>THE STORY:<p>In this sequel, the mutants are faced with an even greater threat.  Following a Presidential assassination attempt by a mutant, the community at large, already full of anti-mutant sentiment, begins to call for even greater sanctions against mutant-kind.  The X-men are soon forced to join forces with the mutant terrorist Magneto to stop a hate-Mongers insidious plot and to simply ensure the continuation of the mutant race.<p>THE COOL STUFFS:<p>Going far beyond the first movie, even more mutants from the comics make appearances in this movie including Beast, Siryn, Colossus, Shadowcat, etc.  The action sequences in this film are MUCH improved from the first one. Making their "major" debuts in this film are Iceman, Pyro, Nightcrawler and Deathstrike.<p>One of the great improvements in this movie is the simple fact that Wolverine is allowed more free reign in this film to simply kick butt.  One of my pet peeves with the first film was the amount of "pulling of punches" they did with the violence level.  That is not an issue with this film. Wolverine was allowed to go into "berserker" mode and cut the bad guys up in this film.<p>For comic purists some developments in this film include a further look into Wolverine's Weapon X background as well as Jean Grey's Phoenix powers.<p>PET PEEVES:<p>I still take SOME issue with the movie's disregard for the comic's original continuity and storylines.  Iceman and Rogue as well as Pyro are presented as classmates at Xavier's.  Oh well,  the improved action makes up for some of this.<p>Best Scenes:<p>1. Nightcrawler versus the Secret Service<p>2. Wolverine and Colossus defending the school<p>3. Pyro takes out the cops<p>4. Professor X uses Cerebro<p>5. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Waaaaay better than the first.  This is easily one of the best action films of 2003.  Can't wait for the third movie.<p>Highly Recommended</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Wonderfully entertaining on every level, "X2"works as an action film, a political thriller, and a surprisingly moving romance.  It also has a beautifully controlled subtext about "otherness" which drives some exquisitely accurate skewers right through the heartless chest of the current US administration.  Singer and his crew have managed something that few comic book adaptations even strive for, let alone achieve: they've taken the source material and made it resonate for a new audience in a new age.  They show us how good an effects-intensive film can and should be.  Beyond the sheer delight of digital imagery and fight sequences, Singer has clearly expended just as much effort on ensuring that the story is engaging and works as a film narrative and not just as two hours of eye candy.  He doesn't make the mistake of staking his film's whole appeal on a few elaborate, digitized set pieces which are entirely revealed by the trailer. "X2" confirms his place among the truly interesting directors working today (go back and look at the unfairly neglected "Apt Pupil" - his work there is superb, as is McKellen's).  Singer's talent for balancing spectacle, story and sentiment makes me wonder what he could have done with the "Star Wars" prequels - two films which fail on every one of those counts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Well I have no idea where to begin how amazed I am at the second installment in the blossoming X-Men movie franchise. The first movie from 2000 was a great start but had quite a few flaws to it and had a lot of room for improvement from there. Well, I'm proud to say that a good amount of that room is filled up with with lots more action packed storyline and much more intense plot. Let me just say that "X2: X-Men United" is a marvelous follow-up to the first X-Men movie and while that movie was very good, this one trashes that one by a mile with much more action-packed plot and greater intensity. <p>This movie also brings a lot of new characters into the picture such as Nightcrawler and newcomer Pyro. <p>The movie begins with the human and mutant societies sharing the planet except that the skyrocketing prejudices have polarized the two societies following an incident in D.C. and the anti-mutant hysteria reaches dangerous levels to where a vicious anti-mutant army general named William Stryker (Played by Brian Cox) launches an attack against the School For The Gifted and uses an experimental drug that manages to control the minds of mutants and makes them answer any questions that Stryker asks them and is on a quest to build his own version of Cerebro to use against the mutant population through the mind of the now captive Charles Xavier. Meanwhile Magneto escapes from the plastic prison and unlike the last movie, he teams up with his former rivals to fight against Stryker's forces. Meanwhile Wolverine goes back to Canada to try to remember his past and encounters the site of the long abandoned experimental lab, or is it abandoned? <p>This movie, following the footsteps of the first X-Men movie, has tons and tons of action packed sequences, and much darker and bitterer atmosphere to the movie especially towards the ending. <p>This movie still has it's flaws but nowhere near as much as the previous X-Men movie. Rogue, seaming looking more like a pure victim than a psychologically scarred character, plummets from a potential super heroine down to just a background character and played virtually no part in the events in the movie. I just hope that she plays a MUCH larger role in the next X-Men movie, whenever that one comes out. Storm fared a little better than in the last one, showing more personality and character and more intelligence but still nowhere near as much of the punch that the comic book character really has. Gambit still hasn't surfaced yet and he's one of my favorite characters. In terms of the missing characters, it's not necessarily bad that their not here as the comic books have SO many characters that it's impossible to bring every one of them onto one movie so I can't necessarily blame the moviemakers for leaving them out in this movie. Hopefully, Gambit, Jubilee, and Beast will surface in the next installment in this marvelous franchise.<p>On the other extreme though, the characters that fared well in the first movie, are even better than they were in the last one. Wolverine shows a chilling rage during the beginning part of the movie. Patrick Stewert proves that he IS Professor Charles Xavier. No one in my opinion could've played Xavier better than Stewert. Sir Ian McKellan does even better as the villainous master of magnetism Magneto. Magneto is even more chilling in this movie than in the last one. To me, it's great to see the rivalry between Magneto and Xavier continue to develop yet they have to work together to stop Stryker and to me, it shows how it seems like Xavier and Magneto are like two sides of the same coin but each side has conflicting goals. Brian Cox though steals the spotlight as he gives a chilling role as the extremely evil general William Stryker. Most of the rest of the characters are also improved. We also bring in Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler and also future villain Pyro. There are lots more characters besides the ones I mentioned that deserve attention but the three I mentioned are the highlights. <p>I view X2 as the movie where the possible war between mutants and normal humans seems to be in the beginning stages of this movie and it almost parallels what the possible outcome would be in the real world should prejudice overtake the minds of the societies of our world and lead to destructive rioting and even civil warfare. I think that both this and the first X-Men film have powerful messages of the dangers of discrimination against those who are `different' and how it causes devastation on all sides of the conflict.  <p>The special effects once again are amazing and the Cerebro room is absolutely amazing and how it shows the locations of the normal humans and the locations of the mutant populations. It almost is unsettling to see especially if there is technology that can locate every living human on the planet. <p>This movie is getting a lot of the justice that it deserves with it's success at the box office along with Spider Man. I have to say that this is the age of Marvel Comic moviemaking and the blossoming of two powerful franchises and let's hope they have a long lifetime as opposed to what happened with the Batman movie series with the disastrous "Batman & Robin" movie. It can't stop here with the second X-Men movie though. There's just so much more to bring out that this movie needs to continue well past the second X-Men movie. Until all that happens, "X2" will definitely deliver the action and entertainment to keep us entertained until it happens. Perhaps the third one should involve the Sentinels. <p>"X2" is a near epic result of great casting, great script, and strong plot and is destined to become a future classic. There's more than I can give out in words.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>I loved the first X-Men, mostly for its intriging story, fine acting and cool special effects.  Multiply all those by two and you get the result: X2.  The characters are more developed, the action tighter and more gripping and the story more  compelling.  This is a truly statisfying thriller.  The best performance in the movie is a tie: I would have to give that honor to Hugh Jackman again for his evolution as Wolverine, Brian Cox as the sinister, mutant-hating Col. Stryker, Ian McKellan for the wicked Magneto and surprisingly Alan Cumming as the religious Nightcrawler.  The movie starts off with a bang as Nightcrawler attempts to assinate the President in a headspinning opening sequence.  The film moves from there, held together by the stern and tight direction of Bryan Singer and a meatier script where original writer David Hayter gets aid from two other wirters, who help develop the characters more and give the movie a healthy dose of humor.  The climax is an extended sequence at Alkalai Lake, where special effects and an atmosphere of  impending doom take over leaving you leveled from it.  Unless you have been living under a rock for the past month, you know X2 has been coming, and it was well worth the hype.  An action movie with a brain, X2 will leave in awe.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>This is the way a sequel should be made!  You build on the original and take it to the next level.  Everything here is great, with cameos from several X-Men and surprises throughout the film.  My only gripe is the fact that Gambit wasn't in this anywhere!  Colossus had only about a 5-second part where he was metal, although he did manage a good few minutes as human. Please bring him back in the next film with a bigger part - and bring Gambit in there too PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! All in all, this is an incredible movie, and it sets itself up perfectly for the final film in the trilogy (the actors are signed for 3 films, and it's doubtful you could get all of them back for any more so enjoy this cast while it lasts). Nightcrawler's part in the film is amazing, and they truly bring him to life as you'd imagine him from the comic books. The teleporting effect is awesome, and the opening minutes of the film will leave you breathless! It totally changed my opinion of Nightcrawler from the comics because I'd always seen him as one of the weaker characters...now I see that he has the potential to be one of the deadliest! Wolverine gets a ton of screen time, and it's nice to see Iceman use his powers (but let's see him turn to ice in the next film like he does in the comics). This movie stays incredibly close to the comics as far as characterization goes, so true fans should be pleased.  Cyclops doesn't get much screen time at all (but being such a stick-in-the-mud character, who really misses him?), but he's obviously going to play a major role in the next one. Hopefully, the final film will have a few key things to make it perfect: Nightcrawler in a cool uniform rather than the circus clothes he wore throughout this one, Iceman TRULY becoming his namesake (the special effects are there, so don't say it can't be done), Gambit (complete with staff, cards, and overcoat), more screen time for Colossus and Kitty Pryde (she's been in both movies so far for a few seconds, so go ahead and give her some serious screen time), and finally, the return of ALL the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (including their new recruit from this film). Get ready for number three to blow you away if this one is any indication of it. This one blows the first one out of the water, so plan on watching it again and again!  Get out there and see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>There's no question that bigger, bolder, better, faster applies to the X-Men sequel, with a whole array of new characters, more stunts, an obviously bigger budget and a returning cast.  This time round the X-Men must club together to defeat mutant-hating Synger (Cox), who is attempting to trick Professor X (Stewart) into destroying all the world's mutants using his telepathic powers.  Alongside Jackman's hulking Wolverine, there are some great new characters, most notably Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.  A seemingly bizarre casting choice, he works surprisingly well as a German teleporting mutant paired up with Halle Berry's Storm.  Of the kids at the training academy, Iceman's powers are displayed with a light touch, along with his look-but-don't-touch relationship with Paquin's Rogue.  Pyro doesn't really get much screentime but, without giving away too much plot, there's a distinct feeling there'll be more of him in X-Men 3.<p>The acting, as a whole, is good.  In particular, James Marsden isn't nearly as irritating this time round, and actually gets a chance to act in the final scenes.  Famke Janssen proves that she can be quite a presence, and McKellen gives it his all.  But there's no doubt that this Jackman's movie, and he gives it his all to come across as the dark mysterious type.  This fits in seamlessly with the references to his murky past and the fact that his mean streak is shown in full this time round.<p>As for the film itself, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, so the exposition-packed first installment really pays off.  The fight scenes are more impressive, particularly between Wolverine and his female equivalent, an energetic Kelly Hu.  There are also plenty of exciting stunts and the scene where the military break into the academy is very well staged indeed.  Even the obligatory 'human' element of the storyline is anything but cheesy, and mostly quite subtle.  Witness Storm and Nightcrawler, Rogue and Iceman and, in particular, Wolverine and Jean Grey.  Of course, all of this is nothing compared to the ending, which should ensure big box office openings when X-Men 3 is released.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Mutants can't live with them, can't live without them seems to be the preveiling theme of the marvelous X2. Building on the momentum of the first film Director Bryan Singer continues to graft contemporary issues (although, to be fair, the original comic did so as well but not in such a compact fashion)to the X-men story. The major theme of the second feature, like the first, is prejudice and tolerance. Singer handles the themes and the film's story well. Although many of the original elements from the graphic novel involving Stryker have been changed, those changes work dramatically for the film. <p>When we last saw the X-Men, Wolverine had left Xavier's School For Gifted Children and the X-Men compound to discover his origin. He ends up at an abandoned research facility so it appears, on the surface, that his search has reached a dead end. Rogue mutants have become bolder making an attempt on the life of the President. This assassination attempt allows William Stryker the opportunity and excuse he needs to convince the President to sign an order giving him troops to invade Xavier's school and take the X-Men (and the children at the school)captive. <p>Encased in a plastic prison cell, Magneto is a caged bird. When Stryker arrives with a special serum to force Magneto to cooperate in revealing information about Xavier's school and the compound, Magneto sings giving up his old friend to a mutual enemy. <p>Jean Grey's abilities have blossomed in a frightening way since her encounter with Magneto at Ellis Island. Her abilities indicate that she might be more powerful than ever before. She and Storm go in search of the Presidential assassin so they can get to the bottom of who is trying to create a war between humans and mutants. Meanwhile, Stryker attacks Xavier's compound and with Wolverine the only adult around, he goes into high gear fighting them off. All of this becomes central to the conflict between Stryker, Magneto and the X-Men. <p>The performances are all exceptional in particular Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Famke Jannsen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Brian Cox give considerable power and presence to the various roles they play. Unlike some films, the actors here are clearly committed to the material and aren't going through the motions. <p>The DVD looks exceptional although I did notice a bit of edge enhancement. Still, it's nothing serious and doesn't mar an otherwise exceptional presentation. The colors are rich and, unlike the film the Santa Clause (another recent release)the transition from one layer to another in the disc isn't disruptive. <p>The extras are an improvement when compared to the first edition of X-Men on DVD (and comparable to 1.5). On disc one there are two running commentaries with Bryan Singer, Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and a second audio track with various comments from a variety of the actors and producers. <p>Disc two focuses on a wide variety of extras. The Nighcrawler Attack sequence is a multi-angle interactive sequence that is actually quite cool although I doubt you'll go back to it again and again. The Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal provides the nuts and bolds of choregraphing a difficult and demanding fight sequence. The documentary The Second Unanny Issue of X-Men (cleverly titled I might add) is quite good and provides a good glimpse into the production process. It's not the best documentary I've seen included as an extra but provides considerable insight.<p>The Featurettes include The Secret Origin of X-Men, Nightcrawler Reborn, The Adventure Before X2, Introducing The Incredible Nightcrawler and character studies. As before there are deleted scenes although I haven't had the time to investigate all of these fully so can't completely comment. <p>Parents should be warned that there is a bit of bad language and also some suggestive sexual situations in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Three years after the enormous success of "X-Men", 20th Century Fox released "X2: X-Men United". The sequel reunited most of the original film's cast along with director Bryan Singer. Where "X-Men" introduced us to the world of these warring mutants, "X2: X-Men United" blew that world wide open, and delivered to audiences a sequel easily superior to its predecessor.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" basically picks up where "X-Men" left off, Wolverine is still searching for some hint as to who he really is, Magneto is locked away, while Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-Men are trying to ensure peace between humans and mutants while maintaining a low profile. Meanwhile, secretly waging a personal war upon all mutants is a renegade Colonel named Stryker (Brian Cox), who is determined to see all mutants dead or dying, and if some normal people get in the way, so be it. To stop this madman and his powerful forces, the X-Men must stand together, alongside their sworn enemies if necessary, or else mutantkind's days are numbered.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" provided moviegoers with everything that was great about the original film, plus so much more. Boasting even more action, a story on a much grander scale, more impressive special effects, and not to mention more mutants, there was no doubt in my mind that "X2" would have what it takes to soar to even greater heights than its predecessor.<br /><br />Written by screenwriters Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, and David Hayter ("X-Men") the story for this sequel continued many of the threads left dangling at the conclusion of the first film, while going off in an all-new and exciting direction (especially for fans of the comic books) for some of the characters. The first film spent much of its time focusing on Wolverine's decision on whether or not to side with the X-Men against the villainous Magneto, in this film the focus still remains somewhat on Wolverine; however for this film to succeed the scope had to be increased, and "X2" never fails to meet that requirement. This time the story delves deeper into the relationships that comprise the team, and introduces some rather intense moments and new challenges for the characters to deal with. Within these challenges and the understandably heightened drama, one can definitely take note of the fact that the stakes were much higher in this installment and the decisions and actions being taken were going to have some very far reaching consequences for all involved.<br /><br />The original film was a surprising movie for many people because of the amount of time spent within the story developing the characters, something that had generally been unheard of in many comic book adaptations. "X2" took the already established characters and dug even deeper (as I stated a moment ago), while at the same time introducing us to a couple of new main characters. I was surprised by the fact that in a two hour movie, the writers found enough time to continue exploring the already established characters left over from the initial film (of which there are several), while still managing to give us new characters to enjoy without skimping on their development as well<br /><br />I found it fascinating how the inclusion of someone as bitter and bigoted as Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox) for the film's primary villain worked as well as it did. His character if handled improperly could have ended up being just a militarized version of the Senator Kelly character from the original film; instead, he was a multi-layered character that didn't just hate mutants because of what they could do or the fact that they were different. No, his reasons were much more complicated, and it was because of how richly developed his character was that he was such an interesting and without a doubt fearsome foe for the mutants. Brian Cox as an actor always delivers great performances in every film he appears in, and whether they are large or small roles, his character is always memorable ("The Bourne Supremacy" is an example of a larger role or "Braveheart" for a smaller example). As Stryker, Brian plays him as a patriot who only wants to eliminate the mutant problem for the sake of national security, but at the same time subtly conveys the sinister nature inherent in his crusade for what is essentially a mutant genocide without ever going over-the-top or venturing into your prototypical villain territory.<br /><br />The other new character was the teleporting mutant known as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). While I've never been all that fond of the character in the comics, I must say that this film managed to make him a really intriguing, complex character and not to mention make teleporting one cool power to have (this had more to do with the incredible work of the visual effects team than anything else). In the comics Nightcrawler never seemed all that useful other than getting the team into a room that they couldn't bust into as easily, but this film actually made him a useful addition to the team, and even a mutant that could be feared if provoked into action. As far as Alan's portrayal of the character I would have to say that he did a great job with the role, and gave the character the perfect balance of self-doubt, faith, and quirkiness that allowed for such a strange creature to seem so real to the audience.<br /><br />The rest of the cast for "X2: X-Men United" (meaning those reprising their roles from the first film) gave strong performances with only a minor gripe here or there, and some even improved upon what they had done prior. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine had already given the definitive performance as the character, but in this film he takes it even further by getting to explore some new territory with the hero. For instance we finally get to see what Wolverine can really do when allowed to cut loose (which made for an incredibly entertaining action sequence), also some new revelations about his past prompts him to doubt the kind of man he was prior to the hero he has become and to wonder if he really wants to know the secret behind his past.<br /><br />For Shawn Ashmore, his character of Bobby Drake/Iceman was given so much more to do this time around. Before he was used as nothing more than the nice boy at school for Rogue to identify with; however, in this film he has become her boyfriend and is beginning to find his way on the path to becoming a future X-Man. If I had one minor complaint about Shawn's performance it would be the fact that sometimes Bobby comes off as being a little too timid and insecure. Granted those attributes would be due to the writers, which of course took their cue from the comics to an extent, regardless the character at times appears too weak that you almost wonder what Rogue sees in him.<br /><br />Unfortunately in a film packed with this many characters some get put on the backburner and aren't given the screen time their character deserves. This would be the case for the mutant known as Cyclops (James Marsden). In the original film, Cyclops was given several key moments to shine as one of the integral members of the team; however, in this installment he is relegated to a handful of scenes. It's a shame that a character as fun as Cyclops can be, and with as rich of a history as he has in the comics that the writers didn't choose to do more with him. I guess sometimes the story just doesn't work as well with some characters as it does with others. Even with the truncated role, James Marsden still brings the character to life in a manner perfectly befitting his comic book counterpart.<br /><br />Lastly, director Bryan Singer ("X-Men" and "Superman Returns") deserves mentioning as his hard work allowed for this film series to raise the bar in terms of what comic book movies should aspire to. With "X-Men" and especially with "X2" he proved that audiences want more than just visual effects extravaganzas and big fight sequences, they desire a story that sucks them in and remains grounded in a reality similar to our own, along with fully developed characters that they can invest in and relate to.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" was an excellent movie and comic book adaptation rolled up in one. While "X-Men" was a really good movie, this one blows it out of the water with great ease. Granted there are a few minor complaints about some character treatment, but by and large everything in this adaptation worked brilliantly. Just like "The Dark Knight", "X2: X-Men United" is a comic book sequel that transcends the stigma of being just another run-of-the-mill comic book movie and stands proud as one of the best ever made.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and mild sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>The first one was better because it was something we had never seen before. Having read the comic books, I wondered if Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play the hardened Wolverine or if Halle Berry would make a good Storm.<br /><br />So the sequel is supposed to be bigger and better in it's action sequences because we have the background story as well, but it is not necessarily so in this movie. There is alot of action, but much of it is of the generic type. The fight between Mystique and Wolverine was much better than the one between Deathstrike and Wolverine (in this one the action was so cut and jerky that I couldn't see clearly half the time). I was not impressed with most of the characters and a few of them took a step backwards in this movie.<br /><br />The characters of Cyclops and Storm are key examples. It is hard to make Halle Berry asexual and unexciting, but Director Bryan Singer made it so. Cyclops comes off as a semi-gay, nsync fan who is the fall guy for the blossoming Wolverine/Jean Grey relationship. Other characters whose motivation is a mystery is Pyro. He's a jerk but for him to run off with Magneto and Mystique doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Another character that is weakened from the original movie is Rogue. In the first movie, she (played by the highly capable Anna Paquin) has a teen angst spin that was mildly interesting, but in this one she turns into a helpless, sniveling whiner who only is interested in getting it on with Iceman. However, they decide to expand the role of Iceman and he becomes more of a 3D character.<br /><br />Not all is lost though, Jean Grey is always interesting and fascinating and is played with appeal by Famke Janssen (even if she develops mysterious powers without explanation like Evy O'Connell from the "Mummy Returns"). She is by far the most facinating character in this movie.<br /><br />Not far behind is the new character "Nightcrawler", played by Alan Cumming. However, Singer does not spend enough time fleshing out the character and by the end of the movie, all we know is that he is German, was from a freakshow, has angelic carvings on his body and is very religious. They need to expand his role in X3.<br /><br />Rebecca Romaine-Stamos returns as the seductive (yet repulsive) Mystique. She is the fire of the group and is not afraid to show her emotions through the movie. Wolverine should be as upfront as she is.<br /><br />Overall, the feel of this movie is not different from a James Bond movie. There are the big set pieces, the mad conqueror, characters with interesting names and the world domination plot. It is not original, or even as good as the first movie and I'm sure that non followers will be stumped by the Phoenix plot of X3.....Rating: C-</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>The first X-Men was a huge disappointment for me, the illustrious Marvel Comics characters rendered ultra-stylish but very flat because the film was spread out too thin over too many characters.  On X2, the story and writing became much tighter, but the characters are still a little more preoccupied with showing off their powers than developing emotional facets.  The result is another good-looking film, with good action sequences but not a great deal of emotional involvement.<br /><br />I still can't accept a majority of the casting choices.  Given one of the main subplots of this film is the legendary Jean Grey-Wolverine-Cyclops romantic triangle, it was a mistake on the writers' part to make Cyclops even less of a character than the rest of the cast.  Wolverine is still our main character, taking up the most screentime and with the most important arc, so making his rival Cyclops such a shallow shadow of a character was a fatal misstep.  Halle Berry as Storm is a disaster, projecting no sense of power, leadership, or charisma, perpetually stuck on an oh-pity-me expression; and Anna Paquin sleepwalks her way through another role.  As a person who is doomed never to be able to have human contact, Rogue needs much more anger and fire in her emotional spectrum, and Paquin barely manages to give us just a sad pubescent look.  The character problem, however, is less glaring than in the first X-Men film.  Hugh Jackman remains a joy to watch, even if he's still too young for the role of Wolverine, and Alan Cumming deserves the accolades he got as new character Nightcrawler, giving this film some much-needed humour and eccentricity.<br /><br />The story's been tightened this time, with a better script and dialogue, even though it still has the feel of a series of mutant-power (and CG-effects) showcases rather than a cohesive, progressive plot.  It's still a step up from the original in that this time I actually cared about what was going to happen next, whereas in the first one I just waited for the whole thing to be over.<br /><br />The ending of this film will set off alarm bells in X-Men fans; if they are indeed about to invoke the fabled "Dark Phoenix" plot, the next installment has the promise of being either the greatest comic-book film ever made, or a colossal dud that flunks the expectations.  Bryan Singer sets it up well at the end here, though I fear that if the thin characterizations of the first two X-Men films persist, then the emotional punch of the Dark Phoenix story may fail to come through.  One can only hope, though:  The Jean Grey-Wolverine relationship in the original comics was heartbreaking, dark and endearing at the same time; I certainly wish they would nail it on the next film.  In the meantime, X2 is good enough as entertainment, even if it's not particularly deep -- once again, a disappointing treatment of the characters of the X-Men comics, some of the most troubled and fascinating characters in comic-book history.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />The sequel to the beautifully character driven original, "X-Men" has more action, a longer running time, and a larger cast this time around. For many people these attributes constitute credentials for a "better" film but in my opinion "X2" SLIGHTLY falters in the story telling department when compared to the first film simply because the film abandons several character's development; characters who were developed and introduced in the first film, only to be pushed to the side in favor for the Wolverine character. Before I begin my analysis I'd like to state that I am the hugest X-Men fan in my area. I meet a lot of people who say they love X-Men but when I actually converse with them I found out that they are merely fans of the cartoon and actually know very little about X-Men at all.<br /><br />With that being said, i thought the opening scene to the film was great and there is no denying that the film's greatest highlight is the inclusion of the character Nightcrawler, who is played impeccably by Alan Cumming and whose action scenes are crafted beautifully by the special effects department. The main plot of the film is an intriguing one, based on the X-Men graphic novel, "God Loves, Man Kills."  Bryan Singer made some changes to the storyline, which is a SLIGHT  shame because the original story would have complimented the religious character Nightcrawler greatly. The original story  had such a deep meaning, using a lot of religious symbolism, which lead to the drawing of comparisons to mutants as angels or demons in a society that was swarming with fear of the new mutant phenomenon. All this was changed in order to tell Wolverine's story, so essentially this film is combining two stories and putting them into one, which in its own right is pretty well done. The other story is the Weapon X saga and what Brian Singer has done is taken William Stryker, the villain from "God Loves, Man Kills" and made him the architect of Wolverine's unbreakable skeleton. Willian Stryker, who is played impeccably by Brian Cox, is the other strong point of this film. He plays his role with great conviction and the best scene in the film is when he finally reveals his malicious plot to Professor X. It also must be noted that the cinematography is beautiful as well as Singer's directing...but his writing is an entirely different matter which i will touch on later.<br /><br />Another excellent scene that must be noted is when Magneto, played exceptionally once again by Ian McKellen, rips the blood iron out of police guard's body. The inclusion of this scene is almost worth forgiving all the other inconsistancies in this film.  ALMOST.<br /><br />There are several characters in this film who feel left out and feel like they stand around and don't contribute much to the story, namely the characters Cyclops Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro. Cyclops' role feels cast aside in favor for Wolverine and it sticks out like a sore thumb. He is simply missing for a good hour and fifteen minutes with little explaination as to where he went. The lack of urgency into his wherababouts is nowhere to be seen, especially in his true love Jean Grey, which for me is an example of poor storytelling. Jean flirts with Wolverine too carefree and mentions she is worried about her lover but it cannot be seen on the surface at all. I understand that it's okay not to have Cyclops at the center of the film, as he wasn't even part of the X-Men team for most of the 80's, but to introduce a character in the first film and to simply push him aside with little explanation of his whereabouts is what I consider poor storytelling. If you want to take him out of the highlight, do it right, and for me this was only a hint of what was to come in an even worst handling of the character in the next film, X3.<br /><br />All the scenes with Iceman, Rogue, and Pyro feel misplaced, like a channel was changed to Disney Channel or Teen Nickelodeon. Clearly Singer doesn't read the comics or novels because his interpretation of these characters is so far off that it makes me cringe. During this film's down times the dialogue is not at its best. References to boyfriends, girlfriends and babysitting, it feels misplaced in a sci-fi environment, especially X-Men.<br /><br />The lack of character development for Rogue's character is disappointing as well. Her character in the first film, while changed to a young girl with no super powers and more in an innocent phase in her life, was still appreciated because she was a vital role to the main plot and I felt her introduction would lead to the eventuality of her becoming the Rogue we all know and love; strong spirited and fighting in a deep struggle to control her powers. There is nothing like that here. She is simply Iceman's girlfriend and all hope of her becoming the Rogue that we all know and love is abandoned. The thing I abhor the most about this film is the relationship that Brian Singer created for her, which is with the Iceman character. This is so far off from the comic that I cannot turn a blind eye to it. It feels blasphemous, putting her in a relationship with the Iceman character. In the comic book there is a beautiful story that is told, where she is in a relationship with a character named Gambit, a playboy type character. She struggles in finding trust for him and he struggles in trying to prove his love for her, knowing he can have any woman he wants, he chooses the woman he can't touch. It is a very touching story and better executed than the sappy love story Singer has created. What also must be noted is they way Singer conceptualizes Rogues reactions to Iceman's advances. When Iceman makes a pass at her she is hardly resistant at all, while in the books, THE REAL ROGUE would punch you in your face if you tried to make an advance at her because she is greatly traumatized by her childhood experience with touching another person, which was executed beautifully in the first film. In X2, she simply says, "I don't want to hurt you....Oh well, let's give it a try." That's not Rogue's character at all!!! She is suppose to struggle with her powers and push people away from her in fear that she'll kill them!! Okay, so Singer didn't give Rogue superpowers, that's fine, but to completely change her personality is a crime and a great injustice to such a great character that is beloved by X-Men fans. The love story Brian Singer has come up with is flat, boring, typical, and I know the scene where Rogue and Iceman are holding hands while contemplating the possibility of death is suppose to symbolize similar prospects of the Gambit-Rogue love affair but its execution feels so downgraded and meaningless that it is almost laughable.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt from a REAL romance from X-Men 24 between Rogue and Gambit. This is what was butchered and watered down by Brian Singer. This is one of the greatest romances ever and the main reason why i cannot turn a blind eye to Singer's butchering of this great love story. remember, Rogue cannot touch anyone, yet Gambit, a man who could have ANY woman, chose the one he can't touch...<br /><br />Gambit strokes Rogue's hair and tries to put his cheek to Rogue.<br /><br />Rogue: "No! I can't...Because I know if I hurt you...I know...I'll just want to die!"<br /><br />Tears come to Rogues eyes. Gambit holds her.<br /><br />Gambit: "Then we won't kiss Rogue. Simple as that...Maybe that's just fine now for you and me. Maybe we both have to learn that there is more to love than just the physical. I know what's inside you, chere....Maybe we'll both end up learning what love really means and I can't think of anyone else to learn with than you, Rogue...That's all that matters."<br /><br />WHAT BRIAN SINGER AND HIS WRITERS HAVE DONE IS A DISGRACE TO THE ROGUE CHARACTER!!! What do we get instead of this deep and epic romance? we get a horny iceman who can't take no for an answer, who doesn't consider how Rogue feels, he just wants to make-out. And a Rogue who kisses iceman for 2 seconds and when her power does take effect, it barely does nothing. The consequences of her using her power is completely undermined! When she touches someone, she absorbs their memories and it's a big deal. Here it's nothing but a walk in the park, especially the scene where she "controls" Pyro. I still can't believe this gets by all these X-Men "fans."<br /><br />The Iceman character's personality is another thing that was compromised by Brian Singer. His whole personality has been changed into that of a total wannabe Justin Bieber teenage heart throb, while in the comic he was a humorous and confident smart ass. The Iceman character would have been a great oppurtunity to use some very witty and intelligent dialogue, it's a shame.<br /><br />Another scene that was pointless was the camping scene, or at least a good ?'s of it. The reason why Magneto just so happens to be standing in that particular geographic location while the Blackbird is crashing is never explained, or better yet you can't explain it, it's simply ridiculous that he would be coincidentally there. The scene where Mystique tries to seduce Wolverine is pointless. I would have much rather have utilized that time frame to see where Cyclops was and it feels like Brian Singer lost all objectivity in telling an X-Men story, a story that is an assemble piece, in exchange for the popular-at-the-moment-character Wolverine. I felt it was unwise to introduce Cyclops and Rogue in the first film and completely abandon their development.<br /><br />It was good to see Storm get a little more to do this time around, namely having a friendship with Nightcrawler, who helps her regain her faith. I also enjoyed the handling of the Weapon X saga...it was really well done. i love the scene where wolverine breaks out of the facility and has blood all over his hands screaming in agony!! That 10 second clip was better than the entire x-men origins movie!!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the special effects, namely Storm's tornado's and the epic fight scene between wolverine and deathstrike. And finally we get to see wolverine cut loose, tearing enemies to shreds who invade the x-mansion!<br /><br />despite this films flaws, the goods outweigh the bads...</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Even more so that its predecessor, "X2: X-Men United" is more of a treat for those of us weaned on Marvel Comics and know the complete back story of every single mutant superhero who pops up through the movie. When Dr. Hank McCoy (Steve Bacic) is shown debating the rights of Mutants on television we recognize he is one of the original merry mutants in yellow spandex, the Beast. During the final shot of the film we nod knowingly because our intimate knowledge of "X-Men" #101 means we recognize the strange shape and can hazard a pretty good guess as to what happens in the third X-Men movie before the credits even start to roll on this one.<br /><br />This film is better than the first one, which is a very good sign in the world of Hollywood where a sequel is one thing but a franchise is even better. The first time around the X-Men, the good mutants of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), had to stop Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his bad mutants (the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for those who know their X-Men lore), although there were humans trying to push a Mutant Registration Act through Congress. This time it is the ordinary humans who are after all the mutants in the world, ironically, by using mutants in the effort. In charge of the effort is General William Stryker (Brian Cox), who has found a means of extracting information from Magneto about Xavier's School for Gifted Children as well as some other ways of allowing him exercise some degree of mind control.<br /><br />The worst thing I can say about "X2" is that it begins with the best action sequences the entire film. A mutant gets into the White House and goes after the President (Cotter Smith) in the Oval Office. We know that this is Kurt Wagner (Alan Cummings), a.k.a. Nightcrawler, who has the gift of teleportation (apparently without the omnipresent of brimstone this time around). This surprises us because he is one of the "good" mutants, but the answer will be forthcoming. He is one of the few new characters introduced into the mix and the tatoos they have worked into Nightcrawler's make-up are superb; on the basis of Nightcrawler and Zhaan from "Farscape," there simply need to be more blue chracters on television and in the movies.<br /><br />Anyhow, Nightcrawler's attack on the President gives Stryker carte blanche to go after the mutants and his first target is the school in Westchester, New York. When the troops hit Xavier's school is probably the second best action sequence in the film, and we are still only a half hour into the film (the final action sequences has great significance but is considerably less spectacular). For those who remember when Marvel editor Jim Shooter put his foot down about X-Men characters doing any actual killing (e.g., a whole planet of asparagus people), it is rather surprising to see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) slicing and dicing his way through the shock troops. From that point on the goal is for the X-Men to stay ahead of Stryker's army and try to stop his plan and save mutant-kind.<br /><br />There are echoes of a lot of different epic adventures from the X-Men comic books in this film. The script by Michael Dougherty and Daniel P. Harris is based on a story created by David Hayter, Zak Penn, and director Bryan Singer, who were obviously inspired by the writers (Stan Lee, Len Wein, and Chris Claremont) and artists (Jack Kirby, Dave Cockrum, and John Byrne) of the comic books. There is still Wolverine trying to get between Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Scott Summers/Cyclopes (James Marsden), as well as the sudden spikes in Jean's powers. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is trying to figure out a way of having the most tentative of physical relationships with Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), while John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford) is trying to figure out whether or not he should switch sides. There are a lot of characters being juggled here; Halle Berry has an Oscar and is one of the good mutants, but she does not have much to do except exercise her powers to control the weather periodically. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gets more to do as Mystique, except, of course, you can never tell.<br /><br />Ultimately what makes this film less than perfectlly satisfying is the fact that the nature of the characters compels the writers to create artificial restraints. When Marvel put out the "Ultimate X-Men" comic books it proved what I had long suspected: that you can really only have one fight between the X-Men and Magneto for all the marbles because as long as he has his helmet on, the Mutant Master of Magneticism is pretty much invincible. This is proven in "X2" when Magneto finally escape; keep in mind how he does it and then come up with a reason why he does not simply go out and do that to every human being on earth. Similarly, when the troops attack the school, there is more fleeing than fighting, although the tranquillizer darts used by the invaders do not work on the armored Piotr Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) or Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Katie Stuart) with her ability to walk through walls. Granted, the important thing is to get the kids to relative safety, but Wolverine does not have to do the Horatio at the bridge act.<br /><br />The key to where the next film can succeed even better is contained in the climax, not only in terms of story of self sacrifice involved but also in the promise of rebirth. In other words, the next time around "X-Men" can reach operatic heights if they do any justice at all to the Dark Phoenix epic. Cross your fingers, True Believers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Once more, Bryan Singer, the director of X-Men brings along a spectacular sequel, which possibly promises more & more. Once you've seen the first, you will definitely want to see the second, especially since you get to see even more of the rather lovely Hugh Jackman.<p>All the old characters are brought back to fight another day, and we also get introduced to some new characters - some of the kids from the school get a bigger role, including Rogue's boyfriend, who will make sure that your drink is always `ice' cold.

(He appears topless in one scene, so that adds on the extra hours)<p>All the now well known characters appear at the start, but they don't all appear at the end. Now, I wonder what that could mean? I was quite shocked at the apparent death of this particular popular character, as it seemed totally unnecessary, but never mind. <p>Hugh Jackman is terrific once more as Wolverine, although he meets the female version of him, resulting in some rather painful looking scenes. There are also a few glimpses into his past, and it gets revealed about how he came to be as he is. <p>Anna Paquin appears, and gets a quite good role, although the originally `white' streaks in her hair seem to have turned blonde between films!

This results in some spectacular action scenes with explosive special effects.<p>There are a huge amount of extras on the two disc dvd version, covering almost everything you could possibly want to know about the making of this film, from pre-production to post-production, including the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.<p>The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.<br /><br />The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant "X" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a "Brotherhood of Mutants" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br /><br />You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.<br /><br />Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men (Widescreen Edition)</a>" (2000), "X2: X-Men United" (2003) and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCO83Q">X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)</a>" (2006).<br /><br />"X2" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in "X-Men." More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.<br /><br />"X2" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and other X-Men are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. Interestingly, the US Government becomes the proverbial "bad guys" and Wolverine refuses to "pull punches."<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on character and the way the film eschews moronic "blockbuster" conventions.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>With a different villain in play (though Erik Lendsherr/Magneto is still a important character) this movie does a good job of continuing the story established in the first movie.

X2) picks up where the first film left off. Director Bryan Singer tries to emulate The Empire Strikes Back(1980) by turning X-Men 2 into a long chase scene. The government is going to extremes to put mutants into captivity! "Peaceful Mutants" and "Radical Mutants" must band together and stay one step ahead of government troops.<br />Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) stumbles upon a laboratory where he was used in an experiment. John Ottman wrote the music score for X2. He flavors music cues with bits of classical music. This is the first X-Men film where we see Nightcrawler, a blue-skinned mutant with the power to teleport himself to other places. Singer throws in a couple references to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982). X-Men 2 left a door open for a sequel: X-Men 3(2006).</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>From the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be even better than the original X-Men.

Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This second opus is bringing the war inside the human camp because one military scientist who had had the chance, though not to his taste, of having a mutant son and who had manipulated him so much that  he had managed to take complete control of him, is provoking, or at least trying to, an open war of total destruction against the mutants. This time bad and good mutants unite to defeat that man though the bad mutants take over the game of the bad human and redirect the weapon from total destruction of mutants to total destruction of human beings. This drastic situation is saved in due time and just in time by the good mutants though the bad ones manage to escape and the good ones must sacrifice one of themselves to assure the escape. That will be essential later and it builds a promise because the death of a hero is always compensated by his or her resurrection, generally in that type of literature with an inverted personality. But the film is well built, the special effects are interesting, rich and at times funny. The dramatic tension is perfect and the President of the USA who was going to declare the state of emergency to take control of the mutants is informed by the good mutants about the actions of his mad scientist, and also head of some kind of national security, and we understand this President of the USA changes his ideas and convictions and moves towards a compromise with the mutants. But of course we know it can't last since the President was more or less forced to act that way and the bad mutants are still out there somewhere plotting evil.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Not only did X2 set the standard for the five plus sequels that came out in the summer of 2003, it's has replaced Blade 2 as my favortie comic book sequel since Superman II.

We join them as Wolverine returns to Prof. Xavier's school after a fruitless journey to Alkali Lake in Alaska, where he believed he might find clues to how he became what he is.  Meanwhile, anti-mutant hysteria is mounting in Washington, fed by the sinister Southerner William Stryker, who has a secret agenda.  In pursuit of it, he interrogates the imprisoned Magneto under drugs and learns of Prof. Xavier's supercomputer, Cerebro, with which the Professor can literally find any human mind in the world--or even billions of them at a time.  Stryker captures Xavier and Cyclops while they are visiting Magneto's prison and sends a Special Forces detachment to invade the school, knowing that Storm and Jean Gray are away.  The only thing that saves most of the students from capture is Wolvie, who proves to be a ferocious fighter in their defense and delays the military long enough for the bulk of them to escape through a series of secret tunnels.  Meanwhile, Magneto's cohort Mystique arranges his escape from prison, and he seeks out Xavier's pupils, knowing that in order to save mutantkind from extermination they must find and rescue the Professor.<br /><br />I was delighted to see in this film the introduction of one of my favorite X-ers, Kurt Wagner/The Incredible Nightcrawler, a demonic-looking teleport (and devout Catholic).  There's also a brief view of someone whom I suspect is Colossus, the young Russian who can transform his body into steel.  The effects, of course, are fantastic, and the scenes in the beleaguered school and in Stryker's secret base under Alkali Lake (where Wolverine finally learns the truth about himself--or at least part of it) are non-stop thrill-a-minute action told with wonderful pace and careful attention to necessary exposition.  Magneto displays once again the flashes of decency that make him one of the most intriguing of Marvel villains.  And, of course, Xavier and his team are splendid.  This film has convinced me that I definitely want the X-Men to have shelf space in my DVD collection, and I'll be adding both it and its predecessor as soon as I can.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Super hero movies can be rather tough to watch. They are either very good (Superman) or very bad (The Hulk). X-Men 2, is probably my favorite Super Hero film. It doesn't even compare to the first movie. That is so rare for a sequel. Aside from Halle Berry, the rest of the cast is enjoyable and fun to watch. We really get to delve deeper into their universe and deeper into certain characters. We learn more about Wolverine, Prof X, and Jean Grey, just some of my favorite characters. Nightcrawler is also a fun new character. The plot is quite interesting and engaging. Once the film gets going, there is plenty of suspense and action and romantic intrigue. Its a perfectly paced film and, like I mentioned, leaps and bounds better than X-Men.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This film maintains the standard set by its predecessor. The secret of both the first two movies is giving Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart plenty of screen time. Notionally Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the lead character, and he is good, but it is the sometime Shakespearean actors who give these films the touch of class that many comic strip films lack. Add in the ever reliable Brian Cox and you actually have a classy cast.<br /><br />My favourite scene is Magneto's escape from his plastic prison, which is perhaps the highpoint of the film. This scene looks as if its came straight from the comic book form and it works perfectly on film as well. Bryan Singer, who also directed the first film, keeps the excitement levels high throughout, without going completely over the top.<br /><br />I felt the film was a little to long, but that aside, I found it an entertaining film that holds up to repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Bryan Singer's X2 is the rarest of sequels. It manages to be better than the original. This is the movie that comic fans were waiting for. It has action, a message, and a story line that does its best not to insult movie goer's intellegence.<br /><br />The film starts shortly after the battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood that ended the first film. There has been an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a strange mutant who teleports. The mutant is the Amazing Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and he is seemingly under someone's control. The person in control is William Stryker (Brian Cox) who adds another layer to the already complex mix of characters. Stryker is a human who wants to eliminate the mutants and is not above kidnapping Xavier to do it.<br /><br />This film has elements of action, revenge, comedy and even an unresolved love triange. It's impossible to go into much detail without destroying the fun. This is one of the few big budget blockbusters that should be seen. It's a great second feature in a developing franchise that promises much more in the future.<br /><br />The disc that I viewed included two commentary tracks: one with Singer and cinematographer Tom Sigel; the second with the producers and writers. Both tracks were informative and aid greatly in ones understanding both of the comic universe created and the production in particular. A second disc provides hours of extra features on just about all aspects of the production and should serve as a standard on features of this type.<br /><br />See this one it is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I loved this film. The writting, story, special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original.

What's more it is bigger (some $50million), better, darker, longer, more action-packed and generally more exciting, with a substantial increase in the sexual tension. <p>In this highly enjoyable sequel, the warring parties from the first instalment are forced into a partnership of necessity to battle against an army scientist, Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who is determined to wipe all mutant life. To this end, in an excellent opening sequence, he coerces a teleporting mutant by the name of Nightcrawler into an attempt on the President's life with the purpose of turning both the public and the oval office against mutant kind. <p>All the favourite X-people from the first instalment including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey). In addition they are joined by three very noteable additions, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Pyro (Aaron Stamford) and Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu). Although Sabretooth and Toad are missing in action from the first movie they're not exactly missed (because lets face it they aren't the most exciting X-characters anyway)!<p>One of the things I most enjoyed about X2 is how much more there was than the first movie. More action, more humour, more X-Men (and X-children) a longer running time, and in particular, more Halle Berry, more Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Famke Janssen, looking even more glamorous, more alluring and displaying more X-powers (as Dr Jean Grey) than she did in the first movie. <p>That said, the film is still dominated by two actors; Brian Cox (one of Scotland's finest actors) who makes an excellent villain as Colonel Stryker and Australian actor Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. For it is their personal conflict and previous history that encapsulates the battle between good and evil that is at the heart of this sequel. However, they are ably supported by all the previously mentioned cast members and the addition of the excellent character Nightcrawler, played by another Scotsman, Alan Cumming.  <p>Kudos must also go to scriptwriters Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris and Director Bryan Singer, who was much criticised for the lack of action in the opening movie of this very profitable franchise. Dougherty and Harris have injected some subtle humour mainly absent from X-Men and Singer (with help from Editors John Ottman & Elliot Graham) has done well to seamlessly cram it all into 130 minutes, whilst still managing to keep to his promise of a darker sequel. Although critics may argue that much of the intelligence and thought-provoking elements from the first movie are much diluted X2 is still one of the finest comic book movie to date and exactly what X-fans were looking for in a sequel. Not only does X2 pave the way for a summer of superheroes, with The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk imminent, but it also sets us up for the inevitable X3, although this is going to be hard to top.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>The defining characteristic of "X2: X-Men United" is the approval bestowed upon it by fans of the origin comic books; whereas the original "X-Men" movie was seen as truncated and flat in parts, the sequel delivers the goods fans craved: a full half-hour more action, and a dazzling opening sequence that features a mutant attack on the U.S. President. The mutant is a newcomer: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a German circus runaway with blue skin that can bounce and teleport at alarming speeds. Director Bryan Singer watched his first "X-Men" effort start with a slow burn of introducing the setup and character; "X2" had the "geeks" bouncing out of their seats.<p>What follows is a superhero movie on par with "Spider-Man" and the best parts of the "Superman" and "Batman" series. "X2" is a too busy and farfetched, but it keeps twisting, and it features a great villain in Col. Styker (Brian Cox) a military scientist bent on erasing the mutants from the Earth. In theme and approach, "X2" is similar to the second and best installment of the "Star Trek" series, "Wrath of Khan" -- "X2" features a large sacrifice from a major character, and serves as a launching pad for future installments. Just about anything could happen in "X3," and that's a testament to how well this movie is structured. Every important mutant is still on the playing field. <p>After the Nightcrawler attack -- a spectacular, dizzying assault through the hallways of the White House right to the president's desk -- "X2" sends its characters in various directions. Stryker, who has the president's ear, convinces the chief that the mysterious mutant school run by wheelchair-bound Xavier (Patrick Stewart) could be behind the attack. The real source is a nifty twist, but Stryker nonetheless storms the school while Xavier is away visiting his imprisoned enemy/friend Magneto (Ian McKellen). <p>Though human, Stryker is as formidable as either Xavier or Magneto -- he has methods of coercing mutants, putting him in position to rid the world of them through Cerebro, a special tracking machine only Xavier can use; how Stryker tricks Xavier into using it is one of the movie's best secrets. Because Stryker means to destroy the mutants for good; Magneto sets aside his grudge match with Xavier to save both their hides, hence the title.<p> Stryker also holds the key to the identity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the steel-knuckled, mutton-chopped tough man of the mutant school. "X2" has a full plate of characters, but Jackman's the star; Wolverine does most of the fighting, and serves as a romantic possibility for X-woman Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), a telekinetic with growing strength and X-girl Rogue (Anna Paquin), whose powers were coveted in the original movie, but not worth much this time.<p>Also onboard is Storm (Halle Berry) who finds and connects with a confused Nightcrawler, and bad-girl Mystique (Rebecca Romejn-Stamos) whose shape-shifting gifts bust Magneto out of prison and hack into Stryker's computer for his master plan.<p> Singer strains to offer every mutant decent screen time, which spreads "X2" a little too thin in the middle; one mutant that figured prominently in the first movie, Cyclops (James Marsden), mostly tags along in the sequel. Despite the generosity, Cox and Jackman return the forefront again and again as Stryker and Wolverine size each other up. Cox, actually, has played a similar role once before in the terrible Keanu Reeves vehicle "Chain Reaction;" what seemed cartoonish about his military monster in that movie works just about perfect here. Jackman  has a look about him that fits the part, and he's surprisingly funny to boot -- the throwaway lines of  David Hayter's script are one of "X2's" prime pleasures. <p> There aren't as many action sequences as you'd expect -- the canvas is so big, a good part of the movie is spent just leaving and arriving -- and none match the opening Nightcrawler attack, but there is enough for a fight junkie to appreciate. And though there's a bit of social commentary mixed into the movie's fabric, "X2" is nothing less than a fantasy. There's a climax, so to speak, beyond the climax, and then another climax beyond that, which is annoying, but it sets the table for a major transformation of Jean's character. Singer obviously has his options wide open for the third installment, which will presumably pit good and bad mutants against one another again. "X2" ends with Magneto having gained a precious new weapon for round three. <p> For what it does, "X2" does it very well. Singer is clearly serious about not letting the franchise descend into camp as "Batman" and "Superman" eventually did -- there are dumb moments, but they're quickly forgotten. It improves on the original and improves the chances of the series at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Consider the first X-Men film a plot progressing set up, because from the first opening scene in X2 your thrown head first into one of, if not the, best comic to film adaptions of all time, and one of the few times a sequel out do's the original.  Almost all of the first film's entire ensemble cast returns: Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (ever perfect as Wolverine), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) are all back.  Also, the film goes more in depth with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and introduces us to beloved characters Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming who turns out to be nearly perfect in the role) and Colossus.  The storyline finds the X-Men months after the events in the first film, under siege by General Stryker (Brian Cox) who has his own agenda for mutant kind.  Eventually the X-Men must team up with Magneto to stop him, and this is where the film shines.  Director Brian Singer was critiqued quite a bit when it was said that the first film wasn't action packed enough; well, he made up for it here as X2 is action packed from beginning to end and the film pushes the limits of it's PG-13 rating.  The performances are great, and while Jackman is his usually terrific self as Wolverine, he isn't the focus this time around and we get to see Berry more developed as Storm, Romijn-Stamos gets more screen time as well, and Janssen is better now as Jean Grey than anyone could have ever thought before.  The special effects are nothing short of incredible; from Wolvie popping his claws to Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) popping hers, to Colossus' body turning to steel to Pyro's fire spewing shootout with the cops you will be in awe of the special effects wizardry.  The only complaint here is that with the exception up towards the end of the film is once again Cyclops is a criminally underused character.  Marsden is a good actor and Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused.  All in all, X2 is much better than I could have ever hoped it to be, and this is undoubtadly one of the finest comic to film adaptions of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background.<br /><br />X2-X-Men United picks up where the first movie left off, with a mutant attempt against the US President leading to government countermeasures against the X-Men.<br /><br />Moreover, Wolverine is now closer than ever in finding out about his past, while more interesting characters also make their appearance.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

Still, I remember liking it whenever I left the theater, and I'm a tough audience, so that should say something.<br /><br />The special effects are good obviously.  So if you only watch movies for good special effects, you're set already.  I don't remember the plot at all, but it must not have been too dull since I never wanted to leave the theater at any point until the end.  Still, the plot must be forgettable since I forgot it.<br /><br />There were some memorable characters though.  Magneto is pretty darn memorable, all locked up inside that non-metal cell, killing that guard by pulling a bunch of iron filling out of him.  I remember this weird mental mutant too, that just sat in a wheelchair the whole time and invaded others' thoughts.  It was pretty creepy.  My favorite character though was that evil blue shapeshifting chick.  I had a few impure thoughts about her at certain points throughout the film.  Heck, I even thought she was hot in her original form.  She's got a good figure.<br /><br />I also remember a movie spoiler: one of the X-men died.  I remember which one too, but I won't say.<br /><br />All in all, good enough to watch, but not great enough to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>The mutants are back and bigger than before in the "X-ceptional" blockbuster sequel "X2: X-Men United". In the near future, an assassination attempt on the US President by an unknown mutant triggers a vengeful military scientist's (Brian Cox) plot to destroy all mutants. Now to ensure their future, the X-Men must rely on the aid of new allies and old rivals to save millions of lives. "X2" is one of those rare sequels that actually succeed over the original. The 2004 summer blockbuster contains a complex but well-structured storyline, a top-notch cast and some strong emotional subplots. Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Hugh Jackman continues to superbly dominate the role of Wolverine and Alan Cummings is stunning as the gentle teleporting Nightcrawler. Director Bryan Singer adds much excitement in this sequel without diminishing the value of its story and characters. The action sequences and visual effects are quite amazing and a considerable improvement over the first film.<br /><br />If you thought that "X-Men 1.5" was a great DVD then you'll be pleasantly surprised with "X2: X-Men United" 2-Disc Widescreen Edition. The blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a fantastic video transfer with great resolution and rich colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is truly great but for a terrific home theater experience, the DTS audio track really delivers. The 2-Disc Widescreen Edition includes an audio commentary with director Brian Singer and production crew, a "Making of X2" documentary, 11 deleted scenes, photo galleries, theatrical trailers, 11 behind-the-scenes featurettes and colorful interactive menus. Overall, "X2: X-Men United" scores a solid "A".</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>Oh yeah, this movie is definently better than the first.

General Stryker hates mutants even though his son is one.  He has a beef with Professor X and his school and begins his hunt against the mutants.<p>Not only that, but Stryker knows Wolverine from the past and while not going into detail, it's clear he was the one who gave Wolverine is adamantite claws and bone augmentation as a weapon.  Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.<p>Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.  <p>We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.  <p>Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.<p>Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.  Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler get the bulk of the character development at the expense of Cyclops and Rogue who have rather minimal roles in the movie.<p>The DVD is loaded with many extras and multiple commentaries.

This  leads to a public outcry for Mutant Registration and a covert operation by special forces that has been approved by the president against the school for the gifted.  The attack leads to a joint operation between both sides of the mutants, since a dark future seems to lie ahead if the problem is not solved.  As in the predecessor, this film has several subplots that are built up around the general storyline that offers something for all viewers, which generates a terrific cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>Although I was very hesitant about a Bryan Singer-directed version of X-Men, this series is the first comic adaptation since Batman to be truely faithful to the comics.

Wolverine's background is explored and the film endsw with an incredible climatic battle scene.  <p>Since I don't own the DVD yet, I can only speak for the quality of the film.

To revisit the characters that you discovered in the first movie. They built this sequel in the precise way that it should have been built. They started with the characters and went from there. So many sequels are just concerned with being "bigger," they never consider that better would be the best way to go.<p>The story focuses on Logan (Wolverine), and the search for who he is. A nice carry over from the first movie. Along the way, we meet new friends and enemies. Not all of whom are what they seem to be.<p>Apparently, we're to believe that Mystique has been able to keep the impression of Senator Kelly going since we last left them. Hey, minor issue as far as I'm concerned.<p>The effects work is again top-notch. The cast makes you believe that this world of mutants could actually exsist. Director Bryan Singer has once again put together a thoroughly enjoyable movie which is arguably better than the first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>[...]P>It sure looks as if "X2" is on the right track for a sequel, and if anything, it seems better. The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film, and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning, it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences, just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.<p>But that's not all "X-Men 2," or "X2" as the posters abbreviate, is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure, non-stop, full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger, the budget is bigger, the story is bigger, and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side, and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elements/techniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first, but I must say I did.<p>It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.<p>[...] "X-Men" was an excellent comic-book adaptation, in more ways than one, and "X-Men 2" is only better. It contains more action than "Spider-Man" and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original, which is ironic, since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.<p>The cast is first-class, but the real scene-stealer, just like in the original, is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one, just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?". If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, they need look no farther, because though he may not look the part in this film, Jackman can look very suave and proper (see "Kate and Leopold"), and is my top choice for the next Bond.<p>Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss. They're never in between. "X-Men" was an unexpected hit, but more than that, a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart, action-packed and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before, "X-Men 2" improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.<p>I expect "X-Men 2" to break some box office records, and unlike other films, I can honestly say that it deserves it.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Following in the tradition of great movie sequels like THE GODFATHER PART 2, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and T2, the sequel to Marvel's action blockbuster X-MEN looks set to not only outdo the original in terms of incredible action, great characters and amazing special effects, but also reach the heights of a "Better than the first one" sequel. And like many series, this one looks set to be much darker in tone than the first one. Almost all the cast have returned; Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm and Ian McKellen as the metal-moving menace Magneto. According to the previews, the action ante has been considerably "Upped". Fans who were disappointed at the first one in terms of nose-bleeding excitement will be happily surprised says Director Brian Singer. Singer has also said that this one will centre more on the other mutants in the first one (Rather than just Wolverine) and introduce some great characters from the comics including Nightcrawler, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee and Iceman. Fans (Myself included) are very excited about what looks set to be one of the most amazing films of 2003. That said, the first X-MEN was a great action film, and the ever-present law of diminishing returns is a major factor. But with such a great ensemble of talent on board, this one looks like a bonafide winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>In this, the second installment of the X-men series, the mutants find themselves up against something far more subtle and difficult to defeat than the first time:  humans who can manipulate them.  This movie was a tremendous follow-up to the first film, and (for me at least) surpassed it in nearly all aspects.  First of all, the characters from the first film are very nicely developed, especially those of Wolverine and Rogue.  Second, many mutants with small parts in the first one and even more who never made appearances at all are now part of the team, and get in on the action.  And finally, the action sequences, special effects, and storyline are absolutely amazing!<p>Nightcrawler, Colossus, Iceman--these are all familiar X-men to many, yet they had no role (or insignificant in Iceman's case) in the first film.  It was great to see the action with these and other new mutants.  Also, Wolverine's past is more fully explored, and the relationship between Magneto and Xavier is also developed (the fact that they have to work together, to some extent, to defeat a common enemy shows that they really are two men with the same purpose, but a different way of accomplishing their goals).  I was very impressed with the twists and turns taken in the relationships of the characters, and the development of the X-man saga.<p>The special effects for this film were absolutely breathtaking, as were the action sequences.  The film opens with a spectacular display by Nightcrawler, and is soon followed up by a berserker rage by Wolverine.  There are several great sequences in the film, and the sight of each mutant using his or her powers (Magneto breaking out of his cell comes to mind) makes you want to stand up and cheer.<p>With the colossal success of these movies and the Spider-Man film, Marvel movies seem to be riding high.  I would love to see a movie involving both Spidey and the X-men, but that's not likely to happen any time soon.  Still, for what it's worth, X2: X-men United is a wonderful new addition to the growing catalog of comic-book movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Surpassing it's rival, the over-hyped MATRIX RELOADED in terms of action, story, spectacle and SFX, X-MEN 2 is one of the (Very) rare sequels that actually manages to turn out better than the original. Pitting the good and bad X-Men against a military scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), the story is more involved than X-1 and has better action and some good humour thrown in for good measure. And fans are kept happy with some great mutants from the comics. Building on his fantastic persona, Hugh Jackman does a terrific job as Wolverine, who finds out more about his mysterious past. And he kicks some serious butt in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto are great, and new mutants Pyro, Iceman, Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstrike. My favourite character, Magneto is even better and Mystique provides both eye-candy and action-woman role. John Ottman's comic book-esche score gives the films a whole new layer of mystery and excitement, and Brian Singer's steady hand makes this one that is not to be missed on the big screen. Building on itself to the amazing finale, the only problem with X2 is that once it's over, you want to see it again. An incredible action event and one of the best movies of the year so far. 5-Star entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Goodness, there sure have been a lot of movies based on comic books coming out in the past few years. We've seen "Spiderman" and its sequel, "Elektra," "Daredevil," "Sin City," "Hellboy," "The Punisher," and probably a few others I'm forgetting. Heck, we can expect to see new installments in the "Superman" and "Batman" franchises soon, too. Personally, I haven't seen any of the above listed films with the exception of the first Spiderman, and it's likely I won't see more than a couple of them any time soon. I'm not trying to bash comic books or anything like that, but for some reason I tend to shy away from films based on this medium. Why? I hear very bad things about many of these films, most of which involve complaints about how the films forego important things like plot and character development in favor of shock and awe special effects. If I remember correctly from my comic book reading days, most of the stories dealt heavily with superheroes faced with moral quandaries and personality problems that translated over into the real world. Not so in the movies. The emphasis here is on blowing stuff up and using the biggest CGI effects possible.<br /><br />There are exceptions: "Spiderman" did a good job focusing on the characters' problems. So did "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United." I have seen these movies, and I liked all three of them. "X2," however, is arguably the best of the lot. The film continues the story of the characters we saw in the first film--namely Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)--while adding a few new faces. After the X-Men saved the world in the first film, not much changed regarding human/mutant relations. Normal people still freak out whenever they see someone shape change, produce fire out of thin air, or any of the other assorted abilities common to mutants. The opening sequences of "X2" do little to alleviate such fears. An attack on the White House by a mutant with the ability to teleport (Nightcrawler, played effectively by Alan Cumming) nearly costs the president his life. The result is a crackdown on mutants everywhere with the resurrection of the dreaded Mutant Registration Act, a draconian measure that will severely restrict the activities of mutants everywhere.<br /><br />The man in charge of carrying out the new act is General William Stryker (deliciously evil Brian Cox), a man whose new mission allows him to carry out his own personal vendetta against Xavier and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. I won't spoil the reasons behind the vendetta, but his official mission sees him launch an attack against Xavier's school in order to round up the freaks. Unfortunately, he picked a bad time to make an appearance--Wolverine is back from his soul searching and is ready to kick some serious you know what. While he assists in salvaging what he can from the fiasco at Xavier's pad, the rest of the X-Men are out and about trying to track down the mutant responsible for the attack on the White House. If they can find this person, they reason, they might be able to head off the impending crackdown. Of course, their mission soon discovers that Stryker's fingerprints are all over the place. Too, Magneto manages to escape from his plastic prison and, with the oddly alluring Mystique at his side, throws a few wrenches into the whole process. By the time the movie comes to an end, we've seen the overall storyline advance amidst an avalanche of mind-blowing special effects including but not limited to huge tornados, rushing walls of water, and whipsaw quick fight sequences. Fun stuff!<br /><br />Heartfelt thanks should go to director Bryan Singer for masterfully balancing the action and CGI with numerous character driven arcs. It's great to see fights and mutant powers blasting away at everything in sight, don't get me wrong, but it's more interesting to see how the characters develop. And in that department Singer and company do a good job. The whole human versus mutant conflict receives fresh treatment, as does Wolverine's eternal struggle to understand who he is and how he came to be. The latter is probably the most intriguing element in the storyline due to its relevancy. Who among us hasn't struggled to understand our identity at some point in life? Of course, most of us haven't been the subject of government experimentation that grafted metal to our bones and wiped our memories clean in the process, but you get the idea. And while the movie simplifies that theme so even the densest dolts in the audience will catch on, it's still an almost universal human issue that resonates with all of us. CGI and character dynamics aside, "X2" is a lot of fun if for no other reason than checking out all the babes. Halle Berry (not a favorite of mine), Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and Kelly Hu provide more than enough eye candy for us older "kids" in the audience.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" has something for everyone. And check out the extras on the two-disc set! That's what I call a DVD! I won't waste time going over them in detail except to say that the sheer number of supplements guarantees a viewer can spend plenty of time exploring every aspect of this film's production process if he or she wishes to do so. If you haven't seen "X2" yet, prepare to be blown away. One hopes the next installment will surpass the previous two, but the absence of Singer behind the camera should cause some concerns. Oh well, even if the next one stinks we've still got these two great films to watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>While I was more than a little disappointed in both the writing and production values of the first "X-Men" movie, the sequel more than makes up for the deficiencies of the original.<p>"X-Men United" lives up to its name: Whereas the original X-Men movie was basically "Wolverine, guest-starring some X-Men," the sequel greatly expands the time we spend with the other characters, and all of them are the better for it, including a more compelling vision of Pyro than even the best of the comics has shown us.<p>While the story picks up months after the original, this time, the story is bigger, grander, and more exciting. The film hits the ground running with an amazing sequence introducing the teleporting Nightcrawler, in an eye-popping attack on the Oval Office. Contrast this to the obviously foam rubber girders wrapped around the X-Men at the climax of the last film, and it's immediately obvious that the special effects this time around will be something to enjoy, not something to overlook, and so they are.<p>As always, the acting, particularly by Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan, is top-notch. The strong central presences of the films' Wolverine and Magneto continue to ground audiences in the larger-than-life world of the X-Men and with the tease in the last few moments of the film egging on comic fans, it'll be too long to wait for the third installment in this series.<p>Recommended for superhero fans, including those who thought the first film didn't live up to its potential.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Consider the first X-Men film a plot progressing set up, because from the first opening scene in X2 your thrown head first into one of, if not the, best comic to film adaptions of all time, and one of the few times a sequel out do's the original. Almost all of the first film's entire ensemble cast returns: Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (ever perfect as Wolverine), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) are all back. Also, the film goes more in depth with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and introduces us to beloved characters Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming who turns out to be nearly perfect in the role) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). The storyline finds the X-Men months after the events in the first film, under siege by General Stryker (Brian Cox) who has his own agenda for mutant kind. Eventually the X-Men must team up with Magneto to stop him, and this is where the film shines. Director Brian Singer was critiqued quite a bit when it was said that the first film wasn't action packed enough; well, he made up for it here as X2 is action packed from beginning to end and the film pushes the limits of it's PG-13 rating. The performances are great, and while Jackman is his usually terrific self as Wolverine, he isn't the focus this time around and we get to see Berry more developed as Storm, Romijn-Stamos gets more screen time as well, and Janssen is better now as Jean Grey than anyone could have ever thought before. The special effects are nothing short of incredible; from Wolvie popping his claws to Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) popping hers, to Colossus' body turning to steel to Pyro's fire spewing shootout with the cops you will be in awe of the special effects wizardry. The only complaint here is that with the exception up towards the end of the film is once again Cyclops is a criminally underused character. Marsden is a good actor and Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused. All in all, X2 is much better than I could have ever hoped it to be, and this is undoubtadly one of the finest comic to film adaptions of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>I went to this movie expecting 130 minutes of entertainment, and that&#65533;s what I got. X-2 is certainly better than the first movie. Now, all main characters are already introduced to those people who watched the first one, but have not a close relation to the comics. <p>At first, I thought X-2 would focus mainly on Wolverine, but that&#65533;s not true. Sure, in the moives Wolverine is still the most popular character, but he&#65533;s not alone. Every major mutant character has the chance to be a good time on screen. Every one of them is given dimension, I could see they were well-developed for screen. Even so, X-2 is not, as may happen in other similar situations, a show-case for every hero to automaticaly and pointlessly display what he/she is capable of. Every mutant&#65533;s actions is made acording to a good script, and Brian Singer&#65533;s competent direction is able to give credibility to the movie (of course, credibility based on the premises of such a movie). <p>I said the scrip is good. There are no boring fight scenes every two minutes, I could find no major sequence-continuity mistakes, no rushed conclusions, and what is best, the story doesn&#65533;t treat the viewer as an idiot. The only flaw I noticed is that the movie starts a little too fast, but that may be one more reason to keep the eyes on the screen. There are some funny moments too, mainly with Ian McKellen and his out-of-date uniform. <p>Speaking of Ian McKellen, pay attention to the casting: we don&#65533;t see this reunion of stars every day. McKellen, Patrick Stewart (the perfect Xavier), Brian Cox (as the common enemy of the mutants, that&#65533;s why the title &#65533;X-Men united&#65533;), Hugh Jackman, Allan Cumming (amazing as the dark, catholic-fervorous Nightcrawler), everyone of them exeperienced, competent actors. And the women: all of them beautiful and talented: Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen (her best role so far), Rebecca Romijn (remember to close your mouth in the scene where she is not wearing make-up). <p>Not to mention the great visual effects. X-2 was an expensive movie, but one that will easily pay-off. <p>First class entertainment, movie grade 9.2/10</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>I'm giving this movie four stars out of 5 within its genre.<p>X2: X-Men United is an unbelievble follow-up to what was just a mediocre first film.  It isn't often that sequels are superior to the first film - in this case it is definitely true.<p>The first film wasn't horrible, but as a fan of the comics, it was disappointing on several casting levels as well as the plotline and flow.<p>X2 makes none of the first film's errors:  it is action from the moment the movie starts and it ends the same way.  A new mutant has infiltrated the White House and threatens the President.  For those of us familiar with the comics, we know this mutant to be Nightcrawler, but to those unfamiliar, you find out eventually.  In fact, this film manages to step up not only the action and the pace, but integrates a love triangle very prominent in the comics, and effectively uses a few other new mutants.  We are introduced to a mutant of unbelievably strong psychic power (Legion in the comics?) and are able to witness a pre-mutant Hank McCoy (Beast) on television, while witnessing a list of mutants whose names many will recognize.  These are just a few of the things that are thrown out there for the comics fans.  Possibly the biggest thing thrown out there to us is in the final moments of the film.  I won't divulge it here, but suffice it to say that those who haven't read the comics may feel that something is lacking in the ending of the film....For those of us who know the comics, we'll eagerly await the next installment.<p>I'm not necessarily nuts about the "mutated" life lines assigned to our heros.  (i.e. Iceman is one of the original X-Men, but the movie makes him a much younger novice.)  I'm also not nuts about the original casting of Halle Berry as Storm - yes, she's gorgeous and now that she's got an Oscar she's more of a draw than before - BUT - Chris Claremont once said that Storm was modelled after the model/actress Iman, who is not only very much alive, but doesn't look much different than she did years ago - and she IS African as Storm is supposed to be).<p>.....<p>X2: X-Men United is a really great action film that will have you laughing and cheering and leaving the theater wanting more!</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Wow, I thought that the first X-Men movie was great.  This completely blows it away.  Almost all of the actors have returned (Pyro and Shadowcat being the exceptions) and they all gave wonderful performances, but once again, the special effects were the shining stars of the film.  This time, the story is about a mutant hater who has devised a plan to eliminate every mutant on Earth, but he needs Prof. X to do it, so he kidnaps him.  The X-Men are forced to temporarily side with Magneto and Mystique in order to save Xavier and themseleves from annihilation.  A nice addition to the team is the teleporting Nightcrawler, and Rouge, Iceman, and Pyro get bigger roles.  The script corrected most of the problems that the first movies had, so there were no flubbed lines, such as the lightning/Toad thing in X-Men.  Finally, the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was amazing!  If you liked the first movie, you will love this one.  If you didn't like the first one, you may still like this one.  I mean, the first one was great, but this one was so much better.  You will love it!</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>I hated the first movie a blazing pasion serpassed only by my hate of the new "Star Wars" films. I have to tell you I thought this movie kicked total ...!! From the first moment a failed assination attempt on the president to the goverment takeover of the mutant school.  Thats just the begining the action in this flick takes hold and it doesn't let go untill the movie stops.  <p>A few points <p>The Bad <p>A. Don't take your young kids to see this there are several scary parts that are sure to have them screaming(at least that was the case for the kds in my theater)<p>B. Sorry Cyclops fans out there he really doesn' thave much of a role in this one. <p>C. It seemed at times that this movie didn't know what it was trying to achomplish. It has somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 writters and it really shows when all is said and done. <p>The Good <p>NIGHTCRAWLER-My god this guy is cool!!<br />Pyro:-Great balls of fire!!<p>General Stricker(Brian Cox) Man talk about a creepy villian this guy is great!<p>Magneto: Friend or Foe? You decide <p>Overall-Excellent just great forget X1 and get this on video when it comes out</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I just saw X-Men 2 and I must say I was blown away. I liked the first but after seeing this one I saw just how good the first one could have been. The first was basically just a small introduction. Now that all the characters were introduced we have a sequel that's all action and has no time for introduction. The result is one [heck] of a ride, this film gave me the feel that I was actually watching the cartoon series from the 90's that I loved. I can't say the first film really gave me that feel at all eventhough I did like it. <p>  I have a problem with the fact that they didn't give Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike a history. In the comic book they were ex lovers. Deathstrike blames Wolverine for the death of her scientist father in the comic, you don't get that here. Instead she's just a mutant being controlled by the evil mutant hater General Striker (Brian Coxx "the original Hannibal Lector from Manhunter"). I also disapointed that the first film didn't give Wolverine and Sabortooth a history as well. I was hoping they'd bring Sabortooth back so they could have Wolverine figure out that his past connects to Sabortooth. <p>  The first also was short, it spent most of it's time introducing the characters when not all of them were even there. In this sequel we don't get Beast or Gambit but we do get Night Crawler. Alan Cummings "Spy Kids", pulls off the role just awesome. The special effects that make it so he can appear where ever he wants are just great. The make-up for that character are well done as well. Colosis who is also another popular X-Man has a short but cool cameo where he saves some mutant children at the school.<p> <p>  This film is a lot more like the comic book than the first and should do many X-Men fans proud. The whole Jean Grey sub-plot will surprise but delight most X-Men fans such as myself. I don't wanna give anything away but I find that with Jean Grey the film does have sort of a Star Trek 2 ending. Part 3 already is giving me a Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock sorta feel and it's not even out yet. Part 3 will probably be largely surrounded around Jean Grey's character just like Star Trek 3 was with Spock. I can't wait for that though. I don't wanna give anything but for any X-Men fans that know of the Phoenix saga you are gonna love this. I wouldn't mind seeing a new Mutant villain come around for the 3rd one as well though. I'm dieing to see Juggernaut for instance. Apocolyse would be cool as well. X-Men 2 is another strong movie for Marvel and could possibly be the best. Yes even better than Spiderman.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This is the best sequel EVER made! This makes X-Men 1 look like Pee Wee's Playhouse. This is everything every comic book movie wasn't. This movie is PERFECT! Let me start off with the Nighcrawler scene at the beginning of the movie. That alone was the most incredible action scene EVER in a movie! The Matrix? What's the Matrix? Just about all of the characters in this movie have a balanced time on screen and they all get to show off their powers. The only one who was left out was Cyclops. But he does have more to do this time than last time. Storm gets a lot more to say and plays an important role in the outcome of the story. She still doesn't get to fly but what she does do makes up for it. Wolverine is COOL! Magneto kicks BUTT! But who is the coolest mutant in X2? MYSTIQUE!!! She went from a nobody in the first film to the most incredibly cool character in this one! When you go to see this movie be on the look out for Gambit's name on a computer screen (Remy LeBeau) and Beast on a TV screen (Hank McCoy.) This movie sets up X3's story line which should include a major role from Jean Grey. She is one of the most powerful and important characters in this movie and in the next she will probably be the most dangerous. Go see the movie. If you don't like it there's really no hope for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Better special effects, more action and an excellent opening sequence. Better then the first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>As with many movies of this genre, the viewer must suspend some common sense and accept a new reality. The premise of the X-Men franchise is that mankind is evolving... at a geometric rate.  While many remain as humans, more and more &quot;mutants&quot; are born everyday. Seemingly human on the outside, each mutant has a unique mutation that gives them a super-human power. There doesn't seem to be a true &quot;mutation&quot; that is not beneficial... no one is born with an ugly deformity, just a kick-butt super-power. <p>Some can project flames with their thoughts, others can freeze anything they touch. Still others have super hearing, super vision, and some can walk through walls or teleport from one place to another.<p>Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the proverbial godfather of the mutants, known as &quot;X-men.&quot;  While wheelchair bound, Xavier has incredible telepathic abilities. With what seems like an unlimited personal fortune, Xavier has built a school for the &quot;gifted,&quot; a refuge for kids and young adults who are mutants. Young mutants have their talents honed and learn to control their skills by former school graduates.<p>Non-mutated humans are naturally scared of the mutants, which seem to be everywhere. A teleporting mutant wreaks havoc in the White House, knocking out all Secret Service agents before they can even aim their guns at him. The mutant simply delivers a message to the President, but knowing what this mutant is capable of is enough to make the public terrified and willing to suspend civil liberties to anyone exhibiting mutated powers.<p>Nazi-camp survivor, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), is liberated from the metal-free prison from the first X-men film. Now Magneto and other &quot;naughty&quot; mutants must team up with the &quot;good&quot; mutants to protect themselves from a diabolical plot to kill all mutants around the globe.<p>The joining together involves no group hugs or mutual understandings between the hero mutants and the mutants with a score to settle. Only a modicum of respect for each others talents.<p>The central character is still Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). A mutant with a really bad bed hair and big mutton chops. Wolverine has acute hearing, incredible healing abilities, and he has keen fighting skills. In addition, he has had an undestructable metal alloy surgically placed into his hands, which projects giant steal claw-like daggers between his fingers when he senses danger. <p>The special effects in this film are AWESOME. There wasn't one scene in which you could tell that something was either computer generated or not in the same plane of view as the other live action characters. The action is super fast, creative, well choreographed, and just really fun to watch. The ending sets the viewer up for a probable 3rd installment of the X-men series in the not-so-distant future.<p>Is this a deep, life changing film? No way! But if you want to escape into another world for a couple of hours, this is the place to go. As always, the good guys prevail in the end, and a lot of bad people get their butts severely kicked.  If you love SFX and sci-fi, this film will not disappoint.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>With the success of the first X-Men, and the Spider-Man movie, it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made.<br /><br />In a spectacular action sequence that opens the movie, the President is attacked and threatened by a mutant.  Professor Xavier sends is Senior pupils to track him down. When they do, they find that there is something very wrong about the whole situation.  Soon after, the school is attacked and the mutants get split up and venture across the country.  Magento, still imprisoned in a plastic cell, finds a way to escape and join up with Xavier's group.<br /><br />Everyone returns from the first movie and some other mutants from the long running comic series are introduced.  Colossus crashes into the story line, but is all too quickly shoved aside, a shame considering his popularity in the comic.  A young but brash Pyro comes on the scene with an obvious pre-disposition of becoming evil.  But the most impressive is Nightcrawler, played with complete bravada and emotion by Alan Cumming.  Brian Cox plays William Stryker, the Government scientist bent on destroying the mutants through his resources in the military.  He plays a bad guy so well you love to hate him.<br /><br />The story and characters are solid and riveting.  All returning actors play their roles with comfort and stride.  All are given plenty to do.  Along the way story lines weave in and out of one another.  The attraction between Jean Grey and Logan heats up, as well as with Rogue and Bobby (Iceman).  Storm and Nightcrawler form an obvious bond as she reassures him that he can belong in society while he sparks her desire to have faith in God.<br /><br />The action scenes are fantastic and brutal in some places, especially with Wolverine in full fighting mode, he doesn't care if he kills anyone.  The movie works it's way into a tragic ending that leaves the story open for another chapter, one that fans of the comic are well aware of and are most likely hoping will be continued.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>X2 is a great movie, and this DVD is loaded with extras.  I waited way too long to finally take a look at this film.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer did a great job, even better than the first X-Men, creating a movie that even people who know nothing about the X-men comic books will enjoy.  This movie draws the viewer right into the plot and keeps them on the edge of their seat.  The fight scenes are amazing, the characters have addictive personalities, and the story flows at just the right pace.<br /><br />Charles Xavier/Prof. X is played, of course and once again, by Patrick Stewart.  His character really doesn't have a lot of EXCITING parts, but the X-Men need a leader, and he fits the bill.  Stewart is very believable in this role.  We may see a little too much of him though, since the other characters are so much more interesting.<br /><br />Logan/Wolverine is played by Hugh Jackman.  He is absolutely perfect in his part.  I can't picture anyone else playing Wolverine.  His character only has a few moments that fall a little short of believable, like when he is seeking out William Stryker's hideout but doesn't think about the fact that it might be underground - even though the mutant school has a plane under the basketball court...go figure.  The other part that left me scratchin' my head was when the kids at mutant high store their Coke and Pepsi in a non-refrigerated cabinet even though they have a gi-normous refrigerator in the kitchen.  This was added to the script just to have Ice Man / Bobby Drake show his chillin' powers.  Scenes like that did not need to be forced into the movie - the viewers are not morons.  Other than those two very small mistakes, I found the scriptwriting for Wolverine to be better than I could have ever dreamed!  Zak Penn and David Hayter know how to write!  Great job, guys.<br /><br />Ian McKellen plays Eric Lensherr/Magneto.  He is fantastic in his role.  I really believe this guy thinks he is a mutant!<br /><br />Halle Berry manages to hole her own as Storm/Ororo Munroe, but I think she could have pushed a little more spice into her character.  Better than Cat---, oh, I won't even go there....<br /><br />Famke Janssen is very believable as Jean Grey, but how exciting is it to watch mind-powers?  It would have been cool to see her in more action scenes, like tossing people around with tele-whatever.<br /><br />James Marsden plays Scott Summers/Cyclops.  I never realized how hard it is to relate to a character when you can't see their eyes.  He did a great job in a part where you can't tell where the heck he is looking!  That cannot be an easy role.  Maybe I should ask Jamie Foxx how tough it is?<br /><br />Anna Paquin nails the role of Rogue.  She was absolutely born to play that role.  Talk about a comic book character coming to life - she did just that.<br /><br />Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is Mystique from this day forward.  She could almost jump this movie to an R rating.  Mutants aren't all bad. :-)<br /><br />William Stryker is played by Brian Cox.  What a jerk!  I think that is what he was going after, so good show ole' chap.<br /><br />Alan Cumming plays Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, one of the most memorable roles I have ever seen.  Man, this guy is one of THE best actors in the world today.  The directing, the acting, and the stunts involved with Nightcrawler are superb.  Everyone involved with the development and end-result of this character should pat themselves on the back.  I was totally impressed!<br /><br />Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike is played by Kelly Hu.  Hu really grabs the screen at first knuckle crack!  She has that IT factor so many stars strive for.  She fit the role of Deathstrike better than the orignal concept turned out.  You rock, Kelly!<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple:  Bad guy hates mutants, he wants them to be blamed for an attack on the president, the mutants find out the truth, and both sides are trying to stop the other before it is too late.  Some times, simple works best!  Like in X2's case.<br /><br />X2 DVD deliver the goods.  Bryan Singer is an amazing director, gifted with the ability to make films that go beyond the usual expectations.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>You have to hand it to Stan Lee and the gang at Marvel Comics: overseeing the movies made from their comics, they've made sure that Hollywood's done a bang-up job, both literally and figuratively. This is true both for Bryan Singer's "X-Men" movies and Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series. In both series of movies, the special effects are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the action sequences are a total wow. But they are also well-written and impeccably cast, with characters an audience can actually care about. "X2: X-Men United" has the same advantage as "Spider-Man 2"--since most of the main characters were already introduced in the first film, the sequel can get down to the business of creating an engrossing story for them. In the case of "X2," the story hinges on a dastardly plot to frame the mutants for an assassination attempt on the President, leading to a worldwide hue-and-cry against them. All the old characters are back, and there are some intriguing new ones--Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the ostensible assassin, and the hissable Stryker (Brian Cox), who seeks revenge on the mutants. In any case, Bryan Singer takes as much care with the performances and the characters--their interrelations and motivations--as he does with the makeup and the action sequences, and it pays off big. All the performers are very good, but the three top-lined ones--Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman--stand out. It's wonderful to see such consummate classical actors as Stewart and McKellen play antagonists, particularly such semi-friendly ones as Xavier and Magneto. As Wolverine, Jackman--a sort of Mad Max/Snake Plissken type among the mutants--is riveting. If you compare what he does here with what he does as Curly in "Oklahoma!", you can only conclude that here is a superstar in the making.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>I waited for three years for &quot;X2&quot; to be released, and I walked into the theater saying to myself, &quot;Please God, don't let this movie suck like Batman and Robin&quot;.  I walked out of it a happy person, as Bryan Singer continues the X-Men saga in high fashion.<p>&quot;X2&quot; is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every single way.  It is longer and the charatcers are given more screen time.  The action is better (the military attack on the X-school is probably the film's action highlight).  The script is tighter and more focused, and the film is overall much more ambitious.<p>Singer took some obvious risks with &quot;X2&quot;.  Its themes are very dark for a mainstream comic book movie- genocide, parental rejection, repressed trauma.  Magneto continues to be a great villain- not evil, but horribly misguided.  Forcing him and the X-Men into an uneasy alliance was probably Singer's best move.  The theme of the X-Men's curse is made more obvious here- they are doomed to protect people who hate and fear them.  However, beneath all the darkness, this film is still fun- there's a couple moments of comic relief, and Wolverine still exudes a playful charm.  Singer manages to strike the right balance here between welcome in-jokes and downright campiness, such as what the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise fell into.<p>To make things even better, &quot;X2&quot; is fully loaded with special features, including commentary and several making-of documentaries.  I would highly recommend this film not only for X-Men fans, but fans of good action films in general.  It's much better than most of the other stuff released this year, a welcome relief from the disappointments of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels, and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;.  I simply love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>I thought this was a better story than the first. Without the Wolverine character this would be another super hero movie. I can see why there are plans to make Wolvie star in his own film. Hugh Jackman carries the story. <p>Well, on to my review....with the mutant registration act the government believes the X-Men pose a threat to society.  It has a great battle scene when the dark forces of Washington D.C. decide to raid the school of mutants. Wolvie has a few more beserker rages in this one but they are not the gory mess I'd thought they might portray. This film is just like a Chris Clearmont scripted X-Men saga. And I have to wonder why the producers didn't get him involved in the story process. <p>If it wasn't for writers like Chris Clearmont... and lets not forget artists Jim Cockrum and John Byrne; the X-Men would have never got off the ground in the mid seventies.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>X2 was a 2003 movie it was a follow up to X Men I think they succeeded with a better movie the cast from the 1st movie comes back Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stuart, Ian McKellen Famke Janssen, Halle Berry dropped out of Gili to reprise her role smart lady lol. 2 newer characters are Nightcrawler played by Allen Cumming Colonel Willam Stryker played by Brian Cox. Plot is Nightcrawler goes to the White House tears @** through secret service gives the President a message Mutant Freedom. Professor X fearing a war has Jean Grey & Storm go to Boston & get Nightcrawler. Professor X is captured later on by Colonel Willam Stryker & Cyclops was captured too & is being "reeducted" by Stryker. Stryker also stages an assault on the on the Mansion.

Despite introducing the blue-skinned, teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, and becoming more action-alert than the first film, X2's spotlight is shone on Logan/Wolverine as he inches closer to uncovering the truth behind his past. But before he can do so, he must match wits with the iniquitous scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), whose past is as murky and mingled as Logan's own.<br /><br />Singer's continuation of the eventual trilogy (not counting the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine)--one that ended with 2006's unworthy The Last Stand (which Singer opted out of to direct Superman Returns)--was one of 2003's top-grossing box-office hits, raking in over $85 million in its first weekend alone and nearly $215 million all-together, far exceeding its predecessor (which earned barely over $157 million), and is certainly one of the sci-fi genre's most exciting films. The High Definition transfer for the Blu-ray package was done pristinely and gets viewers even closer to Singer's brilliant vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Since the first movie, "X-Men," was famous for its great special effects, this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans....and it did! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.<br /><br />Having said that, I do think the film actually needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. Either that, or shorten the story.<br /><br />Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.<br /><br />It's a pretty interesting story and  - all-in all,  if you liked the first film, you'll like this, (and you'll love the third installment!).</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>The Evolution continues with "X2: X-Men United" The X-Men have new enemies,one who plans to invade Xavier's mansion and school.

The X-Men come alive.<br /><br />With the lose of Jean Gray do we now look forward to The Phenoix [?]<br /><br />I hope these guys don't wait forever in bringing the X-Men stories up to date -- too many years pass inbetween and we lose the ongoing line of our characters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- for us comic buffs - great to add to the comic collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>I have always enjoyed the X-Men comics, and the two feature films have done a fine job of following the spirit of the comics, if not the exact detail of the charactors and their stories. X2 is certainly one of the best comic adaptations ever put to film, due to the seriousness the actors and director obviously put into it. If they played it tongue-in-cheek, it would have been a disastor. All the roles are intelligently realized here, only a couple of beefs, though. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, so touching in the first film, is much more distant here. And what happened to Storm and Rogue's accents here? Storm being from Africa, and Rogue from Louisiana, each had noticeable accents in the first film, yet neither had them here. Oh well. Brian Cox as the bad guy was very good. One thing, I do wish his link to Wolverine was explained a bit better. Overall, the film moves well, grags little, and has action sequences that are well-done, with great effects. The ending leaves me more than ready for X3. I can't wait! Anyway, enjoy this film, because most comic-book movies aren't this well-done (remember the later Batman movies?).</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This is without a doubt my favorite comic book movie. Yeah, Spiderman is good and all, but there's just something about X-Men that I find more interesting-- maybe because everyone can find something to relate to in an X-Men character. And I like that there's more than one hero and that the bad guy is a mutant, yet unlike the mutant heroes.<br /><br />This is the second installment, the third is on the way (can't wait!) and we re-join the mutants at "Mutant High," which is also the secret base of the elite X-Men. The film begins with an action scene, one of the best I've ever seen, in which a mutant teleporter attempts to kill the President as a protest against the anti-mutant sentiment that has swept the nation. Jean and Storm are sent by Xavier, the leader of the X-Men, to track down the teleporter, who was actually forced to attack the President by a man named Stryker, a non-mutant who has developed a mind-controlling serum and also has a great dislike for mutants and hoped his attack would force the government to get rid of the mutants.<br /><br />Great film, lots of cool action scenes, and some of the holes of the first film are finally filled in, getting more information about Wolverine. You don't have to like comics to like this movie, just have a like for action or a like for a good story. This movie has both. This movie isn't quite as comic bookey as Spiderman 2 was actually. Check this one out some time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;X-2&quot; picks up solidly where the original flick ended.  Unlike most reviewers, I didn't think this film was any better than the first.  I do believe that it is a good film in its own right.  The first sequence, the attack on the White House, is by far the best sequence of the movie.  Nightcrawler was one of my favorite X-men growing up.  I also enjoyed the fact that they included his deep Catholic faith.  The comic actually toyed with this character becoming a priest.<br />Overall, the action sequences in this film were great.  The Deathstryke/Wolverine battle was one of the most violent sequences I've seen in comic-to-screen adaptation.  It was more violent than all of &quot;Daredevil.&quot;  Wolverine came out of his shell in this movie by racking up a huge bodycount.<br />As far as the story goes, it played out very well and very evenly.  It was just as solid as the first flick and if you enjoyed the first one, this one will not let you down.  The pacing of the movie is quite swift, which could cause a non-comic fan to lose track of some of the characters and their abilities.  The ending was left wide open and if you do follow the comic, you know that something special will be rising in the inevitable part three.<p>A good action movie with a solid story and brilliant effects.  Buy it and enjoy it today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>This is on of the rare moments when the sequel is better than the first film. This is better because it talks more about Wolviren and how he turned into a mutant. Some really good action sceans are in this film. In my opinoin this was better than the hulk film that also came out in summer 2003. Great acting (Patrick Stewart at his best). This is a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>First off, it is nice to see the introduction of several new mutant characters in this film.  But motion pictures can never match comic books in scale, imagination, and narrative tightness and efficiency.  Thus is the underlying problem with the "X-Men" movies.<p>In "X2", we find our reluctant heroes under attack by a rogue General Stryker (Brian Cox, the ORIGINAL Dr. Hannibal Lecter on film) and the Xavier School/Institute/whatever forcibly attacked.  The Xavier school, if you remember from the first movie, is a prep school-cum-mutant training academy for good-looking, upper-middle-class mutant kids.<p>On the run, the X-men must keep themselves and the students safe yet find who is behind the attack and why.  Magneto and Mystique join forces with our heroes for a while, and that stretches credibility just a bit.  Did I just use the word "credibility" in a review of a movie about mutant superheroes?<p>The movie is mostly a series of action setpieces, some Wolverine history uncovered, and spiffy effects.  But the story never really gets you too involved or interested.<p>I'm not saying you should NOT see it, but be aware that any movie franchise that wants to be all things to all people is bound to disappoint on multiple levels.<p>On the positive side, Mystique is given much more to do (and the sequence where she plants the seeds for Magneto's eventual escape from his plastic prison is pleasingly clever), new movie character The Nightcrawler as played by Alan Cumming is a fun visual treat, and you get plenty of bang for your buck with the movie's 133 minute running time.<p>Oh, yeah.  One of the X-Men from the first movie dies.  You'll have to see it to see which one.  But that part of the film was also the weakest.  With all of these incredible superpowers these mutants have, and their proven ability to emerge unscathed from just about any situation, logic dictates that it would take quite an incredible life-or-death situation to kill one of them.  And the one in the movie that results in so-and-so's death doesn't quite live up to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>The wait is over and super heroine Storm (Halle Berry) and her mutant friends have blown back into theaters.  This time, we are treated to more action, new characters and a visually pleasing film that doesn't disappoint.  While some characters have been scaled back in the story line (such as Cyclops and Rogue), this movie gives us more of Storm and her ability to control weather, young X men in training, Iceman and Pyro, and the Xavier-like Jean Gray.  Villains held over from the previous film are Mystique, whose role also expanded in this film and Magneto, played by the always talented Ian McCellan. Bryan Singer did a good job of juggling the meagerie of mutant characters under the care of Dr. Xavier.  I also like how he exhibits the theme of being an outsider in the movie, such as the one scene in which Bobby (Iceman) returns home.  The scene has Iceman "coming out" to his parents and revealing the dreadful news that he is a mutant.  It plays like a young man revealing his homosexuality to his parents and shows the broader scope of the theme of exclusion felt by the mutants to the rest of human society.  The most interesting new addition is Nightcrawler, played perfectly by the charming actor, Alan Cumming.  The scenes with Nightcrawler transporting are extremely well done and I hope we learn more about the blue skinned mutant in the next film.  The story line with Wolverine continues with some resolution but leaves plenty of information in the dark for the inevitable sequel.  There is a death in the film that I felt was unnecessary--I won't say who--but it would have been interesting to see this character return.  However, with the number of heroes and villains in the world of the X Men, there are plenty of new characters to choose from for the next movie. If you haven't seen the first film, you might want to check it out before seeing this one, although it isn't completely necessary.  There is enough interesting things going on in this movie to keep your attention and make you a fan of this group of heroes.  The ending also hints at things to come in the next film (for one hero in particular), making me eager to see the next one and dreading the wait for it to appear in theaters!  Make a trip to your local theater for this popcorn flick...you will not be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>This film surprised me for several reasons. Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors, but X-Men United shows improvement on almost every front.  The acting is solid, the effects and filming are even more amazing than before, and the plot is head and shoulders better than the first, which was in many ways a rehash of the comic books.  This is a testament to the work of Bryan Singer (also responsible for King Kong) and the writers, and proof that popular entertainment does not have to be completely banal.<br /><br />The story kicks off when the president's office is invaded by a mutant.  A demonic looking teleporter who seems to be a representative of a mutant's lib movement.  A barb tailed terrorist who is, for all purposes, unstoppable.  In the chaos that ensues William Stryker (Brian Cox) steps in with a plan to invade Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school and capture the mutants.  The attack is only partially successful, and it quickly becomes clear to the viewer and the X-Men that Stryker's agenda is more than defending the president.  He wants to destroy all mutants driven by his own anger over Xavier's failure to 'cure' his son.<br /><br />Cox is brilliant as the psychotic Stryker, and with a villain so despicable that Magneto seems almost likeable, you will quickly become emotionally involved in the race to keep all out war from breaking out between the increasing number of mutants and populations that feel threatened by those whose powers seem almost magical.  As such, the story becomes a parable of human fear in the face of things beyond our control and how quickly that turns to anger and violence.<br /><br />The film introduces many new faces that will become more important in later films (such as the so far ill-fated X-Men 3).  Pyro (John Allerdyce), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), for example.  The latter, by the way turns in an outstanding performance in a supporting role.  Hats off to the unsung heroes who do the animation and effects work as well - everything seems smooth and seamless.  By all means make a point to see this if you haven't already.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>"X2 X-Men United" is, simply put, an exhilarating and exciting follow up to the first movie.  Cartoons and comic books aside, as a theatrical/DVD release, this movie entertains as much or more than the first one.  Yes, many a fan of those cartoons and comic books are reeling from the major differences and those nuances left out of the movies but, just for a minute, take a look at this film and its predecessor from a completely open perspective and you will clearly see that this film has all of the elements that make for a successful action/adventure movie and yes, it does have a plot and that plot is very well thought out.<p>One of the better aspects of this film and the first is that there are elements that were set up in the first film that weren't paid off in that film but are paid off here such as; Wolverine and his mysterious past and Jean Grey's future...  Along with those payoffs, there are some great new character arcs that are set up in this outstanding film.  <p>The entirety of the cast from the first film makes their return in this film and there are some great new additions to the cast of actors/characters.  Long time fans of Star Trek are most assuredly familiar with Patrick Stewart and his exceptional acting abilities and, just as in the first film, it's wonderful to see him on screen with Famke Janssen, who most will recognize as Kamala from one of Star Trek The Next Generation's best episodes.  Ian McKellen, most recently of "The Lord of the Rings" fame makes a return appearance as Magneto and performs to his wonderful standards.  <p>The ever beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos performs brilliantly as Mystique just as Halle Berry does with Storm and I'm sure taking a huge cut in pay.  New to cast and series is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and his performance is astonishing to say the least.  Hugh Jackman has to be one of the luckiest men in the world when considering how many takes it might've taken when he has Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Halle Berry and Famke Janssen all portraying an attempted seduction of Wolverine...<p>I've never watched any other films that Bryan Singer has directed but with this and the first X-Men movie, one can definitely tell that this director has a long future in directing action films.<p>The Premise:<p>A teleporting mutant makes an attempt on the life of the President, right in the oval office after easily wading through the Secret Service, but he stops short of killing the President and disappears from the White House.  Not long thereafter, we're reintroduced to the X-Men and they're after the teleporting mutant who attempted to take out the President and Wolverine's makes his return.  Unbeknownst to them though, William Stryker, who is played exceptionally well by Brian Cox, is a government agent who has plans to eliminate all of the mutants on the planet...<p>What follows from there is one of the best action/adventure genre movies that I've ever watched.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films from this genre, whether you're into the comics or not.  I personally have never read them and have followed the characters quite easily as the producers and the director have gone out of their way to ensure that those of us that don't follow the X-Men regularly will have no problem following the film.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Full-Length Commentary with Director Bryan Singer and Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, ASC<p>-Full-Length Commentary with the Writers and Producers<br />-"Nightcrawler Attack" Interactive Multi-Angle Scene Study<br />-"Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal" In-Depth, Behind-the Scenes Exploration<br />-"The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men" The Ultimate Making-Of Documentary<br />-Extraordinary X2 Featurettes:<br />*"The Secret Origin of X-Men" A Complete Anthology<br />*"Nightcrawler Reborn" The Adventure Before X2<br />*"Introducing the Incredible Nightcrawler" Character Study & More<br />-11 Deleted/Extended Scenes<br />-Still Galleries<br />-Theatrical Trailers</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"X2: X-Men United" is the widely admired sequel to "X-Men," one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as "different" from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part "irrational fear of the unknown" plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.<p>This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner.  Perhaps when it came to "X2," director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, "X2" starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time. <p>There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy "comes out" to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their "ordinary, average" child (whom they had just considered "highly gifted") has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance ("We still love you no matter what you are") on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life.  "X2" could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.  And it was scenes like this one that made the original "X-Men" soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  "X2" doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.<p>Every so often, "X2" feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a "terrorist" organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clich&eacute;s.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?  Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.<p>People seem to be enamored of "X2," even more, perhaps, than they were of the original "X-Men."  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view "X2," for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for "X-Men 3."</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>X2 adds to what the original had. More action, more mutants and a better story. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original, but this was the best between the two. The acting is as strong as every and the story is even more compelling. Alan does a fantastic job in this film as Nightcrawler. The villain of the film is interesting and the story introduces the beginning story of the Phoenix. Overall a great film that lived up to the expectations left from the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I hadn't seen the first X-Men movie, I have heard of it, so I just checked "X2" out and it was pretty good. I was never a fan of the animated X-Men series. I think besides Spiderman, it's great for the genre. The sci-fi/fantasy/action genre certainly is an extraordinary type. Just like Star Wars. One character I was quite fond of was the Nightcrawler AKA Kurt Wagner played by the neato actor Alan Cumming. I've read the trivia for this movie and it said that it took 10 hours to get his makeup on. Also, this movie is in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the movie that had the widest release on opening day: 3,741 screens! It's no wonder. I thought Lord of The Rings would have done something effective like that.<br /><br />Warning: The awesome action in this film can be head-spinning.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I've been a fan of the X-Men since I was around 9 years old. In recent years, the comics have gotten stale and almost impossible to follow (A situation that Marvel Comics has turned around lately), and despite giving the first X-Men film more than one chance, I really didn't think much of it. So I tried to keep my expectations low for X-2...<p>  The good news is- It's MUCH better than it's predecessor! X-2 doesn't need to bombard viewers with as much information (Since that was mostly taken care of in the first film), and can pretty much hit the ground running. We pick up right where the first film left off: Magneto is in jail, Wolverine is looking for clues to his past, and anti-mutant hysteria is running rampant. Enter William Stryker, a fanatical Government employed mutant-hater, excellently played by Brian Cox. He sends blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler to tear up the White House and rough up the President in the awesome opening sequence, therby ensuring Presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda. Stryker wastes no time at all setting up a covert forces strike team, and their first target is.....Professor Xavier's school. Seems like they picked the wrong time to visit, though; The kids are home alone with their "Babysitter".....Wolverine! Let's get ready to RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE!!!<p>  Before you know it, it's all-out war between Stryker and the assembled mutant faction; Magneto is sprung from prison, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the stage is set for a winner-take-all brawl at Alkali Lake, where Wolvie just might find out some interesting tidbits about his Adamantium skeleton and claws.....<p>  Fans disappointed by the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights have been ratcheted waaayyy up, including an excellent throw-down between Wolverne and Deathstrike, played by the lovely Kelly Hu, and Wolverine's berserker rage in the mansion. Gotta love the way he dispatches Stryker's goons...! Director Bryan Singer has assembled an excellent cast, and each character gets his or her moment to shine. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles, and the end sets the stage for X-3. Longtime fans will appreciate the appearances by X-Men mainstays like The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie, and Kitty Pryde, and be on the lookout for mentions of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others. <p>  Bad news...? The film starts strong but gets a little draggy towards the end; Maybe some tighter editing was needed. Also, considering how heavily the film relies on characters and situations developed by X-Men comic-book scribe Chris Claremont, including the plot lifted whole-cloth from his legendary graphic novel "God Loves, Man Kills", I was more than a little dismayed not to see him acknowledged in the credits.<p>  X-2 isn't a perfect film, but it's a BIG step up from the previous X-Men movie, and a great way to start the summer movie-going season.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Usually it seems like sequels are not good compared to the first. I think this movie isn't as great as X-Men 1, but very well done.<p>The plot seems to run dry. Some guy wants to kill all mutants using cerebro, which was that machine they used to find mutants. It is completely different from X1, but that isn't why the movie is good. It is because of the action, and the characters. If you don't love the characters, you won't love the movie. My dad said the reason he didn't like starwars 2 was because of Anakin, and he is right(noone wants to listen to a whiner). All the characters in this movie you can like, Storm can be stupid at times though. I don't want to give it away, but when Jean states "Its targeting something else", Storms reply is "If its not targeting blahblah then what is it targeting?". Dude, Storm, every single person in that room understands what Jean is talking about, you are just making yourself look stupid. The action is great also. At first you think Wolverine is gonna do that thing where instead of killing people he slashes their guns in half, your wrong. He actually stabs people, for real. There isn't any blood, but its awesome. I mean he must stab 100 people. It is very cool. Storm does some stuff. Even though shes got a pretty big picture on the cover, she is not a main character at all. They have introduced some more mutants too, and it basically highlights the new recruits. Night crawler is major with his transport skill, and Colossus throws these 2 guys. Then there is Pyro. Pyro states that he is the worst mutant of them all, yet he can't even create fire, and you will see what I mean by that. One thing you may notice is that they have changed Pyro, in X1 he was the guy who made the small flame, and iceman froze it. He had blonde hair and looked alot different, they got a new guy to do him in this movie. The humor is alright, and Wolverine does most of it, but some of the people in the theatre would just not stop laughing. I mean jeez, I had to ask someone to stop talking, just because they were laughing at the most stupid things. It can be funny though if you are watching it with just your family, and don't have to sit next to people who like to make sarcastic remarks to themselves when nobody cares(you know who im talking about, that person who always does the "ooowwwwwww, that must of hurt" when it was obvious that it hurt.). So even though my theatre expeirience was bad, I enjoyed the movie, and if you like alot of action with a few boring scenes, you will like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A year after the couragous mutant team known as the X-Men, there has been a terrorist mutant attack made by Devil-esque mutant named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) in the White House. Rouge (Anna Paquin) and Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) seem to be having a beautiful relationship together and Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Huge Jackman) is still struggling to discover his true past and to find out on something on a man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) who made his adamantium skeleton and claws, now after the threat at the white-house it seems humans seem to hate mutants more. Now Stryker has terrorized the X-men mansion and kidnaps some of the mutant students including Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) himself so he can learn the secrets of the computer Cerebro so that Stryker can make a version of Cerebro himself to harm all mutants. Now it's up to Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and now teamed up with Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) to try to save both humanity and mutants alike from this new menace.<br /><br />A sequel that surpasses on a great original but makes it better. This movie features more mutants such as Lady DeathStrike (Kelly Hu), Pyro (Aaron Standford), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) and of course Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. Bryan Singer returns as producer, story writer and director as he reunites with Marvel Films after collabrating on the great original for it's more longer, more action packed and more cerebral then the first movie. Here this movie knows how to surpass the original with more psychological and more allegory on racism like the original on how to be accepted as a different person, it's an emotional funny and thrilling ride that i recommend.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray offers the movie in beautiful HD including some outstanding sound as the extras include audio commentaries, featurettes, pre-production featurettes, deleted scenes, documentary on behind the scenes of this extraordinary sequel, still galleries and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is supposed to deepen the concept of mutant alienation and potential war, raising the stakes with ever more spectacular special effects.  I admit, from a hard sci-fi pt of view, I found this weaker than the first - it is more like magic, this "mind power" that can be bent to threaten, well, everyone.  But the acting is absolutely excellent, even moving (if a comic book ever could be), and there are fabulous moments in the film, from the violent romp of Nightcrawler in the WHite House to Magneto's ingenious and frightening escape with three balls of steel.  These things are a visual treat.  Then there is the evolution of WOlverine, who is the most interesting character by far.  Virtually all of the characters are spectacularly complete as believable types, though I have never liked Brian Cox's open-mouthed style (he never quite rings true to me).  But it all seemed a bit too heavy to me, over-done as it is too ultimate and ambitious as a story extravaganza.<br /><br />Overall, warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>This was an unusual sequel, it surpassed the original in many ways.  Not that the original was in any ways bad, but it more rushed and didn't get a chance to spend time on a lot of the other characters.<p>Here they did what they obviously wished they had the time and budget for in the first movie.<p>More of the Mutants were showcased.  Though it was still centered on Professor X and Wolverine, it brought a bunch the other characters into the side stage.  To name a few; Iceman, Pyro, Kitty Pride, Collosus, Banshee, Nightcrawler, etc....  Plus they gave more screen time to the sultry butt kicker Mystique, whom was given a bit more depth.<p>The bad guys were again, interesting and possessed depth.  Stryker the driven war vetran that is seemingly obsessed with controlling all mutants.  The reasons why he was given the authority to do what he did and how it was carried out was frefreashing, and believable.  Notice the president was more concerned about how it would look the to public than on any sort of personal morality.  Magneto appeared again as the classic anti-hero, still focusing on his own agenda's.<p>The action sequences were longer and more brutal.  Did you notice that the only person that you see die in the first one was the senator.  True you see Toad get shocked and seem like he dies, but he is a mutant and a rather enjoyable bad guy, who knows.  Sabretooth seemed to die, but in the comics he has survived many seemingly critical wounds, and survived.  This includes having his spine broken, so he could very well show again.  This movie wolverine has an actual body count and goes through special ops like they were children.  What would you expect from a barely under control psychopath with unbreakable bones and claws.<p>All in all this was a great movie, still had some elements that were a bit hard to grasp, but it was a comic book movie and a sci fi, that is part of the game.  It treats the characters and situations with dignity and makes you care about what is going on, for good and bad guys.<p>rent or buy this if you like sci fi or plain and simple action movies, you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>X2, free of the burden X-MEN had of having to introduce all of its giant cast of characters, is a better movie than its predecessor. It takes all of its characters, throws them into a life-or-death plotline that makes sense within the guidelines of the X-Men universe, keeps the action on high throughout and even provides its actors a chance to showcase their individuality.<p>Watching it, it feels like a comic book. Someone's out to take over the world, and chaos seems to put our heroes in some new danger every few minutes. As Wolverine and Magneto, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan once again get some choice lines, and the discrimination-against-mutants parable gets addressed nicely, complete with a mutant "coming out" scene.<p>The final battle is thrilling. The villain is fascinating. Of the major new characters, only Deathstrike doesn't make much of an impression. Pyro is interesting and well-developed, and Nightcrawler's multifaceted and compelling.<p>And the ending is one of the most daring, promising and cool popcorn-movie endings ever committed to film. You half expect the film to flash "To be continued ..." across the screen.<p>X2 is great stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>The coolest comic book heroes hit their groove in this excellent episode in the X-MEN series.  I was a sort of comic collector from 1980-90 and the X-MEN comics were always chock full o' great characters, complex stories, and great action.  Both movies have delivered those qualities and more.  It would be nice to see a comic book turned movie actually start a series instead of a few haphazard sequels that get sillier as realeased.  This movie rocks.  X-MEN was a nice intro for XAVIER's gifted students, in X2 the mutants really strut their stuff, both dramatically and with a fine showcase for their uncanny abilities.  Some great action set pieces highlight this crafted flick as well as a story that unlike most super hero movies is engaging and intelligent.  I can't wait for X3 to see what will happen next, how many sequels these days can you say that about?  Not many at all.  HUGH JACKMAN was born to play WOLVERINE, one of the best movie characters in years.  A good new fashoned comic book film with it's head and heart compounded in good storytelling and style, to me that's a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I don't know why, but it seems that in movies, the second part of a trilogy is usually better than the first (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM withstanding). X-MEN gave a nice introduction to some of the basic characters and set the stage for what was to come later. X2 begins not long after X-MEN ended. Wolverine is searching for his past; Rogue and Iceman have started a relationship; Magneto is still in prison; and so on and so forth. The film steadily builds leading from one critical moment to the next, until we finally reach the film's climax at a Canadian dam.<p>X2 is a far superior film than X-MEN. The first movie was basically a live action cartoon, moved by action rather than character. X2 is the opposite, it is an action film, but one with substance, moved forward by character and motive rather than action and special effects. Watching the film, I felt as though I was watching a modern Shakespearean play set against the backdrop of a comic book. There aren't very many action films that can do that.<p>This is a movie that all people will enjoy, whether they know anything about the X-Men or not.</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>X2<br /><br />(USA - 2003)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS<br /><br />Following an attempt on the US President's life by what appears to be a rogue mutant (Alan Cumming), the school for 'gifted youngsters' established by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is raided by military factions opposed to the integration of mutants into American society. The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...<br /><br />Opening with a scene-setting quote from Abraham Lincoln, followed by one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers). Also, this is one of the few movies in recent years to use the Super 35 format in a defiantly cinematic manner, with none of the concessions to television which usually characterizes this 'fake' widescreen process.<br /><br />Followed by X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006).</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After the enormous success of "X-Men", Fox Studios couldn't wait to get director Bryan Singer back behind the camera on another adventure of Marvel's popular team of mutants.  Yet before going off half-cocked and just throwing a sequel together, several key elements must first come together. The first thing that is key to most sequels' success is getting the original film's cast back together, once that is accomplished a great script must be on hand that equals, and hopefully surpasses the original film's story, and third, the budget must always be better, especially for a film of this magnitude.  Luckily, Fox Studios and Bryan Singer accomplished all of this, and so audiences worldwide were presented with an incredible sequel with "X2: X-Men United".<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" basically picks up where "X-Men" left off, Wolverine is still searching for where he comes from, Magneto is still locked inside his plastic prison, Mystique is masquerading as Senator Kelly, and Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-Men are trying to ensure peace between humans and mutants.  This time though, the threat to humanity is not solely evil mutants, this time the threat is humanity, as a renegade general named, Stryker (Brian Cox), is determined to see all mutants dead or dying, and if some normal people get in the way, so be it.  The X-Men must gather together and team-up with Magneto and Mystique to stop this mutant massacre or all hope will be lost.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" gave audiences everything they loved about the original film, and more.  More action, an even bigger, more dramatic story, more special effects, and more mutants.  In "X2: X-Men United" audiences were introduced to the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), also Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro were given more screen time, and several other recognizable mutants made cameos; such as, Colossus, Siren, and Kitty Pryde.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" simply put, was just an incredible film, and built brilliantly on what "X-Men" had started.  Now all we can do is hope that when "X3" comes to theaters in 2006, it will carry on the already impressive legacy, that "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United" has created.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Without question, &quot;X2&quot; offers more exciting, action-packed sequences than the first &quot;X-Men&quot; film. It's one of the best films I've seen based on comics superheros. Bryan Singer deserves ample praise for his crisp direction. To his credit Singer does an admirable job delving into intolerance with the X-Men mutants providing a fantastic allegory with racial and religious intolerance. And of course Patrick Stewart is brilliant once more as Professor Xavier, with his old friend and nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen), assuming a more important role in this installment, and McKellen's portrayal nearly as riveting as his Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. However, Alan Cummings almost steals every scene he's in as Nightcrawler. And I agree with a previous reviewer that it is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, which provides the emotional heart of this film. I was never a fan of the X-Men comics, so I am surprised that I found this film quite engrossing and memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>In this day and age of lousy sequels, it's great when a filmmaker manages to up the ante and deliver an even better movie than the one that precedes it.  "X2" is one such example.<p>Although it's recommended you see the first movie to familiarize yourself with this one, it's not totally necessary.  This one has a bigger budget, and goes further into the character development without sacrificing any quality.<p>If Bryan Singer can make the third movie as good as this one, we'll be in for a real treat.  Wachowski Brothers, you might want to take some notes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I thought the first X-Men movie was a mess.  I liked bits of it, particularly Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, and some of scenes were electrifying, including the "cage" match and the train sequence where Magneto lifts Wolverine into the air and gives him a stretch.  What was wrong with it?  Tone deaf story-telling, for one.  I'd come to expect that from Bryan Singer.  After watching Apt Pupil, I had low expectations about his ability to know a plot hole if it smacked him in the head.  I was right.  The dialogue was mainly lame, as well.  Add to that a rather stupid story with inexplicable inconsistencies.<p>But enough of X-Men the first.  What of this effort?  It's a better movie.  Significantly so.  It still has big problems, and small ones (like Wolverine standing in the frozen tundra and exhaling with no "breath" to be seen).  But the dialogue is at various times snappy, funny, and energetic.  There must have been a new screenwriter involved, because X-2 has no lines that make you want to burst out laughing.  (Remember in X-Men when Storm and Toad have a dreadful exchange about the effects of lightning?)  The lightness of some of the lines provides a terrific counterpoint to dramatic and intense evil that the film depicts.  I, frankly, never expected a menace as dark and deep as Stryker and company, nor did I expect the fascinating twist at the end.  Frankly, one of the things that was missing from X-Men was a depiction of the vainglorious side of Magneto, in which his pride and arrogance go hand in hand with almost god-like powers.  This is a truly "magnetic" persona, one who can call and army of followers with his grand ideas and charisma.  McKellan does a star turn in this one (even though he still can't help but mumble some lines).<p>Jackman, as expected, is terrific (although his hair looks just plain stupid in some of the scenes--in what appears to be an effort to mimic the comic books; it isn't the hair so much as the silly appearance that detracts from the scenes).  Anna Paquin is as insufferable and whiny as in the first film.  Rebecca Romijn does a really great, nuanced performance as Mystique (not to mention a drop dead gorgeous scene where she appears as herself, without the blue skin).  Alan Cumming is wonderful as Nightcrawler, who comes across as closest to the selfless superhero mold.  And Aaron Stanford gets an honorable mention as a terrific Pyro.  Brian Cox makes a formidable villain.<p>I could run through the story problems--there are a few--and the fact that this movie could have been so much better.  But, I'm content to leave those points unmentioned.  Go in for a roller coaster ride with interesting plot twists, fun lines, and some great performances.  And then, for me, say a prayer that Halle Berry and Anna Paquin don't make it into X-3.  That, alone, would improve the franchise immeasurably.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>When you have a formula or gimmick movie, sequels make it hard for themselves to live up to the original and maintain creativity.  When the movie is based on characters and their development, it is easier to have a successful series.  Star Wars is one example of this; James Bond also avoided a set pattern.  The X-Men series is another example.<br /><br />As in the rest of the series, the theme is dealing with prejudice.  This movie has the most chilling human villain Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), who creates a crisis for the purpose of achieving his ultimate goal:  ridding the earth of all mutants.  The good guy mutants and the bad guy mutants unite to save the mutants, but Magneto is just as ready to destroy all humans as Stryker is to destroy all mutants.  It is up to the X-Men to save the day.<br /><br />This movie gives fleeting glimpses of several of the characters, giving Pyro more of a role, while giving a brief scene with Kitty passing through walls.  It also gives a short introduction to Cyclops and Banshee.  The main new character is one of my two favorites, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, doing a wonderful job).  (My other favorite, The Beast, has to wait to Part 3.)<br /><br />I found this movie more exciting than the first.  However, it had a few scenes I found unnecessary, including a couple of PG-13 rated sex scenes.  I'm also uncomfortable with men fighting women, which happened in both scenes, including a lengthy battle between Jackman's Wolverine and a woman.  As a result, I would not recommend this movie as highly as the first and the third.  But that is personal preference.<br /><br />I am hesitant to give much details, but I found some similarity between this movie and Star Trek 2:  The Wrath Of Khan.</p></br></body></html>

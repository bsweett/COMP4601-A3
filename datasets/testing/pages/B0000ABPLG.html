Having (barely) survived yet another world war, humanity has placed its hopes on a strict regime that forces drugs on the citizens in an effort to suppress all feelings (thus doing away with hate and aggression).  To implement law and order, and oversee the administration of the drugs, the state's leadership relies on the services of a special kind of enforcers known as the Clerics.  One such Cleric, however, will discover that what he's been fighting against might just be worth saving...<br /><br />Christian Bale, Sean Bean (from LOR), Angus Macfadyen (from Braveheart), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />There are strong hints of 1984 and Brave New World as well as the Matrix, Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Equilibrium will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Since this movie had so many rave reviews and quite a few friends of mine were telling me about how awesome it is, I decided to rent this movie because, for one, I love Christian Bale. I became a fan after seeing him in Newsies, which, while being a so-so movie at best, was worth it for Bale alone. Who thought he could sing very well? He was also in American Psycho, and a few other movies that I love. ALso, I love action movies, I'm a huge fan of dystopian stories and It seemed very matrix-ish.<br /><br />Let's get right down to the good: The action scenes are incredible. Some of the best I've seen in any movie. In fact, they alone save the movie from being downright awful. The action at the end was awesome too, and it was well shot and edited. No shaky camera, no rapid edits, the viewer can tell what's going on in the scenes. Also, no speed ups or slow motion, it's raw and down to earth. As for the visuals- the movie was shot on a very low budget, but even then they look great. The dystopian look really enhances the dark tones of the movie. Bale gives a great performance here, this is one of his better performances.<br /><br />However, that can't save the movie from being confusing and disjointed. The plot is really hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on, and at times it tried to echo The Matrix. Part of the reason The Matrix kicks serious ass is because the way it was done was incredible- when I watched the Matrix for the first time I was blown away, and I had not seen a movie like it. In fact, maybe had I not seen The Matrix before seeing Equilibrium, I might have liked Equilibrium more. Also, as much as I love the action scenes, at the same time I was wondering how it was possible that Bale's character had God like powers. The Matrix's scenes were more realistic in the sense that you knew why Neo had these godlike powers. Equilibrium offers no explanation, instead we're left wondering what the reasoning behind all of this is.<br /><br />Another negative point is the characters. None of the characters seemed to catch my attention at all. I personally couldn't care less if Bale died or not, and are we really supposed to feel sorry for Watson's character? I was just glad I didn't have to watch her anymore. As for Bale's character's kids, they were pointless and were out of place with the plot. Especially the son. In fact, when I saw that he was dressed like Bale, I laughed out loud. As for his acting, he sounded like he was reading off a teleprompter. Most of his dialogue was just him giving plot points away.<br /><br />In short, this movie is really a mixed bag. When it's good, it's good, but when it's bad, it's downright awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>The violence and cinematography in this film are first class. There's plenty of action and a good presentation of a dark, sinister future.<br /><br />Bale is on good form and the whole film delivers very, very well indeed.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>At the dawn of the 21st century, society was faced with a great Third World War, and knowing that something had to be done to prevent further problems, humanity was faced with the dilemma of solving all of man's troublels.  As a result, they created a new enforcer of the law, the Grammaton Clerics, a collection of warriors who practice gun kata to improve their lethality while executing their sole task of eradicating any instance of feeling within humanity.<br /><br />To control the general public, daily dosage of Prozium are self-administered, similar to the daily dosages of Soma in Brave New World, except this opiate of the masses elimites melancholy, rage, hate, and jealousy, as well as the suppressing positive feelings of pathos, joy, and love.  Similarly, destruction of all that creates feeling, literature, art, all that gives us emotion, just like the firemen in Fahrenheit 451.  Large-scale indoctrination is accomplished through the visualized, Apple commerical-esque, Big Brother screens of 1984 (used later in V for Vendetta).  The combination of the three classic dystopian tales is flawless, each blending into the other, and the collective producing realism and fear for what could easily be a not-so-distant future.<br /><br />Two Grammaton Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale) and Errol Partridge (Sean Bean), have worked together to "protect" society.  However, Errol has been confiscating sense offender material.  Eventually, John catches Errol because he had been sneaking outside of the city to commit sense crimes.  When he is eventually uncovered face-to-face, John must bring his partner in for justice.  His partner would rather die than be captured or give up feeling, and in a final act of defiance he quotes a passage from his book and raises his book to cover his eyes.<br /><br />Partridge's final words would later haunt John in a dream, as they serve as the catalyst for his finaly memory of his wife, the moment of her sense crime incarceration and eventual incineration, and he remembers with horror his still, emotionless inaction.<br /><br />The following morning John drops his dosage of Prozium.  His sone recommends a trip to Equilibrium for a replacement dosage.  Only, John doesn't go, and he begins to feel, to sense and perceive all the wonderful feelings previously unknown.  Soon, he enjoys the touch of an intricately designed vase, cries at the sound of Beethoven, and risks everything by protecting a puppy from extermination.<br /><br />The gun battles are equisitely designed and choreographed, a little Matrix crossed with a little Jet Li action.  Christian Bale delivers an impressive performance as a man who is initially wooden, and later severely troubled by his actions.<br /><br />Eventually John must face the battle between his logic and his emotions, his allegiance and his freedom, as he comes to terms with what he has done, what he has become, and what he wishes for the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>The future - in order to stop the negative actions stemming from certain human emotions like anger and fear, the powers-that-be have long since decided that emotion must be taken out of the equation.  And in the world of "Equilibrium", it's gone - not just the 'negative' emotions but all emotion and feeling - love, passion, joy, compassion, conscience - banned and supressed by the mandatory administering of emotion-blocking drugs.  A class of law enforcement officers known as 'clerics' are charged with tracking down and destroying books, films, works of music, paintings, 'interactive computer programs' and all other works from the past that are deemed to have the potential to trigger emotion.  These are designated 'Emotional Content' (abbreviated EC-10, in an apparent dig at the alphanumerical ratings - 'PG-13', '16-UP', NC-17', 'M', etc. - that currently adorn movies, CDs, video games, etc. and that will probably be applied to novels, groceries, and a host of other products in the near future) and they still exist in fair abundance in the ruined areas outside of the world's cities, and sometimes carefully hidden away inside the cities as well.  Outside the cities is also a refuge for a number of people who've fled the ultra-regimented society in order to avoid being forced to take the drugs which block emotion.<br /><br />  Through a series of events - some of which is brilliantly left open to interpretation to distinguish between coincidence and sub-concsious intent - a cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale) ends up missing doses of the emotion-suppressant and quickly beginning to feel again; and with it, to question: another taboo in this future world.  Preston is to end up being a key player in the simmering war between ultimate authoritarianism and free emotion.<br /><br />  The action is tremendous; sort of Matrix-styled but actually outdoing it; and very impressively the movie actually shows how the system of seemingly impossible fighting used by the clerics was developed through enormous computer analysis and simulation applied to the machine-like properties of an emotionless human mind.  The whole movie is eerily believable, with the possible exception of some aspects of certain events toward the end - not that they happen, but more the way they happen.  The ideas behind "Equilibrium", though, feel amazingly plausible all the way through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>i can not i repeat can not understand why this didn't do so well in threaters...<br /><br />My friend brought the DVD over and i was blown away at how good this movie is the fight scenes was too good and the gun scenes U.N.B.E.L.I.E.V.A.B.L.E<br /><br />I think Christian Bale is one of those actors we are going to have to pay more attention to in the future.. would say good job but i thought it was a great job</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Up until I saw this film, I knew very little about Christian Bale.  My wife told me that he was in a version of "Little Women" sometime ago.  I've also seen him with smaller parts in other films.<br /><br />In "Equilibrium," Bale takes center stage as John Preston, a top cleric in Libria who hunts down "sense offenders."  These "sense offenders" range from people who read poetry and novels, study art, or enjoy the occasional musical piece.  In other words, anyone who shows any sort of emotion is dealt with swiftly and deadly.  Also, if you skip your dosage of Prozium, an emotion dulling drug, you risk facing death.<br /><br />All of this emotion control is done in hopes to render any ideas of revolution moot.  After the third World War, balance is brought about by removing art, music, etc. so that no one gets any crazy ideas.  Of course, there are some folks who want to feel.  These people, including one fellow cleric, manage to get under the skin of Bale.  Bale slowly begins to lose his emotionless nature and begins to cherish things such as rainbows and puppies.  He begins to care for human life and worries for the safety of his children.  Eventually, he is recruited by the revolutionaries to lead their revolt on "Father," a Big Brother-type who controls what is considered good and what is considered bad.<br /><br />Bale goes from emotionless puppet to a vengeful, angry man.  Though some may find his love of a puppy and the lengths he goes to in order to save its life a tad silly, you have to see the situation through his character's eyes.  The best example I can give is when you see a deaf person "hear" for the first time using a hearing aid.  They usually begin to cry tears of joy and pain all at the same time.  Something very similar occurs to Bale when he hears music for the first time.<br /><br />Taye Diggs provides a smarty-pants foe to Bale's Preston.  Angus McFadyen plays "Father" with sinister flair.  Both Emily Watson and Sean Bean have small but significant roles and they put their whole hearts into their respective characters.  The rest of the cast is very good, though most of them are simply "sweepers" and revolutionaries who fight violently and often.<br /><br />The story moves at a steady pace and really picks up when Bale begins to show a little too much emotion around Diggs.  The action is brilliant, especially the gun-kata.  Others have compared this film to "The Matrix," but I see nothing in "Equilibrium" that wasn't copied by "The Matrix" and vice versa.  Let's be honest folks, the whole "Matrix" story and things not being as they seem has been thrown around for centuries.  It's all been done before in countless books, plays and films.  What it all boils down to is good versus evil and in the end, good prevails.  Stop with the comparisons already!<br /><br />Anyway, watch this film if you really enjoy action-packed sci-fi that is a little bit more intelligent than most of the shoot-em-up sci-fi we are treated to these days.  The acting is way better than a lot of other flicks out there these days.  The action is fun to watch, and you will actually pull for the good guys in this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Everything and everyone is covered in black, white, or flat shade between. Police or guards (guarding what? from what?) are everywhere, in beetle-black armor with opaque beetle helmets. This inhuman environment is filled with people. The question is, are they fully human?<br /><br />This world's answer to war, crime, and violence is to flatten all emotion, in every one, with "Prozium". Our hero, Preston, seeks out the people who skip their doses and dare to feel. It's a capital crime, and he summarily executes the penalty more often than not. One day, his dose breaks on the floor. He is delayed in replacing it, then stops taking it altogether.<br /><br />That, of course, is where the movie really starts. It's also where tinges of color start to appear on screen, as Preston's mind opens to the figurative colors of emotion. This is a very good dystopic story, oddly similar to Brave New World even in its differences, but more like THX 1138. The action isn't as wild as comparisons to The Matrix would suggest, but this movie is a lot more thoughtful. And keep your eye on Preston's children. They are un-nerving throughout the movie, perhaps most of all in the last scene.<br /><br />I like this one a lot. It's got fair action, but it's a lot more than that. For one, it's an uncommonly effective use of the cinematographer's palette. Mostly, though, it starts from a premise that stands up to a little thought - a rarity these days.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Equilibrium - an interesting concept. Yes this film may look and perhaps imitate other Sci-Fi movies but its basic storyline is original and thought provoking. <p>Christian Bale is John Preston, a Cleric who enforces the law of no emotion after they were declared illegal in order to prevent further war - achieved by the newly created drug 'Prozium'. One morning, having failed to take his daily dose of it, Preston realises the highs and lows of his new found human emotions and embarks on a new alliance with 'The Underground' and a fight to free the rest of the impassive city of Libria.<p>Some interesting ideas here, yet Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer did not execute them well enough nor expand on their philosophy. Not only that, its intent to be an action film was not fulfilled considering the Cleric's powers revolve around the fictional fighting style 'Gun Kata', it is seldom used. Had there been a few added fight scenes near the beginning and a bigger climatic fight at the end, Equilibrium would have been a lot more entertaining.<p>That aside and considering the rather low funding it had, Equilibrium exceeds as a low budget action film. Definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Equlibrium is set in a futuristic society, where a strict regime has eiliminated war by suppresing emotion and destroying everything that causes it - books, art, music, animals, etc.. To keep everyone in line, the government administers a mind altering drug that hinders emotion called Prozium. A form of police called the Clerics, have been created to enfore the law, and anyone who breaks it by feeling or showing emotion is put to death. John Preston ( Christian Bale), is the highest ranking Cleric who is responsible for destroying anyone who breaks the rules. But John is soon effected by a prisoner ( Emily Watson), who claims that you cannot truly live life unless you are able to feel, and experience emotion. To test her theory, he skips his next dose of Prozium. Right away, John sees that the society that he helped create, has been wrong all along. John has been trained to enforce the laws of the new regime at all costs, but he is now the only person capable of overthrowing it. His partner (Taye Diggs)sets his eyes on John's position, and becomes determined to stop him... <p>I was literally blown away by this film. Director Kurt Wimmer did a great job creating the future society, with the outstanding visuals. While the story is similar to &quot;Fahrenhiet 451&quot; in some aspects, the story still manages to keep your interest and seem original for the most part. &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, is also the best action film I have seen in recent memory. Even &quot;The Matrix&quot; pales in comparison. When I first saw this film at the theater, everyone in the audience was literally gasping and making comments about how original and amazing the action was. A totally original form of martial art was introduced in this film called &quot; The Gun Kata&quot;. It mixes martial arts together with gun play to create a more effective shooting technique. Watching this new type of self defense unfold on the screen was mind blowing. The ending to this film is great and features one of the best sword fights I have ever seen.<p>Christian Bale puts in another good performance. He plays both sides of John Preston so well. The first is the Cleric who feels nothing, and kills anyone who breaks the law. He looks down right menacing! The second, is the man that comes to believe what he is doing is wrong. Watching him feel for the first time will amaze you, because he gave such an accurate portrayal of what it would really be like. Taye Diggs did an outstanding job as his partner. He is dispicable and a truly great villan. Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Sean Bean were also fantastic in their roles. <p>&quot;Equlibrium&quot; raised the bar of action films to a whole new level. The gun play, martial arts action, and overall violence will blow your mind. It is fast paced, realistic, and extremely gory!! The visuals are stunning as well, and the performances are great. Once this film becomes more well known, it will have people talking for a long time to come!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Can you imagine having your emotions banned from society? Well, if you can't, then you'll have to watch Equilibrium to see for yourself. Here, we see a Fascist regime that has banned all forms of human emotions. Christian Bale is John Preston, a man of the highest rank for this notorious empire. At first, he sees human emotions as a plague upon humanity, but after he doesn't take his medicine due to an accident, he beings to experience emotions. Here, we get to see the good things in life, like music and color. But that's not the only thing that makes this film so recognizable.  We also have some tense action sequences. They may not be very realistic, but they're still so spectacular to look at. The cast is a great ensemble, though I did find Emily Watson to be a bit wooden at times (for a person who actually HAS emotion in this movie). Overall, I tried hard to love this movie, but I ended but only liking it. It is a very good film, but it's not one of my favorites (mostly due to the slow pace in the middle of the film, and some unnecessary choral music).</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>I remember clearly in 2002 I saw a trailer for this movie, somehow no one recalls this movie. I on the other hand could not wait for this movie to come out, I actually went to the cinemas to see it...unfortunately it had been taken out already. Anyway, I saw it as soon as it was released on DVD; and let me tell you that when I saw it for the first time it blew me away. The Story, the Acting and the out of this world action sequences.<br /><br />Now 7 years later...It didn't feel the same, the movie however still stands as an exceptional Sci-Fi film, but not as superb as I remember. The problems with the movie are mainly "plot holes" some are passable and others are as big as the Milky Way.<br /><br />The movie's premise is of a world commencing from start after a 3rd World War. According to the brief prologue we are supposed to accept that there is only one last remaining "civilized" society, known as Liberia. In Liberia, every citizen must take a doze of a drug known as "Prozium". This drug inhibits the effect of a robotic/non emotional being. So technically speaking no one can or exhibit emotions..."why"? well according to the story of the movie, emotions like hate, greed, and anger caused War. Yet without Emotions we seize to exist as humans beings, it is an essential part of who we are.<br /><br />shortly in the movie we are introduced to John Preston (Christian Bale) a "Grammaton Cleric" (futuristic officer) he exhibits the persona of a man troubled by lost of someone and himself, his emotions that have been repressed are demonstrated quite well in dream sequences and thoughts. As for what happens...Its quite obvious, he accidentally lets the dose fall on the floor...And voila he begins to "feel"<br /><br />So, pretty much the movie is interesting and contains a potential plot. "So what's wrong with it"? Unfortunately the problem with the movie is the plot holes. As I had said these plot holes are quite noticeable. I will write a short list of some of the most obvious mistakes. Anyhow, the movie borrows alot from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and even the city looks similar to Fritz Lang's "Metropolis.<br /><br />Now, all of these mistakes are not to be taken as a reason to ignore this movie; on the contraire, this movie has still so much more to offer. The astonishing "Gun Kata" the technique to fight with guns blew me away, it is by far the most original idea I have ever seen in an action movie. Not one scene involving the "Gun Kata" looks bad. The best asset in the movie is Bale, he brings so much to the role, he takes the Semi-Original story and gives it heart and a push that made the film a sleeper hit.<br /><br /> This is a sci-fi vehicle at the most, but don't underestimate the directing of Kurt Wimer (who unfortunately directed a weaker film "Ultraviolet) he directed this movie so well for so little money. The entire cast gave a little to the story so we could forget in a way the mistakes in the movie. As well the sets and wardrobe are amazing, Preston's white suit, which resembles the morning suit of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, Gives a certain shine to action, it pretty much gives a splendor. With its Mistakes it still worth owning, classic modern science fiction at it's best.<br /><br />Some of the Mistakes<br />***Warning Spoilers Ahead***<br />1) Preston at the end can somehow dodge 1,000 of bullets and still kill everyone with out a scratch.<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Preston is the highest ranking officer, he is pretty much the best...but still come' on..Way to precise<br /><br />2) Partridge is reading a book of Yates; earlier in the movie it's much smaller<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- The angle in which we see the book the first time makes the book look tiny...hey it can be possible<br /><br />3) The character of Brent smiles all the time...Supposedly he takes the dose<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Brent could have not taken the dose at all or his smile is a senseless smile..a soulless smile<br /><br />Trust me it goes on and on with plot holes...but it still has alot of heart and potential. The vest is the acting and not to mention the music, which soars so triumphantly. Too bad there isn't a soundtrack. Anyway as I said, It's a must have even if it has mistakes.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>I have read the first couple of pages of the reviews and am surprised that no-one has yet made the comparison to Logans Run, the 70s sci-fi classic, where Michael Yorke is a Sandman, an emotionless cop tasked with killing "runners", people who try and escape the domed city the story is set in to avoid being forcibly terminated on their 30th birthdays. Logan tasked with infiltrating the resistance begins to empathise with them and becomes a runner himself. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />Equilibrium obviously tries to cash in on the Matrix but they are very different films, both in terms of budget and premise. This film looks very stylish and revolves far more around the characterisation, costumes and cinematography, as obviously the budget was limited. And the director does a fantastic job in creating the dystopic future and capturing the set piece battles. Even the startling way the film is shot, lots of black and white costumes with a lack of colour enhances the look and feel of the film. It really is a nice piece of work and you can watch and enjoy this even if you think the Matrix is the greatest film ever (and of course, it is pretty amazing.)<br /><br />The plot as many people have pointed out is a little shaky and the premise of the film doesn't really hold up to over scrutiny, but it is sci-fi, the "fi" bit being "fiction" which means we should allow the director to present his world and accept it for what it is. Personally, I like the "gun-kata", its one of those pieces of "film-science" that makes you think that "hmmm, maybe its possible". I remember at a job interview for the Defence Research Agency many years ago being told about some one who had attempted to break down aerial combat into a set of algorithms so that an aircrafts computer could calculate the probability of a successful engagement and inform the pilot. If this was true, the "gun-kata" might not seem so terribly far-fetched.<br /><br />Bale is of course immense, you could put him in the tellytubbies and he would probably binge eat for 6 months and paint himself purple to get into role. He is ably supported by a cast of British and Irish actors including "Beaner" who is the working mans Sean Connery.<br /><br />This film could have been crap, but it isn't. It is really really good, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>OK, we've seen this type of movie before. The oppressive future governments ruling with violence and without remorse fighting against rebels wanting to be free. Equilibrium does this style of movie so much better. How? I hear you ask. With the help of Christian Bale. My review will be in three different stages. They are the story, the characters (or character) and the review which is just my opinion on the whole thing.<br /><br />The Story: In the beginning of the 21st century, World War Three ravages the Earth and almost obliterates mankind. The few survivors realise that a fourth world war would mean the end of mankind once and for all. The world is taken over by "The Father" and his Tetragrammaton government. The father believes that the cause for WW3 was human feeling and in order to prevent that it must be eradicated. They have created "prozium" which is a medication that prevents feeling. But they must also locate and destroy every piece of art, music and other such items that would cause a human to feel. John Preston is a high ranking Grammaton Cleric and is on the front line when bringing "sense offenders" to justice. The only problem is that one day when accidentally smashing one of his prozium injections, he starts to feel. Feeling is the only thing that makes us human and Preston seeks to destroy the government that is destroying basic humanity.<br /><br />The Character: John Preston is played by Christian Bale, and I must say the character is portrayed superbly. John Preston is a man who has no emotion and is dedicated to the cause of the Grammaton. He's so dedicated that he even allowed his wife to be executed for being a "sense offender." Preston also executed his partner and friend for being a "sense offender." This goes to show you the ruthlessness of Preston when he believes in his cause. The interesting part of him, however, is when he goes through the transformation of being completely emotionless to feeling things for the very first time.<br />He begins to dream of his wife, he begins to seek out art and music in the pursuit of emotional stimulation. Seeing him develop and seeing Bale pull it off is what makes this film tremendous.<br /><br />The Review: When I first started watching this film I thought it would just bore the life out of me and I almost switched it off about 10 minutes in. This is simply due to it starting off as completely emotionless, sure the action's cool but without character emotion you're not getting much more than the odd gun fight. The film truly comes alive with the transformation of Christian Bales character. His acting ability really shines when he has to display a character experiencing emotions for the very first time.<br />The film is dark and at times haunting at us being reminded that such a totalitarian government could come to fruition in the near future. Until that time comes we have this film to tide us over. The action scenes are really intense and something this film holds unique to what has become quite a clich&eacute; sub genre. The supporting cast also do their job in holding their own with such a talented actor.<br />It's an enjoyable movie all round and I think everyone will enjoy it. It takes a while to get started but once it does it becomes something very special.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Sci-fi flick with stunning visuals, "Equilibrium" deserves much more attention not only from fans of genre, but also from general audiences.  Sure, its flaws are too visible, borrowing Orwellian ideas from other films like, say, "Brazil," but it is not that ideas themselves but the way they are put into practice that really counts, and on that score "Equiliburium" is a winner.  (And critics, please let me know, why do you all praise Steven's "Minority Report" which actually borrows ideas from other films of this genre?  So, why not give this one a due respect?)<p>Well, I admit the opening chapter of "Equilibrium" is a bit weak, introducing us to the dystopia world after the WW3, but soon you will forget that.  The totalitarian government established after the war decided to eliminate anything that might possibly make humans emotional, forcing the people to inject a certain doze of [chemical substance] to be unemotional every day. Moreover, it decrees there should be no more music (not only hip-hops, but classic music), no more motion pitures, and no more decorated interiors.  Those who love them hide underground, becoming rebels while the authroity set up a super-cop troop called "Grammaton Clerics."<p>Christian Bale ("American Psyco") is John Preston the best of the Clerics, and dedicates himself to the job until he arrests a woman Mary O'Brien who possessd illegal stuffs.  But her strong creed and perhaps beauty make their way into the sleeping heart of Preston, who has been long fighting for his cause.<p>The film's philosophical messages are in themselves not new at all, and director Kurt Wimmer might have kept his idea a little too long.  I say so, because today, in the 21st century, it is not this Orwellian society that we are afraid of most.  The story has enough twists to surprise us, but maybe one too many, I think, and the wrap-up part of the film feels a bit hurriedly done.<p>However, those are noting before the film's sensational action scenes, which can make up for any flawed part of the film.  The "Gun-Kata" fighting deserves special mention, using [weapons] like Japanese swords, and its hyper-kinetic movement is very violent and very beautiful at the same time.  Incredible it might sound, but Christian Bale shows excellent action star quality here, displaying the beauty of "Kata"s -- and "kata" means in Japanese "style."  Yes, there are lots of styles in "Equilibrium."<p>Other plsyers are also effectively cast, and most unexpected is Emily Watson, who quite naturally becomes the Joan D'Arc-like character.  Taye Diggs is good as Preston's partner, and though short time, Sean Bean, cast against type, is also perfect as Partridge who plays a key role in the story.<p>I was quite surprised and satisfied, and even thrilled to see this neglected film, which should have been more pushed.  Again I say, its actions are sensational.  Not that this is "Matrix"; rather, it is more unique and has its own "kata" = style, which means a lot these days.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With the release of 'The Matrix' series of films, the sci-fi thriller genre was given a much needed breath of fresh air.  Proving that good sci-fi can be comprised of terrific storytelling, and contain issues and ideals that do apply to the modern day, the sci-fi world was allowed to explore other things than just the inside of a space ship.  In 2002, writer/director Kurt Wimmer presented audiences with a bleak look at a post-World War 3 existence for humanity in "Equilibrium".<br /><br />"Equilibrium" is set in Earth's future where World War 3 has occurred, in an attempt to stop any and all future wars from happening, the powers that be have outlawed the very thing that makes us human, emotion!  Requiring that all people of the world take a daily dose of a emotion-blocking drug, and that anything that could possibly trigger emotional responses are destroyed.  To enforce these laws, the governement forms an elite police force known as, Grammaton Clerics.  Trained in the art of 'Gun-Kata', a blend of martial arts and weapons training, the Clerics are a force to be reckoned with.  When a resistance to the anti-emotion laws begins to increase in strength, the government looks to it's top Grammaton Cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale) to bring an end to the rebellion.  During a raid on a rebellion hideout, Preston meets a woman who slowly unlocks the emotions within him.  As a result Preston slowly begins to cease his emotion-blocking drug, and starts to feel all of the emotions he had never experienced.  Realizing that what the government and the Grammaton Clerics are doing is wrong, Preston joins forces with the resistance to bring down the emotion-less leaders of this dark world, bringing emotion back to Earth's people.<br /><br />Packed full of incredible action scenes that can easily rival "The Matrix", a strong story of redemption and self-discovery, writer/director Kurt Wimmer has masterfully crafted a new classic for the sci-fi genre.  Terrific performances from all involved, it has to be tough for an actor to give a solid performance without relying on their emotions, delivering their lines virtually dead-pan and not sounding bored is an achievement for any actor.  This cast comprised of Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean deliver on all counts, Christian Bale especially, his journey of self-discovery regarding his emotions is carefully handled, and Bale truly excels with conveying every newly discovered feeling Preston has in this film.<br /><br />Sadly, this movie did not do well in the box-office, mostly due to other sci-fi films of recent time overshadowing it's possibility, films such as, "The Matrix", "Minority Report", and "Star Wars - Episode 2:  Attack of the Clones".  Though it didn't do well, it has enjoyed a fairly strong following on DVD that serves as a testament to the film's quality, that even though it didn't produce strong box-office numbers, doesn't mean it's not a good movie that audiences will enjoy and pay money to see on DVD.  If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the other movies I listed above, or even just an action movie/martial arts fan, then I truly believe that you will enjoy "Equilibrium".  So do yourself a favor and rent it today, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />"Equilibrium" is rated R for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>After telling a friend about Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451, my friend told me about the movie EQUILIBRIUM and suggested that I see it.  Upon this recommendation, I watched the movie and was not disappointed.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM is a movie that takes place in the not-so-distant future. After years of war that have wracked and scarred the planet, a new government has taken control and from all appearances things seem at peace.  The new government keeps order because all forms of Art: paintings, music, literature, etc; have been outlawed and made illegal. To ensure that no Art is produced, a group of specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics are trained to find hidden Art, destroy it, and kill those who produce it.  Needless to say, an underground rebellion rises up to fight against the oppression.  The resistance finds their hero in the most famous of the Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale).  Preston was forced to kill his partner, Partridge, when Partridge refused to turn in a book of poetry that had been confiscated.  Through reading those poems, Preston, like a futuristic Apostle Paul, begins to realize the oppression that he has had a help in creating and seeks to set things right.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM borrows many elements from the best of sci-fi. The dystopian society reminds one of George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451. Preston is in many ways a conglomeration of the firemen in FARENHEIT 451 and Harrison Bergeron from Kurt Vonnegut's famous story. The "Gun Kata" martial art that is introduced in the film reminds one of fighting scenes in THE MATRIX.  However, despite all the similarities, EQUILIBRIUM does an excellent job of incorporating this various sci-fi themes and molding them together into something that is original.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the film went unnoticed in theatres.  The movie has some great acting, good special effects, and great plot and character development. It's a sci-fi movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Before reading the reviews regarding Equilibrium on Amazon, I had never heard of the film. I was looking for some quality science fiction movies, with higher ratings, that I had yet to watch. After reading about Equilibium, I decided to rent it.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't expect much. I wasn't familiar with the actors, and I am always leary about movies that feature alot of action scenes. With that said, Equilibruim exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />It is the story of a "future cop" who is at the top of his game. The twist? Feelings are not allowed. World War III has turned mankind into haters of all things artistic and expressive, and even things as laughter or grief will bring about the death penalty. This "cop" has the job of moping up the criminals; those who express feelings, or possess such forbidden objects as books, music,paintings, etc.<br /><br />While the movie does have some awesome actions scenes, it also has captivating characters, above average acting, quality directing and a good story. There are many bad action movies on the market, but Equilibrium will not disappoint. It is sci-fi/future/martial arts/action will a unique story twist.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 45<br /><br />25 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />5 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />6 (out of 10).

The fight scenes are awesome. The gun parts are cool, but there are also sword scenes. Although there aren't as much of those as guns, they are awesome. Christian Bale does a good job, as usual. Taye Diggs is perfect.<br /><br />Now for the bad. Certain parts of the movie are real slow. It seems like the beginning of the movie isn't that inspired. As the movie progresses it gets better, but the beginning just doesn't have that much substance. Certain parts throughout the movie are slow as well, such as the scenes with Emily Watson. I think most would agree that although many of the characters don't show emotion(that's part of the plot), only certain people can pull it off and still seem captivating. Emily Watson just seems too lifeless, and she formed a bond with Christian Bale that feels uninspired every time I watch the film. I think they could of made a reason for their love, but instead she just seems like a way to tack on a romance to a film that doesnn't need one.<br /><br />This film is really good at times, but it could have been done better. Still, I would reccomend any fan of the Matrix or the book 1984 to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Equilibrium (2002)is an underrated film that thankfully is getting more recognition on DVD.  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, the premise is deceptively simple: after World War Four, society has had enough.  Human emotions are blamed for all violence, and the name of this new totalitarian society is Libria, run by the faceless Tetragrammaton.  Citizens dutifully inject themselves twice a day with a drug that supresses all feelings, even senses of touch and taste.  The movie is a fantastic futuristic action thriller that also touched my heart and provoked endless thought.  The reasoning behind eliminating human feelings makes some sense.  The other side of love is hate, and passion is often responsible for murder.  Why do people numb themselves with alcohol and drugs, even committ suicide?  Because feeling is sometimes too painful to bear.  We have all been let down, hurt by someone we love.  But that is a sacrifice we make, to feel love and friendship.<br /><br />Christian Bale is the center of the story.  A magnetic and mesmerizing actor who moves with the athletic grace of a tiger, he plays Cleric John Preston.  As a top enforcer against "sense offenders," Preston even executes another cleric (Sean Bean - Boromir in the Lord of the Rings) who has succumbed to Yeat's poetry.  "Tread lightly on my dreams."  Bean gives quite a touching performance.  Preston has two young children, but his wife was incinerated for sense offenses.  Of course, Preston feels nothing.  There is a resistance, of course, underground people who are not injecting and "feeling."  They cling to cheesy knick-knacks and tacky art, anything to evoke emotion.  These scenes of confiscated snow-globes and faded paintings are very sad.  Even sadder is a scene where companion animals are exterminated because they serve no purpose except love.  I cried at this scene.<br /><br />The sets and acting are very good.  Taye Diggs plays a villian here - how odd to see that engaging, bright smile become sinister!  He is also very good in combat scenes.  Angus MacFayden (Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) plays Preston's supervisor. Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) plays Mary O'Brien, a woman arrested for sense offense and sentenced to incineration. The movie is very violent, with lots of bloody executions and tons of gunfire.  But the hand-to-hand martial arts combat scenes are breathtaking.  The DVD contains a nice featurette entitled "Finding Equilibrium."  The featurette contains interviews with Bale, Diggs, Wimmer, and Watson, although Watson is so soft-spoken you really can't hear what she is saying!</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>Don't misunderstand me, I thought that Martrix part 1 was a good movie, but Equilibrium has a better story. The story was  interesting and some parts were very heart moving.<br /><br />Equilibrium has a unique action style which uses very fast hand movements. Contrary to Matrix 1 which uses slow motion bullet time speed.<br /><br />I also recommend another movie named The Returner. Which has a different style, but is good for sci-fi action fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>In the future, a majority has been taught that emotions are the root to all evil and they now must be eradicated by the government through a police force lead by the Clerics.  Anything that can cause emotion is to be exterminated or taken in for investigation such as art, books, music, and people with knowledge of feelings.  The people are controlled by Prozium, a mind-numbing medication that controls emotions.  However, when Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) loses his partner and repressed memories begin to haunt his sleep, he decides to see what happens if he does not take the Prozium.  Equilibrium is a dark film about a possible future that promotes thoughts about our current freedoms in the western world; however, it also offers some action packed sequences that will keep the sleepy awake.  In the end, Equilibrium offers a solid cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>After barely surviving World War III, the human race decides that they will not survive another war.  Eliminating emotion is the accepted panacea for future wars. Each citizen is to take a dose of medication every day.  In addition, books, works of art, artistic embellishments, and music are all banned--a loudspeaker continually announces the latest "bans for E10 content." Their hope is to create a sterile utopia.  What they create instead is a totalitarian state run by the "Father" (Big Brother) of an order of Grammaton Clerics.<br /><br />John Preston (Christian Bale) is the chief of these clerics.  In the first scene, we see him verifying the authenticity of the Mona Lisa--and then firing it himself instead of allowing it to be taken in 'because some things manage to escape.'<br /><br />Preston is literally the 'cop's cop' and he's as straight arrow as they come.  When his partner, Partridge, begins to feel for the people of the Nethers, who are resisting being drugged and suppressing their emotions, Preston turns him in.<br /><br />Preston may well have eradicated the Resistance problem had it not been for an accidentally skipped dose of medication.  The next day, he saw the sun rise for the first time and began to unthaw himself.<br /><br />Preston begins to feel and consequently, his sympathies change.  He's thrust into a plot to overthrow the current government by killing the Father.<br /><br />Bluntly, I could pick this film apart--yes, few of the individual ideas are new.  However, the way the film's ideas are put together is very well done.  Battles are in my opinion, better than "Matrix" and martial arts fans really need to see the "gun katas."</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Ok, let me start by saying that Dimension has made a great movie here.  The atmosphere's are really like how I usually picture a Dystopian world.  Very grey and nuetral colors.  Christian Bale is really cool, but I like him better in Reign of Fire.  Our boy from Goldeneye Sean Bean plays a small part as Bale's partner at the beginning who discovers emotion before the movie sets in.  That one guy who's on a UPN show...ah..I don't know his name, plays Bale's new partner, sort of evil.  Well now let me talk about something confusing.  Christian Bale plays a "Cleric" who is a very highly skilled fighter used as an instrument by "Father" to take out people who break the laws of feeling emotion and taking their medicin which helps them be emotionless.  See, after WWIII the world decides that something has to be done, so they take away all free expresion and emotion.  Fahrenheit 451..yes.  There's even a scene where two guys in white clean suits burn the Mona Lisa with flamethrowers.  Anyway it's about Christian Bale discovering what it's like to feel, and he breaks down, but is good at supressing his emotion when he's around other people.  But is this really about humanity's inevitable dive into a dystopian society?  Or is it about cool action fight scenes?  Here's where something is strange.  For the first scenes the dystopian mood is set in showing us what a terrible place it is.  Than there's really outrageous scenes where Christian Bale turns into Neo and begins shooting everyone in sight without getting a scratch.  It's sort of hard to tell what the writer was all about, but maybe some of that is explained by the DVD features.  Regardless of what it's really about you should see it, because it's still a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>This film was a combination between The Matrix, Fight Club, Fahrenheit 451, and Blade Runner. There are heavy symbolic messages being thrown at you concerning religion, dictatorships, and the power of the human spirit. Equilibrium was a sci-fi film to the utmost degree. I say this because most of the time you can only cover these topics with a futuristic approach. This allows the director to give us, the viewer, a warning that unless we contain ourselves as humans, this may be the future that we will have to endure. I thought that the actors very well played it out, the direction was steady, and the action was powerful.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this film is the story. I felt at times it was rushed and a bit difficult to follow. The basis of this film was to not show emotion, which I felt the actors did very well, but there were times when I thought they were showing emotion and guards were going to come and take them away, but never did. When Bale did break down, why were the other pedestrians of the city not surprised (again, was it because they couldn't show emotion). This is where I started grappling with the overall feel of the film. There should have been a must stricter balance between emotion and non-emotion. I felt that anyone could get away with anything, and with as many spies as they "claimed" being around the city, why were more people not picking up on this?  If Prozium was issued to everyone, why were there some in the city not taking the drug. Take Watson's character. She could have been utilized in a much deeper way, helping to bring not only Bale's character to the surface, but also others around them. I just felt that with this story, there were issues not being addressed and topics not brought out until a very suspenseful moment. I despised, dare I say hated, the scenes between Bale and his son. Sometimes he was calling Bale "Dad" while other time he was using the name "John", then there was the fact that there was a painting in "father's" office, making us question if they had to take the drugs as well ... hum ... there was just not enough consistency.<br /><br />Out of what I disliked and onto what made this film work. First, our actors. I have never seen actors give so much to a small film as I did with this movie. Bale was superb, ranking close to Keanu in his "Neo" role, as the gun-toting officer of the government. Even Sean Bean brought a human feel to this story about emotion. I especially loved Emily Watson. She picks the oddest roles to add to her resume, but simply put ... they work. The acting was only the tip of the iceberg, I loved the action sequences. They were fantastic. I am a sucker for the "bullet-time" style of fighting that was issued in The Matrix and I am always impressed when films use it better or add their own spin to it. Equilibrium was one of those films. The kata style gun fighting was slowed down when needed, or kept the same pace to show the power of the human wielding those powers. It was flashy, but not too flashy. Bale pulled these sequences off with the greatest of ease, only proving that he could be the next Hollywood action hero. The battle between Preston and Brandt was exactly what I was hoping for. While there were a couple of clich&eacute;s that riddled this film, there were scenes of power and originality that gave me more delight than I can wave a stick at. The battle between two of the strongest lasted just as long as I wanted. Bale was the best, and this film never strayed from that idea.<br /><br />The final topic I would like to discuss goes over the symbolic references in this film. Please, look closely and see if you can see the Holocaust references staring you in the face. The most blatant is shown whenever somebody is accused of showing emotion they are burnt in the incinerator. This is a direct reference to what Hitler did to the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps. Then there was the supreme ruler that just happened to be everywhere people were. He was unavoidable. It reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 in the sense that "Big Brother" was watching those that would not obey. Toss in a pinch of the Salem Witch Trials and you have a little film I like to call Equilibrium. I think I liked this film due to the numerous amounts of references to our culture, yet that was what Bale and his government were trying to destroy. While they thought that our culture was being repressed, it was actually seeping through the seems. They would try to crush it in one section, but it would only cause more distress in another. The never won battle against the culture that helps make us the people that we are today. It was interesting to see a world that was scared of repeating the horrible deeds of their past actually create a carbon copy of the horrific deeds of the Holocaust. Their attempts at a utopia failed because the rulers and the people were afraid of whom they were.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this film was not without flaws, but it did make a good impression on my mind. It dealt with an issue that is not explored enough in cinema because we embrace the theme in every movie created. What would a film be like without creating any sort of emotion from the audience?  A film full of emotional void being enjoyed by a couple that embraces it. Strange, weird, world that we live in!<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>It is true that there are many similarities between this and other Sci-Fi stories. Human beings are oppressed by a government like in &quot;1984&quot; (except Big Brother is known as Father), pieces of art or otherwise items that make you &quot;feel&quot; are burned, destroyed, or taken like in &quot;Farenheit 412,&quot; and some of the city scenes remind me of futuristic films like &quot;Brazil&quot; or the animated film &quot;Metropolis.&quot; However, the film takes it all its own in one storyline and unlike other films (like Star Wars Episode II) doesn't make you feel like you're just watching a carbon copied movie.<p>The futuristic society of this movie oppresses its citizens by removing &quot;feeling,&quot; which includes movies, paintings, books, cute puppies, any thing that would change your bland nature. Imagine a more serious version of &quot;Demolition Man.&quot; Like the latter, there's a rebel group known as the Underground that just wants to live their lives the way they want too. Enter our hero, a &quot;Cleric.&quot; The Clerics practice a form of martial arts that utilizes both body, mind...and firepower. While it will probably be a while before we see a type of person like the Cleric, the movie presents it in a fairly realistic manner and you're never left feeling &quot;Yeah...right.&quot; Unlike what other reviewers have said, it doesn't feel too much like the Matrix. There is no bullet dodging or slow motion shoot outs, the Clerics merely use quick calculation and smooth, flowing movement to decide who to kill first and how to avoid getting shot themselves. Its believable.<p>The movie has some excellent action and some unforgettable lines and scenes. Its definately worth at least a rental. I'm definately planning on buying it some day.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Christian Bale gives an unbelieveably moving performance in this criminally underrated little gem where he plays a "Cleric" in a post World War III world.  In this world, all of the population is devoid of any emotions for the sake of no war and human survival, and Cleric's are the ultimate fighting machines who keep the law while their own emotions are repressed as well.  When John Preston (Bale), the best Cleric there is, accidently misses his dose of his emotion supressing drug, he begins to realize what it is to "feel", and when he does he knows that all along he has been leading the wrong path.  Bale's moving performance is one of his best, along with his roles in American Psycho and Reign of Fire, but that is almost overshadowed by some of the best action/fight scenes to grace the screen since The Matrix.  Using the "gun-kata" technique, writer/director Kurt Wimmer creates an almost over the top showcase for some ultraviolent fights mixed with incredible performances from Bale, Taye Diggs as Bale's new partner, Emily Watson as a doomed sense offender, and Sean Bean who, even in a limited role, plays a very pivotal part nonetheless.  What I can't understand is why Equilibrium didn't see the release time it deserved.  It was only released in limited theaters which I can't understand why.  I found 2002's big "future shock" film Minority Report every bit as good as Equilibrium, albeit more fast paced, and I would have liked to see how it would have done had it gotten a bigger release.  My only complaint is about the DVD itself, besides Wimmer's commentary, we get a five minute segment with some interviews and various trailers (including one for Quentin Tarantino's upcoming new film Kill Bill) and thats it.  I would have liked to see a documentary on the gun-kata fighting technique used in the film, but oh well.  All in all, Equilibrium is a more than solid sci-fi dystopia portrait, and it is criminally underrated and more than worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>2002's release of "Equilibrium" stars Dominic Purcell, Christian Bale, Sean Pertwee, and the lovely Emily Watson.  It is about a future existence where the sense of feeling has been not only outlawed and banned, there is a drug to sedate and subdue it that is required by law at a daily dose level to maintain the sanctity of having no feelings about anything whatsoever for any reason.<br />What makes this movie powerful is the onslaught of political correctness in society, and the forced adherence to "diversity" being a coerced requirement for continued employment at most workplaces, as well as getting right down to harassment policies where even an overly stern or "mean" stare is considered grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal; because no one should have to endure a hostile work environment or feel emotionally uncomfortable by peers and especially not by superiors.  The boot camp experience for military inductees for the first time in history now equips the raw buck private rank newcomer with "timeout" cards so they can get distance between themselves and a drill sergeant they perceive is being too aggressive.  These are happening NOW here in America, not in some fantasy film about the future.<br />So getting back to the movie, we see an enforcer (called a Priest) who exacts his duties with weapons and martial arts skills.  There are no penalties for deadly force when arresting those who have chosen not to take the government's required drug to avoid having feelings.  Any item of sentimental value or object causing feelings or arousal of the senses in any definition, are to be destroyed immediately or turned into the repository back at headquarters for evidence so the guilty parties of human beings can be cremated alive.<br />This film flat out rocks.  If you have any concept at all about government censure of the true nature of human experience beyond the more obvious stuff like strong indications the perpetrator has lost their moral compass, then you realize the magnitude and relevance of this film.  If you exercise self-restraint far, far beyond what you want to so you can keep your job, or your fellowship elsewhere, then this movie "Equilibrium" resounds into the marrow of your bones.<br />The John Preston character portrayed by Christian Bale is one of the best Sci-Fi / Fantasy roles ever brought to the screen.  There is no way Keanu Reeves could have pulled this role off as well.  No way.<br />This movie is said to be a primer for the "Matrix" series of films.  I just call it one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  If this movie was on the floor I'd roll all around on it like a dog trying to get the scent of a fresh kill on themselves.  This movie knocks all the others like it stone cold dead.<br />Favorite scenes?  The last 20 minutes of this film.  Oh yeah.  5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>EQUILIBRIUM (2002) is one of my most favorite Deeply Personals, thus it merits a Deeply Personal film critique. Firstly, look at this list:<br /><br />a/k/a "Cubic" - Europe<br /><br />a/k/a "Rebellion" - Japan<br /><br />a/k/a "Equilibrium - Killer of Emotions" - Germany<br /><br />You will not find another film quite so well-viewed and beloved. For good reason, mon famille....<br /><br />In the sprawling fascist city-state of Libria, the Tetragrammaton is like the commie party. Ruled by the "Father" (think Mao, Pot Pol and Saddam Hussein all rolled into one) and with the iron hand of the body of clerics, Libria is a drug-addled place. Not for fun: this drug is meant to turn them all into Vulcans. It eradicates emotional extremes (it does not eradicate emotions completely as has been wrongly stated).<br /><br />I will say I was offended by the use of the word Tetragrammaton, which in my tradition is the word representing the 72 Names of God, but oh well, it's THE MOVIES! Not theology school!<br /><br />Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale in his first and only impressive role) is forced to execute his partner, Cleric Partridge, for "sense offense"--Cleric Partridge has been reading Keats (or was it Yeats?--they read the same thing in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD). Partridge has stopped his drug intake, and he's feeling.<br /><br />Bad!<br /><br />Cleric Preston finds his world and acceptance of all things Libria is crumbling. He meets with the resistance, and the results are SLAM! BANG! Better than the comics. And that is the smooth beauty of this action-packed, philosophically charged film that to a degree influenced everything that was to follow.<br /><br />It had few predecessors, and practically no inspiration or idea-stealing. The closest thing I could ultimately find to compare to EQUILIBRIUM was GATTACA (1997) and LOGAN'S RUN (1976). Both these films are also major genre-establishers.<br /><br />I got hooked on this because of the fashion. Seriously. But also due to the fact that I also carry the title "cleric", and because we also try to eradicate strong emotions. EQUILIBRIUM explains how that is not possible, unhealthy and at the end of the day, unnatural. From the beautifully slick habit-uniforms worn by the clerics to the "gun katas", a T'ai Ch'i-like martial art of the two-handed gun (all inspiring the dreary SPIRIT a couple years ago), EQUILIBRIUM has it all.<br /><br />Taye Diggs and Angus MacFadyen are most impressive in their villainous roles, sneering and scene-chewing with the best of the chewers. The martial arts, while quite sparse, are spectacular (MacFadyen is most surprisingly gifted) and the moral-emotional tension never quits until the end.<br /><br />Well past the end, you will be thinking about this unique, thought-provoking masterpiece--and you'll wonder why they don't usually make them this good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Kurt Wimmer's stark, violent cautionary tale is set after WWIII.  Citizens are being controlled by a drug which stifles their emotions.  The government feels that without emotions, there will be no wars, no murders; they think emotions are a handicap, and they use clerics to uphold the law.  Anyone showing emotion is either killed on the spot or incinerated later.  No trials, nothing.  Of course, this means all things like literature, music, etc., are banned.<br />Christian Bale stars as the highest ranking &quot;Cleric&quot;, who enforces the law dictated by Father (Sean Pertwee).  Early in the film, Bale's partner (Sean Bean) shows evidence of having feelings, and when Bales finds him reading the poetry of Yeats, he is forced to kill him.<br />His new partner (an appropriately sniveling Taye Diggs) is excited to work with Bales, but at the same time he is more in mind.  Angus McFayden plays the chief of council, whose agenda is also more than meets the eye.<br />Bales finally decides to stop taking the daily drug doseages and is rewarded with feelings----and a threat to his life and career.<br />The battle sequences are awesome in their fluidity and imagination.  Bales and Emily Watson as doomed Mary O'Brien, are particularly good, and the movie is quite original in its take of Fahrenheit 451.<br />Gloomy yet impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Equilibrium is the type of movie I would have loved as a 13 year-old and is thus recommended to anyone who likes seeing stuff blown up/shot/cut in half/otherwise murdered, but for people who require a little more it's a noisy shoot-em-up which jettisons its ideas in favor of pyrotechnics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This futuristic film about a to the letter "cleric" (similar to 'the cleaner') who suddenly finds himself going against everything he has known.<br /><br />There is no more war in a society that is without emotion thanks to a handy dandy drug that sounds an awful lot like Prozac. All things that stir emotions, literature, art, music, color are banned and those who are caught not taking their medication or collecting emotional paraphernalia pay for it with their lives. But there is an underground movement willing to risk it.<br /><br />One day John (Christian Bale) breaks a vile of his medication and ends up not replacing the daily dosage. This leads to another day, and another day until finally he's hiding his dosages and killing his teammates to protect "sensors" (people who've stopped taking their medication and are feeling again) and lost puppies.<br /><br />It sounds a little hokey but it is an awesome movie. Beautifully shot action scenes as well as dramatic scenes. The child who plays John's son is perfect as the emotionless child willing to turn in friend or family. The film does have reminders of other movies but it really doesn't take anything away from this film.<br /><br />It was nice to see guest appearances by Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), William Fichtner (Prison Break), Taye Diggs (Private Practice) and Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love).<br /><br />This is going to be one of repeat viewing movies and is a must see film for any futurists or Christian Bale fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>I watched this movie at another persons suggestion and I am really surprised how good it is.

It came and went into the movie theaters like a hushed shadow, yet hundreds of outstanding five star reviews prove it was well received and it did not slip by silently.<br /><br />One can easily assume that Equilibrium is just another action movie, but this hybrid of marital art styles, refined weaponry and stunning fight scenes reached deeper than many movies I've seen of serious topics and non frills entertainment. This movie reminded me of movies such as Kill Bill, V for Vendetta, Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet,  yet the story and theme touched on the rawest foundations of humanity.<br /><br />In the future as wars threatened mankind , drugs replaced all feeling and emotions. There was no art, no books, no fancy clothes, only sterile solemn looking houses and no individuality whatsoever, people looked like they stepped out of an assembly line at a factory. A totalitarian society ruled by a man called Father and his high officials distributed a drug which upon injection sustained the feeling of nothingness. Amongst that society there were real people, those who hid or ran away and tired to keep some of their possessions with them, but they were at risk of an instant and brutal death if found by the Grammaton Clerics, a breed of super cops who sniff out the fugitives. It is amazing what they did in the name of peace, how many people they killed and murdered, makes on think about what is right and what is wrong but carries a good name.<br /><br />One day John Preston (Christian Bale) skips a dose and notices undesirable to him effects taking place. He uses his excellent combat skills to trace reasons of why he should not take it and of what the truth really holds. The story as far fetches as it was, was fun and witty and did not take a trilogy to portray it's message. It was a scary glimpse into the world where all feeling and emotions were suppressed, and when I left my boyfriends house after watching it I thought that the air never smelled so good and the world never looked so fresh before. It made me value the kind of freedom I complain about daily, as non perfect as it is, it sure is better than the life Preston had.<br /><br />There were many twists and turns to the story, secret traitors and hidden agendas and I loved solving it with Preston.  The icing on the cake was the fighting, especially when he used his guns as swords, I real treat to watch! This is a must have movie in anyone's library, especially for action buffs!<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This film is a great action film, a must see if you love fight sceens.  A film that slipped by most radars in late 2002, Christian Bale (Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, the Machinist, American Psycho) plays a Graviton Cleric, a futeristic officer used to enfore the laws against sense crimes.  This movie is based off a "1984" plot in a post WWIII world in which people take a drug, prozium, to prevent feelings.  It also has the "Father" government figure as well.  It also carries a flavor of Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 as well.  Although this plot has been used and abused in the past, and again can be tiresome in this film, the action sceens in this film toast any prior film like this.  It starts off with arguably one of the best gun encounters in any movie, and goes on from there. The final scenerio is something that makes any guy feel like a ten year old, wanting to imitate the moves that the cleric does.  The camera work was also well done, and the sets were nice, not overdone with to much computer backgrounds.  Christian Bale plays the part exceptionally well, and Taye Diggs does fair as far as the action, but fails on the flattness of Affect needed in this role. His acting did seem to give the plot away early if you pick up on the hints quickly.  So if you want to see a good action movie, this is a must see. I believe it was this role that landed Christian Bale his role in Batman Begins, so if you like Batman, then you'll definitely like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is about a futuristic world in which a totalitarian regime has created a &quot;perfect society&quot; by suppressing emotions and banning ownership of bad things like books, art, and music. If you have a feeling you are guilty of a crime punishable by death. All the citizens take a mood-limiting drug to go along with the constant brain-washing providing by the single media source and keep everybody in place. Then we have the government officials who are charged with destroying those &quot;sense offenders&quot; who resist the rules, one of whom is one of the chief &quot;clerics,&quot; John Preston (Christian Bale).<br /><br /> To anyone who has read Ray Bradbury's classic dystopian novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; the plot line of Kurt Wimmer's 2002 film is familiar. But instead of taking the simple idea of banning books to a logical extreme, Wimmer's world goes for absolutely everything. This means that for the first half of &quot;Equilibrium&quot; I was having a hard time finding mine because I could not believe that the world could really get that far. By what logic do you throw out Da Vinci's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, that gets rid of both the Sex Pistols and Ludwig von Beethoven, and prohibits everything from snow globes to puppy dogs? Then, on top of everything, you adopt a symbol that is about a close to a swastika as you can get, like this would also be a good thing in a brave new world.<br /><br /> The assumption has always been that it is the conservatives who are going to turn fascist while the liberals are becoming communists, so for the sake of this film we have to believe in a world where conservatives give up religion, forgo any attempts at Vulcan philosophy and take drugs to curb all feelings (Preston is a &quot;cleric&quot; but there are no signs of anything like a religion beyond the cult like obedience to &quot;Father,&quot; this world's version of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; and the tendency to burn people alive as punishment, which may just be another homage to Bradbury). The point is to curb emotions, yet it would the anger of the righteous that would even attempt to spawn this sort of world in the first place. You tell me that Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) is not angry and having other feelings when he he finds out what Preston is really up to. The man SMILES; should they not be shooting everybody who smiles?<br /><br /> Of course this film has to do with Preston, who like Bradbury's Montag becomes intrigued by all that society denies him and then tries to defy the system he has upheld. This is where things get interesting because Preston might be alone but he has the strength of ten men. Well, actually, he acts more like Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies. You can surround this guy with storm troopers holding guns to his head and he will kill them all. The fights are apparently are example of &quot;Gun-Kata,&quot; that is to say &quot;a martial art completely based around guns,&quot; and they are rather impressive, even by &quot;Matrix&quot; standards. Just do not ask me why anybody needs this much martial arts and weaponry training in a world of drug-induced stupors.<br /><br /> So the trick with &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is to balance the political position of the dystopian elements with the action sequences, in an apparent attempt to keep two very different types of audiences separate. It is rather difficult to enjoy the choreography of the gun battles while trying to deal with the deep philosophical issues that film is trying to raise in between the fights. In the end, what redeems this film somewhat is the end game, where Wimmer's film actually ups the ante and throws in enough twists and turns to make it really interesting. But even then if you do not see the about Father's identity coming then you do not know your classic films and the final sequence says to me that Wimmer is only pretending that he is trying to play on a higher level.</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>i'm surprised this movie didn't have a big theatrical release. the action, while completly implaussible, was very cool. the scenery was very good looking. it has logic holes, but all action movies do.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I just saw &quot;Hulk&quot; today and I felt a bit depressed since it didn't live up to my expectations of what a good action movie should be.

The last comparable B Sci-Fi movie was "Imposter". <p>Plot: In the future, there is no war and everyone takes a drug to quell their feelings, so everyone lives in a nice orderly society. Stopping your dosage or possessing banned items warrants execution. There is an underground that fights, occasionally blowing up a pharmacuetical facility and our main character gets involved with taking on the society's high cabal. So it's kind of a cross between the movie "1984" and a B version of the Matrix (it is loosely comparable). There could have been more done with Equilibrium than this, but it's a good movie. The fight scenes are cool and at times the acting was very well done, especially on Bale's part. The same rigidity that flowed for the character of "American Psycho" comes back with this non-feeling enforcer who finds humanity and realizes he is a mass-murderer. The story is somewhat empty in that, it's difficult to believe that a whole society could be so brainwashed as to be totally drugged, obedient and willing in the first place to implement such measures, but on the otherhand if I look around these days...</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>The distributor for &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533;, a modestly budgeted sci-fi thriller, had so little faith in it that it placed the film in just a few theaters in December, then let it die. One reason may be the title itself. In restaurants, some people are afraid to order a dish they can&#65533;t pronounce. These same people tend to avoid movies whose titles they can&#65533;t spell, pronounce and/or understand. Beyond that, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two other recent thrillers &#65533; &#65533;AI: Artificial Intelligence&#65533; and &#65533;Minority Report&#65533; &#65533; had already painted much richer and more elaborate portraits of life in the future. Finally, unlike other small sci-fi flicks like &#65533;Gattaca&#65533;, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; unwisely uses too much energy on special effects and not enough on the story, which might have been interesting if it hadn&#65533;t been overwhelmed. <p>In this vision of the future, a third world war has resulted in a totalitarian society where all material things which cause people to feel emotion have been banned. People are also medicated daily to prevent them from feeling the anger and frustration which the government claims leads to war. Anyone who resists is dealt with immediately and harshly. Large SWAT teams swoop down on groups of resistors every day. In other words, this is a society that is continuously at war with war. <p>This plot concept, which isn&#65533;t wholly original, could have proved fascinating, but it is clumsily handled and full of holes. The highlight is  Christian Bale&#65533;s carefully orchestrated performance as Cleric John Preston, a high ranking member of the group responsible for enforcing the regime&#65533;s draconian measures. Preston, at first a totally unemotional man, ultimately sees the absurdity of his job and becomes a member of the resistance. <p>While not a noteworthy film, &#65533;Equilibrium&#65533; should provide many sci-fi fans with an enjoyable evening. It certainly isn&#65533;t the worst movie of it type, but it could have been so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>I don't like to write reviews about the movie itself.

In this one, John Preston (Christian Bale) is a member of the Tetragrammaton, a sort of secret police-style organization dedicated to the stamping out of anything in society that causes people to feel emotion (in the opening scene, for example, Preston and crew destroy the Mona Lisa). Preston and his partner Partridge (The Dark's Sean Bean) are Clerics, members of the inner Tetragrammaton circle, and rigorously screened to be above suspicion; Preston, however, discovers that Partridge has kept back a piece of contraband from a recent raid, a book of Yeats' poetry. Preston is forced to execute Partridge, and soon gets his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be even more fanatical than Preston. Preston, though, has his own secret: he's stopped taking the drug that blocks emotion, the drug that the entire society takes. And maybe emotions aren't quite as awful as he's always thought...<br /><br />The thing that stands out about Equilibrium at first glance is the cast, which contains a stable of incredible B-list stars--Bale, Bean, Diggs, Emily Watson, William Fichtner, Dominic Purcell, Sean Pertwee, John Keogh, Angus McFadyen, and more. Which is good, because Kurt Wimmer, writer of such classic film adaptations as Sphere and The Thomas Crown Affair and director of the immortal Milla Jovovich film Ultraviolet (just in case you didn't catch it, the first half of this sentence is rather heavy with sarcasm), is neither a good enough writer nor a good enough director to make this into the truly excellent movie it could have been. The strength of the cast saves it from being as horrible as The Matrix, but it does rely far too heavily on staged action sequences. There is a surprising amount of character development here, and it's very nicely acted, though it'd be nice if it were better-paced or had a slightly stronger plot to hang on. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying, well, maybe more than it should. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Well, World War III has happened once again, this time causing government to crush all human emotion in order to control society and eliminate further war, crime, etc. A special breed of super-cops is established to make sure that everyone remains numb and takes their Prozium? (emotion eradicating drug). All is fine until one such enforcer (Christian Bale from The Machinist, Harsh Times, American Psycho, etc.) misses his daily dose, causing his mind to clear and his emotions to activate. This leads him into a career-ruining journey of self-disovery, a true spiritual awakening, oh yeah, and several  wonderful displays of the old ultra-violence! EQUILIBRIUM deserves a top spot in the dystopian movie universe, along w/ 1984, FERENHEIT 451, BRAZIL, V FOR VENDETTA, THE MATRIX, METROPOLIS, BLADERUNNER, and other classics.

It's wonderful. A broad science fiction thriller in a classic vein, Equilibrium takes a respectable stab at a Fahrenheit 451-like cautionary fable. The story finds Earth's post-World War III humankind in a state of severe emotional repression: If no one feels anything, no one will be inspired by dark passions to attack their neighbors. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer's monochromatic, Metropolis-influenced cityscape provides an excellent backdrop to the heavy-handed mission of John Preston, a top cop who busts &quot;sense offenders&quot; and crushes sentimental, sensual, and artistic relics from a bygone era. Predictably, Preston becomes intrigued by his victims and that which they die to cherish; he stops taking his mandatory, mood-flattening drug and is even aroused by a doomed prisoner. The action scenes are extrordinary. This film is so underated, it's unbelievably good. See this.

Christian Bale does a good job portraying a &quot;Cleric&quot;, an enforcer charged with rooting out people who still have outlawed emotions or materials deemed offensive (hmm, kind of like John Ashcroft, but Clerics blow up statues instead of cover their boobies). But the real attraction are the action scenes...WOW!! They are really good, real &quot;Matrix&quot; quality. The fight scene at the end blew me away, incredible!<p>Buy this film, an action film for the thinking man.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>P>Equilibrium features a terrific premise: the film is set sometime after WWIII (the year is unspecified) in a city called Libria, which is headed by a man called "Father" (Sean Pertwee), who only appears to the citizens via hologram.  All citizens are required to take a daily dose of prozium, a drug that dulls the emotions, which is what's believed to be the source of man's inhumanity to man.  To ensure people continue their dosage, examples are made by law enforcers called clerics.  These clerics are warrirors trained in a unique style called gun-kata, which teaches the fighter to stand in the position where they're least likely to be hit by enemy fire and to use a gun as an extension of the fighter itself.  In the opening scene, we see how such a concept works.<p>But similar to Logan's Run, our hero, cleric John Preston (Christian Bale), comes through an awakening when he misses his dose.  He experiences emotions for the first time and finds himself conflicted with everything he'd believed in and fought for and what he now believes is the right thing to do.  He wants to contact and join the rebel forces against "Father," but finds this isn't an easy task, especially with his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), watching his every move and a massive army backing "Father."<p>Equilibrium is a film that can be viewed as thought-provoking entertainment.  Writer/director Kurt Wimmer conveys this emotionless world with great attention to minute details (I never noticed the cars were entirely white, even inside, until my second viewing), incredible sets and production values that display the sterile feel of the environment.  Whoever constructed the sets should be applauded, especially considering the modest budget the film had to work with.  The  look and feel of this city, along with Preston's erupting emotions, are nicely backed by Klaus Badelt's brooding score.<p>Simultaneously, the film has an utterly fabulous story, engrossing in its ability to convince you of this terrifying future and take you along for the ride beside our protagonist.  Are there plot holes?  Yes, but none that couldn't be reasonably explained, which means they're closer to being contrivances.  For instance, the soldiers Preston face obviously display some fear, but I think prozium is only a suppressant; it doesn't completely rid the person of emotions.  Plus, when someone has a shotgun pointed straight at his face, it'd be pretty difficult not to show some concern.<p>Much of what makes Equilibrium's story so suspenseful is it's unpredictability; Wimmer is so skillful in his delivery that it isn't until the conclusion we figure out the surprises and it's revealed who truly has the upper hand in this constantly twisting plot (possible spoiler: I will say this, I am quite glad the villains didn't turn out as dumb as they may have initially seemed).<p>Equilibrium's future claim to fame will be the gun-kata sequences, which are, for lack of a better word, breathtaking.  There are other terms I could use; innovative, exhilarating, exciting, thrilling, heart-pounding, but I think breathtaking most accurately captures the complete surprise and delight I felt while watching the film (on the big screen, no less).  There are five sequences that display gun-kata (along with two "ordinary" gun battles, a well-done sparring sequence, and some terrific swordplay), and each setpiece almost always tops the one that came before it in both innovation and excitment.  I hesitate to go further, as I feel your enjoyment will be heightened if you don't know exactly how the action plays out (suffice to say the one-on-one jaw-dropping climactic duel is, bar none, the best fight scene I've seen all decade long).  <p>Of course, as with almost all thrillers, action sequence only take up a minor portion of the running time (in this case, about twenty minutes in all, still a hefty amount, with a large portion of that in the climax).  So what keeps our attention to the screen isn't just the story, the stylish cinematography and production design, but also the performances.  At the center of the story is Christian Bale, an always superb actor who delivers one of his best performances as Preston.  This immensely difficult role is made entirely believable and moving by Bale, whose captivating turn ensures we have a rooting interest from beginning to end.<p>Taye Diggs doesn't get the opportunity to shine nearly as much as Bale, but is solid as Brandt, though his constant smiling has been a source of complaint.  (spoiler) By the end of the film, it's still questionable whether or not he was taking prozium. He is Dupont's underling, which suggests he, too, might not have been taking his prozium.  Emily Watson is good, though underused, as Mary O'Brien, a woman Preston takes interest in.  William Fichtner has an intriguing role as a somewhat mysterious but passionate rebel leader and Angus Mcfadyen is suitably chilling as the head cleric Dupont.<p>Equilibrium's action sequences have raised the bar for future competition, and not even the just released The Matrix Reloaded can compete (not that their action is similar) with what Wimmer has crafted.  But just as important, the movie engages our mind, our emotions, and pulls us through all 107 minutes without a hiccup in pacing or momentum.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The cataclysm wrought by a third world war at the onset of the 21st century has forced the surviving world to abopt a new form of government to prevent the obliteration of the planet.  In the Kurt Wimmer written and directed intense sci-fi thriller "Equilibrium" the society known as Libria suppresses the act of feeling in its inhabitants.  With the aid of a drug Prozium, which all citizens inject at regular intervals, all emotions and feelings are quashed.  A vast militaristic organization has been created to root out any undesirables that don't follow these societal tenets.  At the apex of the enforcement arm are the Gramatan clerics, a group of super martial arts practitioners.<br /><br />Christian Bale stars as John Preston the most highly ranked Cleric with unsurpassed fighting skills.  Pure of thought and uncompromising, Bale and his partner Errol Partridge, played by Sean Bean comb the nether regions outside the city for rebels and to destroy any artifacts that could promote emotion and feelings.  His unflagging loyalty to societal head, Father played by Sean Pertwee is shaken when he is forced to kill Bean who has committed an unspeakable sensory crime.<br /><br />Bale purposely avoids dosing himself with Prozium which clears his mind and allows him to reconsider the jaded mores of the society.  Working with an ambitious and suspicious new partner Brandt played by Taye Diggs, he secretly joins forces with the underground while appearing to stalk them, striving to topple the gonernment.<br /><br />The underrated "Equilibrium" plays like a cross between "Brave New World" and "The Matrix" and compares quite favorably with the later.  Impressive action sequences filled with incredible gunplay propels the film forward, creating an exhilarating viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A conceptual Christian Bale sci-fi vehicle that can't quite commit to its one primary plot point. It's the future, and we're living in a totalitarian regime thanks to a government-mandated drug that saps humanity of its ability to feel. Bale plays the cold, emotionless head of the gestapo, responsible for tracking and exterminating the few remaining shreds of liberal thought in the wild. Curiously, after incinerating every shred of artwork, poetry and literature he can find, this super-cop then retires to his ornately decorated office where a big show is made of the beautiful architecture and lavish sculptural decorations. The story's failure to comply with its own focal point doesn't end there, as Bale's coworkers and bosses are surprisingly animated and emotive for men supposedly removed from their own feelings. The plot offers no revelations, with the protagonist stomping through a shallow character arc and an overly simple, black-and-white evaluation of the grand scheme. There's fruit to be harvested here, but Equilibrium is either too short or too lazy to reach for it. A few very good action scenes (leading to an unusually high body count) are its only saving grace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Silly, predictable, seriously flawed, with moments that are outright laughable, Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark, stylistic Orwellian drama.<br /><br />In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to "Big Brother"), emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime, punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art, music, literature, friendship, love and everything else that makes life worth living.  Wisely, there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to "live."  Among them, Emily Watson's saintly, emotional Mary O'Brien.  These folk are, naturally, hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics, that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.<br /><br />Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study.  One witnesses in anticipation as, throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as, for the first time, Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma.  Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him, but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.<br /><br />Director, Kurt Wimmer, in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job, has created an entire new, faux martial arts: "Gun-Kata."  Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on "a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range" combined with mathematics, etc.  At first, it is almost painfully hilarious to watch, but give in and it achieves a type of anime, hyper realistic that can only be described as "wicked cool!"<br /><br />Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after "Father" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering.<br /><br />Like a great conductor, Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless, choral based soundtrack, jumps every hurdle and flaw, delivering a terrific movie full of action, meaning and emotion.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Thankfully the DVD has been a top seller and everybody (including me) is discovering this gem of a film. Christian Bale is one of our top young actors. Just watch his performances in The Machinist, American Psycho, Batman Begins and one of the best child performances of all time in Empire of the Sun. Everything in this film fits perfectly. The futuristic style, brooding score and unique action scenes are fresh in a genre full of sameness. Equilibrium may bare resemblance to Gattaca and 1984, but it's like those films on steroids. And by the way, Gun Kata is about the coolest style of fighting ever created for a film. I really hope they make Equilibrium 2, but after seeing Ultraviolet (by the same director) I think a sequel will only diminish this already cult classic. They don't need to go The Matrix route.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In a futuristic world, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it. "Equilibrium" is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters in this movie. "Equilibrium" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well. It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Equilibrium is a movie that follows in the footsteps of the Matrix, yet is better than its predecessor in every possible way. The acting is excellent notably by Christian Bale, who isa much better actor than Keannu Reeves. Bale should have been Neo. It would have been a much better movie. The plot of Equilibrium is better and the fights are even better! The plot of this movie is thought provoking, very original and very memorable. The movie is set in the future in a very change world after World War III. In this future, feelings of any kind are outlawed as are objects that provoke feelings. Everyone injects themselves so that they never feel. Christian Bale plays a cop that finds sense offenders and arrests them. But this world is depressing and weird. Christian Bale's character can't take it anymore and becomes the leader of the rebellion against this world.<br /><br />The movie is very moving and interesting, and the fight scenes are absolutely amazing. The final fight is AWESOME and very memorable!<br /><br />This movie is worth a buy thanks to the amazing fights and the memoralbe story! This movie IS better than the Matrix in every possible way and I strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good action/ sci fi movie. It has some of the most memorable fighting scenes ever and everything just seems to click in this awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Futuristic?

Brave New World, 1984, Brazil, Total Recall, the Running Man, Terminator, and so many others. The basic crime here is to feel. How can we get rid of feelings in order to guarantee social peace and complete control of everyone and everything? The question is the answer.<br /><br />A drug will do the job everyday and destroying anything that could resemble any feeling or their carriers will do the job every night, and we are covered day and night. But what happens in any society? Some do not like drugs and compulsory acts. So they rebel and they stop taking their drugs. And that is called the resistance.<br /><br />In Brave New World they are tolerated in some human reservation, but in this world they are underground and have to fight against the official society overground. And there will always be one secret agent of the feeling police who will rebel one day and will get in touch with the resistance and will be the instrument of the end of this world. That's part of life and no one can prevent it.<br /><br />So the film is a little bit na?ve on the means with which one man, even a cleric of super power and strength, can succeed in killing dozens of trained soldiers in about two minutes without even getting a rip in his coat. It yells impossible but we are a good audience and we suspend our disbelief long enough to know that this rebellion is absolutely possible and that it exists in any totalitarian system.<br /><br />The only pass&eacute; element is that the power of "free" information is not captured in this film which is already old and cannot know the power of the new medium called the Internet and the way even the best kept secrets in the world can be made public tomorrow morning by Wikileaks or any other eaves dropping site.<br /><br />But apart from that it is an entertaining film and I like the dog, the mongrel, the BO of this film that was made even before that famous BO was elected President of the United States who brought a dog named Bo into the White House along with two young girls.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Equilibrium:<br />Sci Fi/Action.

The martial arts and special effects were lame but the acting is good thanks to Bale (but he wears too much make-up). The middle of the movie is the best, especially that adorable pup. Overall, I found this sci-fi flick a snoozer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>I read all the underground buzz about this film being a neglected scifi film that was excellent. I remember such films as Dark City and Donnie Darko receiving the same acclaim and to that I decided why not discover another unknown film to add to my collection and spread the good news about to others. Maybe I was a bit too hyped over it, maybe I expected more gun fights, or maybe it was the all too similar aspects between this and the Matrix that leads me to say it may not be all it's hyped up to be.<p>The action IS really cool but don't expect alot of it, I did enjoy that it wasn't all karate like most action films today, it reminded me of the gun totin days of Chow Yun Fat in such films as Hard Boiled and The Killer. It certainly follows the Matrix formula. Philosophy + Action + SciFi = ??? Well I don't know what it comes out too, it certainly takes after such books as Brave New World and Farenheit 451. At times it works but with such scenes as the puppy scene you wonder if their trying too hard to make us understand what it is to FEEL. <p>The acting was decent although inconsistent. If the Cleric (and everyone else) do not know emotion. How come Tay Diggs grins through out the whole movie, I wanted to slap him and say "Hey your not supposed to feel emotion dummy stop smiling!" Last time I checked, anger, wit, and suspsicion, are all EMOTIONS. The acting is not at all consistent with the idea of having no emotion. Even the villian shows anger, which again, is an emotion. Maybe their was too much Dashboard Confessional played on the set, who knows. Those little things did bother me but if you ignore them than the few moments of genius matched with the few and far between action sequences (which are very cool) than you have a decent movie that in no way matches the wit of Donnie Darko, or the gothic atmospher of Dark City, and let's face it steals alot of it's look from every scifi movie ever made.<p>A noteworthy mention is a really great audio commentary by Director Kurt Wimmer. He honestly and boldly confronts all the criticism he's heard about the movie and even admits to many of the mistakes he made in the film. He addresses alot of my concerns with the logic of the no emotion thing and after hearing his explanation for them they don't seem to  bother me as much (Tay diggs smiling, the villian gettin angry). It's a great commentary for would-be film makers because he focuses on his first  time directing and the techniques he used. It's one of the most earnest and humbling commentaries I've heard in awhile and it's definetly worth hearing. (Unlike most directors  who seem full of themselves)<p>It's worth watching at least once, but don't go in expecting to "Forget the Matrix" as the cover suggests. It's decent SciFi and I will enjoy it on repeat viewings despite it's flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>A dark and futuristic thriller, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a clever and convincing addition to the somewhat tired and repetitive science-fiction genre. <p>In a flawed society after World War III, emotion and feeling are considered the proeminent elements that lead to the collapse and fall of social order, control and organization. So, the best way to avoid a disastrous scenario is to block or destroy any kind of emotion, building an apathetic, controlled and obedient society. <p>Christian Bale plays a special agent whose mission is to kill anyone who dares to defy the rules and actually gets to feel anything, and his task is well suceeded until a point where he starts questioning his system. <p>Director Kurt Wimmer manages to combine diverse references, from George Orwell`s &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; or &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and delivers a consistent and gripping sci-fi thriller, even if its premise isn`t all that innovative. The futuristic society is dark and gloomy as it should, the atmosphere of the movie is dense and claustrophobical enough, the fight scenes are well directed and the plot presents some creativity (the ending, however, is a bit predictable, simplistic and anti-climatic). <p>&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is also a one-man show, where Christian Bale shows (again) that he is an enticing and credible actor, adding depth and presence to a character that could easily have been a cardboard tough guy. <p>Although it`s not as challenging as some of its influences, this cinematic experience is still a strong effort and an unexpected surprise worth discovering.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Given the very poor overall quality of sci-fi movies released every year, maybe I don't have the right to complain about Equilibrium. After all, it's a well-made, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi movie in the finest tradition of the `highest' prototype of the genre, with some great design ideas and highly impressive action scenes. And, to tell the truth. I quite enjoyed it. It sure was better than the Matrix Revolutions. It strikes me as peculiar, though, that with so many great sci-fi novels lying around just waiting to be adapted, this movie ever needed to be made. The plot of Equilibrium is so incredibly trite and predictable, I can practically spot which novel each aspect of it was taken from. Most of all it owes incredible amounts to 1984, while the fight scenes are inspired directly by The Matrix. The plot twists are predictable, and the ending immensely disappointing. There were more than a few 1984 rip-offs made before; check out Terry Gilliam's Brazil for one that managed to stay fresh and original. Equilibrium, on the other hand, makes no new statement and thus fails to justify its existence.<p>A few words of praise, though, should go to the lead actors. Christian Bale is great in the main part, but I was more impressed with supporting actors Emily Watson and Sean Bean - Sean delivered a short performance, but nevertheless it was the best part of the movie. It can be safely said the story becomes more boring and more predictable as the story goes on, the deterioration beginning with the death of Bean's character, and hitting rock bottom with that of Watson's. The ending in particular is rushed, unconvincing and unimpressive. Matthew Harbour as Bale's son is especially wasted, as are all the lead villain characters. The final showdown is far too short and the happy ending too strained; it almost seems as if the last twenty minutes were glued on, like the fabricated happy ending Brazil got in its US version. Still, good acting, good photography, good pace (for the first hour and a half) and terrific fighting choreography make Equilibrium a nice watch. If you're a fan of the genre it's worth renting, but don't expect too much of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Can one be loyal to the Matrix...<br />in n reruns?<br />Yes, this is a future mind control<br />film patterned on the Matrix.<br />Only the world isn't virtual<br />and the low is drug induced<br />not plugged in.<br />Worlds where revolt is by a "super hero"<br />who is the savior.<br />In the true future I think we will all be our own priests<br />and saviors and I doubt<br />that as tempting as killing evil seems,<br />that is the solution.<br />Rome was brought to an end by<br />Christians who were not above being eaten by lions<br />in the coliseum.<br />The eastern martial arts...in a anti-utopia?!</p></br><a href="../users/APW72P4COWTBK.html">APW72P4COWTBK</a><br/><p>Everything in this movie was perfect for a WILD action film!!

Though we all agreed that the action scenes were incredibly done, I found them out of place in this film. The premise regarding a world free of emotion, if executed better, could've been interesting, but, by the end, "Equilibrium" left me unconvinced about its points.<p>Christian Bale plays John Preston, a law enforcement officer who goes about assuring that everyone in society is without emotion. The society controls the emotional responses of its people through drugs and use of the martial arts. (The martial arts in the film, used with guns in a stunning, if bafflingly incoherent, provide its best effects.) Preston, over time, begins skipping his treatments, though he's initially a stalwart in favor of the old system. <p>As he develops emotions, in scenes that aren't quite convincing because actors pretending not to convey emotions come off as wooden (whether or not it's a plot device), Preston begins fighting the establishment, caring for his kids and caring for his old partner's lover, a renegade art-lover played by Emily Watson. (I'm not entirely sure if this is supposed to be some sidebar love story, for it's hard to be convinced when Christian Bale doesn't play up emotions in this, or any, regard.)<p>The movie lost me with its use of the cute puppy dog. Bale finds that, with emotions, he can't shoot the poor thing in the head, even though it's required of his job. Instead of shooting the dog, though, he guns down about 15 men trying to kill the dog. Where's the emotion and morality in that? One cute dog we can't kill, but let's violently dispatch a whole bunch of people because they don't have emotions and want to kill us. It's weirdly uneven, and the scene of him gunning down the people, then embracing the furry creature and crying is just silly.<p>Don't waste your time. Though it's action-packed and sorta has a moral point to it, it's unconvincing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>The thing I couldn't get past with this movie was the premise.  It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the "books are banned" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  Only there, the premise worked.  Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.<br /><br />I couldn't buy this for a second.  According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets.  In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban.  Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie:  antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?<br /><br />Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>Special effects might be good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 3 years + So so acting + Typical plot = Not good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Falls apart early on when Preston says "I beg your pardon?"

Strictly for the young, dumb and full of...er, rum.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Equilibrium is a movie that, let me say, I love.  I happen to be a fan of dark futures in science fiction, either on the printed page or on the big screen.  The fact that ideas and emotions are dangerous to men is nothing new.  The fact that this movie took an almost Buddhism goal, to control feelings, to the point where this future society is out to destroy those who feel emotions is, in itself, fascinating.  The balance between plot and characters, between action and story, is almost perfect.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and even Sean Bean are all great in the parts they were given.  I can't see any other actors doing those characters.  The commentaries, one by the director and one by both the director and the producer, really are interesting.  Beginning film makers would more likely get more out of the commentaries than I did.<br /><br />The idea that by destroying emotions you could better the world is, once again, not new.  In WE the Benefactor's goal, with the help of the Office of Guardians, was to destroy feelings and replace it with Reason (people didn't even have names).  To control emotions with drugs and brainwashing, such as in Brave New World and 1984 with its idea of Hate Crime and Thought Police, is well used in many films and books.  Burning the books, artwork, toys and music comes right out of Fahrenheit 451.  Even in Fahrenheit 451 there is many forms of brainwashing.<br /><br />But this movie is not trying to steal from these sources.  Any more than the reason for writing 1984 was to steal from WE (which is did).  The movie's goal was to tell us how important being HUMAN is.  Some people might say that idea is old yet we still don't seem to understand the need for staying human.  The warning will always need to be there.  And with such a delivery system as this film it can't fail to be passed on to the viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>What is "Equilibrium"?<br /><br />Take equal portions of "1984", "Fahrenheit 451", "Brave New World", and "THX1138", throw in some generous servings of gunkata and wire-fu, add a dollop of the twin-Desert Eagle-wielding whirling dervish of destruction that is Christian Bale's Grammaton Cleric, and you have the shiny-happy-people-holding-hands world that is "Equilibrium."<br /><br />Yeah, it's derivative. Sure, it's fluffy. But boy oh boy is it fun to watch, and if there's a moral to this story, it's this: sometimes the best thing to do is to self-medicate.<br /><br />It is 2172 in the Republic of Libria, and the future's so bright we've *all* gotta wear shades---and take our Meds.<br /><br />But it's a fragile future: all citizens maintain a constant dose of the wonder drug Prozium, taken at regular intervals and available at Equilibrium distribution centers throughout the City. Prozium induces a perfectly level emotional state, flattening the mountains and filling the valleys. Prozium lets you cope, Citizen.<br /><br />It's your restroom break, and a jackbooted black-visored thug in full battle dress with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper is gonna give you a little escort to the potty. Your reaction? No worries. Told to stomp puppies in the street or club baby harp seals to death? No worries.<br /><br />You get to spend most of your day gazing up at the huge, bloated, godlike head of Sean Pertwee ("Father", Equilibrium's economy-class rendition of Big Brother) blaring away at you 24/7. Your reaction? Hey man, it's cool.<br /><br />Yup: Prozium is a real wonder-drug. And if you miss your dosage? See those big guys in the leather trenchcoats with the black-visored helmets and the itchy trigger fingers?<br /><br />Of course, there is another way: go off the Prozium, quit cold turkey, begin to feel, start an art collection. Trouble is, government in the world of Equilibrium doesn't come calling with public donations to your arts foundation or underground symphony.<br /><br />They come with a Death Squad.<br /><br />They send in Society's ultimate weapon: the Disciples of the Tetragrammaton---the Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton Clerics let the shock troops do all the initial wetwork and perimeter-securing, stride into the dark little warrens where you and your Picasso-loving rebel scum are hiding, show off their astounding Gunkata (a discipline where the adept wields his weapons in mathematically and geometrically precise sweeps and arcs designed to maximize carnage on the enemy and minimize damage to the Cleric. It's neat. Where do I sign up?), provide you with about 300 extra air-holes free of charge, and then pay you and your "Feelings" the ultimate compliment: they introduce a little napalm and chordite appliqu&eacute; to your bootleg copy of the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />That sounds pretty harsh, you might say. And I might say: consider the alternative: the brutal b*tch for humanity that was the 20th century. Father would back me up, citizen. Mankind nearly didn't survive. We made it through four World Wars, nuclear apocalypse, mass murder, environmental catastrophe, ecological collapse, mass genocide and ethnic cleansing, even 24-hour Jerry Springer episodes.<br /><br />Prozium is far better than the alternative. The problem starts when Grammaton Cleric Preston (Bale, who is so good he makes you cares despite the overall silliness) goes off his meds.<br /><br />Alright: first off, I was told "Equilibrium" was a mind-f*ck flick: much like the Matrix. I expected that Bale's character, once off the drug, would start realizing that something truly horrible was up---like, you know, when Rowdy Roddy Piper in "They Live" when Piper puts on the shades and realizes the yuppies are actually revolting outer-space monsters with meaty, veiny heads. Something like that.<br /><br />I thought maybe Bale would discover that Libria was ruled by giant carnivorous pink lemurs, or that the citizens of Libria were actually being forced to eat their own snot while Father took pictures and laughed.<br /><br />Nothing at all like that, I'm afraid. Bale wakes up, starts grooving on fine art and getting down with his erstwhile buddy Partridge(another great, grounded performance by Sean Bean)'s sudden interest in the poetry of Yeats, and starts to feel. You can probably connect the dots and fill in the plot from there.<br /><br />But that said, "Equilibrium"---which doesn't have an original bone in its sleek little body---entertains. Director Kurt Wimmer has certainly added something to the bubbling cauldron of cultural Cool with Gunkata: even if it's not a real martial art, it should be. I'd take lessons.<br /><br />The acting is the glue that holds the flick together: Bale is astonishingly good here and provides the movie with so much gravity that it seems more profound than it actually is. Good job! Sean Bean is equally excellent: the two make such a convincingly formidable duo that a `twist' 15 minutes into the film is actually compelling. I've never been a big Angus Macfadyen (Dupont; the actor was Robert the Bruce in "Braveheart") fan: he doesn't give me any reasons to start here. Maybe it's the weak chin and the pouty face.<br /><br />And the movie looks absolutely awesome: the firefights are great, the choreography is stunning, Kurt Wimmer keeps the pacing so tight that even as the wheels come off the wagon and the seams start showing, you're just so overloaded you don't notice. As for the film's big `message': is Utopia worth the emotional price?<br /><br />I don't know about that, and I don't know that I care. Things blowing up? Check! Christian Bale looking hip and sleek as he robs Neo's wardrobe? Check! Lots of wire-fu and gunkata-fu? Check and check! Hip white cadillac with white interior you get to drive if you make it through Grammaton Cleric training? Big check.<br /><br />Dose up on your Interval---or hey, go the cold turkey art-appreciation route and don't---and check "Equilibrium" out.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>Fans of futuristic action will not be disappointed with this film; While it offers some of the most memorable gunfights in recent cinema history, it also boasts great perrformances; As usual, Christian Bale brings credibility to a film that could go so wrong in another actor's hands; You read his anguish in his face, his clenching jaw...he puts himself emotionally into his role and sells it. Taye Diggs hits all the right marks as Bale's partner, and Watson is great for the little screen time shes given. Too bad Sean Bean wasn't used more...This movie could have been extremely silly, but the people involved cared enough to make it both a film with action and depth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Not sure where the lines of emulation and outright plagiarism comes into play, but mine is not to reason why...I just watch.  A futuristic tale is in the strong shadow of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 411, so strong, that you wonder why they just did not call it an outright remake.  Equilibrium is set in the post World War III era, where they evidently watched Star Trek one time too many and bought into Doctor Spock's lack of emotion is superior to human emotions.  To see this robot-state exists, where all emotions are suppressed, the government ruthlessly removes anything to provoke feelings.  In Bradbury's tales it was books - Fahrenheit 411 being the temperature at which paper burns.  In this movie, it's anything that provokes passion, senses.  Books, Grand Masters' paintings...even puppies.<br /><br />It's beautifully lensed, and writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives you a pinch of this and a dram of that, blending a Metropolis and Fahrenheit 411 feel to paint this bleak picture of the possible future.  Christian Bale (Reign of Fire) turns in a strong performance as the dispassionless top cop, who busts the "sense offenders" It's no surprise when the work eventually gets to him, and a gentle fuzzy puppy breaks through his already cracking resolve, setting him off in a near one man crusade to make change.  His performance is a tour de force, raising the movie to a<br /><br />stronger level than the basic premise.  His cold, emotionless, mood-flattened state, perpetuated by required drugs, is dead bang on target.  Equally, he convinces you he is a man with a mission, and you feel his near agony, as he is flooded with feeling once again.<br /><br />High marks on the visual blocking of the film and the evocative sets that set the tone for the whole film.</p></br></body></html>

I love "The Rock" but most video game flicks just don't turn out that great. Surprisingly, I think I liked this film as well as the AVP series and at least as well as "The Rock's" other films. It's not a masterpiece like "Predator" or "Alien" but it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />SOME CONTENT NOTES:<br />I've only seen the unrated version, so I can't comment on the theatrical. I can tell discerning viewers that the violence is pretty extreme (like the game, it involves chainsaws, giant guns and all kinds of impalement and dismemberment) the language is pretty heavy (though not pervasively so) and there is a scene of unneeded nudity involving one of the infected. I understand that the nude scene was not in the original "R" rated version... and I certainly don't think it was needed. It's pretty easy to fast forward, but still...<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />The unrated version is a lot longer than the theatrical, so there's gotta be a lot of extra content. I would get this version (keeping in mind the reservations noted above.) You'll be surprised at how decent and suspenseful it actually is!</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>To be completely fair I did manage to get into the first hour of the movie "Doom" (2005) before the wheels fell off and the mish-mash of a script managed to contradict itself once too many times. And any film that includes close-ups of Rosamund Pike ("Pride and Prejudice" - "Die Another Day") more than justifies its existence and the current $.19 price tag for a used DVD.<br /><br />Pike not only looks good, she is an excellent actress and injects some self-parody into the film, you can almost hear her wondering if her salary was worth having to do scenes with the rest of her talent-challenged ensemble.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of originality to be found here. Basically it is a big budget money-losing attempt to clone "Aliens" while throwing in a few names and inside jokes from the video game. As in "Deep Rising" (another money losing "Aliens" clone) a squad of mercenaries/Marines/Marines go to a luxury liner/space colony/research station and find that the passengers/ colonists/scientists have been wiped out by undersea/deep space/genetically-altered creatures. They attempt to destroy the creatures but most are killed.<br /><br />The hero is a maverick outsider played by Treat Williams/Sigourney Weaver/Karl Urban. The main villain is a slimy businessman/corporation representative/kill-crazy NCO; who endangers everyone. Comic relief is provided by wisecracking Kevin O'Connor/Bill Paxton/Richard Blake. The group encounters a female survivor played by Famke Janssen/Carrie Hein/Rosamund Pike.<br /><br />Unfortunately for "Doom" and "Deep Rising" the producers did not hire the writers from "Aliens". This oversight will have you wondering how they could sink this much money and effort into the making this movie, and put so little thought into writing the screenplay. Too bad really-because while unoriginal, the premise does have a lot of potential. There was simply a failure to execute so that after a promising beginning things bog down completely and it just becomes an exercise in excess; with endless boring battles between mercenaries with pop guns and monsters whose properties allow them to do anything.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Dwayne Johnson(The Rock) and Karl Urban star in a movie adaption of the ultra popular video game of the same name;and surprisingly it works very well.<br />The Rock,known only here as The Sarge,is one hard nosed,by the book soldier.It seems there is a level 5 security breech at Olduvai Research Station situated on the planet Mars.It's supposed to be an archeological- only dig but a very selective virus has managed to infect several members of the site team.It's up to the Sarge,his right hand man John(Urban) and the rest of the military team to go to Mars and shut down and contain the breech.To get there all must travel through the "ark".This is,for lack of a better description,like a watery ball that comes up out of the middle of the floor and when one stands close enough,one gets sucked into and transported directly to the Mars site.<br />Once the entire team arrives the adrenaline starts pumping for them and for us.They make their way methodically through the site labs,meeting up with scientist(and Urbans' sister) Samantha(Rosamund Pike).They go room by room and area by area until they start making contact with the "breech".As they "eliminate" one breech another eventually appears.It seems the lead scientists they are seeking are the ones responsible for much of the trouble and are infecting each other,but before they can fully comprehend this they are up to their elbows in trouble.<br />The Sarge,unbeknownst to the others and even himself,gets infected early on by coming in contact with comtaminated blood.As things progress his behaviour becomes more and more agressive and erratic until he orders the murder of innocent and uninfected scientists and their families and even shoots one of his own rookie soldiers.During one of the last attacks on the surviving group Urban is injured and the Sarge is taken away.In order to save her brother Samantha injects him with C-24,which is a serum derived from the ancient indigenous population of Mars who have 24 chromosomes.This has the effect of not only saving his life but heightening and enhancing his physical and mental abilities to an unheard of degree.By this time The Sarge returns pretty much converted into one of the monsters they originally came to hunt down.A battle royale ensues which ends up back on Earth,but fortunately for the moment is still contained below ground.It is a back and forth fight for life, but the Sarge is sent back to Mars with a live grenade in hot pursuit,which destroys him.<br />The movie does a good job of keeping the atmosphere dark and gloomy throughout its' 113 minutes and once the group lands on Mars the paranoic level remains high.It is so good in fact that it helps gloss over the weak spots that appear along the way,dialogue or plot related.<br />One nice spot comes at approximately the 90 minute mark where for about five minutes the movie reverts to its' gamer roots and turns into a FPS(first person shooter) demo.We become Urban,whose rifle in the foreground snakes through the corridors and around corners shooting and killing each and every creature it comes into contact with.You almost wish you had a controller in your hand to take control of the action on the screen!<br />This unrated and extended edition DVD includes several mini docs on the making of the movie,an extended FPS secquence,tips for playing the real game and if you have an X-Box you can play the Doom 3 demo right from this disc!<br />Presented in a clear and clean anamorphic 2:35:1 ratio,this movie is a heart thumping,testosterone filled 113 minute thrill ride that is bound to please.There are no moral imperatives here or lessons to be learned or multi plot twists to unravel.You just sit back and let the movie wash over you and let it do what it was intended to do.<br />Don't think.....just watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I must admit, Doom had much more potential to be a movie than most other games. It's not that it's bad, there still good to be had, but it just could have done so much more. I love the original Doom for SNES and PC, but the movie borrows too much from the first Resident Evil movie and doesn't really capture the spirit of the classic game. Not to mention the fact that I did not know that I would be stamping this film as the 18th zombie I've watched.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A team of marines are sent to Mars to investigate a distress call put out from a remote research center on the planet called the Olduvai Research Station. Strange things begin happening; scientists are dead, terrifying creatures lurk in the dark and wait to eat and infect the soldiers, all while trying to figure out what Chromosome-24 does to the human body when injected into the system. The storyline just isn't that great, it borrows pages from the first Resident Evil movie, only Resident Evil told its story in a much better fashion in every single way and it was more explanatory.<br />GORE FACTOR: Limb-ripping, flesh eating, and even some chainsaw action, but there is very little present most of the time.<br />MUSIC: Why is this music even here? It sucks! There is not much present, and it doesn't fit the themes of the movie.<br />SCARE FACTOR: You will mostly end up laughing at its attempt to be scary, because it is not scary at all. The creature designs sure look great though, and seem to follow the game.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: You will mostly find it to be comedic, even though it is unintentional. Certain action scenes are quite entertaining, while others are just downright stupid. For example: The fight scene at the end of the movie. It's like watching a freaking Jean Claude Van Damme movie for Godsake (UUUUGGGGHHHHH.....). It does a decent job of ripping off Resident Evil, but it just doesn't really follow the spirit of the awesome game.<br />OVERALL: It's worth a rental, maybe even a buy if you're interested enough. Just don't expect to be wowed by anything.<br />THE GOOD: Decent gore, decent ripping off of the first Resident Evil movie, and it's funny.<br />THE BAD: Doesn't really follow the spirit of the game, music is awful, and the movie is unintentionally funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>I don't think there should have been a Doom movie. In the old days Doom was a great game you could play for hours. As the game itself only consisted of shooting aliens it was virtually impossible for anyone to write a decent script for this movie. Obviously The Rock's acting abilities are at the right place here. Still the movie didn't turn out that bad after all. A few actors, like Karl Urban for example, still make it worthwile to keep watching. Of course they usually talk scientific nonsense all the time, but it was fun to see some people take Doom seriously, although it's an absolute IQ reducer. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I watched this one not expecting much.  Overall it was a decent watch, especially when you put it up against other video game adaptations like Wing Commander.  While watching the film, I was really reminded of Resident Evil(the movie.  From the evil corporation, to the outbreak, to the marines coming in to save the day was pretty close.  Overall it was not as good as the Resident Evil movie.  The special effects were weak at times, and I didn't find any of the main characters to be overly likeable, so I couldn't get into the movie as much as I could.<br /><br />For fans of the video game, the storyline has nothing to do with any of the games, but they do use the first person shooting sequence for about 5 minutes or so.  This is worth a watch if you have a slow night and want lots of gun fights and monsters.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>I admit that while watching this . . . I thought that it was going to suck. I was only half right. To put it bluntly, this movie is vast and it does have a lot of style, monsters, and characters but in the end it lacks something more. To put it more simply. I'll let you weigh the pors and cons so that you can decide whether you wanna buy it or not. I bought it right away without even thinking.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Original storyline<br /><br />-Cool gadjets<br /><br />-Cool Guns<br /><br />-Cool special effects<br /><br />-Well-built sets<br /><br />-Cool first person perspective scene.<br /><br />-Good scar tactics.<br /><br />-feels like a videogame.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-sometimes the characters do nothing but search.<br /><br />-Too much walking around in the dark.<br /><br />-The suspense, at times, gets boring.<br /><br />-And finally, the rock cannot act. How are you going to wear the same expression saying each and every line. It's almost like there is no emphases on any word. It really gets repeatative.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Pretty good movie but instead of lots of monsters a la doom we<br /><br />are given lots of zombies and a few monsters, which is still fun, be there are so many zombie movies out there that it brought down the fun a bit.<br /><br />The rock is solid as well as the rest of the crew and the musical score flows well with the movie.<br /><br />You ll probably need two boxes of popcorn for this one.  Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I was definitely entertained throughout Doom. It was an enjoyable action/horror/sci-fi movie that in my opinion is getting unjust treatment by the critics.<br /><br />A little bit Aliens. A tiny bit Predator. A lot Resident Evil. And, hey, I loved all three of those flicks. Resident Evil got crushed by the critics, and that was completely captivating if you're into the genre. Doom has some very similar parallels to the plot lines of the 3 aforementioned films. And also has some of its own merit. But overall it is a good, average, somewhat predictable (due to the familiarity with like story lines) fun film to watch.<br /><br />You've seen the story played out before: Something has gone wrong on a distant Earthly inhabitation of a remote planet (or moon...whatever). A team of soldiers are dispatched to search and destroy. But the soldiers soon find that they are the ones on the short end of the "being hunted" stick.<br /><br />There's some decent special effects. Some campy humor. And there's some fair at best acting. But as I said early, if you're into the genre, Doom is definitely worth a rental. It's a purchase only for the die-hard fan. Sorry Amazon.<br /><br />Lights out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>For every one videogame-to-film adaptation that's decent, there's at least 3 that absolutely suck. They're not even worth the celluloid they're on basically. So where does Doom fit? Well, it's not awesome that's for sure. But then again, it's not really terrible. And that's quite surprising, you would think that it would obviously be stupid but then you find yourself enjoying all the gory mayhem and go "huh, look at that, this film ain't so bad."<br /><br />A distress signal is sent from a research facility on Mars so a special squad is sent in to retrieve any survivors and neutralize any threat. Shall I go on? Cause that's pretty much it. Soldiers are sent in, they find weirdness, weirdness happens to have teeth and claws, soldiers die and they have to make it out alive.<br /><br />The first 2 Doom games had massive amounts of enemies coming at you so essentially it was a more fast paced game. Doom3 in many ways was like a Resident Evil on Mars. More slower, atmosphere and eerie, the game in a way toned down the "soldier sent to kick Hell in the balls" angle to the quiet angle. Well the film follows that route. It's darkly lit, and things go bump in the night suddenly then take off. So in a way it's not the game but it's no Doom3 either.<br /><br />Where is it Doom though? Of course the First-Person shooter scene where a Marine kicks a bunch of demon *** for around 4-5 minutes. This scene was more fun than probably the entirety of the film. It was quite funny at times too such as bringing out the sniper scope, a chainsaw and grenades. It's odd in the special features where they say the DVD can put in the full scene and they show the scene, yet it's the exact same thing that's in the movie. Huh?<br /><br />What can you expect from the rest of the film? Gore, slight nakedness, bad lines, overdone performances, weak character development and really dark hallways. You know, just like many of the recent "horror" films. Granted Doom3 was really poorly lit too but at least it helped the game. Here it's like "I can't see a thing, where's the lighting guy?"<br /><br />The only time I played Doom was playing Doom 2 many years ago, cheat codes on and blazing infinite ammo all over the place. It was fun but at the same time taking on demons wasn't my thing. Zelda, Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid however...here's hoping they don't do a MGS movie though, games are movie-like enough. Doom on the other hand is not quite horrible but we wouldn't have made a stink if they didn't make it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>God this movie was fun!!! Awesome special effects, kick-ass guns, non-stop action, lots and lots of blood and gore, intense monsters and zombies, what more could you ask for? Good acting and a plot you say? Nope, not here, and you know what, who cares!! If anybody went into this expecting good acting and a plot I'm thinkin' they never played the game. The game has always been in-your-face, raw power, great visuals and lots of violence, and you want this in the movie version, and boy do you get it, and then some. Quick question, how many GOOD movies have we had that were derived from video games? Hmmmm, let's list shall we?<br /><br />1.Streetfighter, terrible 2.Super Mario Brothers, even more terrible 3.Alone In The Dark, just plain bad 4.House Of The Dead,  one of the worst movies ever made, oh, by the way, a sequel is in the works, god help us 5.Resident Evil 1 and 2, well, I liked these alot, but there were alot of negatives said about it. I'm sure I missed some, plus we have more on the way, Spyhunter, Bloodrayne (The same director from House Of The Dead and Alone In  The Dark) So, as you can see, the market is getting flooded, so it was real nice to see such a good video game movie such as this.<br /><br />The Rock and Karl Urban lead a group of bad-ass marines in a search and rescue/destroy mission on Mars. Problem is, there is no one to rescue, they have either been killed or mutated into a zombie/monster. Seems the research/archeologists found a 24th chromosone that can either make you super-human, or, well, you know by now I'm sure. But it effects each individual differently,  if you have evil tendencies you will turn, if you are generally good, then no change.<br /><br />The weaponry is so awesome, the guns these marines use are loud and quick, and pack a hell of a punch. Then there is the 'BFG' that The Rock gets to play with later on in the film, I'll give you 1 guess what it stands for...(Bio-Force Gun? nah.......) I'm guessing the monsters were CG, but I'll tell you what, it is some really good CG, They are all really scary looking and mean and nasty. Also the make-up on all the zombies and the blood and gore are all incredible looking, they really did there research into making the monsters/zombies look like something right out of the game. There is a scene toward the end where they switch to a 1st person shooter mode and it is so friggin' cool!! All you see is the end of the gun blowing anything and everything away, looking so much like the game but only better.<br /><br />Now I know acting and plot are important to any movie, and I would usually agree with you, no movie should get 4 stars if the acting sucks and you can't get into the plot. The acting doesn't suck, it's just that it's, well, not there. It's just your usual assortment of testerone-filled men yelling and cursing, you have seen it a hundred times before. This is The Rock's worst performance yet, but he has such a strong presence, and as my wife would say, when your that smokin' hot, who the hell cares?<br /><br />I did like Karl Urban, he of Lord Of The Rings fame, he plays Reaper, at first a total a-hole, but then mellows and kicks alot of butt toward the end. The other marines are all forgettable as are all the doctors and scientists, but it was sure fun watching then all die, some much worst then others.<br /><br />My wife usually does not like these mindless, pointless movies, but she said she had alot of fun (I'm sure The Rock had a little to do with that) and would recommend this to the ladies at work, so I think most women will enjoy it as much as the men. Be warned, it is extremely graphic and violent, just like the game was. There is also alot of language and some generally creepy, suspensefull scenes, I'd say late teens should be fine. You gotta check this out people, big fun to be had by all..........<br /><br />acting.....2 stars, Moving on.......<br /><br />directing....4 stars, Worthy adaptation of the game, well done<br /><br />special effects....4.5 stars, Incredible Monters, zombies, guns, Mars setting, The Arc,<br /><br />action rating.....4 stars, Non-stop from beginning to end, but there is also some horror and suspense to be found as well<br /><br />quality.....4 stars, A bit too dark at times, but otherwise amazing looking, be sure and watch the 1st person scene twice, trust me, it's worth it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Doom starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is in stores now. The movie is based on the popular video game. The movie is straight up action but the plot can be a bit confusing to viewers who are not familiar with the game or the backstory. The Rock (handsome as ever) stars in the film as an intergalactic Marine. What I enjoyed most about the film was looking at The Rock. However, it was really hard for me to follow the film. I recently reviewed the movie Serenity. Even though I had never seen the television series, I was able to follow the movie. While watching Doom, I saw movement on the screen but I wasn't really sure what was going on. Perhaps this film will be more interesting to people familar with the backstory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of the game and I have enjoyed every other movie I bought that was made from a game including "Final Fantasy", "Resident Evil", et cetera, but this one is missing something. Decent cast, story, sets, and music. I bought this and although I wasn't enthralled, I won't be donating it either. I think the directing must have been mediocre. I say this because "The Rock" has turned in some decent performances in other movies. See "The Rundown". I think with better directing this movie would have rocked. The make-up was excellent, and there were great special effects. I think if the cast had a little more character appeal it might have been better. With good directing this would have come out. To me it is up to the director to have a clear view of the characters so he can help the actors develop them. Don't get me wrong, the director does a decent job because the characters are close to being interesting, but they just don't quite make it. The sequence were they have you viewing as though you are in the game was kind of cool. Overall not bad, just not great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER STUPID PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE THEY ARE JUST HATIN ON THE ROCK CAUSE HE'S A GREAT ACTOR!<br /><br />I REALLY LOVE THE VIDEO GAME AND IT SCARED ME TO DEATH. I WAS EXPECTING A HORROR MOVIE, BUT THIS IS REALLY AN ACTION MOVIE. WELL, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM AN ACTION MOVIE OTHER THAN LOTS OF SHOOTING AND SOME SUSPENSE? THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHALLOW.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: AT THE TIME THE REAPER WAKES UP AFTER HAVING BEEN INJECTED WITH CHROMOSOME 24 I JUST WENT BALLISTIC IN THE THEATER. YOU WAKE UP LOOKING OUT OF HIS EYES JUST AS YOU WOULD DO IN THE GAME AND THE FOLLOWING ACTION SEQUENCE WHERE, HA HA CAN'T SAY, I'LL KEEP Y'ALL GUESSING.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Good special effects.<br />*The last 13 minutes or so were great.  The movie's finale includes a fantastic sequence designed to look just like a FPS game.  Not to mention, having the Rock turn into a villian and the other guy become a hero was a great twist.<br />*The music score/soundtrack is awesome.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A very weak adaptation of the computer game.  The story line is totally different.  There are no scary demons and there is no Hell, just a bunch of ugly zombies on a martian base (albiet, the movie tried to keep up with the demonology by having people turn into demons; it is somewhat interesting).<br />*The movie itself has a weak filming style.  It is very forgetable (save for the last 13 minutes) and indistinctive.  I found much of it dull and boring.<br /><br />Overall, this is like a B-rated flick with good special effects and it just happens to share the title of the computer game.  I believed that "Doom" could have been promising as a movie, but this film falls short with its dull photography and uninteresting story.  Only the ending is worthwhile (and the soundtrack, if you like metal).<br /><br />The video and audio quality are good, and the disc has a few featurettes.  The unrated version has one or two extra featurettes as well (I'm not sure what makes it unrated, though).</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie.

The actor was probably born after "Galaxian2" ceased production, which might explain why he's holding it the wrong way around: "Galaxian2" had controls at the top and at the bottom of the game panel so it could be played by two players, one at either end. However our game-loving Marine is holding it like a Gameboy, horizontally, using both sets of controls at the same time. It's possible to read this failure of orientation as a metaphor for the entire film: the filmmakers just didn't understand what they had their hands on here. Having bought the rights to a game with an incredible array of ghastly creatures, wonderful weapons, and some truly terrifying close-quarters combat situations, they decided to ignore it all in favour of dark, overlong stalking sequences with very little payoff. The creatures are rarely seen, and the action is utterly conventional - with the exception of a first-person sequence late in the film, which sounds cool but is actually about as entertaining as watching somebody else play while you wait your turn. Much is made of the legendary BFG, but it's fired twice in the entire movie (and not for lack of SFX budget - the film cost $70 million). I just don't know what they were thinking. "Doom" the game had some truly terrifying moments. "Doom" the movie is a bore. Is the whole idea of game-to-movie flawed? The notion really only appeals to nervous production VPs short on ideas. The bet is that enough curious fans will come out (or rent the DVD), even if it suffers a predictable mauling from the critics. The problem is that the pleasure of gaming is in first-person action, not narrative. While most games do have an over-arching story, it's really just an excuse for sequencing a number of action set-pieces full of the gun-toting mayhem in which the pleasure of gaming lies. But a film needs a story. It needs characters, especially if it is to engage an audience to the extent that a game can. Film's can compel, but they just use different means: a story we become absorbed in, characters we really care about. The game-to-movie still needs to give us that, and yet retain the elements that make the game great. "Doom" does neither. There's a lazy attempt at story (the obligatory corporate greed) and an abandoned attempt at character development (Reaper and his sister). They seem to have forgotten everything else. The result is not only a failed adaptation, but a failed film in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Okay, so I walked into this movie expecting it to SUCK out of it's mind, and to my surprise it only sucked a little.  I mean, it stars the Rock and it's based of a video game.  The Rock, mind you, is a terrible actor if I've ever seen one and his choice in films is rediculous.  I have to say that through most of the movie I was thinking 'the acting may suck but the MOVIE itself isn't terrible' which may only come because I had NO INTEREST IN SEEING IT WHATSOEVER...I was actually dragged there through guilt since I forced my friend to see Saw II against his will and so I saw this against mine.  The graphics are okay, nothing major, the scares are there, but not very often and the gore is there but not a whole lot of it really.  The best scene in the entire film is the last one, the fight between Reaper and Sarge.  As I said the Rock is a terrible actor, but when you consider he started as a wrestler than you know the highlight of any of his films will of course be the fight scene.  Oh yeah, and I thought the whole movie was going to be first-person...NO, only about 3 minutes at the very end...and to clarify my TITLE to my review...when you play a video game, much like Doom, you are estatic to find the BFG, that Big F#$%ing Gun youve been searching for...when you watch a movie, that same BFG becomes RFD...Really F@#$ing Dumb...it's a movie...not a video game...remember that...to hear the Rock stare in awe at a gun suspended in air and mutter crap like "wow" and "cool" is just stupid...</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>I've never played the video game the movie is based on so I'm only reviewing the movie for what it was. A bunch of marines are called to a research facility on Mars that is accessed from a portal on Earth. When they get there they find that the scientists have been attacked by some kind of creature and are now transforming.<br /><br />Sadly, there is nothing original in this movie.

The speical effects were top notch, the acting was what you'd expect for this type of movie, and pretty good gore and killings. The only problem I have is the movie is too dark to really see anything. The best part of the movie was the first person shooting scene, that was awesome. Very good movie, even though it is pretty dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Maybe it's partly because I'm old enough to remember when Doom was the gaming experience of a lifetime and partly because I can't get enough of seeing The Rock layeth the smacketh down on any sentient being, but I loved Doom.  I wasn't all that confident at the beginning, though.  You've got like seven or eight soldiers going in to the battle zone, and that made me wonder how they were going to string this thing out for an hour and forty five minutes.  Then there's the fact that the movie drastically rewrites the whole Doom story from the origin of the alien creatures to the manner in which things ultimately play out.  Lest I forget, you also have a couple of incredibly annoying characters you have to put up with and just hope they are among the first to die.  When all was said and done, though, there was no doubt that I had enjoyed the heck out of this movie.  It wasn't so much all the blood and gore (although blood and gore are always important) as it was the intelligence of the script.  Stay with me now, and let me explain.  I'm talking context here, and in the context of a cinematic adaptation of a first-person shooter video game, this script is rather exceptional.  The original Doom storyline was changed for a purpose here - and it made for a much better film than it might have been otherwise by taking us beyond a superficial battle of good vs. monstrous evil and allowing for things to play out somewhat differently than I was expecting.  The brother-sister relationship (and let me just thank the filmmakers for not putting some kind of trite romance into the mix) that stands near the heart of the story also plays into the conclusion quite well (and, dare I say it, leaves a little wiggle room for a sequel).<br /><br />While Doom the film isn't just about killing monsters, that's certainly its raison detre - and it does it quite well.  Actually, I would have preferred a lot more violence and a few more monsters, but the film does deliver a satisfying number of violent killings on both sides of the conflict.  I wouldn't have complained about more usage of the BFG, either (and isn't it nice to hear this weapon called by its true name?).  The movie never really approaches any sort of suspense, but the attacks and counter-attacks we do see are quite acceptable.  I was a bit disappointed by one decapitation shot, however, as I didn't even realize it was a decapitation until I saw the headless body on the floor.  Still, I have no real complaints about the level of violence I saw here - or the special effects.  Sure, most of the action is computer-generated, but it's really well done.<br /><br />In a sense, the movie is on the predictable side, yet events didn't play out quite the way I expected them to - and that counts a lot in terms of my personal evaluation.  I also appreciated the sequence in which we view the action from a true first-person perspective - for those few minutes, it almost feels like you're playing a fantastic, futuristic version of the game.  Younger folks who never played the game or experienced the thrill of the Doom phenomenon may not appreciate it like us slightly older folks, but I'm sure they'll still find the sequence pretty darn cool.  And even if they don't, they still have The Rock to entertain them (although I must say I was a little disappointed that we couldn't get at least one People's Eyebrow in there somewhere).  I can't really judge The Rock's acting ability based on this film, as it frankly doesn't require a lot more than acting big and bad all the time, but he certainly comes across as the right man for the role of Sarge.<br /><br />Obviously, I think Doom is an underrated movie.  You expect a lot of big guns, monsters, and gore - and you get them.  You get so much more, however, in terms of the storyline - and that is why I find this film so impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>Sometimes I marvel that so many people and movie critics expect every film to be Oscar material! Lots of action, fast paced, cool special effects--Doom is a solid, entertaining movie.  The Rock and Karl Urban carried the story forward (and provided some nice eye candy to boot).<br /><br />Are you going to find deep philosophical meaning in it?  Only if you're drunk.  Can you sit back and let go for a couple of hours? Definitely.  Bottom line is if you're a fan of action movies, add this movie to the roster.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Doom (Andrzej Bartkowiak, 2005)<br /><br />It took fourteen years, but one of the finest videogames of all time finally made it to the big screen. And there are some of us who've been waiting the whole time. And we get a movie starring The Rock?<br /><br />The big surprise is, it's not all that bad.<br /><br />Sure, it's possible to nitpick. What's a Doom movie without revenants, lost souls, archviles, rocket launchers, and for the love of all that's holy the cyberdemon?But when it comes right down to it, why not The Rock in a movie about a bunch of Marines fighting creatures from the depths of Hell? At least they didn't cast Steven Seagal. And when you've only got a little over an hour and a half, you have to cut a few things. At least we got the BFG. (And I wish the BFG's effect in the game was half as cool as its effect in the movie.)<br /><br />The plot, what little there is (and pay attention, because it's different than the game, in one major aspect): A colony on Mars, originally started to support an archaeological dig, shut it down after weird, mysterious things began happening. Without anyone knowing, the head of the genetics lab, Dr. Carmack (Robert Russell, of the recent Dune TV miniseries), has reopened the archaeological dig, putting everyone in the colony in grave danger. They don't know that, of course, until it's far too late. They discover remains who have some pretty odd characteristics, which intrigue Carmack. He does some experiments that go, shall we say, awry. Marines, headed up by Sarge (The Rock), head to Mars in order to find out what's going on. Things blow up.<br /><br />Doom the movie, like Doom the game, is a turn your brain off and watch things getting killed experience. If you were expecting high art, were you playing the same game the rest of us were? This is a movie that's all about violence, special effects, and things blowing up. And that's pretty hard to mess up, as long as you get halfway competent actors and a crack special effects team. Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose name is not Uwe Boll, something for which we can all thank whatever we hold holy) delivers both, and does it in style. The Rock heads up a rather capable acting team-- Reaper (The Chronicles of Riddick's Karl Urban), Duke (Resident Evil: Apocalypse's Raz Adoti), Destroyer (The Four Feathers' Deobia Oparei), The Kid (Al Weaver, recently in Radford's Merchant of Venice adaptation), Goat (Ian Fleming: Bondmaker's Ben Daniels), Mac (Phobia's Yao Chin), and Portman (Munich's Richard Brake). They're assisted on Mars by the quadraplegic Pinky (Layer Cake's Dexter Fletcher), on intel, and the obligatory beautiful scientist Sam (Die Another Day Bond girl Rosamund Pike). All of the above are at least decent actors.<br /><br />Cliched? Sure, in spades. But again, this isn't a complex flick, just as it wasn't a complex game. And from that angle, this is a wonderfully satisfying film.<br /><br />Still, I wish they'd found a way to work in the cyberdemon. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>This one still boggles me!<br /><br /> I read the finicky reviews and was not expecting anything decent but it wasn't so bad!<br /><br />Yeah at times I was thinking "why did these people film this? Did they need money?" because it is based on a game and has its own world, it does not follow what we on Earth would call a story taken from life.<br /><br />The special effects were rough at times and made me think that whoever did Pac Man was still doing his work on this movie, but since it's based on a game I took it with a grain of salt. The creatures were pretty wild and I like "alien chase on starship" whether under water, in outer space or on a Moon type of a movie.<br /><br />I liked how certain characters, without spoiling anything, changed sides and there were a few nice plot twists. Karl Urban and surprisingly the dude known as The Rock were pretty good in this one.<br /><br />Fun movie to see, but it's not deep soulful or Oscar nominee material.<br /><br />Pretty much eye candy, but overall better than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>As a big Doom fan throught the video games I was happy with the movie and I will admit there was not much of a story to it but this is doom your suppose to be shooting demons and your suppose to be scared<br /><br />This is why this movie gets bad reviews because you get a person who has not played the games before and has no knowledge of anything to do with doom and they dont understand most of the movie so they automatically can not appreciate it as a true doom fan<br /><br />Two Thumbs up Great job</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I, unlike other people, did not find this movie to be a disappointment.  I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was "this is cool". Honestly if this movie would have been called "UAC Marines", "Viral Apocalypse" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission to Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC; this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment.<br /><br />The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fan boys (girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but good nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something that's a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then I'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Other than that it's a lot better then what I was expecting too see</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>Doom i have to say was not a bad movie,but there were things that lacked badly in the film.....

The Rock as the marine sent<br /><br />down to investigate the going ons at a scientific<br /><br />facility is pretty good.<br /><br />I know critics panned the movie but it has some<br /><br />brights spots, at least the gore and some scenes were<br /><br />done with some effort, the other parts are not, but<br /><br />even then you can laugh your butt about them. It<br /><br />was kinda funny to see the scientist in the beginning<br /><br />use keycards (like the game) to escape, it looks<br /><br />much cooler in the game than in the movie.<br /><br />Andrzej Bartkowiak does a fair job but I probably<br /><br />wouldn't be excited about his next movie.<br /><br />Rosamund Pike who is Samantha Grimm , another scientist<br /><br />in the movie is pretty darn watchable though like<br /><br />the role for the most part takes the role seriously.<br /><br />The special effects were average but I guess enough<br /><br />for some people. Maybe they could have used more gore<br /><br />or instead of using the computer effects for some<br /><br />creatures done more prostetic work.<br /><br />In short though due was an ok movie but not something<br /><br />I would shell it money for on DVD, it ain't that good<br /><br />and will never be except for die hard gamers who wanted<br /><br />to see their game on movie screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>No, the Rock can't act...it doesn't take a Razzie nomination to understand that.  But The Rock IS a commanding physical presence and at least he doesn't have an Austrian accent.  And DOOM is one of the best movies made from a video game.  While certainly not the classic that ALIENS is, the movie borrows a lot of that movie's dark atmosphere and it has a great sequence in which you become the shooter; it's just like a video game.<br /><br />DOOM's standard plot focuses on the planet Mars, where a genetic experiment gone wrong (do they ever go right?) unleashes some frightening monsters.  The action is fast and furious; the special effects are great; and there's lots of gore and violence as one would expect from this kind of film.  Karl Urban (LORD OF THE RINGS) gets to be the hero in this one and he's sufficiently macho and controlled; Rosamund Pike is effective as his sister; and Richard Brake is a nasty sex-craved soldier.  If you like your movies adrenaline-charged and fast paced, DOOM delivers--in spite of the Rock!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not a fan of the game Doom nor have I ever played the game, so I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br />The film is an action-packed sci-fi adventure combining significant elements of horror.<br />It starts off like Stargate then turns into Alien and then goes Resident Evil on us.<br />The acting is above average with Karl Urban (from LOR), the Rock (from Scorpion King) and Rosamund Pike, a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) doing a good job in their respective roles.<br />The setting, the plot, the special effects, the battles and the special effects are all very good!<br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>The game Doom has inspired a lot of competition and a very-good series of novels.  It is not surprising that it would be made into a movie.  But like the books, the movie has to add a lot to the story to make it work.  A simple shooter is not a story.  This movie takes a different direction than the novels.  Most of the action takes place on Mars which can be reached through an ancient gate.  When a science installation comes under attack, a rescue squad is sent.  They don't know what they are going to find but they investigate in a professional manner.<br /><br />Soon they run into some of the horror game players expect.  Strange and powerful creatures no roam the installation.  The team must manage to fight them off while trying to figure out what is going on.  As expected, the body count begins to rise.  As tension escalates it is realized that the horror must not be allowed to get back through the gate to Earth.  Eventually the exact nature of the menace is played big time and we have the final showdown.<br /><br />Considering this is based on a game with almost no story it turned out pretty well.  The team would have been more believable if that had some sort of head protection but the makes wanted the actors faces unobscured.  I was also surprised at changing rates of spread.  For much of the movie it is a slow process but when a scene calls for it, it is almost explosive.  The Jekyll and Hyde nature was quite interesting but I felt the movie ended almost too easily.  There was no mopping up or even checking to see if mopping up would be necessary.  Still, these films are made for action and this one delivers it in full.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>The only reason I watched this movie was because it was an HD DVD-great picture and sound.

Things have gone way south on a research base on Mars---or was it the Martian moon Phobos?---anyhoo, communications are dead, and the situation is totally FUBAR. You're sent to clean it up.<br /><br />You get hyper-jumped into the Phobos base, and mutated bloodthirsty zombies and demons and flesh-and-steel monstrosities in the thousands come to rip your face off. You blow them back into Hell. Rinse. Repeat. Boo-yah!<br /><br />Now: the formula for "Doom" wasn't anything profound, but it worked: it was pure, raw, nerve-rattling, brain-boggling adrenaline.<br /><br />Raw, pulsing adrenaline. The Gnomes at Id Software had found that magical servo, written it into gaming code, and hardwired it into our fitfully slumbering Reptile Brain.<br /><br />If you played "Doom", you found yourself, say, at about 11:00 P.M., with a load of schoolwork piled on the couch behind you, jacked into your computer, a sheen of sweat coating your greasy, slack-jawed, whey-skinned face. I swear to God, you said---just this level---just this next corridor---just to the Research Lab, honest to god, and then I'm going to go study/sleep/work.<br /><br />At 5 in the morning, you were still blasting Pinky Demons and dodging Imp Fireballs, and praying your boss/professor/chick-of-the-moment would understand, even as wan morning-light was feebly forcing its way through the blinds and curtains.<br /><br />So: when "Doom" first reared its ugly head, I wasn't expecting much. I didn't need much. I needed a few ready-for-bear, growing-and-spitting Space Marines. I needed a massed, hungry army of demons and hellspawn mutants, Stygian sinew fused cruelly with state-of-the-art Phobos military technology. I needed shotguns, and rocket launchers, and most definitely the BFG, laying waste to huge chunks of the Demon Horde and Martian real estate alike.<br /><br />Most importantly, I needed lots of slaughter. I wanted to be knee-deep in the Dead. What did I get with the cinematic "Doom"?<br /><br />1)There's very little to see---no seriously, this flick is Dark, as in it's underlit. If you spy a monster---and God knows, I was all eyes!---you'd better not blink, or you'll miss it.<br /><br />And the Phobos base comes off as your late-night Kansas City cheapo haunted house---lots of blind alleys and stairways and ramps and sh*t. Hell, we might as well be following the Rock (who plays "Sarge") through the local poultry warehouse.<br /><br />2) Turn off the Ultraviolence. Yep, "Doom" the movie is definitely toggled over to the "Don't Hurt Me" setting: we get a little gore thrown our way, but it's so minimal, so begrudging, and so tightly edited, that it might as well not be there at all.<br /><br />3) No Demons. Yeah, let's make a flick about marines slaughtering Demons on Mars and---well, skip the demons. Something about genomes and a propensity to evil. If I'd wanted to see a flick about socio-genetics, I'd have stayed in school. Bah Humbug.<br /><br />4) Oh, and no Hell. Did I mention that? "Doom" without a gateway to Hell.<br /><br />So---this review could go on. I could talk about Stan Winston fighting the good fight, doing some good critter prosthetics---and from what I could see of them, they *are* good. I could talk about The Rock's squinchy uni-brow. I could talk about how Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike (fraternal twins, according to the plot---a sort of spacefaring Sisters Grimm) spend much of the flick looking painfully constipated.<br /><br />I could even spend a few sentences yakking it up about the first-person shooter segment, meant as a nod to the fans, coming across as something you might see in a more desperate spookhouse at the Wichita County Fair.<br /><br />Or I could just say "Avoid", and be done with it.<br /><br />Game Over.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>Once upon a time a bunch of archeologists were archeologing in the Nevada desert when they stumbled across something spectacular. Can you guess what it was? Dinosaur bones? Indian arrow heads? Wild camels? Nope! It was a portal through time to the planet Mars. So humanity, being what it is, turns that portal into a scientific laboratory and starts digs on Mars to find out who used to live there. Being the way these movies are, nothing is ever done easily and all hell breaks loose in the lab directly next to the dig site. All contact is loss with the area and the six scientists inside are missing. Who you gonna call? The military outfit with the biggest PR department: the Marines!  The marines of course find out that the crap has hit the fan and try to contain the situation. Things don't go as planned and soon it becomes a game of survival. No I'm not talking about "Aliens," I'm still talking about "Doom!" Why would you get so confused?<br /><br />When you get down to it, it's your typical special-team-goes-to-investigate, with all your needed characters: the wise cracking black guy, the dumb guy who gets "Shut up" yelled at him a lot, the normal guy who becomes the hero, and the tough and serious main guy, that being the Rock. The Rock's character is very oddly used in the film, however. At first he's the tough guy who's cool, calm, collective, ready with a plan, and they were building up a lot of cool stuff with the use of the BFG. (yes, its used in the movie) However, this is all ruined in the last 30 minutes of the film when the Rock goes crazy, killing off his own men and ordering the death of civilians. Then at the very end he becomes one of the beasts and attacks our nominal hero in a scene that looked like it came straight out of a Jet Li film with high jumps, lots of throwing against walls, and kung fu boxing. What the heck? This comes especially after the first-person-shooter gunfight. Yes, that's right - you DO have that in the movie. Granted, it's not as much in the movie as some people led you to believe, but the sequence is in there. It's actually not all that bad and is used pretty well. Sad thing is the main monster who watch the hero fight is what the wheelchair guy turns into it. When you think about it, that's kind of lame. The character in a wheelchair is named "Pinky," so that means the main boss monster is something called Pinky. Still...it was kind of cool.<br /><br />Granted, I didn't go into this movie expecting "Citizen Kane." I went expecting a craptastic film, and on some parts it succeeds and on some parts it doesn't. The special effects are nice, and it does have some decent gore and violence in it, and some parts were kind of scary. It suffers from some terrible writing too, with some corny lines like "Kill them all, let God sort them out," or even the quote I've used in my review title. I wouldn't expect superior acting either, and you shouldn't expect it. The girl playing Samantha couldn't have been more bland - read these words: "Oh God!" You just put more emotion into them than she did in the respective scene. And the Rock...I'm sorry, but what the heck? Did he read his lines directly before filming? Read this line normally: "Semper Fi, mother f***er." You sound like the Rock! Yay!<br /><br />I would almost give this three stars for entertainment value, which believe it or not this movie does have, but they nearly ruin it all with the last bit, cutting it short of being a craptastic feature. Watch the "Doom" movie the way you would any original Sci-Fi Channel original film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>You want to see bad?  I mean real bad?  Then you've got to see Doom, the long awaited adaptation of the wildly popular early 90's PC shooter is here, and not only is it about ten years late, it's absolutely abysmal.  Karl Urban and the Rock star as good and evil space marines sent to investigate strange happenings on moons of Mars, and while fans of the classic game will no doubt see where the story should lead, it doesn't.  Yes, there's no mention of Hell.  Yes, the CGI demons are lame.  Yes, the acting is terrible.  Yes, the storyline itself is about as boring, cliche ridden, and predictable as can be with little sense to anything at all.  Not to mention the fact that when Doom switches to it's first person-esque view towards the climax, that's when the film goes into complete and utter cheese territory.  Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike is also here, for no apparent reason.  All in all, Doom is a brainless waste of film that's so bad that you would expect Uwe Boll's name to be attached to it, and it should be avoided by longtime fans of the game and everyone else as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The game is something you play, not watch. I don't know why some film producers keep making movies based on video games such as `Super Mario Brothers' `Tomb Raider' and `Resident Evil.' Like them `Doom' is inspired by a video game of the same name, which I have never played. If I have never played it, that is not because I hate playing computer games. I am sure playing the game is a much better experience than just watching it. You see, I can control (or try to control) the whole situation of the game. In film, you just watch.<br /><br />Still, though I give the film only two stars, watching `Doom' is much better than watching dismally bad `House of the Dead' and perhaps two `Resident Evil' films. It is absolutely meaningless to say that the film's plot is familiar and recycled. There is no other way for anyone to make a film out of shooting game, of which main purpose is to provide the thrills of shooting and being shot, bitten, or killed. Plot is only a starting point.<br /><br />So I didn't complain when the film introduced us to the near future world of the year 2026, and the special force led by `Sarge' played by The Rock sitting before a PC without wearing a shirt. These eight soldiers (including top-billed Karl Urban, the real star of the film) are sent to the laboratory of one corporate facility on Mars, where something went wrong, but what went wrong you can successfully guess before the rescue team. So far everything resembles `Resident Evil,' but even when I noticed that, I didn't boo or leave. No, there is another reason for me to dislike the film.<br /><br />Though Director Andrzej Bartkowiak quite wisely shortened the introductory part of the film, his job gets slack and lazy after the team arrive at Mars. In addition to the poorly designed creatures, the team's prolonged search for the survivors damages the pace of the film, only to make the bigger and better action sequences and shoot-outs in the final chapter less impressive. But this awfully slow-paced middle-part has been seen in the films by Andrzej Bartkowiak, who gave us `Romeo Must Die' and `Exit Wounds' the latter being the last decent film starring Steven Seagal. Certainly photographer-turned-director Bartkowiak can deliver, but he takes too much time before doing that.<br /><br />And in the last shoot-outs, the filmmakers made an interesting decision to insert the shooter's viewpoint while fighting the monsters. As you see on the smaller screen of video game, you see the evil creatures get shot and blown up to pieces, the point of view that shows how a solider sees things over the barrel of a gun. Then I was reminded of two things; one is the point where I started - game is made for us to play. The other is the name of James Cameron, who improved the POV idea by using the video monitors attached to the soldiers. Here I expected to see Cameron's brilliant touch which elevated the clich&eacute;d ideas to the higher places with adrenaline-filled intense direction. Maybe I shouldn't have.<br /><br />`Doom' is not a terrible film. It is a passable fun movie, but I couldn't find the reason why this film should be made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Yeah, right.  A 2005 film version of the video game "Doom" starring The Rock and directed by the guy who made Cradle 2 The Grave?  I can definately smell what The Rock is cooking here.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>This movie is not based upon the popular Doom games at all.  It does have the UAC, it does have the BFG 9000 and it does have blood and gore...but this isn't Doom.  In the game, the monsters came from hell and are not borrowed from Resident Evil.  In the game, there's no mention of a "super being" ever being on Mars.  In the game, they didn't experiment on people to produce a "super being".  The idea of experiments changing people into monsters comes from Resident Evil and not Doom.  Do NOT confuse Doom with Resident Evil and do not make a movie of it.  The movie is more based on Resident Evil than it is on Doom.  And The Rock should be embrassed being in a movie that's NOT base on the game of the same name.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I went into watching this film adaptation of Doom with little or no expectations other than to see lots of big guns, kickass Marines to wield them and lots and lots of zombie-demons and mutant demons to shoot at and kill. With that criteria in mind I wasn't disappointed by what I saw. The movie felt just like I thought it would. A close to two hour piece of popcorn fluff based off a video game franchise of the same thing.<br /><br />Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is the headlining star of the film with Karl "Eomer" Urban playing a close second. The charisma of both actors is all this movie needs. Every other character in the movie either serves as demon-fodder or person-in-jeopardy. They help enough in moving the story (as basic a plot as there is) from one scary action sequence to the next. The special effects is mostly done with animatronics by the house that Stan Winston (FX master of such films like Aliens, Terminator, T2, Predator) built and it helped in making the demons and monster look real. For a film based on a video game this one has a minimum amount of CGI-effects outside of the first-person sequence in the closing part of the movie. That sequence straddles the fence between cool and cheesy but never seems to fall on either one. Just when it started to look laughable something cool happens that reminded me of the game.<br /><br />The way the film ended and changes in certain characters happened was a surprise to me. I wasn't expecting the film ending the way it did and I think that helped in making me enjoy it enough. The movie is not for everyone but for fans of the game Doom it's a surprise that it didn't suck and look terrible like most film adaptations of video game properties.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>DOOM, believe it or not, is based on a video game!  With all the literature of the world, all the fine screenplays that are stacked on the shelves, all the creative stories that languish in the 'not for profit probably' bins, it seems a raw commentary on today's movie audiences to spend millions of dollars on a game everyone who cares already knows.  But, movies are business and box office demands take precedence.<br /><br />As the narrator of the film states, 'In the year 2026 archaeologists working in the Nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars. They call this portal the Ark. Twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand why it was built and what happened to the civilization that built it' is the apparent 'story'. What follows is a series of conflicts between killers transforming into beasts right out of Hieronymous Bosch and Francis Bacon only to bloody up the claustrophobic computer generated interiors with occasional transmogrifications into mercurial clouds only to reappear.  Much slaughter, much eye dazzling color manipulation, and ever so little story line fill the screen.  The participants in this real time game are The Rock (he needs a role that uses his talent), hunky Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, Rosamond Pike, and Richard Brake - all squashed around the set by director and head gladiator Andrej Bartkowiak.<br /><br />Though not meant to be, this film can actually be fun to watch as a hilarious parody of scientific world events.  Visually and content-wise it wears thin after about a half hour.  Grady Harp, November 06</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>This film is enjoyable if you watch it in a dark room so that the images pop from the screen. If you leave the lights on, you will find that you can barely see what's going on. So much of the action is shot in the dark that you will find yourself squinting and getting seasick. The action is OK, but the first hour of the extended version is pretty boring. Much of the dialogue and story are copied from Alien, Aliens and Predator. The Rock is entertaining and the musical score also rocks. Brace yourself for the seizure-inducing action sequences that copy the video game (you are the camera, running down corridors, shooting cannibal zombies); it's migraine time.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It's not the greatest sci-fi horror movie ever, but I liked it. I'd say it's the second best film adaption of a video game after Resident Evil: Apocalypse. If you're an FPS game freak, there's lots of game references in this movie to amuse you all the way to the end. A pretty decent videogame adaption.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the future, a research station on Mars is under attack with a race of sub-humanoid alien creatures who are attacking people. An elite military team from Earth led by Sarge ( Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock)with Reaper ( Karl Urban) and the crew go to Mars to investigate these strange murders done by the creatures and must outwit then terminate these hellish creature whom can also make people into zombies.<br /><br />Inspired by the popular game series, this is a very entertaining and action packed Sci-fi horror action thriller with decent acting and cool monster effects by the legendary Stan Winston ("Jurassic Park", "Predator" and "Aliens"). The movie may not have much brains but plenty of brawn to please the action lover anywhere and the unrated cut is even better with more gore than before, the special effects are very good and there's a very cool "First Person shooter" sequence which makes you feel like your in the game, this is one of the better game adaptations with "Resident Evil" and "Mortal Kombat" unlike Uwe Boll's films, "Street Fighter" or "Super Mario Brothers".<br /><br />The Unrated DVD has footage not shown in the original theatrical cut and has some good extras like a look at the "First Person Shooter" sequence in the movie, a look on the creation of the monsters, a featurette on how Sarge's monster make-up was made, a look on the phenomeneon that started it all, and behind the scenes.<br /><br />Leave your brain at the door and have a good time with "Doom", recommended if you like no-brainer action flicks, Sci-fi with horror in it, "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers", "Aliens" and "Predator".</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I had low expectations for this flick, however I was surprised to see a film above the average game/movie conversion. The overall ambience is very, very dark (literally) and it tends to drag slightly somewhere in the middle. Also, there are many sequences that borrow heavily from the 1986 movie -ALIENS-, but nevertheless I was pleased with the overall rendition (the first person shooting sequence is very intriguing). Overall: DECENT to GOOD! (more like 3.5 stars)</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>oh dear this was truly one of the worst movie going experiences of my life. let's take this into consideration, since the masses of unintellectuals will think this is: "dude this was the sickest movie ever, it was so amazing, just like the videogame man." No, really it wasn't.<br /><br />1. 'Doom' series is out of this world gaming experience. I think the masses will agree on that. That is why they made the game into a movie. Duh.<br /><br />2. The Rock = Disaster in any genre.<br /><br />3. One of the most painful experiences of my movie going life. It was like adults who have never acted before got together to shoot their own movie, with some 'ok' special effects. Stan Winston this wasn't.<br /><br />4. THIS WAS NOT TERRIFYING. This was not scary. It is supposed to be Scary, it is supposed to be REALLY, really scary. Remember how terrifying Doom 3 was, I mean honestly. The music, the bloodstained walls, the smears of matter and inards on the walls. I really didn't get that in the film. I mean how could anyone?<br /><br />5. Put Arnold in The Rock's role and a great supporting staff and it could have racked in more loot and been much more belivable from the video game transfer to live action.<br /><br />5. Please buy the movie for the satisfaction of destroying it with a sledgehammer afterwards, it's really that bad. I wont have it anywhere near my sci-fi collection.<br /><br />The Rock ruined the movie, he has no perceptual understanding of any technique, Meisner or the like. He really is an awful actor, which added to the total bombardment of this truly sickening film. What a waste, what a farse. I am truly dissapointed. And no true sci-fi or video game to film fanatic, could possibly think this was anything less than a C film.(take Silent Hill for example in comparison to Doom; brilliant!)</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Well here is another video game adaptation movie and it's pretty good. i've played doom for the 64 and the game rocks. i thought that they would of screwd up the movie. To my surprise they did a good job. and the rock is awesome. Good movie</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>I am a fan of almost Sci-Fi movies and video games, so am predispositioned to rate even "bad" movies as at least watchable. Sadly, this is the group Doom falls into. The premise is fairly straight forward and those who played game will likely enjoy seeing the monsters "fleshed out"  (pun intended :-) but it loses a lot in translation from game to movie.<br /><br />"The Rock" turned in a strong performance and perhaps saved the film almost singlehandedly. The special effects were great in some parts and fairly weak in others, which leads me to believe that there was more than one production company working on the CGI elements.<br /><br />Overall, it is watchable and even enjoyable if you are fan of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Doom (Unrated Widescreen Edition)~ Karl Urban is an alright shoot them up movie with an alright plot. The special effects are quite good. The acting on the other hand is terrible and the Rock acts like he went to hollywood upstairs acting school. I love the doom cam that we get in the end and I wish somehow that the movie would have played alot more like the computer game (which I love). The music is alright but it sounds like the generic shoot them up grunge metal and is not all that inspiring. Still and all this is an adequate shoot them up movie that should not be missed. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>I never played the game, but watching this movie made me think this is how the game must look like on the screen. If you like The Movie Alien, you might like this. Some of the same feel to it. Moments of on the edge of your seat suspense before all out action. Seemed more like a made for TV movie or direct video. But it is still worth watching. If you are not a big fan of the game...rent it. I borrowed it from the library.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>There's a problem on Mars.  At a remote scientific research station, something is happening.  People are dying.  A Special Ops team is called in to contain the situation and retreive top secret research data.  Leading the team is Sarge (The Rock), a gung-ho, shoot-first-ask-questions-later-if-he-feels-like-it soldier.  Reluctantly accompanying him is Reeper (Karl Urban), searching for his sister Sam (Rosamund Pike).<br /><br />What they find on Mars is a disaster area.  The few survivors left are scared, worried...but their troubles have just begun.  For there are horrible secrets here, secrets so profound that the soldiers may be forced to take whatever means necessary to keep them hidden.  But secrets may become a moot point...for the troubles of this isolated Mars research station may soon find a new home...on Earth...<br /><br />I didn't come to this movie with high expectations.  I grew up on "Doom" the game (I wasn't a fanatic, but there's something cathartic about blowing away demons with your precious BFG), and so I seriously doubted the ability to transfer it to the big screen.  In part, I was right; this isn't your video game, despite some attempts to recreate the first-person shooter format (which, surprisingly, isn't as cheesy as you might think, and is indeed somewhat enjoyable).  I expected wooden acting, fake-looking monsters, and a by-the-book plot.  Well, the plot is what you'd expect (if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all, and so forth), but the monsters are genuinely disturbing, if not outright terrifying, and the acting is much better than would be expected.  Also, there are some unique plot twists that help raise this movie above its peers.  Is "Doom" the absolute best sci-fi/action/horror movie ever?  Nope.  It's not as revolutionary as its namesake, but it IS a darned good popcorn flick, and much better than many of its kind.  If you like the genre, you'll definitely like "Doom."</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>First of all, to like this film, you have to get past the idea of video game movies being Oscar awards winners and then I think you will enjoy video game movies more. Out of all of the movies based on video games that has ever come out, this is the best, especially in it's genre. I loved this film in theaters so I had to buy the DVD, and I have to tell ya, this movie wasn't any less exciting. I love it.<br /><br />Urban and the Rock do an excellent job in this film. The plot of the film has been somewhat changed, the biggest change being that the monsters aren't from Hell in the film, but overall an interesting story that makes sense. The special effects are done perfectly and the scenery really does set the mood.<br /><br />No this movie isn't going to win any huge awards, but why would you think a movie based on a video game would? I have been a fan of the DOOM video game series since it's first release, and I can speak from a fans perspective that fans will definitely love the game. If I could sum it up in one word, I would say that this movie is fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Could have done with out the nude doll [wether she be alive or dead] and still can't tumble to the vulgar language [a guy thing? must be they can't articulate themselves].<br />Enjoyed the plot [game?? never saw it] great acting by Urban, the Rock and the rest - I can take the blood and guts - thoroughly enjoyed the features with the make of the monsters and Rock's make-up explanation - and their training in weapons.<br />Have great admiration for any man in the Special Forces and their abilities.<br /><br />Never did figure out #24 - it's use - super people??<br />Did so enjoy the plot - the pace - the inhumans [or whatever] - the dark side of it all.<br /><br />All right for most? adults? sure not even a teenage movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>When one contemplates watching a movie like DOOM, surely ones expectations are always pretty low.  Lots of gory sci-fi action is probably all one can hope for.  DOOM provides a fair dose of that...but it also provides other, less welcome aspects...mostly involving guys with big guns walking around dark, steel corridors doing nothing but looking anxious and sweating.<br /><br />I understand that action scenes and such are pretty expensive to make, particularly when they call for convincing CGI monsters.  But to pad the story to feature length by filling it with interminable scenes like this makes the whole enterprise virtually fall apart.  Having just seen the "unrated director's cut" at 1:53, I would say the film EASILY has 30 minutes of utterly unneeded padding.<br /><br />Set in the future, a group of marines is dispatched to a research station on Mars, where a significant portion of the base is on lockdown after some kind of mysterious, violent event took place.  The marines, led by "Sarge" (The Rock, before he had gone to being Dwayne Johnson and playing a Tooth Fairy) are a typically diverse group, with nary an original character in sight.  Karl Urban is the nominal 2nd in command, and it just so happens that his estranged sister (Rosamund Pike) is a scientist at the station.<br /><br />They poke around for awhile, and after a LONG time, find some monsters and the gunplay commences.  And it all feels like little more than a third-rate ALIENS rip-off.  Monsters appearing behind marines, above marines and below marines.  Our characters picked off one by one.  A conspiracy that implicates the scientists in some pretty shady experiments.  And so forth, from one unoriginal idea to another.<br /><br />Again, that would almost be okay, because it's the action we came for.  But until the last 15 minutes or so, the action feels complete rote and uninspired.  Fortunately, the film goes from being a complete waste of time to a mostly complete waste of time when it finally turns into a direct homage to the classic video game on which it is based.  (In case you didn't know, DOOM was an early - and extremely successful - "first person shooter" where the game is played as though through the view of the player.  You see your own gun in front of you and move through corridors and chambers, shooting everything that moves.)  Urban takes on this view and for about five minutes, we get the fun of seeing a beloved, but very old, video game brought to life.  It even emulates the flowing style of the character moving through space...a movement that it trying to emulate real life but doesn't quite.  This is good, clean fun...something the rest of the film misses.<br /><br />The performers are all unremarkable, even Pike, who bounces from these modern action films (DIE ANOTHER DAY) to high-quality projects like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and her wonderful work in AN EDUCATION.  Urban is bland and The Rock is all attitude and no real character.  The special effects were also merely adequate, and the soundtrack was all generic blaring techno.<br /><br />In summation, there really isn't a good reason to see this film.  I had VERY low expectations, and even those were not met.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.<br /><br />It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.<br /><br />Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.<br /><br />The Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Doom is the most recent cinematic rendering mined from the video game industry and, like all films with a horror element,  it's better viewed in the dark.  A Marine squad responds to a frenzied call for help from a research facility on Mars and comes face to face with monsters. Led by the intense, military-to-the-core Sarge (the Rock), the marines must prevent the ravening demons from accessing "the Ark" teleportation device and gaining entry to our world.<br /><br />Dusted off from the science-run-amok department, Doom is yet another cautionary sci-fi/horror tale, replete with hackneyed characters, familiar uglies in the dark and a formulaic storyline. Somehow, though, I found myself having a good time watching this one. The Rock isn't about to win an Oscar or Emmy any time soon but his alpha male screen presence is undeniable. Karl Urban does yeoman's work as the conflicted John Grimm (codenamed Reaper), adding some depth to his kickass marine character. Icy Rosamund Pike (from James Bond's Die Another Day) detachedly plays Samantha, a forensic archaeologist and Reaper's sister. But she's nice to look at.<br /><br />If you've already seen the vastly superior Aliens or even Resident Evil, then Doom will hold no surprises. Heck, even if you haven't seen the above movies, Doom still won't catch you unawares. Still, there's a tiny morality play acted out just before the film's climax that kinda came out of left field, as well as an unexpected arc of one of the leads that I didn't see coming. The much touted first person shooter segment is pretty cool and places the audience smack-dabbed into the Doom video game universe.<br /><br />The special features aren't shabby: an extended first-person shooter sequence, as well as its "making of" segment; an amusing "Game On!" piece gives the viewer strategies and tips on how to play Doom 3; "Basic Training With the Rock" shows how the cast underwent a special forces mini-boot camp; and the nostalgic "Doom Nation" details the history of the various Doom video games and their effect on gamers and fans. I wish, though, that the Rock, Karl Urban or Rosamund Pike had done a film commentary.<br /><br />Gamers and other fans familiar with Dooms 1,2 and 3 are understandably upset that the movie version strayed so far from the games' original story. But persons with no prior knowledge of the game or those screening it purely as a cinematic experience will get a kick out of this monster-go-"boo", shoot-'em-up film.</p></br></body></html>

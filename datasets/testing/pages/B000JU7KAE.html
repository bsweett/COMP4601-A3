I think it's great. It has drama, humor, suspense, fun characters, decent fantasy, horror....you name it. This is a real sleeper of a film."<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is really as the hotel manager "Cleveland Heep" and Bryce Dallas Howard is believable, if you will, as "Story, the "sea nymph." As long as those two dominated the screen, the movie was great.<br /><br />Then - wham! - just like that, it got stupid. All of sudden, half of the motel residents - even though some of them are a hoot - got involved with the two main characters and it became ridiculous. They all assemble with this "sea nymph" bedtime story character and start playing all these ridiculous roles as "The Interpeter," "The Guild," "The Healer," etc.<br /><br />The movie seems to go from an intimate suspense-fantasy to a grab-bag of crazy New Age weirdness. Within five minutes, I almost lost all interest to keep going.However, I'm glad I did because it settled down when this group-effort doesn't do the trick and things gt interesting, once again.<br /><br />All in all, I just took as a pure fictional fantasy Tinker Bell-type tale and let it go at that. I think this is one of the those films that could easily be over-analyzed and overly interpreted with all kinds of analogies and metaphors. I would just look at it as entertainment, and nothing else. On that level, it succeeds. It's weird......but it surely entertains.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>It's not fair to compare every new M. Night Shyamalan movie to his magnum opus The Sixth Sense, and yet more than with anyone else in the business, this is what happens to this man each time he releases a film. I told myself I wouldn't compare Lady in the Water to anything else, sat back and gave this one a chance, and I thought it had charm. I liked the feel to it, the colorful cast, and the way it leaped right into its tale without wasting time in explaining how this reality-shattering event came to be: in Shyamalan's hands it simply WAS. I don't regret buying this DVD and think if it's taken for its own merits, Lady in the Water is enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This is a good family flick with a fairytale quality. When a sea nymph travels to land to help men escape some of the depravity they've immersed themselves in, she touches the lives of some very unique personalities living in an apartment building. The nymph completes her mission with the help of the apartment handyman/manager, but her return home is hindered by a wicked wolf-like creature determined to destroy her. Beautiful story!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I watched this at the local second-run theater. I'm not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, especially after The Village, which I thought was a dud. When I went to see this one I was skeptical, but I figured it was worth the gamble of $2.50. Overall I can't say I was impressed, but I must admit that the storyline was intriguing and the characters, if generally shallow, were entertaining. I particularly liked Reggie, the guy who works out only one side of his body "as a scientific experiment". Shyamalan himself, who normally puts in only cameo appearances in his films, played a surprisingly large role in this one, but he should stick to writing and producing, not acting.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought Shyamalan did a good job of developing the character of Cleveland Heep, played by Paul Giamatti, who in turn did excellent work bringing this character to life. I also enjoyed some of the special effects, such as the scrunt lying in the grass with its red eyes aglow. Finally, the little plot twist at the end, such as it was, gave this film that little nudge over the top from being a total snoozer to being worth seeing.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be some great allegory? Maybe Shyamalan meant it that way, and I certainly see how some viewers can interpret it as such. As for me, I wasn't looking for that, so I didn't pay much attention to the potentially allegorical elements of it. I was watching it for raw entertainment value on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Did I get my $2.50 worth? Yeah, I think so. Would I watch it again? Probably not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Has M. Knight Shyamalan lost his mind?  Is he a mad genius or just loopy?  Has he created a masterpiece or a mess?  These are the questions I'm still grappling with after watching THE LADY IN THE WATER.  This is most interestingly beautiful, confusing, and downright strange films I've have ever seen.  Wow, trying to come up with words to explain what's going on in my mind after watching this film is impossible.  I'm not sure if I've seen the future of the cinema or the end of a popular director's career.  But I do know that THE LADY IN THE WATER cannot be ignored.<br /><br />I think walking into this film, I had many preconceived notions.  I know what an M. Knight Shyamalan film is, or at least what it's supposed to be.  But  THE LADY IN THE WATER challenges every one of those notions.  There's no surprise ending, there are very few scares, and the film feels sloppy, half-hearted, overly confusing, and I understand why most will dismiss it.  This is a movie that can't quite be nailed down and since the film bucks any and all convention.  It's easy to find the conventional  flaws everywhere.<br /><br />The acting is disjointed, the plot is a mess, the dialogue is overly simple, the story is far too complicated and it all combines into something that seems pieced together on the fly.<br /><br />It feels almost as if Shyamalan has drawn a line in the sand.  This line is all logic. This line is how far he expects us to go, and then out of nowhere the line suddenly falls apart.  Shyamalan pushes us so past the line, it's easy to just give up.  I think the line comes at a different point for each of us.  The  line disappeared to me when the little boy begins to read cereal boxes.  It is so weird, so out of left field. This was at that point in which I had to decide if  I should give up any semblance of logic and just give in to the sheer absurdity of it, or whether I should give up and pan it.  Where that lines falls with you, may decide if you have a positive reaction to the film or not.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or maybe not.  A "Narf" named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) shows up in a pool at The Cove, and apartment community in Philadelphia.  What's a "Narf?" Well it's kind of like a mermaid with human feet, or maybe more like an angel or a muse that lives underwater, both would be appropriate.  Anyway Story is rescued by The Cove's resident superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Story is looking for a writer who's written work will cause a positive change in the world forever.  On that trail Cleveland must protect Story from an evil creature bent on destroying her.<br /><br />But what is this movie exactly?  It is a bedtime story come to life. It's a  fanciful yarn, a child's story and a wild imagination run amok.  Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film, THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale, it's not a terribly cohesive, and demands that the audience put the pieces together.  I liken it to the weird tales I created with my action figures as a kid, or a nonsense story that a first grader may try to write.  It's not designed to be pulled apart, just experienced at that moment.  None of the pieces  quite fit, a lot of times if feels as if the film is grasping for straws.  Sensing that it's lost most of the audience it gives into its oddness, and it revels in it. But is that by design?<br /><br />The other side of the coin is that this is a badly made movie.  It's the wild ranting of an over zealous personality.  The first credit you see as the film comes to a close is "Written, Produced, and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan" and since he's been so successful maybe this film is an example of what happens when you allow a director too much room, and no editorial comment from the studio.  Maybe this is a self-indulgent vanity piece, a sloppy mess of a movie that would have been easily dismissed had it not been created by Shyamalan himself.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know where I fall.  I think I want to see the movie again.  But I like the notion that this could be a step in the right direction for film as a whole. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time.  I'd hate to realize that there is nothing there because it would rob that odd sense of madcap joy I experienced with the film.<br /><br /> THE LADY IN THE WATER is the perfect remedy for what's wrong in Hollywood.  Even if you hate every single moment of it, it encourages strong reactions. Whether that reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored.  So at this moment I think I will argue that THE LADY IN  THE WATER is a brilliant film.  That Shyamalan will get ribbed for it now, but will later be rewarded with a strong cult following.  It's easily the best film I've seen all year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I loved this movie.  Sure, its not as great as the Sixth Sense or Signs, but it makes you believe in the characters and the world.  Paul Giamitti is one of my favorite actors and after this performance he needs an Oscar, he carries this whole movie on his shoulders and makes it great.<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is going:  Oh, it wasn't scary it sucks.  Name one other scary movie Shymalan has made besides the Sixth Sense.  None.  Signs was about faith and believing.  Unbreakable was about becoming what you were meant to be.  The Village was about realizing there is sorrow in the world.  None of those scared me, but I loved them all because M. Night Shymalan took me to that world and made me believe.<br /><br />The critics are way off on this movie.  I've read hundreds of reviews for differrent movies and the critics will say:  This movie follows the basic action plot, with no surprises blah blah blah.  Then this movie is made with originaltiy and style and the critics go:  What the heck this is stupid, I don't get it.  I don't put much value in critics anyway.<br /><br />Overall M. Night Shymalan has crafted a well made movie about loss and finding your place in life, you just have to be willing to believe.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Breaking away from the suspense movies with a twist that have made him famous, M. Night Shyamalan's latest picture is a charming picture full of hopeful yearning and powerful cinematography.  Most simply put, the film is a fairy tale set in a modern day setting.  That makes sense since the film is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan told his own children.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) a janitor of a local apartment complex.  Something happened to Heep's family several years ago and it's left him a humble, but broken man who stutters.  While trying to catch who is messing around in the swimming pool at nigh, Heep falls in and discovers he has been saved by the lady in the water.  Her name is Story and she is a sea-nyph, or narf, sent from the Blue World to deliver a message.  She has to find a writer and Cleveland agrees to assist her.  But, things aren't that simple.  An evil creature from the Blue World, a snark (a creature that looks like a giant wolf, but with a covering that looks like grass), has followed Story and tries to kill her when she's supposed to return home.  Story only has one last chance to get home, but she can't do it alone.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is perfect as Cleveland Heep.  I might be mistaken, but Giamatti has now become one of those actors who makes every movie he is in better just because he's acting in it.  Bryce Dallas Howard seems a little old for the role of Story, but the mysterious gaze behind her eyes captures the innocence suggested in the part.  Shyamalan himself plays a large supporting role as the writer Story is seeking to meet, Vick.  In the past, Shyamalan has put himself in his own films, but only as a minor character.  In this film his role is central to the story and he does a good job of portraying the struggling actor who will write a book that will change the world.<br /><br />Shyamalan uses a lot of great cinematographic techniques to support the fine acting performances and wonderful plot.  For instance, there is a scene where Cleveland and Vick attempt to talk to Story in the bathroom, but through an interpreter (Vick's sister). In this scene the camera pans above the room from Story to Cleveland and it's an amazing shot.  There are also a lot of interesting shots done underwater.<br /><br />THE LADY IN THE WATER is a departure from the type of films that Shyamalan has made before.  I also know that he received a lot of criticism for this film because of his tight artistic control over the project.  Therefore, there was a lot of negative criticism about the movie even before it arrived in theatres.  People wanted to pan the picture even before seeing it.  Nevertheless, the film succeeds.  It is a fairy tale set in a modern setting.  Since the death of Jim Henson, there has never been a director who has been able to make a fairy tale movie and do it right (Terry Gilliam could have, but he's never tried).  Shyamalan has finally done that.  He has done it and done it well.  All the elements of a fairy tale are there as well as many of the themes that Shyamalan delved into before in SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.  This movie is about faith; about how things have a purpose.  This movie is about love and hope.  It is about living a life to the utmost, even though everything around you seems to tell you otherwise.<br /><br />THE LADY IN THE WATER is a great movie.  It might not have done very well at the box office, but I predict that it will gain a huge cult following in the next few years.  Next to SIGNS, it is my favorite Shyamalan film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>Jonathan, a friend of mine, and myself were sitting in our cushioned seats before both Superman Returns and Dead Mans Chest were about to roll through the projection reel. As "rated pg-13 for frightening moments" appeared I whispered... "Lady in the Water." Jonathan smiled and said, "No way you can tell what movie it is just by the rating..." "LADY IN THE WATER" appeared a few seconds later.<br /><br />I am a huge Shyamalan fan, as most everybody and their mother likes to say. I have been eagerly, no, EAGERLY awaiting his newest film, and what I will say - may astound you. It is rediculously rare that a movie is almost solely relying on the name of its director to succeed. Lucas, Spielberg, Lynch, Donner, Eastwood... Just a handful and a few others. But in this case we still have a relative newbie. Since 98 four films have been released that have at the core been imaginitive and original. Though, in this film a character (a critic no less) points out that, "There is no more originality, its a sad fact but we must accept it."<br /><br />I say all that to say this: I will not describe the DOZENS of steps this movie takes to get from one point to the other. I won't Describe the creatures, nor the hidden agenda for which everyone is a part of. No, I will only say that I liked the movie. But then again, I liked Solaris... as my friends fell asleep.<br /><br />I liked it because it is a farely pure tale of hope. (Though contrived) Also, Giamatti's character is astounding to me. And believe it or not, the movie is very funny. No, not unintentionally. Some may think so. This is not his best film by any standards. I give that award to Signs, which is tied for my all-time favorite movie (with Awakenings by the way). Everyone likes movies for different reasons, the rest you can discover.<br /><br />The Dislikes would have to be, and this is my soapbox, DON'T BRING OUT THE EVIL CREATURE, NOR THE GOOD CREATURE, OUT EARLY IN THE FILM. Jaws, Signs, Close Encounters... Come On!! I feel like he broke his own rules. I KNOW that he actually does this to a certain extent, but the payoff is so fast that its more of a blur than an enjoyment. I didn't like how the "Bedtime story" is actually an epic that has to be spoken quickly and often. It's more like "Cliff-notes to the history of the Narf society". I was able to keep up, but I am afraid others will have issues.<br /><br />There is a scene in Lady in the Water that is so touching that it stands alone as a really great moment that Paul Giamatti's character has before the end. Really powerful. Also I loved the opening shot/scene after the cave drawings. You heard right. I also loved the fact that in the movie there is no outside world, only the apartment complex. That sense of solitude is what made Signs so great.<br /><br />Lady in the Water is a movie that I recommend because to me, its good. Though there are times where Shyamalan blatantly has his characters speaking about THIS MOVIES could-be-problems. But hey, movies should be about the experience, and I enjoyed mine, though I am sure before Lady in the Water finishes its run there will be many a candybar scraped from the screens. Here's hoping for the next Shyamalan film, may it be a movie that people don't expect a twist... then has one anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>After "The Village" we learned (many would argue, the hard way) to never make any assumptions about a M. Night Shyamalan movie going by the trailer. "Lady in the Water" falls into the exact same category. Simply put, if you liked "The Village" you will like this one. And if you didn't like "The Village" you won't. Because there are many similarities in both movies. But having said that, "Lady in the Water" is a lot more eerier and "out there." This is by far Shyamalan's least commercial film, as if by now he knows that he's established his fanbase and can therefore make any type of film he wants without concerns of whether it will do well at the box office or not.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the plot of "Lady in the Water" but I will say that this movie definitely has Shyamalan's trademark suspence and creepy atmosphere, up until the very end. The creatures aren't seen often but when they are the special effects are quite convincing. As with "The Village," the entire movie takes place within a confined space. This only adds to the tension, something I'm sure Shyamalan fully intended.<br /><br />I did not like everything about this movie though. The moments of humor seemed awkward to me, way out of place in the context of the film. Same goes for a few characters who were completely absurd (ie: the guy who worked out only half his body). I'm not sure what Shyamalan was trying to convey with these scenes and characters. I found Bryce Dallas Howard's performance rather phoned-in, having only one single expression and talking in a monotone. I know, that's what her role called for. Still, I liked her a lot more in "The Village." And then there's the signature plot twist at the end, which of course I won't reveal. I can't put my finger on it, but it felt lacking to me.<br /><br />I really give "Lady in the Water" 3.5 stars but will round up to 4 because I believe M. Night Shyamalan makes movies that have a lot more substance than the trash that's passed as movies these days. "Lady in the Water" is sure to divide reviewers here...I don't foresee many 3-star reviews. You will either like it or not like it. And maybe this movie will grow on me even more with repeated viewings. In any case, I haven't stopped thinking about "Lady in the Water" after seeing it today, and that to me is a sign of a successful movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>What a strange and lovely film from M. Night Shyamalan. Sad, sweet, funny and frightening. A group of misfit residents in an apartment complex called The Cove find their destinies when their lives intersect with a water nymph named Story. Paul Giamatti will make you cry in a poignant performance as a man who has lost his family through violence and who finds a purpose in life that he could never have imagined. M. Night Shyamalan performs in the film and he is arresting. Highly recommended. The special effects are unbelievably good. A special, spiritual film. You will like it if you are into M. Night Shyamalan's films, otherwise, you may find it not to your taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition) is a strange fantasy movie that centers around a handyman (Paul Giamatti) at Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers who discovers a naiad like creature named Story. The acting is not great and the storyline falters. The movie seems really long even though it only is 110 minutes, it seems much longer. It was universally panned by critics and was nominated for worst movie at the Razzie awards. It is not a 1 star movie but a since I can not give 1 and a half it gets a very weak 2. Not recommended. 2 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Long past due for viewing on my list, partially due to mixed reviews, I finally made it to watch this movie.  It is part fairy tale, with beautiful visual effects, but also a morality tale for disillusioned adults. Translucent Bryce Dallas Howard, brings to us a mythical lady whose unusual appearance in the apartment complex wakes up its tenants from their mundane if not unhappy lives.  Her presence gives them all new purpose - which while not clear to any one of them at first - still keeps them together in their efforts to help an enigmatic stranger.  They all find talents and purpose they could not see in themselves before and they act as "band of brother" -just trying to do the right thing.  Paul Giamatti brings wonderful performance that is both delightful and hillarious at times.  Writer/director Shyamalan is expressing himself as an artist of wide range, not just a capable director.  There is a lot of talent in this young man, he should let it grow at it's own pace and not rush it.  That way his next work will in fact earn 5 stars instead of 4 (like this one).</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Lady In The Water" is great! M. Night Shyamalan's (also has the role of Vick Ran) screenplay and directing is excellent! Paul Giamatti (who worked Howard's father on "Cinderella Man" (2005) & Bryce Dallas Howard (who worked with Shyamalan on "The Village" (2004) are excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who has done the music on Shyamalan's films since "The Sixth Sense" (1999) is excellent! The cinematography by Christopher Doyle is excellent! The film editing by Barbara Tulliver (who also film edited Shyamalan's "Signs" (2002) is excellent! The casting by Douglas Aibel (who has done the casting on Shyamalan's films since "Unbreakable" (2000) is excellent! The production design by Martin Childs is excellent! The art direction by Stefan Dechant & Christina Ann Wilson is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to Shyamalan's "The Village" (2004) is excellent! The costume design by Betsy Heimann is excellent! This is another great effort from Shyamalan, who is more original than any filmmaker in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Just by way of background, I've been a M. Night Shyamalan fan since I first saw The Sixth Sense. I thought that Signs was underrated and was totally surprised at the way in which the critics panned The Village--a film I found quite rewarding. Therefore, despite my hearing bad things about The Lady in the Water, I paid little attention and obtained the new release anyway. I regret to say that conventional wisdom was right in this instance because this production is terrible. The plot is contrived and it moves far too quickly to register as being compelling or believable. I found myself incapable of suspending disbelief due to tale's inherent ridiculousness. As for Bryce Dallas Howard, her presence was strong in The Village, but she's a weak sister here. It's not her fault really as the movie fails at nearly ever level, but, personally, I'm not sure she has the beauty to be a Hollywood principal actress. All of that aside, I still love Shyamalan as a director, but this one is best forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I'd basically give Lady in the Water ** 1/2. It's well acted even if everyone just talks as if they're reading the script that exact same moment. I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies but he has actors act so emotionless in his movies where they basically just talk like robots through most the movie.  It's like he's after getting wooden performances from his actors. I'm surprised he hasn't worked with Keanu Reeves yet.  His only movie that wasn't like that was probably the Sixth Sense. I also loved the under-rated and unappreciated Unbreakable and Signs as well. I never minded the slow paces of his films because they always led to something good. Here we just get a lot of talented actors talking and trying to help the  Lady in the Water (Bryce Dallas Howard) but without them or us even knowing why they wanna help her. The talented  Paul Giamatti just trys to figure out how a story book goes and what it has to do with her. It's like he just found her in his pool yet he knows she has something to do with that book. Well that's how it seemed to me anyway, like everyone just decides to help her the second they meet her.<br /><br />  Giamatti is good in every role he's in and is good here too but his performance is the best thing about the movie. It's him that really has your attention the whole time in the movie. Everyone else isn't bad but they aren't as captivating as Giamatti. I guess Dallas Howard is a little too but all she really gets to do is make a blank stare with a scared look on her face through the whole thing. M. Night Shyamalan has to make an acting appearance in the film as well of course but he needs to give that a break already even if he is a decent actor. I mean Alfred Hitchcock just made small appearances in his movies, he didn't cast himself in supporting roles.<br /><br />  Plus his movie critic character seems to be actually talking about M. Night Shyamalan movies. I mean he knocks a movie that has nothing but people just speaking their minds unrealistically through-out the movie. That sounds a lot like this movie..... I have to admit that when his films come to life at the end they always manage to get me teared up but I think that's just the power of James Newtown Howard's musical score abilities. The scene that his score gets pumped up is when it's reveiled who the guardian of the Lady in the Water is and that scene's what got my tears going lol. It's the most lively and well done scene in the movie even if it is a little silly. But it probably wouldn't of had that effect on me if it wasn't for the musical score.  M. Night Shyamalan should just make those Unbreakable sequels that he had planned. I mean he didn't make them due to bad reviews but the Village and Lady in the Water probably got worse reviews. So he might as well make Unbreakable sequels because at least that was very well liked by some people like myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>LADY IN THE WATER is a very tough film to review.  M. Night Shyamalan is doubtless a new thinker and has produced some original and interesting films (none of which equal the promise of his first one THE SIXTH SENSE) and LADY IN THE WATER has some very good aspects.  It is just such a mixed bag, full of holes and hints of personal vendettas that it ultimately fails to achieve what it sets out to do.<br /><br />The opening sequence tells a tale in charming line drawings about how we all used to be water people but how man gradually went on land, gained money and power, and became estranged from the purity of the water people: the ladies of the water will try to return reason to the land people but the journey will be fraught with danger.<br /><br />Transfer that tale to real time and we find the disconsolate manager of an apartment house Cleveland Heep (a brilliant, stammering Paul Giammati) whose rules for the building dwellers include no smoking and no swimming in the pool after seven evening.  He discovers a swimmer in the night pool, rescues her, learns her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and gives her a Gilead in his meager room.  He discovers with the help of one of his tenant's Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) hesitant mother that Story is a narf, a creature from a bedtime story who is sent from the Blue World to imbue reason to a certain man (One who will return 'civilization' to mankind) and then return to her world on the wings of an eagle.  Heep takes it upon himself to find the One who will allow Story to complete her mission, protecting her from the monsters in the night that would destroy her plight.<br /><br />In seeking the One, we meet the buildings tenants: Reggie (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) bent on working out only one side of his body (!); Mr. Dury (the always fine Jeffrey Wright) who is committed to solving crossword puzzles with his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey); a Mrs. Hill (Mary Beth Hurt) who seems to have spiritual affinities; the odd Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin) who foresees things; a newspaper critic (Bob Balaban); a writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), who appears to be the One who will answer the goal of Story, and his sister Anna (Sarita Choudhury): and a bizarre group of smokers and a family of Hispanic immigrant sisters.  All of these characters are woven into the conclusion of the bedtime story as we watch the intial tale come to resolution.<br /><br />It plays better on paper than on film as there are so many loops and problems with the plot that it becomes silly.  But the film is saved by the actors, Giamatti especially, who makes us love him and his very troubled past shrouded in secrets, and Howard who truly does allow us to suspend disbelief in her otherworldly portrayal of the lonely and needy water nymph.  You simply have to be in the mood for this kind of film and forgive Shyamalan his oversights and vanity, and if you can do that it is a pleasant little diversion. Grady Harp, December 06</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>There is something strange going on at an apartment complex in Philadelphia. Sprinklers keep getting set off and building super Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) hears splashing noises from the pool at night. One evening, he finds that these noises are being caused by a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) residing in the water. He befriends her and comes to learn that she is a narf, a fragile fairy tale creature from the Blue World, trying desperately to return home. But, first, she has a purpose she must carry out here in the "real" world. She must locate the Chosen One, a writer who will someday change the world (guess who plays that role?). A nightmarish monster called a scrunt is after her, intent on keeping her trapped in this world. The stuttering, unassuming Cleveland Heep and several apartment tenants band together and attempt to help the despairing damsel in distress. But things get even weirder and more frightening when they realize that they, too, are part of a bedtime story. According to storytime lore, the narf can summon to her aid a Protector, a Guide, a Healer, and the Guild. Somewhere in the building are these people, somehow having been drawn to the narf. Cleveland must find them before time runs out.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (Sideways) is perfectly good as the everyman lead character and he carries the movie as best he can. His Cleveland Heep is no macho hero; he is very self-effacing. He's the kind of guy who passes you by on the streets without eliciting a second of your thoughts. And he has a secret. The willowy Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village, Book of Love) imbues her character Story (yes, Story) with a sense of otherwordly presence. In regarding Story, adjectives such as "waiflike," "gossamery," and "ethereal" inevitably pop up. The third character to make an impact on me is Bill Irwin as Mr. Leeds, the pompous movie critic who delivers a humorous monologue before getting his come-uppance.<br /><br />Writer/Director/BooMaster M. Night Shyamalan has had his share of cinematic homeruns (The 6th Sense, Signs) and strike outs (Unbreakable, The Village), so I didn't know what to expect walking into The Lady in the Water. After two hours, I walked out with a perplexed feeling of "Huh! Is that it?" This definitely is a beautifully crafted movie in terms of how it looks on the screen. But it's a mess. Shyamalan clearly has things of deep meaning he wants to convey but his story comes off as stilted, contrived, and a bit self-serving.<br /><br />I found myself drowning in the writer/director's feel-good formula of destiny and belief in one's sense of purpose. Done right, I would've welcomed his message. As it is, it comes off as pretentious. Shyamalan's world building (fairy tale building?) here is poorly done, with storybook details coming abruptly out of left field. Cleveland has a question about something? Boom, just go to the disgruntled Asian mother in the building, who has extensive knowledge of the narf fairy tale. The pace of the movie is plodding. There are too many onerous, drawn out sequences wherein Cleveland just knocks on doors and has conversations with tenants. These talks do pay off in the end, but c'mon...some editing, please. Too much time is spent on Cleveland trying to riddle out who exactly are the archetypal characters who will save Story. I also found it astounding that everyone in the film instantly took the fairy tale premise in stride. In the last half hour or so, the film becomes even more unfocused as people who, before, only had fleeting  moments of camera time now all of a sudden become key to the storyline. And don't tell me you didn't see the identity of the Healer coming a mile away.<br /><br />Shyamalan, fortunately, still has the ability to take you on a creepy excursion in his spook house. He still knows how to mesh musical score, camera angles and built-in viewer anticipation to set up a good scare. There were a few times when I almost jumped in my seat. But, sadly, these moments are not enough to tide the movie over. Also, the ending felt a bit too abrupt. Instead of being a clarion call to the imagination, Lady in the Lake muddles up the pool and leaves you treading water in the dark.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Well, yes, actually I do. As I've said, it's still a beautiful movie and its heart is in the right place. And it's worth watching for Paul Giamatti's riveting, masterful performance alone. But, yeah, it could've been better. Three and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When reading customer reviews for M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, I see plenty of words like "believe" and "underrated" in the postitive reviews of the film.  Well seriously folks, what is the point of trying to let your imagination run wild when the film itself is abysmal and crafted by an ego-maniac?  Contrary to many, I didn't hate his last film, the Village, like everyone else did, and as far as his previous films go, ranged from decent to excellent.  Which is why I'm scratching my head at Lady in the Water, because while it still features his stylish touch (somewhat), the story is ridiculously inane and non-sensical (I don't care if this is supposed to be a fairy tale or an homage to fairy tales, there are so many plot holes and leaps in logic that it just gets inexcusable), poor Paul Giamatti gets saddled with the hapless lead role and his talent is wasted to boot, and the rest of the cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard as the mythical creature and rising star Jeffrey Wright, range from wasted to annoying in their roles.  Not to mention that Shyamalan himself gives himself the most screen time he's had in any of his films, with the ego-mania just smoking off the screen.  Although the offing of a film critic offers some chuckles, Lady in the Water is an incredibly bad film that even the most die hard of Shyamalan fans will find hard to enjoy.  And as far as letting your imagination run wild, maybe we shuld all imagine that he had done a better film than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I had heard the critics pan this movie, but I didn't believe it could be as bad as they said it was. However, it is that bad - and worse. I'm not sure how Shyamalan could have come up with such a soggy mess.<br /><br />In his DVD commentary, he tells us that the plot was taken from a fairytale that his children enjoyed hearing him tell over and over. Either something got lost in the translation to a screenplay, or else Shyamalan's children have very strange taste in fairytales. Because really, there is no tale here at all - except maybe a fish tail. It's a hodgepodge of mismatched elements.<br /><br />The Queen of the Sea pops up out of a swimming pool - languishes in a faint in Paul Giamatti's apartment - while some great clawed beasts lurk on land acting as (what is it?) sentries or predators - and some great clawed birds in the air wait to carry the Queen back to the Sea. All these clumps of plotline snarl together like matted seaweed. There's only one elderly Asian woman in the apartment complex who knows the whole truth of this Oriental myth, and she metes out incoherent pieces of it to Giamatti when she feels in the mood.<br /><br />Even the setting of this movie is vexing. The courtyard apartment building where Giamatti works as manager/maintenance man is an uneasy combination of the stage set for "Rear Window" and an open-back doll's house.<br /><br />The only thing that was done right here was to cast Bryce Howard as the sea maiden. She has the requisite watery look. But having a look isn't enough to carry the picture. Believe the critics and deep six this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>What if your destiny was laid out for you? Sure you have choices but the choices are brought about with one purpose in mind and surrounding events cause you to make the only plausible decision.<br /><br />Lady in the Water offers a classic tale about a battle between good and evil. A group of close-knit tenants whose purpose in life comes down to a single moment in time where they can work with one another to bring two worlds long separated, together. Their one purpose, to protect the lady in the water.<br /><br />The lady in the water is a waiflike nymph who inspires writers to write, men to be brave and love to bloom. Her mission is to be the bridge between the land and water dwellers with the hope of opening the lines of communication that have been broken for centuries.<br /><br />As can be expected from M. Night Shyamalan, there are lots of twists and turns as you try to decipher each character's role. The film is sublimely shot and truly suspenseful, counting on the viewer's mind to increase the intensity instead of over the top blood and guts.<br /><br />I was expecting to learn more behind the scenes secrets in the special features but still highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Lady in the Water" is M. Night Shyamalan's bedtime story about a lonely apartment building janitor named Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) who lives in a cottage by the swimming pool and who befriends a narf named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard).  A narf is a sea nymph from stories from eastern mythology.  I would say specifically from Korean folklore since what we learn about narfs come Mrs. Choi, Choi being a popular Korean surname, except that Shyamalan made up the narf as a bedtime story he wrote for his children, which he then turned into this film.  So when you go online to learn out more about narfs and the whole mythology behind them, you are not going to find anything.<br /><br />Cleveland knows that somebody is taking unauthorized dips in the pool late at night, but he has never been able to catch them.  Instead when he learns why our mothers told us no running around the pool, he is rescued by Story.  She tells him that she is a narf, but not what that is, so he does some investigating and uncovers what she is up to, which leads to more questions and more investigating, and finally to the need to do something to help Story get back to the Blue World.  However, the problem at the heart of this film is that Cleveland and the residents of the apartment are acting out a bedtime story that they do not know and not knowing it presents problems for figuring out what to do.  Getting people to believe is not particularly a problem in this film; getting them to understand is the fly in the ointment.  Tell people they are caught up in Cinderella and they can figure out who is who (e.g., Leonardo da Vinci is the fairy godmother in "Every After").  Trying to get a show of hands as to who would be part of the Guild and who would be the Guardian is only get to get you blank stares.<br /><br />I know that there are people who totally detested Shyamalan's previous movie, but I liked "The Village," although to be more specific I really liked Howard's performance, which I thought should have been nominated for an Oscar (most people who hated the film readily admitted her performance was excellent).  So it did not surprise me that he would want her in his next film, but Howard is given relatively little to do beyond looking pale and wet.  She might be the title character, but this is Giamatti's film and it is his character that has the big moment, relatively speaking.  Still, "Lady in the Water" is devoid of the memorable moments that I usually find in one of Shyamalan's films.  I had watched his previous four films in the last week to prepare for this one opening today and this is simply the one of those things that is not like the others.  It is probably not going to garner any new fans for Shyamalan, and the serious nose tweaking he gives film critics is not going to institute influencing enemies either.<br /><br />The opening of the film reminds me of the prologue to "Watership Down," in establishing the mythology behind the story we are about to see.  But whereas Richard Adams had a whole series of stories about El-ahrairah, Prince Rainbow and Lord Frith, all Shyamalan has is what we see and hear about here.  Part of the problem is that as soon as you understand what Story is up to it raises all sorts of questions about the past.  Well, okay, it does to me, but probably younger members of the audience will not be as bothered by such nonexistent details, which serves as a reminder of who it was that Shyamalan came up with this for in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>To begin with, I'm not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, so I'm not writing a bad review because I'm disappointed in this film compared to his previous endeavors, although his other films are clearly more critically appreciated and arguably better written and executed.<br /><br />The acting on all fronts is superb - Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard stand out in their respective roles as a depressed apartment manager and some kind of mermaid fairy tale figure.<br /><br />The cinematography of the entire film has a kind of greenish-blue hue around it which makes the film beautiful visually, but stunningly disappointing story-wise. A mermaid appears one day in the pool of the apartment complex, and the apartment manager sets out to try to get her home.<br /><br />What follows is an inanely repetitive story line in which Paul Giamatti repeatedly asks an old woman about an ancient myth. Each time he learns something new it then happens in real life. In trying to move away from his secret twist endings, it seems Shyamalan moved so far away that he  decided to spell out every step of the film without a surprise to be found.<br /><br />This leaves the viewer as bored as Shyamalan must have been writing the script. After over two hours of watching what you've just been told is about to happen, viewers will find themselves ready for the film to end in its predictable way so they can get on with their lives.<br /><br />Unless you're really interested in M. Night Shyamalan, Bryce Dallas Howard, or boredom, stay away from this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>I just finished watching this movie.  Let's start by saying I love Night's movies.  Some of his movies are "so so." I thought for the beginning of this movie, "why did i buy this movie?" "I can't believe I bought this movie." "This movie looks stupid."  Because from the beginning, I didn't want to buy this movie, but I did, only because of the fanbase. Was I disappointed?  No.  Was it Night best film?  No. Overall view is this:  Creative!  Think about it? A story "within" a story. I kind of got this feeling from this film that it wasn't "directed" towards everyone. It was almost like a "child like thinking" for a kid who loves mysticals. It is a bed time story that supposebly came to life. Hello, Creative!  I thought one cool part of it was, "trying to find who's the characters"  After the movie, I didn't feel that "awe factor" but I felt like it was pretty good. In order to really like this movie, I had to think "ok its just a bed time story" That's it! lol its not based on a true "story" It was a guessing game from almost the beginning.  Just like any bedtime story, you were intrigue to find out what was going on, who's who, and how will it end.  I like it, but it's not my favorite Night film, but I'm happy with the purchase!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Lady in the Water was quite a bit of a disappointment considering his other masterpieces (!) such as Signs, The Others, The Village, and Sixth Sense.<br /><br />The movie sheds light on an apartments' superintendent who comes across an unusual girl in the complex's swimming pool.  Soon enough it becomes evident that there is more than meets the eye in regards to... both of them.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond "below average," and then there's the great music!<br /><br />In short, The Lady in the Water is really nothing great.  You might want to wait till they show it on TV. 2.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Night Shymalan really needs to develop a new outline for his movie plots. Remember the stencils we used to get as a kid? The ones with all the cut outs on a single sheet of mylar....No matter how many times you used it, you were fortunate to be able to create the same images over and over again.<br /><br />That's why the director has done with this and his other films...<br /><br />Lady in the Water follows basically the same template as "Signs"<br /><br />"The Village" and "Unbreakable" are basically the same as "The Sixth Sense". All of these films are so very similar to each other that it is impossible to really get excited about any of them and his propensity for delivering films using this same template dillutes the very fine film that was The Sixth Sense (although to be honest it was really an homage to many films from the 1940's).<br /><br />Ronnie Howard's daughter is some sort of a water nymph who has to find someone in this world to save her in order to conquer some sort of gobbeldy gook of a creature made of grass. In order to do so, the apartment manager to whom she reveals herself must gather a group of people together to fight this evil. Confused? Don't worry, you'll be bored.<br /><br />There are several false endings and in the end there's not a whole lot of satisfaction in having stayed through the end. The characters are just that. They aren't fully believable - and in some cases, some are downright offensive in their stereotypes.<br /><br />Really not worth bothering.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>M. Night Shymalan's 'Lady in the Water' is good at taking a mundane existence, like life at an apartment complex, and lifting the veil off the supernatural world.  He works to build a bridge between two worlds: childhood and adulthood, the ancient and the modern, myths and the tangible, the factual presence as we know it and the supernatural.  In 'Lady in the Water' he does all of this skillfully, but often leads us to make our own conclusions.  And sometimes there is explaining to do, and sometimes there is too much explaining,...<br /><br />We begin with an apartment manager and maintenance man, Cleveland Heep, (Paul Giamati) who is recovering from the grief of losing his family to violence, changing jobs from doctor to  work in a Philadelphia complex (called The Cove, and looking a lot like a hotel).  He is confronted by a mysterious woman* who comes from "the blue world" via the complex's pool.  He believes she is drowning and dives in to save her life.  She ends up saving his.  In his apartment, she tells a marvelous tale of a ritual she must fulfil to escape danger and be promoted in her own realm by an eagle.<br /><br />Interweaving stories and possibilities are revealed by the colorful tenants who all believe in this magic, coincidentally enough, and try to protect and free the woman from the menace of "the snarks," another mysterious Shylaman monster out in the wilderness.  All the ritual must come properly together.  She is some sort of mystical force that will transcend all the evil of the world, but how that manifests itself is not entirely clear. Yet, all of the tenants are convinced.<br /><br />The movie is as hypnotic as most of his works are.  Shylaman keeps our interest and suspense, but he doesn't always satisfy this time around.  There are genuinely scary and funny scenes that create a decent entertainment, but it doesn't always add up.  Unlike his masterpieces, 'Wide Awake,' 'Sixth Sense,' and 'Signs,' he doesn't flawlessly tell his story or mesmerize our senses to an admirable conclusion.  However, some of the essential flaws of 'The Village' are noticeably absent, too.  There are also some of the same elements you find in most of his movies:  the bitter person in need of healing, the child who is more perceptive than the adults, the other world that contrasts our own..., etc.  'Lady,...' is a perceptive, but flawed creation by the man who has replaced Hitchcock in post-modern films.  Who else could make it plausible that there is a mystical nymph  making a visitation from the local swimming pool?  There is also a lingering sense of archetypes that are well-drawn and haunting--like always.  He bridges the gap between both worlds convincingly enough, but here he just doesn't do it as well.  This is a recommended movie with some major reservations.<br /><br />*Her name is "Story".  With "Cleveland Heep," how 'bout the prodigy Mr. Dury renamed Mr. Crossword, etc.?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Now that all the negative press, the poor box office, the stories about why Shyamalan moved this film to Warner Bros, the stories about Shyamalan's supposed meglomania has died down a bit, it was time to see "Lady in the Water."<br />I am a big fan of Shyamalan's work particularly "The Village." Most of his films have been box office successes until this one and though "LITW" definitely has some problems: the plot is too complicated and the storyline too convoluted, overall it is  very thoughtful,persuasive and touching...very much a fairy tale, very much a personal, emotionally available film from Shyamalan.<br />For many, all this business about the Blue World, the Narf (a resplendent, totally believable, vulnerable Bryce Howard as Story), the green creature whose goal it is to kill her, etc, etc. is negligible at best and silly and off-putting at worst but there is also no doubt that Shyamalan is committed to this material, casts it perfectly (Paul Giamatti as the man who protects, discovers and leads Story's return to the Blue World, the excellent Jeffrey Wright as a  crossword puzzle addict whose son holds the key to Story's return) and films it with obvious delight and love.<br />"Lady in the Water" is not a great film nor is it Shyamalan's best: what it is, is a charming little film about our need for home and the comforts derived therein. Shyamalan also has the sense to steal from the very best: in this case "The Wizard of Oz" and his take on this material, as usual is pristine, his moviemaking above reproach.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>In a Hollywood world where no idea is original, M. Night Shyamalan captures his creativity in a bottle, putting it into words, images, and emotions. Many critics pan his movies. Why? Do they ever lack originality? No. Do they ever lack emotion? Certainly not. Though the plot of Lady in the Water may be unfathomable in terms of "reality," it's original. No one knocked J.K. Rowling for creating a crazy world of wizards and muggles: M. Night deserves the same respect. So perhaps the critical dismissal of his work is something that needs to be reconsidered. This is visually and emotionally stunning film. Each frame in the film is a delicate picture, and Shyamalan's eye for detail reveals his genius.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, a stuttering apartment super who dutifully does his job, never complaining and always willing to help. One night, he slips and is knocked unconscious by the pool, only to awake in his apartment with a half-naked girl sitting on the couch opposite him. The girl's name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and she tells him that she comes from the Blue World. She needs help. She must look into the eyes of "the vessel," a person living in our world because this fateful meeting will awaken something inside this person, something that will be the seeds of positive change in the world. But there are evils looking to stop her. Scrunts are red-eyed creatures that live in the grass, and they'll kill Story if they get the chance.<br /><br />It's no secret that "the vessel" is a writer played by M. Night himself. And the book his character is working on is one that will not be appreciated in his time because everyone is a critic. (And the critic who lives in the apartment complex is appropriately dealt with near the end of the movie.) And everyone has something negative to say. I refuse to say anything negative about this movie. Because I can't find anything negative to say. The script is original-- a bedtime story that Shyamalan created for his children, full of childlike wonder and mystery. Leave your pre-conceived notions about Shyamalan at the theater entrance. Rediscover your inner-child and simply enjoy the movie. Is it really so hard to do? Is it really so hard to not be a cynical critic?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>I own this on DVD and I really like the added extras but, you won't miss out if you only rent.<br />The story takes unexpected twists and it's a pretty fun and creative story.<br />Some of the characters were a little annoying but, hey 4 stars is still a good movie.<br />Other than that, you will enjoy the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan doesn't do plain movies. As an artists he has his own unique approach of seeing extraordinary tales in mundane things whether its aliens, mythical beasts, ghosts or a mysterious azure pool. This tale is like no other, perhaps can be thought of as a tale of good and evil, of human purpose, common ground and understanding. When a mysterious pale woman with red hair saves an apartment superintendent, who looked like he gave up upon falling into the pool, simply because he didn't see a purpose to living, she brings hope and a sense of purpose to him and other tenants. Together they try to figure out who she is and why she came into their lives.<br /><br />Story, is the name of the woman, perhaps those who save the Village, recognize her as the blind brave daughter Ivy Walker, takes on another roles this time as a narf, a word that does not really exist in an English dictionary but a word that takes on meaning by the time the movie ends. She is a fairy like creature that is on a mission and needs help from Cleveland Heep the stuttering superintendent who loses his stutter and finds his true calling. She needs to find a safe passage back to her own world, which is guarded by an evil wolf like beast, invisible to all but those who know how to find it. Together all the characters have to decipher the answers behind what she says and in all reality they have to save the modern world. She tells one of them that he will be a great orator and his book will change the world, cease wars and bring peace, she tells another that he can heal; others learn that they will have profound impact on the feuding life and who will improve life around them if they take the risks and do what she says.<br /><br />This was a visually stunning and memorable movie, with hair rising music and some really jumpy special effects, especially with the wolf. Yes there are monsters and there are casualties but then there is a sense of purpose, of a mystery coming together brought upon this mysterious creature, who in my interpretation is an angel. She brings hope and love and unites those who sulk and lose their touch. It's a beautiful story that leaves one thinking long after leaving the theater, a story that feeds the soul and feeds a hungry mind ready for something different. It's a fairy tale that leaves one feeling good and light, with hope and understanding of the future. M. Night Shyamalan is such a fantasy wizard that no matter how outrageous his stories are they have a ring to truth about them. I can't wait to see what he cooks up next, for he is fabulous for those who like something special.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>An apartment building superintendent named Cleveland who discovers a magical sea-nymph named Story  who's been transported to this world and is living in the building's own swimming pool. As this bizarre revelation sinks in, Cleveland becomes enraptured by her other-worldly charm. As he shelters her in his apartment, other inhabitants of the building begin falling into place as representations of characters from an Eastern myth in which these mermaids, or "narfs," co-exist unhappily with more beastly and violent characters. In human reality, the forces of darkness that threaten the heroes of a fairy tale prove to be much more terrifying, and the victory of good over evil is by no means guaranteed. "Lady in the Water" has a wonderful cast, the script is well written and at times funny, the plot is very simple and straightforward but towards the end of the movie is quite touching.

The story revolves around a sad disillusioned man, Cleveland Heep, who has given up everything after the loss of his family.  Heep discovers a mystical creature, a narf, in the pool of the apartment complex he manages.  Malevolent forces lurk in the gardens around the pool which she must be protected against.  Ultimately this magical creature must be restored from whence she came.  This quest to save the narf ends up involving many of the oddball yet normal apartment dwellers Heep has come to know over time.  In the process of saving this creature, he find his own redemption and possibly hope for the future of our world.<br /><br />This move has an enchanting storyline with intricate plot twists.  The main stars, Paul Giamatti and Bryce Howard, are perfectly cast. Shyamalan plays a small, yet compelling role in the film. The look of the film is unadorned-these are ordinary people pursuing ordinary lives.  There is humor and pathos in the lives of these people.  Yet, when galvanized by the hope of something out of the ordinary and an opportunity to do good, these "normal" people gather around and give their all.  In essence this film shows the magic of the everday.<br /><br />This is a  fairy tale on film-with all the strangeness and skewed logic of the fairy tale world.  Not for those who are looking for a slick Hollywood film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Although it's another genre-bender, writer/director M. Night Shymalan's "Lady In The Water" represents a significant departure from his other movies.  While films like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" were dramatic horror-thrillers, "Lady" pulls back the reigns on the frightening and 'traditional drama' elements, and adds in fantasy and a soft humor to its thriller core as the other main ingredients.  Of course, like the director's other movies, it also adds in dashes and undercurrents of other styles, but in essence it's the shift from darker territory into something more fairy tale-like that gives this one its unique identity.<br /><br />  The manager of an apartment building (Paul Giametti) finds, in the swimming pool of the building, a water nymph in human form (Bryce Dalls Howard).  Coming from an alternate world called 'The Blue', the nymph (named Story) has been sent to our world at this crucial time in human history to deliver a message to someone who's destined to play a pivotal role in the near future.  Story doesn't know who this man or woman is, but is supposed to be able to sense it when she encounters them.  And the quest to find this person is the basis of the movie.  Complicatinng the mission is that the nymph hasn't come into our world alone, but has been followed by malevolent predatory creatures (I think they were called Narfs, but I'm not certain) that can perfectly blend into grass and other greenery and emerge either stealthily or explosively.  These beasts were comvincing and highly original, and could have been used to greater horror effect, but "Lady In The Water" went subtle on the darker elements so as to open the movie up for little kids to see too.  Not a bad decision at all, although it would still be cool to see the Narfs turn up in another, more horror-oriented movie - not a sequel necesarily, just something that shares the same mythology.  The building that most of the movie centers around is populated by an interesting ensemble of characters, most of whom have some eccentricity or other to them.  These players are drawn in, first as Giametti and Howard 'scout' different people to see if they're the one, and later as a number of them are recruited into the quest.<br /><br />  When this came out last year, an awful lot of the pre-release talk focused on the lack of big marquee-name stars, and on the fact that Shymalan himself was cast in a significant role.  Interestingly, relatively few people seemed to want to discuss whether the performers who were cast did good jobs (which they all did, Shymalan included), just whether the abscence of household-name performers would hurt the movie's box office (uh, that one was an affirmative too, unfortunately)  Kind of indicative of how the peripherals surrounding a movie (who got payed what; what the studio's marketing strategy is going to be, etc.) seem to be getting bigger than the movies themselves at least in the eyes of a lot of the media outlets.  But I digress.<br /><br />  "Lady In The Water" is a great, original fable, drawing elements from enough different styles of moviemaking and storytelling that it should be pleasing to a wide range of tastes.  Not only thought-provoking but dream-provoking, this one makes a great addition to any DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>I have seen every M.

No matter what you think of him or his films he will no doubt always give an interesting story and he does so with Lady in the Water. Like one of the characters say in this film "the world no longer has any originality" I definitely agree. With Lady in the Water you get complete originality with a weird array of characters. Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) plays a building manager of an apartment complex that unexpectedly becomes part of a living fairytale.<br /><br />Only thing is you truly don't know if there will be a happy ending or not. While patrolling the swimming pool on a late night Cleveland slips on the wet cement and falls into the pool. He wakes up on his couch to a pale woman with red hair (Bryce Dallas Howard) sitting across from him. She tells him her name is story and that she is scared so he lets her stay for a while. After a bit he carries the sleeping story outside so she can return home but Cleveland is chased back into his home by a wolf like creature. Story won't tell Cleveland too much as she doesn't truly know everything herself. Cleveland finds out from one of the tenants a story that sounds similar to what's been happening around him. He realizes that Story is just trying to go home and that the creature does not want her to go and will kill her before she can get the chance.<br /><br />Unlike the trailer for "The Village" what you see in the trailer for "Lady in the Water" is what you get in the film. No real big plot twist, Shyamalan left the movie the way it was without the crazy twist. He even has a bigger role in this film and it was a lot better than his past appearances that he's known for. The story itself is what you'll truly appreciate this movie for. Shyamalan put everything together so well that you start to forget that it's totally unreal for these events to happen. It's a type of story that has been done plenty of times in films like "Kate and Leopold" or even for kids something like "A Kid in King Arthur's Court". "Lady in the Water" is done in such a serious manner that you can't really compare it to those other films. The film gets more exciting and interesting as it goes on and more characters start to participate.<br /><br />The apartment complex gave Shyamalan a plethora of characters to work with and he added them very well. Somehow he gave each of them a purpose in the movie and it didn't feel overcrowded in any way. This movie was done with great style that makes it very entertaining. The score and pacing were done in a way that made it feel serene but still got you into the film enough to keep watching. The cinematography is very well done, perfect colors to make the feeling of it complete. This is a movie I would definitely recommend to some but not all as not everyone will be able to let their imaginations go to truly enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan lifted me into a dream world filled with thrills and hope, yet grounded me with a bond to humanity. NOT predictable, Lady in the Water is a film above films, a truly 'realistic' fantasy to follow. Every character is finely developed, interesting and endearing. Comical moments, tear-jerking scenes and edge-of-your-seat suspense pulled me into this film. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. An invigorating cinematic experience. Well-worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Let's start with the cinematography. Every frame of this movie is bewitchingly beautiful and mystical. The whole gist of this movie is that a woman, found in the pool of an apartment complex, is part of another world; a world of others like her who have a purpose in their race. her name is "Story" and she comes up to the surface to find her purpose. Paul Giamatti plays a perfect lanlord/custodian "Cleveland Heep." He has a troubling past but somehow finds his purpose by Helping Story find hers. The whole story has a mystical fairy tale for a new generation feel to it. It resonates with the slow-pacing/ alfred hitchcock directing style that were so familiar with from M. Night. This is surely a "Must own" movie that you'll watch again and again. If you loved "Unbreakable", then you will fall in love with this one. It's a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece from the master himself. He really makes you believe that it really could happen.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Ignore bad reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>According to Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), the enchanting and mysterious sea nymph from the Blue World, "All beings have a purpose." She has come to the world of land dwellers at tremendous personal risk to awaken our world to this knowledge. However there are unseen evil forces lurking in the shadows that wish to prevent Story from accomplishing her mission. Only by revealing the Symbolist, the Guardian, the Guild and the Healer can Story be saved and the rest of mankind as well.<br /><br />`The Lady in the Water' ('06) is rather slow and surprisingly predictable but it also exudes an almost ethereal atmosphere that's unexplainably appealing. Coupled with a haunting soundtrack, the film succeeds in drawing the viewer inexorably into Shyamalan's mythical landscape. Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderfully enigmatic and Paul Giamatti once again proves himself to be one of the best actors on the scene today.<br /><br />My rating: 3 1/2 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>The prose for `Lady in the Water' is an intriguing one.  I was excited to see Shyamalan tackle a fairy tale.  I mean, Night has hit a slump since `Unbreakable' and for some reason I still flock to his films crossing my fingers and praying he gets his mojo back, but `Lady in the Water' si just further proof that he tries way too hard.  What's sad is that this has so much potential, but Shyamalan was too concerned with making a point (the point being that he can do whatever he wants in this industry) and failed to give the story a solid point.  Add to that a film littered with many other faults and you have a big problem.<br /><br />The first problem is found in the underdeveloped, or maybe it's overdeveloped, story.  The fairy tale that this movie tells, about a sea-nymph or narf who must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians is somewhat exhausting.  But Shyamalan didn't stop there.  You have to add to that the fact that there are humans who must help this narf escape the skrunt's.  Each of these humans has a specific title or job.  There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.<br /><br />With all of this here you may wonder how so much could mean so little, but when each persons role is far from explained it makes it difficult to give it much meaning.  So, for every `overdeveloped' plotline it, in a sense, comes of `underdeveloped' because it just flat out makes no sense.  In a way I feel that this is another attempt on Night's behalf to throw one at his critics.  In the film, as all know, there is a film critic who meets an untimely end, but before that happens he makes a comment about how all films are predictable and that there is no originality in cinema today.  Well, Night is attempting to disprove that by giving us the opposite of what is expected...the only problem is that Night forgot a key element to making any film memorable...it needs to make sense!<br /><br />Now that you've processed all of that, we can move onto the next problem.  This is found in the characters themselves.  They all, every one of them, seem na?ve and childish.  It makes no sense that no one would question the reality of what is going on.  Even Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) who in the first scene of the film says that creatures don't exist, doesn't even question whether or not this girl is just plain delusional.  It baffles me that everyone wants so desperately to believe this whole thing is real, which is not the way any normal person would act...and maybe that's why this apartment building is littered with strange and abnormal people.<br /><br />Another problem is found in the acting.  I normally love Paul Giamatti but here he's somewhat annoying, especially his stuttering which comes off too rehearsed, unnatural and, for lack of a better word, bad.  Bryce Dallas Howard was sensational in `The Village' but here she comes off distant and stagnant.  She lacks the commanding energy she gave to her previous role but she just kind of slips away into the background.  Bob Balaban as that arrogant critic Harry Farber is ridiculously clich&eacute;d, Jeffrey Wright sounds like he's reading cue cards throughout the film and Freddy Rodriguez is pitifully used and abused in a thankless and ridiculous role.  The shock to me was M. Night Shyamalan who to me was the better actor here, and that was something I never expected.  Cindy Cheung was also fine, I mean at least she was funny, and Sarita Choudhury was decent if not underused.<br /><br />When you add these disappointments together it becomes harder and harder to find anything good about this film.  The visuals are stunning in comparison to the horrid makeup and effects in `The Village'.  The skrunts and tree beings look pretty cool, scary even, but even they can't rescue this film from impending disaster.  The real sad thing is that Night had so much promise.  `The Sixth Sense' was one of the best films to come out in the past decade and it gave Night the boost he needed to make a name for himself and garner enough respect to make what he wanted the way he wanted...but sadly that power has been misused.  Instead of capitalizing on his strengths and turning out smart script after smart script, in an essence becoming the go-to guy for a blockbuster he ended up becoming the go-to guy for a international flop.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Kind-of a modern fairy tale, Lady in the Water is about Story (the title character) and her interactions with all of the film's other characters. Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard), a "water-being," is found in the pool of an apartment complex by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the complex's repairman. Heep, who has his own secrets/backstory, becomes involved in trying to aid Story in accomplishing her mission (to inspire a human who will go on to do something great) and then returning to her own world.<br /><br />The film is much about connectedness. Heep discovers that many of the apartment complex residents have a special role to play in Story's mission (with M. Night Shamalayan himself playing one of the largest roles I've seen him take on in one of his own films), and all the residents must work together to help the strange water creature that has stumbled into their midst.<br /><br />The film also has alot to say about the purpose of the individual - i.e. how we are all searching for our purpose, how we make mistakes, how we sometimes don't realize who we are until the fit hits the shan, how each person has a special importance.<br /><br />So, in a way, the film is about the critical nature of both knowing who we are as an individual and realizing that we are all interdependent - an indivisible group. The film's characters cannot achieve success unless they all work together.<br /><br />Giamatti, as usual, gives a great performance. There were a couple of strained moments (which is uncharacteristic of him, I think. He usually makes it look sooooo easy.), but overall, he was fabulous. Howard was good, too, and the quiet, restrained quality she has served her very well in this role (as did her very chiseled face - positively haunting).<br /><br />While, like most of Shamalayan's films, this one has strong elements of fantasy, I thought it was worth watching. I would not call this my favorite Shamalayan film (That would probably be either The Sixth Sense or Signs.), but this movie is in keeping with the types of films he produces. To wit, if you like his other films, you'll probably like this one. If not, stay away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>This is the kind of film I typically enjoy, even if others consider it average at best.  Oddly enough, though, the tables have been turned when it comes to Lady in the Water.  Frankly, I just didn't find this to be a very good film.  The story had potential, certainly, but M. Night Shyamalan's script, which involved way too many people coming together and accepting a most extraordinary story far too easily, is decidedly weak and flimsy.  And while I certainly understand that the events that play out convey many a metaphorical meaning, too much of what I saw seemed to be made up as things went along.  And for something that supposedly originated with a bedtime story for Shyamalan's kids, it's so bloated with characters and plays so fast and loose with the few rules most fairy tales actually follow that it loses its appeal pretty quickly.<br /><br />So, basically, what you have here is a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) named Story showing up in the dirty swimming pool of a seedy motel housing a really diverse range of tenants, from a grumpy, generally silent old man to Chinese immigrants to a film critic to a bodybuilder who only works out on one side of his body, etc.  Story is discovered by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building superintendent, a good-natured soul and just about the only sympathetic character anywhere in the vicinity of this film.  He takes Story in and slowly learns her story: she's a Narf who has left the Great Ocean temporarily on an important mission to change man's destiny, and she has to avoid some nasty Scrunts who want to stop her and prevent the Great Eatlon from carrying her back home - and, by the way, there's another creature called the Tartutic who scares the heck out of Scrunts.  And what is this grand mission?  She has to communicate a silent message to a young writer, played by none other than Shyamalan himself, whose book will basically save the world some day.  It's not hard to see why some critics point to Shyamalan's ego having run totally amuck, especially given the fact he included in the story an unlikable film critic mouthing only clich&eacute;s for no plot-related reason (but obviously for personal - not to mention childish - reasons).  One must remember that Shyamalan threw a hissy fit and took his fairy tale elsewhere when the perceptive folks at Disney pointed out that the story needed some serious revising.<br /><br />In the end, I'm afraid I have to agree with those who see Lady in the Water as a misguided product of Shyamalan's ego and filmmaking arrogance.  Talk about metaphors all you like, but the film's plot is basically nonsense.  At one point, Story - who can see the future - refuses to help all of her new friends by telling them who is supposed to represent whom, but she does agree to do the Yes-No thing when they ask her questions.  That's the kind of thing you expect to see in a sit-com long after it has already jumped the shark.  And I still can't figure out why everyone in the motel bought into Story's story so easily.  Paul Giamatti turns in a brilliant performance, but that's about the only thing Lady in the Water has going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Lady in the Water is a very quirky movie. Something's afoot, and I left the theater more puzzled than opinionated. I felt as if I'd walked out of someone else's surreal dream. (My children, 14 and 16, strongly disliked the movie. One of them poked me in the arm and said, "Lazy writing." Maybe we've talked about one too many films at my house.)<br /><br />So here's the multi-part deal.<br /><br />First, it's as if M. Night Shyamalan reviewed every book on screenwriting (actually, story writing generally), came up with a consolidated list of all the rules, and then consciously and studiously broke most (if not all) of them. Many of them are basic, and some of his approaches are genuinely cringe-worthy. For example, serendipity plays a huge role in this movie. The main character hears an otherworldly young woman mention that she's a "narf," happens to go to a Korean woman (who happens to live right upstairs) and asks her to look up a narf, she coincidentally recalls that her mother told her a bedtime story about narfs, and then we're off to the races. It turns out that her mother knows EVERYTHING about narfs -- and that this bedtime story she recalls becomes increasingly complicated to accomodate the movie's plot. Paul Giamatti's character (played with great earnestness) keeps going back to this Korean lady -- again and again and again -- to get more and more information about "narfs," "scrunts" (sheesh, my kids couldn't stop laughing over that word), a "Great Eatlon" (just a big eagle), and the "tartufics" (evil monkeys made of branches).<br /><br />Second, the movie depends on a fictional mythology that isn't terribly consistent -- with more than its share of contradictions and confusion. That's annoying, especially so, I think, for kids. My normally "quiet in the theater kids" kept nudging me with stuff like, "Hey! I thought they couldn't do that!" or "I thought anyone who sees those dies!" Frankly, after the exquisite and seamless logic of The Sixth Sense (which ranks among my favorite movies), Shyamalan's been on a downhill slide (although Signs was even more inconsistent and illogical than Lady in the Water).<br /><br />Third, the dialogue for some of the characters is either wooden (the Village-like lines of Bryce Dallas Howard are a good example) or mockingly stereotypical (Cindy Cheung, as a young Korean woman). I couldn't help but think of a Calgon commercial whenever the Korean characters spoke or interacted. That's bad.<br /><br />Fourth, Shyamalan's presence in the movie as a significant character (a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world, no less) was disturbing to me as a viewer.  First, his acting leaves much to be desired. Second, it breaks the plane of the story as an ever present reminder of the authorship, and as a personalization of the drama that seems especially out-of-context in a story full of symbols, metaphors, and mystical themes. It makes the movie feel more like Shyamalan giving a speech than telling us a bedtime story (which, apparently, was the genesis of the film). I expect that, for this very reason, few directors and writers ever appear as more than momentary cameos in their films. It puts them ahead of the story and the art, and that's rarely, if ever, a good thing. This, coupled with a thinly-veiled swipe at movie critics ("Cads! How could they know what's in someone's heart??? How arrogant!" or words not far off from that) suggest an author who is so mad he can't restrain himself, and had to jump into the movie to add punch to the attack.<br /><br />Okay, so why did I give this a three?<br /><br />Well, there's a sentimental side of me to which this movie appealed. The theme of this movie is that there is more to this world than is spoken of in science and secular philosophy (to paraphrase the Bard), and that each of us are part of a grand morality play (of sorts) in which each person's role has meaning. In other words, our lives have meaning of some kind. That theme appeals to a middle-aged guy.<br /><br />In addition, there is something interesting about the "form" of this movie. Although it has a splash of Matrix-sequel-style obtuseness and Terry Gilliam-esque oddness, Lady in the Water is a pretty original animal as far as films are concerned. It's odd, ideosyncratic, dream-like (as if a straight feed from the subconscious) and very personal. In fact, it's downright voyeuristic in tone -- as if we're listening in on some dad (who is a colorful, but not great spinner of yarns) telling his beloved children a load of nonsense at bedtime. And, in that nonsense, there is a grain of unspoken truth: that the world is weird, strange, and full of the "mystery of the ordinary" as one of the characters puts it in an "on the nose" line they warn you about in screenwriting books. In a "reality" of thugs, terrorists, and mothers drowning their kids, among other horrors, Shyamalan's odd world of vicious monkeys that keep the peace, delicate young women full of strange and wonderful knowledge, ordinary people with extraordinary skills, and giant eagles is a welcome respite. For all of its failures, and if we take off the armor of cynicism and sarcasm that we all seem to be wearing of late, it's pleasant fare.<br /><br />In the end, Lady in the Water has, for me, the feeling of a solo effort in which the writer/director/star made very little effort to consider or incorporate the thoughts and opinions of others.  There are, obviously, both good and bad points to such an approach, but few people possess a sufficiently wide range of talents, abilities, training, and life experiences to take on three such critical roles in one project and create something well-crafted, immersive, and accessible to the audience. Shyamalan isn't there yet, but I'm glad he's trying -- pushing the studio envelope and our expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The tightrope that filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan walks with this audacious 2006 fantasy is a precarious one at best, and I was hopeful that his risky undertaking would yield dividends despite his recent track record. While there are some compelling elements, the film is ultimately done in by its contrived execution and lugubrious pacing. Much of the basic problem comes down to the insistent way that Shyamalan applies the brooding atmosphere of his previous films to what is essentially a whimsical fable about maintaining community and believing in one's own potential. These are worthy themes to pursue but not in the convoluted quagmire of faux-spirituality that he presents here.<br /><br />Based on an elaborate bedtime story concocted by Shyamalan, the plot centers around Cleveland Heep, a pensive, stuttering apartment superintendent who obviously has more on the ball than his job would indicate. After hearing splashing in the complex pool over several nights, he discovers a sea nymph named Story, who comes from the Blue World. The rest of the movie focuses on how Cleveland learns the detail of the myth behind Story (apparently a Chinese-based fairy tale) and enlists various apartment dwellers to help him find her way home. At the same time, Story inspires a tortured writer to find his way toward greatness as grass-tufted wild creatures lie in wake to do her harm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shyamalan chose to populate the apartment building with stock characters meant to represent a societal microcosm, hiring and then wasting several fine actors to play them including Jeffrey Wright as a crossword puzzle expert, Bill Irwin as an agoraphobic bookworm, and Bob Balaban as a cynical film critic. Easily the most self-indulgent move comes from the filmmaker casting himself as the writer. Rising above it all, however, is Paul Giamatti who leverages his well-grounded, self-deprecating humanism to give Cleveland more gravitas than the screenplay warrants. In the impossible role of Story, Bryce Dallas Howard has the right opaque look and plaintive manner, but she is given little latitude beyond that.<br /><br />Production values are top-notch, especially the otherworldly cinematography by Wong Kar-wai's favorite cameraman, Christopher Doyle. It appears all this talent has been directed toward a film that tries fervently to be uplifting but ends up inert. Given the coincidence of Howard's appearance, one cannot help but look back fondly on her father's satisfying film, "Splash", which took a similar premise but added warmth and laughs. The 2006 DVD has plenty of extras though surprisingly no commentary track from Shyamalan. Instead, there is a multi-part, 34-minute making-of feature, "Reflections of Lady in the Water", as well as a brief short, "Lady in the Water: A Bedtime Story" in which the director discusses his children's book tie-in. Less worthy are a few deleted scenes, a useless gag reel and a rather odd audition tape of various actors retching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>First off I'd like to say I'm M. Night Shyamalan's fan. I love all of his works although I haven't met a person yet who'd like them all. Some prefer "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs", but don't like "The Village", others adore "Unbreakable" while being sceptical about "The Sixth Sense"... I love them all. And I never had prejudice about this "twist thing" - when I knew "Lady in the Water" would be a totally different picture, without usual Shyamalan's tricks, I was OK with it. A director doesn't need to repeat himself all the time and stay in the framework of the genre he created (may I suppose so) to be successful hereafter. And when I heard annoyed exclamations "A film about a mermaid? That must be crap!" I told those people to wait till they see the new work of almighty genius. And boy - did I make a joke on myself...<br /><br />You know the story, I think, so there's no need to repeat it. But I must say when I was leaving a theater I was thinking: "So what did he want to tell us with this?" And what's worse I still didn't come up with any answer. If "Lady in the Water" was supposed to be a fairy-tale for kids, it's so dull, motionless and deprived of any action that kids would be falling asleep in theaters. Besides there's a couple of really scary and jumpy moments apparently not suitable for kids. And if this is for adults... Well, what was this that I saw?! We got an unsophisticated and plain story that goes nowhere with practically nothing going on, and almost with no sense. I read multiple reviews and articles to catch this sense, to find some interpretation. And I found nothing. Just idle and void sentences about how people unlearned to see good things in life and how "Lady in the Water" is not about fairy-tale itself but about how people tend to percept fairy-tales. So what? Actually I didn't have a chance to see that in the film. And even if I did - what an absurd idea of a movie.<br /><br />When I said about the genre Shyamalan created I was talking about his pictures meant for wide audiences, his films are still pop culture but shaped to bear some higher meaning, some idea. Like "The Sixth Sense" was about how a person can absolutely not see what's happening around him and how a boy with seemingly big problems helped main character to discover his own, much bigger problems. "Unbreakable" was about how our life may not be exactly what it seems to be at first glance and about some personal overcoming. "Signs" was about that nothing in life is accidental, that everything has its reason and finally - that there is God. "The Village" was about how good intentions and seemingly right choices sometimes lead us to what we try to avoid so much. It's about life itself which has its own rules and which is doing everything its way.<br />All Shyamalan's thoughts were always wrapped in a glittering thriller paper and it worked just fine. Shyamalan who until this moment had made only four big pictures became one of those directors who are capable to attract audience to the theaters with just his name in the credits. With all my respect I think people didn't come to see his movies because of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Mel Gibson and Adrien Brody. People were coming to see M. Night Shyamalan's films. "Lady in the Water" also has a great cast. So what? It just perishes in a mediocre movie with no sense, no sparkle and no life. "Lady in the Water" has great cinematography and music. So what? It has a lot of cinephile jokes and allusions e.g. the episodes with the critic. So what, so what, so what?<br /><br />There was a moment when I started thinking that maybe I'm just stupid and don't understand anything. But then I thought that usually I understand movies besides I couldn't find any intelligible opinions about "Lady in the Water". I'm far from thinking Shyamalan was a big soap bubble that just bursted with a thunderous bang. I will pretend I didn't see this film and wait for his another work.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>I love this movie. I'm sure you already know the basic plot, so I'll spare you a rehash. It is hard to describe how this movie just roped me in; It is a film of many emotions and layers; It was a pleasure to watch the events unfold in this modern fairy tale. Paul Giamatti was one of the main reasons this worked so well for me; He plays this part so convincingly I never really questioned the plot; I was impressed with the way he interjected both humor and sadness into his character without it ever seeming contrived. The visuals and cinematography captured this apartment world perfectly. The 'colorful' characters(some were better than others)were used nicely, and it was interesting to see how they all came into play during the course of the movie. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this; It is something fresh and original in a time of many ho-hum, so-so movies. Many will be upset this isn't more of a 'horror' movie; I'm glad it wasn't. Plus I'm a sucker for anything with alot of rain...Do I dare say this is M. Night's most inspired movie yet? Sure, why not.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Although I wasn't laughing that much, people throughout the theatre including my wife found this film quite funny. No question, Paul Giamatti as Cleveland delivered an excellent performance and his character was the cause of most of the laughter. The story itself is about a bedtime story that becomes reality for a particular group of people. The message of the film is very good, namely that every individual has a purpose in life and in the universe, and that each person is of value -- a message that is not subtle, but communicated rather obviously.<br /><br />The problem that I have with the film is that there's no real surprise factor that takes your breath away like e.g. in the Sixth Sense or in The Village. Still, M. Night is a top-notch director who communicates and translates his vision very well unto the screen, and in this flick he also shows a bit more of his acting skills which have improved a lot and are actually very good. Cindy Cheung is also doing a fine job - I have to mention her. Let's put it this way: it is a completely different film from what's out there and also the expectations for this film might be different of what this film really is. Did this film deliver? I would have lived my life just fine without ever seeing this film. Will I buy the DVD? No. But it's an original story although in a sense some story aspects reminded me e.g. of KPax or the typical good and evil sequence and there's someone who needs to be saved by some sort of savior.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...atmosphere centered around the simple life's seemingly harmony, and the lurking evil. Never quite knowing for what to expect. Nor when. "Lady in the water" containing these necassary ingredients. The locations rarely change, the contrasts focused on good and evil. Sympathetic characters we identify with, the drama. But then it is the main creature. A narf. From a world we don't understand or recognize. And do we feel wiser after watching the movie?<br /><br />Speaking for myself, well, no. I actually found myself thinking meanwhile watching the latest movie of one of my favorite directors/writers -this was intended on his children? No wonder if they fell asleep then. Because first time I watched so did I. I've now seen it twice since that. I don't hate it. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen. And I still have faith in Shyamalan as a director of future entertaining-releases. I just hope he doesn't try with a sequel on this. To me, the ending being the ending was what surprised me. Good acting as a plus though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Well,this is the only "title" I can think of that pretty much sums up this film. What an utterly dull, dreary and dissapointing film. Night often has very original ideas, but the story telling/plot become so misguided and hard to folow,and/or try to be artsy or surreal its just a bit hard to follow what he is trying to get accross.Perhaps he is smarter than all of us(me included) and he is a genius director and I am just too dimwitted to comprehend his films?However, Lady in the water moved terribly slow.It was painful. This film had about 10 minutes of my attention,and then "it just lost me."I know it was a "mythical" plot but it had become so misguided, by the time it finally came to an end I just didn't give a damm anymore.Paul Giamatti is a fantastic actor(one of my favorites), and was really the only one who shined in this film,if at all. All the other "charaters were just "fillers".Making a film that is a fairy tale for adults, but trying to make the adults "the childen" is a bit of a stretch.I understand ultimately this was a "seek your purpose in the world" message and to believe in things that are generally taught to us not to believe in,because we grow up and turn into borring adults. That's all fine a good, and it was a decent idea to being with,but perhaps M. Night Shamalan should not make films of his rough drafts and actually edit and re-write the screenplays a few times before just thinking,"hey,this is a cool idea" and just make a film based on a catchy title or a page of notes that look like chicken scratch.Whatever it was he was trying to do with Lady in the water, it somehow got lost and just turned out to be a very poorly executed film and it shows terribly. I only hope that Night stops following the the film practices of other directors who had one hit wonders(and/or trillogies) and has some reflection on his dircting and screen writing practices for future projects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>It's no revelation that director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to make suspenseful, often creepy movies.  Bursting on the scene in 1999 with the commercial and critical hit, "The Sixth Sense," he parlayed that success into follow-up films "Unbreakable," "Signs," and "The Village."  None, however, lived up to "The Sixth Sense."  Shyamalan's trademark is the Big Secret -- some well-kept plot point that is supposed to blow the audience away.  Though these later films have their share of eeriness, palpable atmosphere, and first-rate performances, they never set the screen on fire.<br /><br /> Now Shyamalan is back with "Lady in the Water," based on a tale he made up for his daughters as a bedtime story.  There are strange doings in and around the pool of an apartment complex called The Cove.  Late one night, apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) sees a young woman emerge from the pool.  She reveals that she is a water nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) and has come from the Blue World beneath the swimming pool.  Story's unique powers of perception predict the fates of Cleveland's tenants, whose destinies are tied directly to her own. They must work together to decipher a series of codes that will unlock a pathway to her freedom.<br /><br /> Getting Story home is not easy.  The feat involves following the blow-by-blow plot points of an ancient myth, provided by an elderly Korean woman as interpreted by her daughter (Cindy Cheung).<br /><br /> The tenants are an odd collection of colorful, quirky characters.  Shyamalan himself plays author Vick Ran in a role much bigger than the director's cameo appearances in his earlier films.  He's not a bad actor and does a credible job, but his  considerable screen time eventually becomes distracting.  Alfred Hitchcock, whose trademark was popping up in his movies, had the sense to make a brief appearance early on and then disappear, allowing his actors to unfold the story.<br /><br /> But the primary problem with "Lady in the Water" is Shyamalan's screenplay, which never stops providing new nomenclature and new information even three-quarters of the way through.  There are narfs, scrunts, tartutic, and the great eatlon to keep track of as well as volumes of mythological lore.  Keeping track of all this mythology-in-the-making, revealed piecemeal, becomes tedious early on.  Seeing how intent and stone-cold serious everyone at The Cove is about getting Story back home, one wonders why there are no skeptics among the tenants.<br /><br />  "Lady in the Water" is derivative of so many other, better films, it would take forever to list them all.  Let's just say that "E.T.," "The Wizard of Oz," "Batteries Not Included," "Splash" and even "X-Men: The Last Stand" come to mind immediately.  Shyamalan tries to be original, but becomes bogged down in these iconic references, his own complex mythology, and a desperation to have the audience "get it".<br /><br /> "Lady in the Water" is ultimately a very silly movie.  For a director who prides himself on the Big Secret, Shyamalan has turned out a surprise-free clunker this time around.  For a fantasy, there is no sense of wonderment, no childlike awe, no magic.  It's an ambitious but badly flawed movie.<br /><br /> There's a sad waste of talent.  Giamatti is excellent as usual, but even he comes to look dopey as he gets involved in a convoluted scheme to get Story back to where she belongs.  Howard has little to do but look ethereal and shiver a bit, and she does both well, but she never conveys the magical nature of her character.  She's merely an actress wearing little and brooding much.<br /><br /> Supporting performances are provided by Bill Irwin as a gloomy guy who spouts philosophical aphorisms at crucial intervals, Freddy Rodriguez as a bodybuilder exercising only one side of his body, Jeffrey Wright as a crossword puzzle expert, and Bob Balaban as an unfeeling film and book critic.<br /><br /> I am totally perplexed as to the intended demographic for this film.  Little kids will find it scary (the scrunts are loathsome CGI-rendered creatures that lurk in the shadows and occasionally pounce), older kids will be bored, teenagers will find it not worth the effort to follow a constantly evolving, tortuous plot, and adults will simply dismiss it as what it is -- a bad movie.  The moral:  a bedtime story doesn't always make a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is a place where myth and reality intertwine in a spellbinding story of a sea nymph who holds the future of the world in her eyes. With one look, she will become a muse to a struggling writer played by M. Night Shyamalan himself, who is an amazing actor and I hope he will appear in more of his movies. He has a magical radiating presence that infuses the movie with light.<br /><br />This is a story of humor and heart and the unlikely hero brings a subtle beauty and kindness to this terror-laced fairytale. The soundtrack keeps you riveted and the wild darkness of the rabid scrunt/hyena is only equaled by the fright you experience as the sprinklers keep going off at odd times.<br /><br />The misty surroundings, wet grass and evening rain gives the story atmosphere and keeps you wondering about the creatures lurking in the darkness. If you are expecting dark horror with gratuitous gore, you will be disappointed. This is a much more finely crafted movie with elements so beautiful they are difficult to describe. The human drama intertwines with the sea nymph's purposeful intent and as the community works together to solve an overwhelming task, she becomes weaker as the humans must show their best qualities and emotional strength.<br /><br />If you love movies like Big Fish, the pool in this movie is also center stage. This is where the sea nymph lives in a room below the pool with cracking walls. While Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti - who is a natural at physical comedy) fixes garbage disposals and changes light bulbs for tenants, he tries to figure out the fairytale that is about to come true.<br /><br />For the most part, I found myself laughing at the start and then completely lost in the magic of the story right until the last second. Lady in the Water was everything I had wished it could be after I initially listened to the soundtrack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Shyamalan's films are somewhat quirky and offbeat and very much draw upon his own idiosyncratic (but neither entirely original or totally out there) sense of what kinds of stories ought to be told.  They usually don't conform to the standard Hollywood storytelling model, which means there are gaps and inconsistencies and odd duck characters and miscues that aren't entirely justified or the structure of the films is slanted without a clear "beginning" "middle" and "end" or where a "twist" takes the place of a genuinely motivated character arc -- in general in his case this is not a good thing but every once in a while it gives a fresh and unique edge to his films.  "Lady in the Water" was no exception -- and it was clear from the beginning that Shyamalan didn't want to make concessions: he set up a cast of "misfits" and contrived a story that would bring them together under a common cause, and wasn't worried about mixing genres or stretching the limits of plausibility or giving his characters enough evidence for us to believe that they would believe in and embrace this cause at the peril of their lives.  This is a story about abandoning oneself to believe in the power of stories, about suspending disbelief and letting the storyteller tell her story however ludicrous its implications become.  (What is odd is that he seems to want to say that if we can just abandon ourselves to stories we will be better people and there will be less war, etc. -- but of course it is often the willingness to accept stories about "good" and "evil" without fact that gets us so riled up about going to war in the first place).  In any case there is something obviously self-serving and a bit naive about the premise of the story -- and the self-reference is as blatant as it can get in this film, since Shyamalan himself acted the part of the writer who was going to write a lot of strange things that would not be accepted at first but eventually would change the world through the power of belief (not to mention the one person who gets "eaten" in this film is a film critic who can't write anything himself but likes to criticize films for lacking neat plots and stories, i.e. one who wouldn't have liked "The Village" or this film).  Still, as stories tinged with the fantastic go I enjoyed this one (it's a better film than "Signs," which did much better at the box office).  It worked even better for me on the small screen when I watched it again with a couple of my children on dvd.  There I wasn't so bothered by the obviously grandiose delusions of the film (and its filmmaker) -- but just enjoyed, most of all, the undeniably fascinating and powerful performance at the heart of this film by Paul Giamatti, one of the most consistently strong supporting actors in Hollywood, here given center stage.  Three stars for the film, and five stars for Giamatti give this film my four star rating.<br /><br />The way I think of M. Night Shyamalan's films is that he is like a small budget independent filmmaker who happens to have big budgets.  This is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  He tells small stories that appeal to a niche audience -- but luckily for him that niche has coincided with a fairly large number of Americans: mostly sci-fi/fantasy lovers and "believers" who like their fantasy movies to hint at transcendence (the afterlife, etc.)  Where this is a drawback is that weaknesses in plot or limitations in scope or unconventional stories that you could forgive (or even celebrate as an alternative) in a small budget independent film are hard to accept in a glossy big budget feature put out by Disney or another major studio.  Watching "Signs," for example, it struck me that I would have liked it much better if it hadn't had such big name actors and hadn't obviously had such a large budget.  It feels like a "small film" about a crisis of faith and an identity crisis, but its science fiction premise overwhelmed this rather than working seamlessly with it.  (Unlike, say, Spielberg's "Close Encounters" -- a film that was able to manage both intimacy with the characters and a global science fiction premise).  Shyamalan obviously has visual talent and the ability to coax exceptional performances from his actors and has been lucky enough to hit upon a few stories that resonated enough at the box office that he has been given free range for quite a few films.  Plus, the studios he has worked for have had the good sense to market his films as being different and as expressing his unique vision. I don't know how much longer that is going to work for him, though -- with films like this one and his previous one that have had diminishing returns in the box office he may have to turn to creating the kinds of independent and low budget but high concept films that he would have been making if he hadn't had the good luck to have the right actors and the right kind  of buzz that made "Sixth Sense" a smashing success.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan has provide us another interesting film. His earlier works have been very cynical, and sometimes dark which I had fun watching. This film, in the other hand, ventures away from that and the characters are in a dissimilar light. M. Night somehow made a movie that is compatible with children, and just as compatible with the adult. The humor doesn't lose its touch halfway through the movie, and in some respects the humor adds to the sadness.  The opening tells us that this is a children's story, pretty much about good vs. evil and visually suggests that the people from the water are like angels.<br /><br />The whole plot is laid out right there; the depiction of it in character, in dialog, in camera shots, is compelling to the very end. The casts, mostly whom are less character-driven but are caricatures on the screen, gave good performances. The acting by Paul Giamati and Bryce Dallas Howard were true to their roles. M. Night Shyamalan appearances are always appealing to me. I even like how he summarily dealt with critics but after watching this I have clearly seen that this wasn't his best efforts.<br /><br />The soundtrack explodes when it needs to and whispers when it doesn't. Night is wise to employ Christopher Doyle (2046, Infernal Affairs, In The Mood For Love) as the cinematographer. Doyle is a genuine architect of angles, mood and atmosphere when it comes to hand-held cameras. For me, this movie is a painting and Night is the painter. We, as viewers, can never understand an artist. So did the people at Disney, who rejected his sixth drafted script. Probably in 1000 years from now someone is going to write THE SHYAMALAN CODE and make big bucks out of the novel.<br /><br />And that's the twist!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Lady in the Water" is not M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie, which unfortunately isn't saying very much. I give it credit for not being as preposterous as some of his other films, all of which have completely failed to impress me. He's a master manipulator when it comes to the way he advertises his films, using tried and true editing methods in the trailers to draw in an audience. Only when they actually see the film are they completely let down, being forced to watch half-hearted attempts at storytelling. Let's take a look back: "The Sixth Sense" was drawn out, moody, and implausible; "Unbreakable" ended before anything was resolved; "Signs" was just plain bad; and "The Village" wasn't much better, especially since it had one of the most unrealistic, unsatisfying, anticlimactic twist endings I've ever seen. With this kind of record, I didn't have much hope for this new film.<br /><br />And it seems I was justified. "Lady in the Water" tries so hard to be a modern fairy tale that it loses all sense of place or purpose. It tells the story of a mythical sea nymph--or narf--named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who emerges one night from the swimming pool of a Philadelphia apartment building. She meets Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building's superintendent. He's a lost, tortured man, unable to speak without stuttering and still reeling over some traumatic past experiences. Even though he doesn't understand who she is or what her purpose is, he takes her in as casually as someone who takes in an abandoned kitten. I found this a little difficult to accept, considering she speaks to him in short, monotone, cryptic sentences. Basically, she's a mysterious person who continually eludes personal inquiries. Who would want someone like that to stick around? Apparently Heep does. But if he wants to get the whole story, he has to rely on someone else. This creates a problem: who on earth would know anything about narfs, especially since they're not supposed to be real?<br /><br />As fate would have it, there happens to be one tenant who knows all about them. She's an old Chinese woman (June Kyoto Lu) whose grandmother told her the legend many, many years ago. Apparently, there used to be a harmonious union between those that lived on the land and those that lived in the water, a place Story calls the Blue World. As time went on, humanity got more and more greedy, claiming pieces of land that stretched further and further away from the water. Eventually the union was broken. However, the narfs still make an attempt at reconciliation, every so often sending a daughter of specific importance into the human world to reestablish a connection.<br /><br />Here's where the bond between Story and Heep comes in; she's but one of the many narfs sent to restore the balance between humanity and the Blue World. Why have there been so many? Because all the ones before her have failed in their objectives, never again returning home. They were hunted down and destroyed by creatures called scrunts, evil dog- and plant-like beings hell bent on keeping narfs in our world. Exactly why is never explained, which I found troubling; in fairy tales, villains always have a reason for wanting to destroy the good characters (all you have to do is read stories by the Brothers Grimm, the "Harry Potter" novels, and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy to see what I mean). For "Lady in the Water," Shyamalan created a villain just for the sake of creating a villain, never mind giving it any sense of meaning.<br /><br />But whatever the scrunt's beef with Story is, the fact remains that it's after her, and time is running out to get her home safely. Fortunately, the legend also tells of some important human beings who have the ability to protect her: there's a Guardian, a Healer, an Interpreter, and a Guild of Protectors. All of them are only chosen when the time is right. Since Story doesn't know who possesses the right qualities, it's up to Heep to interview specific apartment tenants. There are a number of possible candidates: the crossword puzzle-addict Mr. Dury (Jeffery Wright) and his son, Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey, whose character can look at a cereal box and find meaning); the jaded film critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban); Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan) whose connection with Story centers on a book he's writing; his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury); Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung), daughter of the old Chinese woman; Reggie (Freddy Rodriguez), a young bodybuilder who, for whatever reason, is only toning the right side of his body; the morose Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), whose tired of all the hatred and violence in the world; and the animal lover Mrs. Bell (Mary Beth Hurt). Topping off the list is a group of chain smoking slackers who live like slobs and like to party.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, each character has a particular quirk that in some form or another serves the story. In that regard, the film earns its billing as a bedtime story because, be it directly or indirectly, each character has a purpose. However, this creates a problem: Shyamalan's idea is a combination of fantastical elements and mundane, real world circumstances, neither of which come together in a way that's completely cohesive. Story tells Heep that her journey home can only be achieved by hitching a ride on a gigantic eagle, and in order for that to happen, the characters must come together and fulfill their destinies. How exactly does she expect such odd people to help her, especially since they supposedly live in the real world?<br /><br />I realize that this is a fairy tale and that I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief for a little while. But the story for "Lady in the Water" doesn't mesh with the fairy tale genre; despite the mythical creatures, it's actually too realistic, so rooted in the real world that the fantasy elements seem completely out of place. On top of all that, the film includes a fair number of humorous moments, all of which were incredibly inappropriate. I found myself asking "Why?" during much of the film. Why would a sea nymph choose to emerge from an urban swimming pool? Why not a lake, or perhaps even the ocean? Why do you have to look at a scrunt with a mirror? Why does everyone speak so cryptically? Why is it that an underwater dweller is able to breathe air and speak English?<br /><br />I think the most important question I had was this: why would everyone come to believe in Story so quickly? Immediately after she arrives, the events unfold as naturally as if it were an everyday occurrence. I didn't believe for a second that the reaction towards her was genuine, even for a fairy tale. There was no sense of wonder or bewilderment; there was only quiet acceptance and the vague assumption that all this was supposed to be happening. I guess this means we're supposed to assume the same thing, even though we don't know it. I don't think Shyamalan ever takes this into consideration when he's writing a movie, which is probably why I haven't liked anything he's made thus far. Yes, "Lady in the Water" is better than some of his other films, especially since it didn't trick the audience with a ridiculous plot twist. But it's still a ponderous, long-winded, and ultimately unsatisfying idea. As much as it may pain some of you, I can't quite recommend it; it's just not the way fairy tales were meant to be.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is an apartment manager for The Cove.

It wasn't as confusing as people have said, and Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard turn in fantastic performances. There is humor, drama, and wonder throughout this two hour fantasy.

The part of the "Lady" who is in the water is played by Bryce Dallas Howard with an innocent simplicity which is touching.

It's intensely repetitive, with a plot that's only advanced via a series of chats with a superstitious old woman, and outright refuses to decide between serious or lighthearted material; both emotions tug at the narrative in a few bizarre, important scenes that just don't work. M. Night Shyamalan has always had a slightly aloof nature to his films that's never felt completely at home with its surroundings, but in the past he's been able to lean back on the immense ambience of his premise and some great cinematography to compensate. Here, with neither of those skills showing their best, his odd idiosyncrasies are lain bare. Casting Bryce Dallas Howard as the titular lady was a smart choice, with her nymphian, otherworldly appearance giving the role a certain validity, but Paul Giamatti is merely okay as the weirdly comical stuttering maintenance man at the root of all the drama. The only other cast member worth mentioning is Shyamalan himself, who climbs into the role of the nonplussed creative genius, destined to indirectly shape and inspire a happy future. Take that for what you will. Lady in the Water has the echoes of a few good ideas reverberating through it, but they're never adequately reined in or solidified. Let's call it below average, and I think that's being pretty generous.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The Lady in the title is named Story, and is played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  The water is literally an apartment swimming pool, but is really the blue world that is Earth.  The story of this movie is relationship between the apt superintendent and Story.  She rescues him from drowning at the beginning of the movie, he then rescues her from the wolf.  Later she sees into his troubled heart and rescues his soul by giving someone to care for again; her.  At the end he rescues her by assembling the apartment residents into a team that helps her get back to her world.  The plot plays out very easily with few twists.  The characters, like those in Shamalayan's other movies, are normal in most ways except with special gifts that are revealed only at the end.  The visual editing is different from other movies, with a lot of slow-motion shots, up-close shots, etc...  The DVD itself does not have many extra features, and really does not add insight into what the director was thinking.

Well, I say that and I must say that this particular film caused me to extract all that faith and I have not seen a single film by the director since.  That said, it bothers me that I find a sense of strange excitement when I see his name, as if maybe, just maybe this next offering will be the real follow up to `Unbreakable'.<br /><br />And then he releases that `Airbender' movie, further cementing my thoughts on his `has been' status.<br /><br />`Lady in the Water' was the last film I've seen by the `one hit wonder' director.  I must admit that when I first saw the trailer for the film I was sitting firmly on the fence.  I had just witnessed the underwhelming (yet not without a sliver of merit) `The Village' and so my expectations weren't particularly high, and yet the film looked ridiculously intriguing.  It looked dark and mysterious and developed and despite the scathing review in my EW magazine, I threw caution to the wind and jumped right in.<br /><br />The film is such a sloppy mess I'm just utterly disgusted.<br /><br />The film runs that sick line between underdeveloped and overdeveloped.  The storyline is so contrived and thick with unnecessary details that the actual depth of `story' is non-existent.  It is 100% gimmick with no real development of themes and moral.  It felt like Shyamalan was trying to write the skeletal basis for a videogame, a RPG in the vein of `Final Fantasy', which would have been ideal had this actually been a videogame, but it's not; it's a movie (and a horribly bad one at that).<br /><br />For those of you interested, here is a quick synopsis:<br /><br />A sea-nymph (also called a narf) must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians.  This narf is aided in her escape from the skrunt's by a group of humans. Each of these humans has a specific title or job. There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.  These characters are so convoluted that they make NO SENSE whatsoever and so while your brain is on overload trying to process the ridiculous storyline you are disappointed in the fact that nothing is strung together well enough to make it all valid.<br /><br />In a film that defies logic by bombarding the viewer with an `original' script (that's a stretch of the term), the film is bathed in clich&eacute;s that strip it of any true originality.<br /><br />It's `originally' stupid, if that helps at all.<br /><br />I had so much hope for Shyamalan.  He really had so much promise.  He has exhausted his own potential by delivering one flop after the next, each more convoluted and preposterous as the one before it.<br /><br />Hey, at least the visuals were `good'.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. I'm a big fan of fairy tales and have long thought that there's a lot of mileage in updating fairy tales to the modern day and attempting to tell new stories in the vein of a modern fairy tale.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while "Lady in the Water" makes a run at it, M. Night Shyamalan's (perhaps understandable) insistence on clinging to the original bedtime story he made up for his children hurts the film. For starters, Shyamalan's clearly not one of those rare people who can come up with a clever nonsense word off the top of their head, so we're stuck with "narf," "skrunt" and "The Great Etlon," the silliness of which undercut the sort of magical tone he's trying to create, although their depictions in the film undercut the silliness almost (but not quite) enough not to overcome their awful names.<br /><br />Secondly, things that can be taken as read in a bedtime story -- "and the neighbors all agreed to help Cleveland Heep protect Story until she could be lifted up by the Great Etlon" -- are jarring on the screen. Some of these cuts are restored in the deleted scenes, but there are still several outstanding instances of characters referring to bits that didn't make it to the DVD or into the final version of the script.<br /><br />Ultimately, the whole thing comes off like a very talented auteur not having someone around he can trust to tell him "no." It's the sort of thing that undoes lots of auteurs, but hopefully Shyamalan will be able to get back up after this stumble.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in "Lady in the Water," including solid acting, otherworldly special effects, beautiful cinematography and a magical tone throughout. Unfortunately, it's done in by the very mundane problem of a Swiss cheese script.<br /><br />A recommended rental for fans of M. Night Shyamalan or any of the talented members of the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />Anyone who has ever taken a course in basic fiction writing knows that the first thing you learn is the old "show don't tell" rule of storytelling.  It's ironic, then, that this is the very thing that M Night Shyamalan - hitherto one of the most innovative and imaginative of modern day storytellers - seems to have forgotten in his latest film, "Lady in the Water," the first truly disappointing movie the young writer/director has made to date (and, no, I'm not forgetting "The Village," which I liked much more than most people did).  Unlike, say, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy or the "Star Wars" films, in which the filmmakers allow us to see and enter into the fantastical and mythological worlds they've created, in "Lady in the Water" the characters spend most of their time DESCRIBING rather than showing us the imaginary world of their story, resulting in a static, talky film that fails to engage the viewer in any truly meaningful way.<br /><br />The wonderful Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, the sweet-natured, milquetoast-y manager of a multi-storied apartment building on the outskirts of Philadelphia.  One night Cleveland discovers a strange woman swimming in the pool after dark, an intruder he soon discovers to be a sea nymph (called a "narf") who has come from the mysterious "blue world" to bring a message of hope to mankind.  Unfortunately, this creature, who calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, who played a similar emissary-to-a-strange-world role in "The Village"), has also inadvertently brought with her a menacing wolf-like monster which threatens to destroy her before she can make it successfully back to her own world.  With the help of a number of other, amazingly credulous residents of the complex, Cleveland is able to piece together elements of the mystery in the hope of helping Story to do what she came to do and then return safely home.<br /><br />As with his earlier films, Shyamalan is far more interested in mood and imagery than in easy melodrama and cheap thrills.  However, in this case, the film gets so bogged down in explanations and exposition that it winds up talking itself and us to a standstill.  The screenplay cheats right off the bat by relying on an outsider's knowledge of the tale to relate the key elements rather than letting those elements reveal themselves naturally and organically.  As a consequence, the film is never able to convince us of its authenticity, while the plot points begin to feel increasingly arbitrary and silly the longer the movie drones on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film's visual style is every bit as incoherent as the storyline.  For some reason, as a director, Shyamalan proves unable to establish or maintain spatial unity in his misc-en-scene.  He never gives us a clear view of the entire courtyard, so that we are unable to tell where the woods are in relation to the building or even if the woods are real at all (that would certainly be an intriguing concept, though I honestly don't think that was Shyamalan's intention).  For long stretches of the film, we expend our energies trying to orient ourselves in the film's geography, something even the least competent director should be able to do for his audience.  At times we seem to be trapped in some type of concrete fortress, while, at other times and from other angles, the setting seems positively bucolic, overrun with thick vegetation and with Cleveland living in what appears to be a quaint little cottage nestled cozily in some nearby woods (but which is somehow supposed to be only a stone`s-throw from the apartment`s pool).  The film looks as if it were shot at two entirely different locales, and that Shyamalan was unable to meld them into anything even remotely approximating a seamless whole.<br /><br />And that seems to be the biggest problem with "Lady in the Water."  It always feels incompletely formed and half-baked, a thing of bits and pieces rather than a wholly rounded and fully developed work of art.  Shyamalan has struck out in his own ballpark.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>What makes a movie watchable? Mostly it's good acting, a good screenplay, and a story that has emotional weight. So it is most strange to see the many harsh reviews of this film which I'm sure kept ticket-buyers away from the theater when professionals started pummeling LADY IN THE WATER.<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly said, "[It is] Shyamalan's most alienating and self-absorbed project to date" (as if that has anything to do with the story being told). The Philadelphia Enquirer called it, "...extremely silly." And the New York Observer said, "Hollywood cannot pollute the ozone with anything more idiotic, contrived, amateurish or sub-mental than Lady in the Water."<br /><br />Ouch.<br /><br />No wonder so few went to see it after reading things like that. I know I shied away specifically because of them. But I'd also seen a few positive reviews. Nothing big, really. I attributed most of these to Shyamalan die-hards who'd love anything put out by him regardless of subject matter. That wasn't the only thing that kept me away from the theater, though. Having fell in love with The Sixth Sense (like 99% of the rest of you), I sludged through Unbreakable, Signs, and then The Village. None of them were stellar and they lacked that umpf! we'd come to expect from M. Night. So having invested money and time in many of his previous works, I was extremely hesitant to spend more of either on something that many "respected" reviewers found, to say the least, tepid.<br /><br />So when I plopped in the DVD this week and started watching Lady in the Water, I was prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, that's not what I found.<br /><br />If films are supposed to be about entertainment, then Lady in the Water most certainly meets that challenge. Not only that, but I found Paul Giamati's performance to be outstanding. Not since Sideways had I enjoyed a Giamati film so much. He, in fact, carried most of the movie with his excellent portrayal of Cleveland Heep, an apartment manager who one night finds a narf (a water creature) swimming in the compound's pool. The narf is named Story and is played by Bryce Dallas Howard (the blind girl from M. Night's The Village). The movie delves deep into Fairytale-Land and plants the audience firmly in its belief structure. The fact that Story has shown herself to Cleveland is very important in the film, and it shows us that this is something special. Cleveland is given the opportunity to heal himself through Story's visit, and in the process bring together everyone in the apartment complex. All of the people within the apartment building have been drawn here for this one event: to see a narf safely on her way to becoming a segue between the blue world (i.e., the narfs) and the human one.<br /><br />The quirky, quaint, and scarey intermingle here as we see a movie reviewer monologuing during a funny yet frightening scene, watch Cleveland come to terms with the death of his family from years before, and witness the battle between humps of grass that come to life with razor sharp teeth and threaten to destroy Story.<br /><br />The heart-wrenching scene between Cleveland, the apartment building's occupants, and the mortally wounded Story has such impact as to cause most watchers to reach for the tissue box.<br /><br />The ending is extremely satisfying and filmed perfectly. When Story has to leave, she does so in fairytale fashion.<br /><br />This is a great story. My only regret now is that I didn't see it in the theater. I'm sure the sound and scenery were even better on the big screen.<br /><br />I also have to wonder about Warner Brothers and the "falling out" that they had with M. Night over the film during production. Budget, screenplay and time constraints weighed heavy on all of the parties involved and I think this may have had an impact on reviewers and how the film was marketed. Are some reviewers leery of praising a film from a large studio when that studio has problems with a director/writer? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But the negative reviews of the film seem far out of proportion with what I watched.<br /><br />Lady in the Water was well acted, had a decent screenplay, and told a great story. I'm glad I saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I guess I am an M. Night Shyamalan fan more than I thought I was.  As I look back, I have enjoyed all of his films.  Part of that, I guess, is that I am willing to take each film for what it presents to me rather than putting preconditions on what I want it to be.  I am willing to let Shyamalan tell me his story the way he wants to tell it.  This is especially true of this film.<br /><br />Apparently, it is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell his children.  It certainly has that flavor about it.  And it doesn't have anything like a driving plot or a great mystery about it.  It is flavored more like a dream.  There are elements that one isn't quite sure what they are or how they relate - even after the film is over.  However, the telling of the story provides its own satisfactions.  The real point of the film is about saving the lives of an apartment complex full of lost souls.  Well, saving at least most of them.<br /><br />How those lives are saved and what that will mean is partly told in the film and partly left up to you to look in yourself and supply to the story.  Which is why the story is so satisfying and why kids like bedtime stories.  It also has to do with why dreams can be so especially satisfying even though they make no logical sense.  It is about connecting things within yourself.  The stories goal is to draw certain things out of you and let you put them together.<br /><br />Maybe you will hate this story.  I have read some things expressing dislike to outright contempt.  It was much better than I expected, but I came to it without expectations or preconditions.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti and find his acting compelling and engaging.  It is quite interesting to learn how this guy came to be a stammering and  And I fell for Bryce Dallas Howard in "The Village" and she is just as engaging here in an utterly different character.  Bob Balaban is also a very nice presence in this story as he always is.  There are many other nice actors who contribute to this very interesting story.<br /><br />If you come at this film in the right way I think you will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>This is an odd film, and like most of M. Night's work, bears repeated thought, pondering, and viewing.  He has given us affair tale for grown ups, following the trend that was started by C. S. Lewis in "That Hideous Strength."<br /><br />So does the film work?  I am still wondering about that.  On a superficial level, the film strikes me not as a bomb, but more as a misfire.  The water-nymph seems too much like Disney's Little Mermaid, with red hair and an undersea cavern where she keeps her collection of man-objects.  The cruel death of the film-critic was a two edged sword--a comic-relief made funnier by his seriousness, and also fantasy projection of M. Night and his real-world critics.  And casting himself as the messiah seemed like autoerotic genuflection, and a window into his psyche and dreams.<br /><br />In fact, the film had the feel of the dream.  The lopsided bodybuilder is a classic example of a person one would see in a dream, symbolic of a half-complete and half-incomplete person.<br /><br />I have a paradoxical observation. First, the pacing was too slow, and second, the film needed to be longer.  The film was too compressed; I felt like I was watching several run-on chapters.  The film, like a symphony, had movements and vignettes, but it lacked a lynchpin.  The several subplots did not gel.<br /><br />So what would I change? First, remove the preachy introduction.  We are given enough clues in the film to piece it all together, which is a credit to M. Night's writing.<br /><br />Second, distance Story from The Little Mermaid--cast her as an Asian and remove the "Part of Your World" grotto.  The hair change was not commented on and I wonder if it was an obvious and sloppy continuity error.  And lose "narf"--too "Pinky and the Brain." Stick with nixie, naiad, or sea-nymph.  And then tell us why you are so fond of water--"Unbreakable" and "Signs." Or is this your version of Arthur's "Lady in the Lake."<br /><br />Third, round out the characters--there were too many, and what we saw were flat, dream-like images.  All of these secondary characters threw the film off-center and distracted from the relationship between Story and Cleveland.<br /><br />Fourth, get collaborators.  Being the writer, director, and producer feels good, but you are going to burn out--Rod Serling,  Brian Wilson, Bill Corgan, and Brian Wilson.  Paul McCartney had John Lennon; the Beatles had George Martin; Brian Wilson had Mike Love, Tony Asher, and Van Dyke Parks; and Lucas and Spielberg have each other.  It is no shame or disgrace, and collaborators can help round out ideas.<br /><br />In closing, I think M. night took a risk on this film.  His post-6th Sense films (i.e. all but the first) have not done well, thought they all artistic classics.  Maybe M. Night is not the next Spielberg, but the next Orson Welles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>In an interview, the director spoke of having a foot in Hollywood while still planting the other firmly in independent cinema. As one has largely incorporated the other I'm not sure there's really a distinction, although it may help him to weather the low box office returns of 'Lady' with pride. You can never truly straddle two worlds, just ask Story. As a matter of interest, most of the fifteen or twenty matinee attendees with me were older patrons. That may be why another cinema had abandoned all but evening performances.<br /><br />'Lady' reminded me of the children's book 'Marianne Dreams' coupled with my least favourite Tarkovsky, 'Stalker'. The latter featuring a guide whose followers had to perform ritualistic and puzzling tasks to get to a destination in a roundabout way, avoiding traps more metaphysical than manifest. "Periously close to hocus pocus", lamented one critic at the time. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />The media studies self critique running throughout is a distraction as the constant ambiguity (special pleading or unbridled confidence?) remains unresolved. Also, quaint is the notion that in the age of Internet blogs and other sites in which thousands of opinions about society and political figures are poured over, "in a few years time" a book will capture the imagination of one figure and through him, the multitudes. Haven't books by prophets and radical thinkers cost enough lives? Try telling the hundreds of millions of Muslims to stop reading the Koran and take up 'The Cookbook'.<br /><br />Far from being original, the film's New Age, get in touch with your inner child sentiments are dated and have been overtaken by events, as the saying goes. If the director's contention that multi-cultural America has no sense of community, self-knowledge or direction is correct then the United Sates better get its act together quickly because it has plenty of enemies who do know and the will to do something about it. The hope that after climbing out of the water, man's endless fight over land and religion will be abandoned in favour of some third way that the director does not even have the courage of his convictions to reveal is a forlorn one.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I thought the director's acting performance was respectable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This film almost had me through the first half,but lost me through the second half.

While with that film, it came after the hugely successful Signs so there was no need for concern until people saw it. Now mind you, the Village wasn't terrible but it was a case of a huge missed opportunity. With this film it was more like "oh boy, here we go" as if we knew it would be just like the Village. Now regardless of his faults and strengths as a filmmaker, he always told stories that I liked seeing: paranormal stories that were not just simply mob movies or officers turning rogue to take down a criminal. Well Lady in the Water certainly has an intriguing premise, but maybe somebody should've helped out with the story too.<br /><br />Cleveland is a superintendent working at an apartment complex called the Cove. One night, he spots someone in the pool when no one should be there and he accidentally slips and falls in. He's saved by a woman named Story and turns out she's a "narf" from a place called the Blue World and her coming will promote great change. Like any Eastern legend come to life, they must have enemies and in a narf's case it's a "scrunt": a big wolf that looks like vines and grass. Cleveland with a handful of tenants have to somehow get Story to the Blue World before the scrunt gets her.<br /><br />Now, I'm an RPG player like Final Fantasy and an anime watcher like Escaflowne so a story like that to me doesn't illicit unintentional laughter. But they are certain points where it got kind of not really silly but you know people would see it like so. An example is a character who gets wisdom from cereal boxes (seriously) and you almost wish someone was there near Shyamalan's shoulder going "um, might want to change that". But then when you think things are fine, then comes trouble spots. A snooty, humorless film and book critic in one scene actually deconstructs the situation he's in typically found in movies and probably worst of all: the director himself has a bigger role than before who's writing promotes great change. I don't mind director cameos or roles in film and I don't find him a bad actor but when his character gets that kind of importance it's like "heh heh, you wish buddy." Whether it is ego or just simply a wink to the audience though, who knows.<br /><br />One thing that Shyamalan always had a knack for though is casting and atmosphere. Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard both are great and the rest, while not given much to do, at least don't feel disposable. Directing is not as overtly flashy and he certainly knows how to frame a scene and the scrunt, while not given the more "less is more" approach like Signs, is downright cool and even scary. The only thing that kind of derails the film is the pacing is not as forwarding as it should be. It's not a slow moving film but it doesn't have that huge sense of urgency or dynamics that it should. It's only when that big dog shows up that things start ramping up.<br /><br />Some people own all his films since Sixth Sense as a "collection" while some own just some. Lady in the Water is in the grey area: you might like it, you probably will hate it but don't think you're going to see an outright terrible movie like Glitter, Battlefield Earth or a Uwe Boll movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>WOW!

The whole purpose of the boring Village was to try to throw you a tweest, but it did not prepare me for the cinematic train-wreck that is Lady in the Water.<br /><br />In the opening scene we see M. Night flaunting his camera style where we see a bunch of people reacting to Paul Giammati squashing some bug, ok so they can act, let's see them act out a fairy tale pinched out of M. Night himself. So Paul Giammati's the maintainence guy of this apartment complex that's main/only attraction seems to be this gigantic pool in the middle, where he finds some nymph who claims she's from the 'blue world' or some dumb crap like that.<br /><br />Eventually she meets all of the apartment residents and finds M. Night Shymalan playing himself in his most humble role yet: the savior of mankind through his stories. The story is so stupid and jumbled that I got the impression that Dingdong made up the story as it went along, and speaking of which the lady is named 'Story', I can just picture Shyamalan thinking "this is genius, like me" to himself when he thought that dumb name up. 'Stor-f*** this I'm calling her lady' is apparently motivating, she convinces Giammati not to kill himself and reveals the other tenants true purpose, but all you really see her do is hug her knees in the shower and stared blankly, wow real motivating.<br /><br />So later when the characters are going on their adventure trying to figure out who's role is who (instead of working like normal people) they get a film critic to help, and he ends up screwing it up because he thinks he knows how to choose the roles by movies. Oh yeah, and one person dies in this movie, guess who? That's right, the wormy, snobby critic who hates everything, just like in real life! That's right Shymalan, keep rubbing your, *ehem* 'ego' while writing this self-congratulatory s***. When the critic is confronted by a monster he says to himself "I'm going to narrowly escape, almost getting killed but not quite", then BAM! He dies! TAKE THAT CRITICS, YOU THINK MY MOVIES ARE S***, I'LL WIPE OUT A PLANET-LOAD OF CRITICS IF YOU DON'T STOP CRITICIZING MY MOVIES! OH GOD I'M CUMM-anyways no one seems to care that the critic has died, and they're all going through some weird impromptu formula for the lady to get picked up by a giant eagle (lord of the rings anyone? oh wait, it's name was Eagatron or whatever so I guess it's suddenly original).<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan's character is an amazing brilliant writer that's way ahead of his time apparently. He's going to write a novel that will one day inspire peace and end war, however his book is controversial and leads up to him inevitably getting assassinated, and he knows this and writes the book anyways. Wow, now DingDong is drawing comparisons of himself to Christ, never in the history of movies have I seen such an egotistical little man write himself as the voice of God, I think at the end of the initial screening only one person was still in the theater standing in applause, M. Night Shyamalan of course. Maybe one day we can all come to recognize his genius, because his scripts are definately going to change the world one day, just look at the Happening's brilliant script of killer plants.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>could have made this a bit more exciting and added a few more twists which is what I like about his movies.

He takes pride in his work, and seems to know everyone pretty well.  One night, he discovers a stranger swimming in the apartment's pool.  Her name is Story (Howard), and she is a narf.  It seems that she has come from the Blue World to provide enlightenment to one man before returning home.  Making things difficult is the Scrunt, a grass-covered wolf creature that wants to stop her.  According to an Asian fairy tale, there are others who will help her, and Cleveland attempts to locate them in the apartment complex.  But, when the Scrunt attacks, it may be too late, and Story might not accomplish her task.<br /><br />"Lady in the Water" was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I found it to be a bit on the silly side, with its narfs, scrunts, and even tartutics.  It tries to have a point, but it is somewhat lost amonst the goofiness of the story.  Paul Giamatti does the best he can with what he is given, creating a very real character that is likeable.  Bryce Dallas Howard's Story is unremarkable, and even somewhat boring.  M. Night Shyamalan does a decent job as an actor, having cast himself in a bigger role in this movie.  In the end, it does not quite work for me.  Shyamalan has misstepped here, making perhaps his weakest film to date.  On the heels of "The Village", that is not a good thing.  He has some serious rebuilding to do with his next film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>It is sad to watch a filmmaker who has peaked so early. M. Night Shyamalan is such an example. "The Sixth Sense", his first film, is a hard act to follow. Great performances, an engaging story, great technical work and an incredible `aha' moment combine to create an incredible experience. Shyamalan followed with "Unbreakable", an exploration of the myth of superheroes. While not as great as "Sixth", it is an overlooked film. I consider it to be one of my favorite films, but I am in the minority. "Signs" was good, but a lot of people were turned off by the sight of the aliens. "The Village" was a mess, a huge disappointment. Now, we have "Lady in the Water". It falls somewhere between "The Village" and "Signs"; not as bad as "The Village" or as good as "Signs".<br /><br />Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the superintendent of a large apartment complex called The Cove, suspects a tenant might be swimming in the pool at night. Startled out of his sleep, he spots the figure but ends up falling into the pool. Waking up a bit later, he finds he has been rescued by Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, "The Village") who he later learns is a Sea Nymph sent to our world on a special mission. He also learns creatures from her world, Scrats, dog/ wolf like creatures that can dissolve into and hide in the grass, have followed her back to prevent the mission. Soon, Cleveland realizes he will need some help, so he recruits a number of the apartment building tenants.<br /><br />Shyamalan begins the film with a brief introduction of the legend, using primitive cave drawings to illustrate the narrator's words. Then, we meet Cleveland as he shows a new tenant, Mr. Farber (Bob Balaban) around the building. As they make their way to the new tenant's apartment, they meet a number of the `colorful' tenants living at The Cove. They meet Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright, "Syriana") and his son (Noah Gary-Cabey). Dury `likes words' and spends his time working crossword puzzles. Reggie (Freddy Rodriguez, "Poseidon") is doing an experiment and working out only one half of his body, the right side. Vick Ran (Shyamalan), a writer experiencing writer's block, is working on a new book about politics and current affairs, that "no one will like to read", while he lives with his sister, Anna (Sarita Choudhury). Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), the oldest tenant in the building, sits silently in front of his television all day, watching coverage of wars and carnage. And Young Soon (Cindy Cheung) walks around scantily clad while trying to do her college homework. Young Soon's mother reluctantly provides her daughter with a version of the fable, which Young Soon passes on to the building superintendent. Each of these people will play a part in helping Cleveland return Story safely to her world. But will they play a part in her mission?<br /><br />There are some significant problems with "Lady", detracting from the overall experience and making this one of Shyamalan's less successful films. But it's still better than "The Village".<br /><br />Let's start with the good. Paul Giamatti is, as always, very good. Cleveland is a meek, unassuming man who exerts authority only when necessary. Giamatti's slumped shoulders and stooped posture help him make this character real. Yet, when he sees a bunch of pot heads smoking in their apartment, he quickly becomes an authority figure and orders them to stop smoking. As soon as he leaves, his stutter returns and he becomes a man most would never give a second glance. He goes about his job in a measured way, completing it with pride because it is all he has, but also trying hard to hide the loathing.<br /><br />As soon as Story enters his life, he is incredulous about her existence, but quickly comes to believe her. The Scrats make a quick appearance, providing him with all the evidence he needs. Then, he finds he has something new to care about, to live for. He devotes his life to helping her, to understanding the rules of her world, and to helping her return home.<br /><br />At one point, late in the film, Farber (Bob Balaban), a movie and media critic, finds himself cornered by a Scrat and begins describing how most movies would handle such a situation. This is an amusing method for the filmmaker to take a playful dig at the industry he works in.<br /><br />Also, Shyamalan is good at placing his camera in places to help build a little suspense. As the Scrats track various people, he frequently places the camera at their eye level, giving us their vantage point, as we stalk the victims sharing the experience with these strange creatures. Shyamalan also reveals many things just after they have happened. For instance, we might see a swinging door at the end of an empty hallway. What went through that door? Often our imagination is more effective than an image.<br /><br />But there are also problems with the three most prevalent elements of the film.<br /><br />Story is a difficult character to make fully believable; a good portion of the film depicts her sleeping or curled in a fetal position in someone else's arms. Bryce Dallas Howard spends a lot of time staring blankly ahead and speaking in very general terms. It would be difficult for most actresses to make this character interesting and Howard simply doesn't have enough experience to pull it off.<br /><br />It is interesting to see such a diverse group of actors in the same film, but few go beyond their initial introduction. Because there are so many, it is difficult to make each of them seem real, to give them more than one human quality. Because of this, many seem like stereotypes. There is an elderly woman who is always telling people about her husband's bowel movements, you might say she is `kvetching' about them. There is another middle aged woman who cares for stray cats, nursing them to health while she talks about healing properties. She comes off as an aging hippie.<br /><br />Finally, because so much emphasis is placed on the legend of the Sea Nymph and Story's journey, it becomes problematic when it doesn't have a strong tie to the rest of the story. From almost the moment she arrives, Cleveland is searching for ways to get her safely back home. She never even seems to have an opportunity to fulfill her journey. I realize that some of the effects of her presence are meant to be subtle, but for this to `payoff', we need to see the effects of this. The effects are very subtle as well. Cleveland doesn't stutter around her. Vick finishes his book. But what is the big cosmic thing she was sent to fix? Her presence is supposed to elicit change on an epic scale. Instead, she makes vague references to some of the characters which will presumably lead to this change. But we feel cheated because we are taking this journey with these characters and we don't see the final impact.<br /><br />There are a couple of vague references to `current events' and `the war', our current way of life. As soon as these pop up, you might expect them to play a significant part in Story's journey; you might expect Shyamalan to make some sort of statement. The connection starts out vague and remains so throughout the film. The idea is never fully integrated leaving another loose end for us to ponder.<br /><br />"Lady in the Water" is similar to other Shyamalan films in one regard. Shyamalan likes to build suspense. Suspense does not require blood or gore and Shyamalan knows this. His films are generally scary because of the atmosphere he evokes in our minds. They aren't scary because of excessive amounts of blood or gore. This is a lesson many filmmakers would benefit from.<br /><br />"Lady in the Water" is not a very good film. But there are a couple of things making it worthy of a DVD rental.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The most brilliant thing in `Lady in the Water' is its stars - Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard. They did a fantastic job; the chemistry between them is real, and the latter's `The Lady in the Water' has ethereal beauty that makes us believe the presence of the nymphs.<br /><br />But I didn't like the film, not because the story is unbelievable or contrived. A narf from a bedtime story might rise from a small swimming pool in an apartment complex at night, and she might be saved by a lonely superintendent. I really like that part, and again I say, both Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti playing these roles respectively are just wonderful.<br /><br />But the film is saddled with too many things - the meaning of `Story' or the narf is too obvious; the idea of `symbolist' `guardian' etc is interesting, but poorly handled (what is he reading, and how?); and one character played by Bob Balaban, which is also director M. Night Shyamalan's personal letter, is simply an unnecessary addition. A good story doesn't need any self-reference. It keeps telling something about itself, but M. Night Shyamalan is tempted to say something more.<br /><br />But what is most annoying to me is M. Night Shymalan himself, not as director, but as actor. He plays a pivotal role in `Lady in the Water,' but to be honest, he is no professional actor, and it is painfully clear when he is seen beside Paul Giamatti or Bryce Dallas Howard. What is worse is the nature of the role he assigned to himself - a misunderstood author whose works will be appreciated rightly in the future. I don't deny his talent as director, but this kind of personal reaction, if understandable itself, need necessarily not to be revealed on screen.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan, it is said, first thought of this film's plot as a bed-time story. A good bed-time story is always simple and, if it has a hidden meaning, it has to be to the point. A very good bed-time story is actually there, in the story about a narf and a super, just like `The Beauty and the Beast,' but we are not allowed to know about them very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Having seen all the M. Night Shymalan films, I must say that his films are becoming less scary and more interesting at times. Lady in the Water is not really a horror or fantasy film like Sixth Sense and Signs, it's more of a supernatural thriller. There is a lot of good humorous moments delivered by the impeccable Paul Giamatti who finally gets a starring vehicle in a big budget show. The film is not very lavish in terms of sets and special effets, and the duration of the film is set inside and outside of a residential building. Very interesting swimming pool shape. The film has a good story-telling process, but it's not scary. It's funny and suspenseful, more than half of the film is dialogue driven. The creature makes a few brief mements, and didn't have the effect of a scene like the alien appearance in Signs. The supporting cast all turned in pretty good performance. Shymalan has writen quite a bit screentime of for himself. Cindy Cheung who plays the Korean neighbor has some stealing moments, but a few of the scenes of her opposite Giamatti is over her shoulder only without a reverse! Bryce Dallas Howard may appear on the poster exclusively, but her role has limited screentime compare to Giamatti, and it's not even as challenging as her blind girl character in The Village. I wished they had done more underwater scenes or give the viewers images of the "Blue World" where Story(The Lady) came from. Afterall, I don't see how this film costed $75 million to make. On another note, I was also surprised that Wong Kar Wai(2046)'s favorite cinamatographer Christopher Doyle got this gig, because it's not his style at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>Does M. Night have to be in all of his movies?<br /><br />This is a good movie but I expect better out of him. I've enjoyed all of his movies so far but this one didn't require much thought process. There was no secret or cleaver ending to the story. It was just...there. I didn't get that sense of really good story telling that he's had in his previous work.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch Lady in the Water. I had loved Signs, but stayed away from the Village at the request of a friend. So, the movie began...and I was stunned.<br /><br />Few movies have made me want to watch them again, immediately. Few movies leave me dozing off at night thinking about them. the Lady in the Water did both.<br /><br />The acting was wonderful, and the story was refreshing, fun and completely engrossing. The Lady in the Water was a work of art. It's a film that I shouldn't have liked, but ended up in love with. It's a film that makes no sense, but makes all the sense in the world. An adult fairy tale? How insane, right?<br /><br />The Lady in the Water is like a good painting or piece of music...you can't often describe WHY you love it, but after it is done, you want to view/listen again. Few movies carry this artistic weight. It is a weight better suited to describe the music genre.<br /><br />The Lady in The Water is a must see. It is comforting and warm, just like your favorite security blanket or stuffed friend.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 798<br /><br />50 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

His films, conceptually, always seem to want to convey a deeper message, meaning or metaphor. This is welcomed for me, but this film, Lady in the Water was a mess. The characters seemed to be created like caricatures, and for me, could not be taken seriously. The film felt 10 hrs long, and the entire film was a garbled mess for me. PQ and AQ clear, but not the best. Technically-4/5. Film 1/5. Ugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>There is no doubt that M. Night is a talented director and a so so actor.  Paul is a fantastic actor.  I applaud Night for trying something differant from his usual formula twist ending.  But overall the movie didn't leave me feeling "wowed".  A lot of people around me booed when it was over.  I won't go that far, but the movie just doesn't get it done.  A lot of the movie feels like Night is taking shots at critics and studio executives in thinly veiled references.  This one can wait for dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>That is the question. The story was all mixed up and didn't seem to have any focus, the characters weren't well developed, the acting wasn't great, and yet I really liked it. Why?<br /><br />The story is about a water nimph that lives in a pool and comes out to, okay I don't really know what she came out for, and meets up with this guy that owns a hotel and has a stutter. then she decides she wants to go back but cant because there is this big dog that looks like a wolf and has grass growing on its back that attacks her but shouldn't because of the three monkeys who enforce the rules but their not dong their job so the nimph has to find the guild, the healer, the interrupter, and the guardian who all happen to live in the hotel to try to get her back into the pool before the dog thing can eat her. Wow, did you get any of that? if you did, go see a doctor.<br /><br />Anyway the whole movie is like this. The nimph fish person, whatever she is, comes out of this guy's pool naked and the guy with the stutter doesn't even offer her any cloths. He doesn't even ask why she was in the water in the first place. And everyone in the movie just sort of accepts whatever the nimph person says as truth. Come on. If some lady came out of my pool and told me that a dog covered in grass was trying to kill her and that I had to find a group of people to help her get back in the pool, I'd think she was retarded or something. The last thing I'd do is believe her.<br /><br />Now for the good. This movie is full of symbolism and a deep message. There are parts in this film that, although they don't make any sense, are very powerful and show Shamalaws true creative genes. If you can just suspend your belief for this movie it is really enjoyable. But if you're like me and like to analyze every part of the movie, you might be left a little disappointed. if you read this review, please leave a comment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I love Shyamalan's work. I adored each film he's put out so far. So when the Lady in the Water's trailer began to show in theatres, I was giddy with delight. But then I saw the film. I enjoyed it, and was entertained, but I found myself wanting more. I was used to getting sucked into his films, and this, although coming close, simply fell short.<br /><br />That being said, I truly believe M. Night is paying homage to three of the greatest fantasy writers of all time in this film: Stephen King, L. Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz), and J.R.R. Tolkien. I deduced this from three sets of characters in the film - we have a lawn wolf that is literally made of grass and hedge (see the monsters from The Shining), we have an evil group of flying monkeys (see Wizard of Oz), and there is also the eagle that represents safety and closure (see the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />The plots involves a group of apartment dwellers who discover a mysterious women who may possess knowledge that will help heal the world. Of course, there are forces of evil that wish to keep her from doing this, and the neighbors rally around her to ensure her safety.<br /><br />All-in-all, Lady in the Water is an entertaining film with an original plot. The film is doing okay at the box office right now (it's brough in 22 million and cost 55 million) but this is not your typical Shyamalan. Rather, this film appears to be his little pet project, one conjured up from those nights he told this tale to his own children. It's loaded with sentimentality and stands strong on its own merit, but when compared with his other work, ultimately falls short.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I stayed away from this film for a while mainly on the basis of some comments of critics ( who I do not normally trust), some incorrect summaries, and some bad promo clips. Up front I must say that I love the surreal, so that element throughout the entire film made things superb.The driving force in this film was, of course, a first class<br />cast of actors, a very good script, and a fulfilled supernatural drive in the film ( which the VILLAGE promised but never delivered, despite that film being superbly crafted).The film shows the Journey of a supernatural being and how that being inspires a human to fulfill their greatness.The humans in a group of flats discover their higher roles, and so work to beat the forces of darkness.<br />THE DVD: The extras are very good. One missing element is a commentary. Also, one of the deleted scenes is so useful for explaining one sequence in the film ( Paul Giamatti's exploration of the Cave beneath the pool) that I find the deletion totally inexplicable.The Gag reel and the Reflections in the Water extras are very good watch, and explain<br />many parts of the film if you need them explained.</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>This was a wonderful movie.  It was a unique concept based on some Far Eastern myth.  It captivated me through out because I had no idea where it was going.  The acting was good.  It included suspense, romance, misdirection, a little scifi, a little fantasy.  I will definitely add this to my collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This movie is a very odd and wonderful movie all mixed into one movie. I do like the odd and strange movies and this one had it!!! It is a fairy tale for adults that is wonderfully done and "unfolded" all in their time. What I really did like about this movie is the plot and how it was told. It keep you on the edge of your seat and "guessing" about what was really going to happen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves "adult fairy tales"!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is the most (in my opinion) unusual and creative film of his career. It should go without saying that all his films are unusual leaning towards the supernatural and fantastic, touching upon subject matter such as earthbound spirits, alien invasions, an indestructible super-man, the notion of fear itself controlling us and in Lady in the Water, a bed time story turned adult fantasy about the necessity of the human being to become more aware and change for the better.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (Sideways) plays the leading role of Mr. Heaps, the landlord of a large apartment complex, a caring man who has made it his sole purpose to take good care of his tenants though later in the film, we discover his true purpose and why he is off his true path. Giamatti is an excellent actor, able to do comic roles and true pathos with utter believability.<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village) as Story, the Narf who arrives from the world of water to the land of the human in order to move the human on the correct path towards positive change is perfect in this role. Howard's pure innocence as the Narf came across as genuine and her vulnerability almost visceral as the evil monsters that hide in the grass stalk her and attempt to drag her away and destroy her.<br /><br />In fact the entire cast played their roles with enthusiasm and all seemed as actors, to really enjoy doing this film with Shyamalan.<br /><br />To make an observation, all of Night's films except maybe The Village, have a similar underlying theme. That theme is the individual discovering their true purpose in life and following that purpose. In this film he expands on this theme writing the purpose for the entire cast in the form of the desperate mission to enable Story to leave our world without harm. This was very clever and worked well in the film.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted writer. He is not only a gifted writer but a hard working one with an eye on perfection. It is known that he begins with an idea, jotting down sporadic notes, creating an outline and then to write several drafts to end up with the final draft. In Lady on the Water, he wrote 13 drafts before he was satisfied.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film. My fascination and study of Fairy Tales might have something to do with it however; standing alone, Lady in the Water is a wonderful story with a positive message.<br /><br />An excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although cynicism is rampant in this day and age and children hardly ever believe in Santa Claus, I for one believe in M. Night Shyamalan. Even this movie has a movie critic who belches the line that there are no new stories. Personally I think that anyone that feels that way should be boiled in his Christmas pudding and have a stake of Holly put through his heart as Scrooge would say. Let's suppose for a moment that people have brains they use for new ideas and stories. Further let us imagine that imagination exist and if we are fortunate enough to have it we can see that "Lady in the Water" has merit. Perhaps I'm a fan of Shyamalan and a sentimentalist. But whatever I am I think I know a good story when I see one. He took a story he told his children for years and made it into a movie. Parts of it seem familiar and made me want to do research on stories. But although that would be fascinating work, I don't want to take away from what he has done.<br /><br />What he has done is take an apartment maintenance man that has lost his will to be a physical doctor and made him a sort of mental doctor. One that fixes things for peoples temporary homes and comforts them in a way that touches them more deeply. Enter a water nymph swimming in the pool and other odd occurences. From the beginning he is a believer in imagination and faith. He does not hold much doubt in the possibilty of things outside our tidy little logistics that must define everything infinitesimally. Fortunately he is among people that have that same need to believe in something other than all the violence and laws of man. They all feel they have a purpose, it just may not be obvious at first. If you enjoyed Shyamalan's previous works like "The Village" you will probably enjoy this movie. If you'd rather watch movies like "Black Christmas" or some dark drama or reality show it may not appeal to you. This is mostly a movie of imagination, hope, and faith. I personally found it very satisfying and plan to get the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What a winning streak (perhaps if you exclude The Village [2004]) M. Night Shyamalan has been on since The Sixth Sense (1999). And the streak solidly continues with Lady In The Water.<br /><br />According to an interview that I heard Shyamalan do on The Howard Stern Show last summer, Lady In The Water was actually planned as a Disney Touchstone studio release and also shunned by other big Hollywood studios. It was a film that Shyamalan had wanted to make, but kept getting brickwalled by the studios. Finally, Warner Brother embraced the idea.<br /><br />Perhaps Touchstone thought that Shyamalan was on a downward spiral after the disappointing box office result of The Village two years ago. And The Village was indeed a mediocre-at-best movie. Ultimately, Touchstone doesn't look bad for passing on Lady In The Water based on the film's budget to its box office take. The bad press, bad blood, mediocre previous release all hanging over The Lady In The Water really hurt the box office success of the film.<br /><br />So the question is: what constitutes success?...A very good movie or a very good box office take? Well, one thing's for sure: Lady In The Water is definitely the former.<br /><br />The movie is well acted. Paul Giamatti is stellar; no one can say that this guy is just a character actor...he's without doubt as A-list as it gets. And his performance in Lady just reinforces my opinion.<br /><br />The movie is scary. I hate movies that rely on a lot of "jumps out of the dark accompanied by a loud bong" to scare the viewer, and Lady indeed does that a few times. But redemption is served in a thrilling, suspenseful, creepy overtone to the whole movie. And the movie is full of deliberate comic relief that works perfectly.<br /><br />Shyamalan says that this was a bedtime story (and is portrayed as such in the movie, albeit a come-to-life bedtime story) that he used to tell or was told as a young child (can't remember which). No wonder all his movies are so creepy.<br /><br />I'm sorry that I rented this instead of adding to my library. I was clearly caught up in the "Shyamalan downward spiral" unjustified hype. Lady In The Water is definitely worthy of collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I have to say that when I rented this film recently, I and my family didn't care for it much.  We didn't hate it, but we were certainly disappointed considering our high expectation of M. Night Shyamalan.  I thought "The Sixth Sense" was riviting entertainment that both scared and moved me.  "Unbreakable" was interesting, but not a great follow-up to his previous success.  "Signs" was no less than brilliant and had everything going for it like the acting, script, music, and so forth.  I think it's Shyamalan's best work.  "The Village" was better than "Unbreakable", but that is not necessarily a compliment.  I had hoped that "Lady in the Water" would be better than the critics treated it and although it is, it is still a disappointment.<br /><br />Then why the three stars, Steve?  Well, it is clever in some areas.  The casting is terrific.  Bryce Howard, The Village, is a young star on the rise who holds your attention and was a great choice for the leading role, and Paul Giamatti is turning out to be an acting find after numerous low-key, but terrric roles in such films as Cinderella Man, The Illusionist, and Sideways.  I love this guy's unobtrusive acting style.  You just believe anything about him in a role that he asks of you.  I have to admit that I also got a kick out of how Shyamalan gets back at his critics with the character Bob Babalon plays in the film, a deadbeat critic who is on the skids, but gives what appears to be insightful info to Giamatti's character.<br /><br />Lastly, the spotlight review by Kasia really made me think twice about the film.  It is rare when one reviewer, whom you might disagree with, can make you re-examine your position on something.  I will have to watch this film another time as Kasia made some really good observations and taught me why some actually liked this film more than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>With "Lady in the Water," filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ("The Sixth Sense, "Unbreakable," "Signs") has crafted one of the most unique films of recent memory. Featuring intriguing characters, fascinating plot twists, and some awesome visuals, this film is a great piece of cinema from an underrated director. The cast does a fantastic job of bringing these amazing characters to life, and the rest of the filmmakers do a fantastic job of bringing a unique vision to the screen. Despite a few head-scratching moments, this is a fascinating film. Fans of Night, and of fascinating fantasy films, will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I liked this film so well I looked up the writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan in Wikipedia before I started this review. I found he has done some other films, only a couple were at all successful: The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village. Apparently his style is not all that Hollywood (and especially Disney Studios, from which he has broken away) would want. But he's an Indian-American brought up in the Philadelphia Main Line, a wealthy suburban region I know something about from my life in Pennsylvania. Most of his films have been made in and around Philadelphia.<br /><br />The Lady in the story is a water sprite, not a mermaid. She has legs. Very pretty ones, in fact. As the opening legend (even ahead of the title credits) tells us, the water people have tried for years to contact humans, with whom they were once in close harmony, to help us with our spiritual development. They do this at great personal risk, but they feel it is essential.<br /><br />Our particular Lady, whose name is Story, shows up in the swimming pool of a rather odd apartment building, populated by a truly unique cast of characters. They are of different races, different temperaments, religions and lack of same, and so on. The manager stutters terribly except when he's in the presence of Story. Story's purpose is to be seen by a writer who has an important destiny. This writer is played by Shyamalan himself, who is a very charming young man. He has been writing a book which has not come together yet, but which is a series of fragments about life and philosophy and politics and such. When he sees Story, he is able to see clearly how to put the book together. She tells him about the future of the book, and his own personal future as well.<br /><br />It turns out Story's story corresponds to a traditional bed-time story remembered by the old Chinese lady who lives in the building with her extremely modern daughter. Using the daughter as interpreter, the traditional tale is told, with enough clues to realize that the inhabitants of this building did not come together by accident, but specifically because they are destined to help Story to get back home.<br /><br />How they figure out their individual roles in the drama needed to get Story safely back to her home, and what they each discover about themselves and each other in the process, makes a charming tale that makes a very important point. We all have a role to play, a purpose to being alive, and the people around us in our lifetime are there for a reason. We come together in order to support one another's spiritual development.<br /><br />As I was thinking about this, I got a message from one of my favorite people on the Internet, telling me she had just been thinking about the value of the circle of friends she has made through the Internet, and sounding very much like she had just been listening to my brain, or I to hers.<br /><br />Perhaps in the modern world these circles exist in hyperspace as well as locally, eh?<br /><br />I have to give this movie three stars. I'd like to give it four, but it does seem just a little too precious at times, and a wee bit contrived. Only a wee bit, but that keeps it from a full four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When "Lady In The Water" first hit DVD/BluRay in December of 2006, I eagerly snatched it up in anticipation of M. Night Shyamalan's next masterpiece following "The Village".  After viewing it at that time, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life.  Six years later, after watching the film again with a younger sibling, I finally was able to understand the overall concept and thoroughly enjoy the experience.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Lady In The Water" takes place in "The Cove", an apartment complex (complete with swimming pool) owned by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti).  When a mermaid-like being named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) suddenly turns up in Heep's pool, an entirely new world (with completely new beings) is discovered, one that Story must get back to at all costs.<br /><br />If you try to compare "Lady in the Water" to M. Night's earlier fare, you will be severely disappointed.  This is not a "surprise ending" film, nor is it a psychological thriller.  Comparing it to movies like "Signs", "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable", & "The Village" is like comparing apples to oranges.  When I originally watched the film, I was expecting the past and missed what this movie really is all about.<br /><br />The real genius of this movie?  It is essentially a modern-day fairy tale.  Based on a bedtime story M. Night told his children that later took on epic proportions, Shyamalan adapted the story into a major motion picture.  As such, the story is incredibly original and quite fantastical, filled with imaginative characters and quirky real-life individuals.  This project is a labor of love for M. Night, and I respect him for making it and making it well.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars is because some of the plot points do not exactly line up.  Yes, it is a fairy tale, but it is quite a bit fractured at that.  It contains nothing "worthy" of the multiple Razzy Awards it ended up winning, but a few points in the film are a bit confusing/nonsensical.<br /><br />Overall, upon second viewing (with a completely different frame of mind), "Lady In The Water" is inches shy of a truly classic film.  Once you understand WHY M. Night made the movie, you'll respect it in a completely different light.</p></br></body></html>

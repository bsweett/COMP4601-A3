The results are much more enjoyable (if a bit repetitive), making one wonder what might have happened had THIS been the original?<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Red Dragon" takes place before the events of "Lambs". Brilliant young FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) finally captures the mysterious Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins), but sustains wounds both psychological and physical in the process. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and Graham must revisit Lecter in order to solve the gruesome "Tooth Fairy" (Ralph Fiennes) murders.<br /><br />Clearly, director Brett Ratner studied the faults of "Hannibal" and made sure not to include them in this third installment. This time, the plot takes the same basic form as the original, only with a new killer and agent. This results in a much better overall narrative and interesting movie. Basically, if you enjoyed "Lambs" then this one will give you a similar experience.<br /><br />Why isn't this film regarded as more of a classic, then? Well, frankly it is because it already WAS done before in "Lambs"! In effect, its greatest strength is also what prevents it from being a true classic. It is (almost quite literally) a "Cut, Copy, Paste" of the original format. This is good in comparison to "Hannibal", but by definition it just can't quite attain the success of "Lambs", since the original is always the original.<br /><br />Overall, then, "Red Dragon" is a solid movie that, truth be told, probably resurrected the Hannibal series of movies and gave it some hope for a future. It completely goes back to its roots to tell an interesting story, and it succeeds in utilizing Hopkins to his fullest. It just won't go on your "best of" list because "Lambs" is already there. One has to wonder, though, what could have happened if this plot would have been the original...?</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes<br />star in this 2002 thriller prequel based on the novel.<br />A retired FBI investigator seeks a sociopath's help<br />to find a killer. This is a good prequel that's also<br />a remake of the 1986 film, "Manhunter" which is<br />superior. This dvd has nice picture and sound<br />plus neat extras. I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>I have yet to see Manhunter, but I like this version a lot because of Anthony Hopkins who in my opinion plays this part better than anyone could.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Really! They had to remake <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425228223">Red Dragon</a> with Sir Anthony Hopkins in order to make it "an official entry" in the "Hannibal series"?? Come off it people! MANHUNTER is the one and the only. This film is an insult to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CM1ICK">Manhunter [Blu-ray</a>] (the original film version of RED DRAGON, see my review) and really dismantles what was accomplished by it. That film of the mid-1980s changed the way cop films were made.<br /><br />Here we have the sickening Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), a pathetic Will Graham (Ed Norton who is forever being confused with the equally abominable Ed Burns), and a super-sick flashback to an earlier Hannibal. Strangely, Hopkins' rendition of Hannibal, though a Maryland native, in this film has a totally Anthony Hopkins accent. As one reviewer of the period said, Hopkins didn't even bother to change his accent the way he did in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br /><br />Graham was injured by Lecktor (MANHUNTER spelling!), true. He was slick but recall that Graham visited Lecktor in jail to discuss the Tooth Fairy--Graham had already captured Lecktor. Ah, forget it, the rest of this thing is really a waste, a greedy attempt rather than praise for the novels. Watch it if you must but don't say you weren't warned: this is pretty stupid overall.<br /><br />Now MANHUNTER is a work of unparalleled genius!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>As usual, I'm here to look at the flaws mainly.<br /><br />1. Hannibal in this third installment is not how he usually is in previous installments. He is still smart and witty and quick to speak, but not poetic and the suspense in his tone is lacking or not there. You have to sort of watch the others and this back to back to see the difference. I just find his verbal scenes in this one a lot less satisfying, the Hannibal signature is starting to lack. It's hard to describe.<br /><br />2. The new main character, Edward Norton, is a great actor HOWEVER he does not fit this role nearly as well as his predecessors. He just doesn't have it. He's a fantastic actor in other movies, he just doesn't fit this role much in this one IMO. He doesn't look the part nor is he meant for it.<br /><br />3. The pace of the movie. I feel it is a bit quick and doesn't have the mystery feel behind it like it usually does. Hannibal usually assists with this area significantly, but his role feels rather lacking not to mention it differs from the usual. Basically, I'm missing the similar suspense and story build up. It doesn't interest me like the others.<br /><br />4. The scene with the reporter I believe? Slightly past the one hour mark of the movie and the scene with the killer (no this is not a spoiler....) This is where the acting goes to h*ll. Just watch it, the whole entire scene becomes a joke and I almost had to keep myself from laughing. Like the movie was sorta okay, then suddenly they threw in some goof balls....it almost became a comedy of some sorts. Just watch the whole scene from their encounter, just plain laughable directing and acting.<br /><br />5. !!WARNING POSSIBLE OPENING SCENE SPOILER ALERT!! I'll just admit straight out that the opening scene itself is flawed because in the prequels of this making, Hannibal is usually portrayed purposefully as someone almost invulnerable, impossibly witty and sly. Him getting killed the way he did in the beginning is a grave mistake, especially with such a lame and outright approach. He's the great Hannibal Lecter, getting stabbed with some arrows and shot during a lame charge is an insult....<br /><br />6. LMAO! I'm still watching this and they describe the villain as a very strong person that is possibly a body builder! Based on the weights that he lifted in the earlier parts of the movie, there is no way he is that darn strong. He is not exceptionally or extraordinarily strong or buff enough for him to set himself apart from many other people out there, especially enough to help narrow the search down to just him. He looks like an average man, not even muscly either!<br /><br />7. !!POSSIBLE VILLAIN'S WEAPON CHOICE SPOILER!!The villain's choice of weapon is one huge thing degrades the movie, how can you have a Hannibal related villain that runs around with a silencer gun....I mean come on! We want our villains to remain brutal, man eating, gore loving, hands on murderers! Not some little pansy with a gun, guns are for wimps. I do also take note that the villain in the first movie also slightly uses a gun, but he fits the other description so it's negligible.<br /><br />8. The ending was a bit confusing but basically there's a twist. I won't tell you the twist, but like other reviewers, I have to agree that it is indeed lame.<br /><br />9. !!POSSIBLE NEAR ENDING SPOILER ALERT!! Okay does anyone even know how the heck that blind woman got out of that ring of fire near the end? I mean COME ON!<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Anyone that gives or have given this movie a star rating of 4 or 5 is out of their mind. Take in mind that only 5 percent or less of the population knows what is good and what is bad. This movie is not horrific, but it does not belong in the same line as the previous two. Will not watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lector in this prequel to Silence of the Lambs. FBI agent returns after capturing Lector, to be called into duty to hunt for a killer called "The Tooth Fairy." Even though Lector is one of Hollywood's great villains and Hopkins' performance fine, it fails to deliver the chils or any surpries any way for that matter this mediccre sequel. If people were influenced by the media, every time they saw a killer like this they would comit homicide. Easily the worst entry in the series though fine in many respects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Chronologically the second entry in the Hannibal Lecter saga, "Red Dragon" delivers everything, with an all-star cast, a fine screenplay, and haunting music from Danny Elfman. Sir Anthony returns for his curtain call to the role that launched him into Hollywood immortality. With some fancy computer work, Sir Anthony both looks and acts younger as the chilling Dr. Lecter, oozing menace and charm all in one. Edward Norton is appropriately tortured and duty-bound as Will Graham, the ex-FBI agent who caught Lecter (this is done in a chilling pre-credits sequence). Ralph Fiennes is evil and tormented as The Tooth Fairy, and Emily Watson is simply sublime as the woman who tames the beast. I felt that Mary Louise-Parker and the actor who played her son were under-used, but it doesn't detract from a great story. thrilling appetizer to "Silence Of The Lambs," which is the prelude to the even more delicious "Hannibal." the film should have been rated PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 3:14 Mins<br /><br /></span></p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Only Anthony Hopkins can play the deranged character of hannibla lecter. this movie is awesome i recommend it to every horro fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>I guess this is a prequel to "Silence of the Lambs," or is it a sequel? No matter. It's nowhere near as scary as the original, but it does have some tension sufficient to hold your interest. Ed Norton, somewhat light in his loafers, plays Jodi Foster in this, while Hannibal Lechter is, as usual, Anthony Hopkins. The main villain is no Hannibal Lechter, but he has his moments. You've seen the ending several times before. Trust me. Watch if you are a Lambs fan. Just don't expect any great miracles.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a very good "remake" of Manhunter" which was the first Hannibal Lecter movie but didn't get the press the others did because it didn't have Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal.<br /><br /> After "Silence of the Lambs" became so popular, and the sequel, "Hannibal," it was decided to re-do that first film and this time obtain Hopkins' services.It worked because not only do you have the incomparable Hopkins at Dr. Lecter but you have one this generations best actors, Edward Norton, as the leading character "Will Graham."<br /><br />Norton, as always, gives a solid performance. And - look at the backup cast: Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary Louise Parker and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Not bad.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing. On my first look, I was disappointed Hopkins didn't have a bigger role but, after I knew what to expect, subsequent viewings made me appreciate the film's effort as a whole, and it's an underrated flick and a fine addition to the "Lecter" series.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>In case you don't get my review title, I'm counting Hannibal Rising as the very first movie. Red Dragon is a really good prequel to The Silence of the Lambs. It shows how Hannibal got in that room and how he helps Will Graham find The Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy is a psychopath who is obsessed a painting called Red Dragon, and had an abusive grandmother.

Much better than expected, gotta see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This film is a remake of Manhunter (1986).  It is the first in the Hannibal Lector series.  Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins, so right away you come to realize that this should be a good remake.  This movie does not disappoint you on that end. The story line was the exact same as Manhunter, no changes.  The screenplay, however, was a better adaptation, so many of my questions about Lector were answered whereas Manhunter left me "hanging".  Hannibal is in jail and helps the FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton)---who he nearly killed and eaten a few years before--- catch a new serial killer, "The Tooth Fairy".  This time "The Tooth Fairy" is played by Ralph Fiennes.  I have to admit I liked Tom Noonan's "Tooth Fairy" better.  Overall this remake of Manhunter, in my opinion, is superior, except for the portrayal of "The Tooth Fairy".  Also since the time line happens before "Silence of the Lambs", more could have been done to make Hopkins look younger.  Overall an excellent and entertaining film!  Please watch this before you watch Silence of the Lambs, and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one I find myself watching alot. While all the performances are above average, I found Fiennes and Watson to be the most interesting part of the film. Their tragic romance, coupled with the infamous scene w/Hoffman, help liven up what could have been a very average thriller. I thought Norton was a little ho-hum, and while I like Hopkins alot, I was somewhat disheartened to see him primarily used as comic relief. But these are actually minor flaws, and while this film is far from perfect, it generally sticks to the novel by Thomas Harris(one of the best thrillers ever written; if you haven't read the book, you should...). An enjoyable, B-grade masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel "Red Dragon" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller.

It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins.

And I remember and enjoyed MANHUNTER back in the 80's.<p>So I wasn't in a big hurry to see RED DRAGON, despite having such a stellar cast.  Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel AND Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector?  Now that's a cast.  I watched it and enjoyed it, especially the departures it made from the novel and the original movie.<br />If this film came out in the mid-1980's (before MANHUNTER), would be one of the greatest thrillers of all time.  Everyone's great in it.<p>But, despite hitting on every piston in everything else, my enthusiasm for the movie was lost because...I already knew this story.<br />(I think this is a huge problem in Hollywood: the acting, the technology, everything has exceeded the writing.  The stories, for whatever reason, have been up there with everything else.  Lack of development, rushed deals, whatever.  In this particular example, the story was exhausted.)</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Before Hannibal ... Before Silence of the Lambs ... There was evil in its purest form ...<p>That is the tag line Universal Pictures is using to lure in fans of Hannibal the Cannibal into the latest feature film. Though younger fans of the Hannibal Lecter series may be amazed at the originality of Red Dragon, the older fans may believe that the story for the highly anticipated sequel is all too familiar. And they would be right. Red Dragon is actually a remake of the first Hannibal Lecter film, Manhunter, which was released to little public acknowledgement back in 1986. In Manhunter, Dr. Hannibal Lecter was played by Brian Cox. Now veteran actor Anthony Hopkins returns to the role that made he made famous in Silence of the Lambs. But returning to a famous role can have its downs as well as its ups, just look at Hannibal. Granted the highly anticipated sequel had a huge opening weekend (the largest opening weekend for an R-rated film until The Matrix Reloaded opened) but due to lackluster reviews and some public panning, the film dropped quickly from the public eye. Will Red Dragon be doomed to suffer the same fate as its predecessor or will it be able to bring the series back to its former glory?<p>The story takes place several years after Dr. Hannibal Lecter is captured by FBI agent Will Graham in a bloody confrontation that leaves both with permanent scars from the event Though Graham has left the FBI because of the capture of Lecter, he is still sought out by Agent Crawford who needs help in a special case. It is believed Will possesses an ability to get into the mind of the criminal and capture them quickly. After searching through evidence of the disturbing murders of two families, Will admits that had help in his cases. That help came from Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now in jail serving nine consecutive life sentences. Now Will must face his greatest fear of confronting Lecter again. If he doesn't, more and more people will die at the hands of this serial mad man. The story of Red Dragon is pretty well done compared to Hannibal. It sets up a good opener of how Lecter was captured but the injures sustained by Lecter in that confrontation are not fully explained in the course of the film, which causes some confusion as they seem to focus more the injuries of Will Graham then Lecter. Other then that small squabble, the story envelops the audience and really brings them into a suspense thriller that is well played.<p>The cast for Red Dragon is pretty large and offers a variety of talented actors and actresses from many different backgrounds. Anthony Hopkins once again offers a stirring performance as Hannibal the Cannibal. He presents a character that is not only intelligent but one that will leave chills down your back long after the movie is over. He plays him so well that it seems that he was destined to play Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Edward Norton gives a good performance as Will Graham. His character isn't cared for as much as Clarice in the previous Lecter films but then again, the audience isn't as attached to him as they are Clarice, emotionally that is. Ralph Fiennes presents a quite but twisted look to a serial killer. He plays the role straight out as a man who knows what he is doing is things that are wrong but has no emotional control over himself. Other characters within the film are played as they should be and do not stand out amongst the earlier mentioned cast but still are pretty good overall.<p>Overall, Red Dragon was a good film but not a fantastic film. The story played well with its two hour time frame but there several moments that offset the generally good film. There were parts in the plot like the ending to the confrontation between Lecter and Graham in the opening sequence and whole ending to the film that caused confusion and really let down fans of the series. The ending to this film could have been taken to a whole new level but the filmmakers stuck with one that was sort of expected. Not to say that everything in the film was bad. The story played out for the most part except for the previously mentions plot holes. The acting from Hopkins, Norton and Fiennes really set this film from the rest of the trash that is currently cluttering the box office theaters. Plus the way Red Dragon transitions itself into Silence of the Lambs film by introducing Clarice but not showing her was very well done by the film makers. But all those good things can't take away the feeling the audience was a little cheated with the ending. This is a good film to see opposed to trash like Knockaround Guys and The Tuxedo which may or may not be getting more attention then films like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>In a story set before the events of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; FBI investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton) returns from an early retirement to hunt for a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) with assistance from the imprisoned Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, of course).  I was leery about this one, especially because the director, Brett Ratner, has not done very much good work in the past.  However, he really rose to the challenge here.  He understands the Lecter character and has put together a very suspenseful, scary movie.  The outstanding cast does a wonderful job.  Ted Tally, who wrote the screenplay for SOTL, also took on the writing chores here and acquitted himself well.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>If sequels are traditionally worst than the original, prequels are less obvious. While Star Wars seems to show that they can be as terrible, a comparaison between Hannibal and Red Dragon is definitively a point in favour of prequels. <p>In Red Dragon, Hannibal says "a rational society would have killed me, or put me to some use". This is not only an interesting sentiment, but also a reflection of his character in movies - either stop using his character, or put him to some use. The movie Hannibal didn't get that. Red Dragon does, and that's one of the things it gets right. <p>Another thing it gets right is serial killers - or in this case, one serial killer, Red Dragon, who has killed two families and will kill more unless Agent Graham, the man who got Hannibal in prison (as told during the delicious opening scenes), gets on the case. Having established a patient-doctor relationship with Hannibal, who is a top-rate psychologist, Graham appeals to him again to help him solve this case. But Hannibal has an agenda of his own as well. <p>Red Dragon is trying a bit too hard to psych people. It has a number of false alerts (as well as an ending which serves absolutely no purpose) and a trivial character (the reporter, who serves as little more than foil). It could have been more, but as a portrayal of serial killers, Hannibal Lector, and interesting mysteries, it's right on the dot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>...and the Hannibal saga goes on. The third installment of this trilogy had a few surprises up its sleeve: notably, the incredible cast, secondly that it's a very worthy continuation of the other two (a lot of people were expecting it to fail dramatically).<br />  This time around it's Lecter back to his coaching methods again as he directs an FBI agent (Edward Norton) to find the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; killer (Ralph Fiennes).<br />  The new elements in this film compared to its predecessors are that it contains more fear, more intimidation, and less dosages of dark humor. All these work in a positive way: they are not overblown out of proportion, in fact the film is superbly balanced throughout.<br />  And, speaking of balance, the biggest trick is balancing big time actors like Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and of course Hopkins himself. Indeed, it's not Hopkins that dominates the proceedings here (even though it's impossible to even think of ignoring his presence) but Fiennes portraying the psychoting serial killer that the &quot;doctor&quot; is helping to track down. Fiennes gives a memorable (and tone setting) performance in one of his very best roles of his career.<br />  Fiennes's performance helps shift the focus point from Lecter in an overwhemling way. Aided by Norton's subtle but ultra-convincing acting the whole film becomes a classic not only for fans of the Hannibal trilogy but for fans of the genre in general. Keitel is great in his rather small role and it goes without saying that Hopkins maintains his reputation as one of the all-time classic cinematic psychos.<br />  The script is very well-crafted and maintains the suspense and the &quot;edginess&quot; from beginning to end, but what really does the trick are the dark optics that accompany it particularly the sequences involving Fiennes and his horrifying deeds.<br />  As it has been mentioned already &quot;Red Dragon&quot; can be viewed either as a sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; or a prequel to the previous two parts. But even if viewed as a sequel it's actually incredible when you think that it could've been a disaster especially because of the hype prevailing the other two films before it. It's far from that, it's simply a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />The movie begins with the capture of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) by FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton).  However, the capture isn't a simple, "Put your hands up."  Both Lecter and Graham are seriously wounded.  Lecter ends up in his famous cell and Graham retires from the FBI.  But when a new series of serial murders begins, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), Graham's boss, convinces Graham to come back to work for the agency to help them find the person they are calling 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Graham returns to the FBI but in working on the case he must request the help of Lecter.  Lecter, who has become quite famous for his murders, is also contacted by the serial killer who considers himself to be the incarnation of Blake's Red Dragon.  Graham has to work out the details and connections to figure out who the killer is while dealing with the psychological manipulations of Lecter.  The result is a climactic scene similar to the beginning of the movie when Lecter is captured.<p>My Comments:<br />I'll reveal my bias from the beginning - I love psychological thrillers and I'm fascinated by serial killers.  So, in reading my review you may want to keep that in mind.  The only problem I had with this movie is I wasn't sure Edward Norton was the perfect fit for an FBI agent.  I really like Norton in most of his roles and he plays all sorts of characters, there was just something about him as a serial killer profiler that didn't work perfectly.  I still think he did a good job, but I just wasn't sure I was as convinced that he was being played with psychologically - at least, not nearly as convinced as I was when Jodi Foster was being played with by Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.  So, that was a small problem.<p>Otherwise, the acting was great.  I particularly enjoyed Ralph Fiennes (Francis Dolarhyde & the Red Dragon).  He came across as extremely disturbed, which, obviously, was what he was supposed to be.  <p>I read the book Hannibal before I watched the movie and was pretty disappointed by the movie.  I haven't read Red Dragon, so I don't know how they compare.  However, from my past experience reading Thomas Harris novels, I'm guessing that the book is probably better than the movie.  <p>I also cheated when I was watching the DVD.  I have a tendency to look at the length of movies before I watch them - usually because I'm pretty busy and have to plan accordingly.  Well, as I was watching Red Dragon, I realized that Francis Dolarhyde had allegedly been killed at about 112 minutes but I knew the movie was 124 minutes long.  I wasn't positive what was going to happen next, I thought Lecter might escape, but once they showed Graham back at his home in Florida it clicked.  I liked the ending.  However, I'm not sure that it made perfect sense as serial killers go.  Of course, I'm not an expert on serial killer profiling and maybe it does, I just thought that it was actually plausible that Dolarhyde would kill himself instead of killing Reba McClane (Emily Watson).  To do what he did was pretty calculating and based upon how he seemed to be acting prior to that, I wasn't sure it worked perfectly, but I was ultimately satisfied.<p>Overall, I liked this movie better than Hannibal but not quite as much as Silence of the Lambs.  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs or like psychological thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  As with all movies about serial killers, it can be a bit disturbing (one of the people we were watching it with actually left the room she was so disturbed by it) what with references to eating people and what not.  But perhaps Lecter's fascination with cannibalism is what keeps fans of Thomas Harris's novels coming back.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>When I first saw Michael Mann's adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel "Red Dragon", I was blown away; I'd never encountered a character as evil and wiley as Hannibal Lector (Played by Brian Cox.)....Years later, I read Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs back to back, and was blown away again. Especially by Red Dragon- The end of the book was SO powerful and dark that upon finishing the book, I sat in stunned silence for the rest of the train ride home. How could they have NOT used that end in Manhunter???<p>  Well, here's more of the same....Red Dragon is perfect in nearly every way, except for the ending, which, while retaining the same setting, opts for a more "Crowd-pleasing" finale...and loses that punched-in-the-gut feeling that the novel gives.<p>  The cast is top-notch, as one would expect from actors the caliber of Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Especially good as the loathsome Freddie Lounds..), etc. Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, and Anthony Hopkins are all spellbinding in their respective roles as Fed, Serial Killer, and Imprisoned Cannibal, and the actual depiction of the capture of Lector, as well as his infamous dinner party is a real treat. I just couldn't get past that ending, though. Ever since Hannibal came out, I've been looking forward to the promised "Faithful" adaptation of Red Dragon. This isn't it. It's a well-made thriller with a cop-out ending. See the movie, by all means; If you liked the previous Hannibal films, you'll like this. But then do yourself a favor and read the book, to see the TRUE finale to the Will Graham/Tooth Fairy saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel "Red Dragon" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features Edward Norton in the role of troubled, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer, known as the "Tooth Fairy". It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by  Anthony Hopkins. Unfortunately for Graham, Hannibal has not forgotten that Graham was responsible for his changed circumstances.<br /><br />It is Hannibal Lecter, after all, who was the catalyst for Will Graham's retirement. The viewer is treated to scenes of Lecter's life, before he was revealed to be Hannibal the Cannibal, one of the sickest serial killers ever to strike. The viewer sees the renowned psychiatrist in his milieu as an erudite, cultured, and wealthy patron of the arts. A noted gourmand, Dr. Lecter liked nothing better than to give intimate dinner parties for the favored few. Of course, some of the ingredients used for his dinners were best left unsaid. It was nice to see the always excellent John Rubenstein in the small role of a dinner guest, heaping accolades upon Hannibal for his dinner parties.<br /><br />The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Anthony Hopkins reprises his career defining role and steals the show (Really, Hannibal Lecter has become all but a cottage industry for him!). With a twinkle in his eye, he is, in his low key way, deliciously malevolent. Edward Norton, one of the best young actors around, gives a decent and sensitive portrayal of Will Graham, the angst ridden former FBI agent and profiler, but lacks the grittiness and hard-edged veneer that the role really demands. He also simply looks  too young and soft for the role.  Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as the tormented Francis Dolarhyde, but his portrayal is hampered by the fact that too little is revealed in the film about what makes him tick.<br /><br />Emily Watson affectingly plays a blind woman who becomes romantically involved with Francis Dolarhyde. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Moreover, Ms. Watson is a wonderfully talented British actress who manages to get her American accent down pat. Good performances by Harvey Keitel, as Graham's former boss, and Mary Louise Parker, as Graham's wife, round out this fine, ensemble cast.<br /><br />This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is subject to comparison to its 1986 predecessor "Manhunter". Having seen both, I call it a draw. This current version had a bigger budget, so obviously it has better production values. Also, the opening scenes in the current version are more interesting than those in the 1986 one. Music, however, was used to much better effect in the earlier version. Moreover, the final scenes in the earlier version were much better than in this later version, as they were much more suspenseful. Both films, however,  are well worth watching. Do yourself a favor and view both. Then,  judge for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>The debate has raged long and hard as to which of the adaptations of Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon is superior with most people plumping for whichever version they saw first. For this is the problem with remakes (or watching a movie having already enjoyed the novel) and particularly with thrillers, where it's the twists and turns that dictate just how much viewing pleasure and excitement there is for the audience. So at the end of the day being objective about which movie is better and how to rate each one is very difficult (and perhaps all that serves to prove is the pointlessness of the debate) but for what it's worth here goes...<p>In a third outing as the world's favourite cannibal Anthony Hopkins returns in this prequel to "The Silence of The Lambs", complete with a ponytail in a new and very clever opening sequence that pits Hannibal Lecter against the FBI's special agent Will Graham (Edward Norton). Directed by Brett Ratner, (a surprise choice given that his last two outings were The Family Man and Rush Hour 2), Red Dragon sets out to recapture the tension of Jonathan Demme's multi-oscar winning "Silence of The Lambs" and to this end the sets of Hannibal Lecter's prison cell have been expertly recreated. Anthony Heald makes a return as the disgustingly sleazy asylum boss, Dr Chilton and Anthony Hopkin's part is inflated from both the novel of its origin and Manhunter. For make no mistake, this is (unlike Ridley Scott's Hannibal) not a Hannibal Lecter film, just as it was never a Hannibal Lecter novel. Instead the focus of Red Dragon is actually Will Graham's showdown with his own inner demon's and another serial killer, Francis Dollarhyde, christened the Tooth Fairy by the movie's tabloid press and played expertly by the ever excellent Ralph Fiennes, complete with a body toned by months of lifting weights and an enormous tattoo, (present in the novel but absent from the book) of the eponymous Red Dragon, covering his entire back.<p>But is it any good? Well, I genuinely believe that how much you enjoy this movie wholly depends on whether or not you have previously seen and enjoyed Michael Mann's original cult movie of the same novel, because for the most part both movies follow the same path and in places the same script. Being objective, and trying to put aside the baggage of having both seen and enjoyed Manhunter (I own it on VHS), I have to admit that this is by Hollywood standards a superior thriller with an excellent cast. As previously mentioned, to my mind Ralph Fiennes is both the star and strength of this movie. However, despite being an enormous fan of Edward Norton's previous work (Primal Fear, American History X, Fight Club, The Score etc.), I would have to say that he was miscast as special agent Will Graham in that his appearance is too preppy and his portrayal seems to lack the inward depth of a man tortured by his own thoughts and the mental scars of his previous (mental and physical) duel with Dr Lecter. Don't get me wrong Edward Norton's performance is fine but it just lacks that spark and charisma of his other roles, which I cant help but feel is partly as a result of being miscast and partly as the result of some uninspired by the numbers direction by Brett Ratner. As for Anthony Hopkin's, he is surprisingly forgettable. His part is little more than a cameo, where he only just steers clear of hamming it up and fails to chill in the same way as he did in his Oscar winning performance back in 1991's Silence of The Lambs.  Harvey Keitel meanwhile is as reliable as ever as Graham's FBI boss Jack Crawford but although fine (scant praise for such fine actors) Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson are only required to sleepwalk through their parts on cruise control. This is perhaps because they have small and undemanding roles with not enough character development or screen time to get their teeth into the parts. That aside there is also much to recommend Red Dragon, other than Ralph Fiennes excellent performance. The pre-credits sequence for example and the finale are both very thrilling and very enjoyable and there are several other scenes throughout the movie, particularly those featuring Francis Dollarhyde's character development, that were absent in Manhunter but more prevelant in the novel, which positively add to the viewing experience.  <p>The debate will no doubt rage long and hard but in the end which one is better is a pointless argument and a moot point. The best way to watch either movie is with an open mind but once you have seen either version its probably best to avoid the other, as your perceptions of the plot, the characters and their appearance will in all likelihood be indelibly set, thus spoiling your enjoyment of any other version. I'm scoring this one a draw, four stars ****.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Red Dragon is an adaptation of the Thomas Harris serial killer novel "The Red Dragon", the prequel to "The Silence of the Lambs". Retired FBI profiler Will Graham (Edward Norton) is asked to return to the force to investigate the murders of two families, each killed on a full moon in exactly the same manner, before the killer can strike again. In order to find the murderer, nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy", Agent Graham seeks the advice of a serial killer that he put behind bars years ago, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) is an admirer of Dr. Lecter as well, and is simultaneously seeking his advice. Agent Graham must decipher the evidence and Dr. Lecter's ramblings in order to crack the case before the next full moon claims the lives of another family.<p>Red Dragon is the second movie adaptation of the same Thomas Harris novel. The first was a movie called Manhunter, released in 1986. So Red Dragon is in the difficult position of being compared to both a book and a movie that preceded it. I wish I could say that Red Dragon holds up well, but it doesn't. Red Dragon has but a fraction of the visual and  emotional impact that Manhunter does. It has bad screenwriting, mediocre directing, and poor casting instead. The first and most striking problem with Red Dragon is the extraordinary amount of screen time spent on things entirely extraneous to the basic plot and character development. The film really condescends to the audience by inserting several scenes that are only there to set up the next scene, as if we needed an explanation of what is going to happen before we actually see it. Presumably due to his iconic status, the character of  Hannibal Lecter is given many more scenes than the book or first movie allowed him, including a ridiculous first act that only serves to lessen our opinion of Agent Graham. Lecter's extra scenes don't contribute anything to the film except the opportunity to listen to him ramble and look at various preposterous features of the prison in which he is confined, while being distracted from the substance of the story. I found this especially annoying because I have always thought that Sir Anthony Hopkins was badly miscast as Hannibal Lecter. There are a lot more superfluous scenes in Red Dragon whose purpose I could not even guess. But all of this extraneous material prevents the film and the audience from focusing on what should be the substance of the film, and it dilutes any emotionalimpact or intellectual interest that the movie might have. <p>Red Dragon's cast is certainly impressive: Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and in supporting roles: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Harvey Keitel. I was left wondering how a film can feature so many great actors without producing one sympathetic or memorable character. I can only say by way of explanation that the characters are both badly written and badly cast. Red Dragon explores The Tooth Fairy's "Red Dragon" obsession in much greater depth than Manhunter does. In itself, that is neither good nor bad. But the character of The Tooth Fairy is so over-the-top and theatrical in Red Dragon that he is more ludicrous than frightening. And, again, too much screen time was dedicated to his histrionic antics. The more the audience sees of a villain, the less scary he seems, especially if we see that he is nutty to the point of caricature. In the film's worst example of poor character writing, Emily Watson plays the part of Reba, a blind woman in whom The Tooth Fairy seeks companionship. Reba is chatty, desperate, and generally annoying, not the bright and confident woman we know from both the book and the movie Manhunter. I find her character in Red Dragon to be a little insulting and certainly unsympathetic. Edward Norton's Will Graham is utterly lacking in depth and gives no indication whatsoever of the trauma that Lecter has caused him or of the great self-sacrifice that Graham is making when he decides to see Lecter again. Philip Seymour Hoffman sleepwalks through his performance. These are easily the worst performances of both of these actors' careers. <p>If you liked Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, you might like this film. But nothing in Red Dragon is believable -not the behavior of its characters or its knock-off gothic sets- so the movie is not affecting in any way. I strongly encourage you to see Manhunter, the first and far superior "Red Dragon" movie, and judge for yourself. Manhunter is a tightly woven film with good writing, directing, editing and casting. It is one of the best films of the serial killer genre. The characters have far greater depth. The movie has real visual impact. And Brian Cox plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as he should be portrayed. The only reason Manhunter didn't do well at the box office is that it was released before serial killers were fashionable. Fans of Hannibal Lecter should check out Manhunter and see if you don't prefer Brian Cox's charming, seductive, and chilling Lecter to Sir Anthony Hopkins' grotesque, flippant Lecter who seems simply to be trying to put on a show all the time. I've always thought that Hopkins' Lecter was more of an attention-starved creep than a convincing criminal mastermind. If you are a fan of Thomas Harris or of murder movies, Red Dragon may be worth a rental, but Manhunter is worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>This film ALMOST makes it, and will be considered a hit by those who are not familiar with the book and its original movie rendition, Manhunter.  For anyone who appreciates the book, this new movie falls short in several ways.<p>Will Graham in this movie simply does not evoke the same degree of audience/reader sympathy as in the earlier presentations.  The book painted him as an injured soul, a man with a gift he hated but was unable to resist using.  His abilities had almost cost his life, and he definitely did not want to enter the investigation arena again -- but then Jack Crawford showed up with photos.  Manhunter's William Petersen portrayed this emotional conflict extremely well, while Edward Norton merely seemed to be reading his lines.<p>Compensating for that weakness somewhat are Red Dragon's plot details (with exceptions, below), which presented far more material from the book than did the first film.  We see the original capture of Hannibal Lecter, along with expository information about Francis Dolarhyde's upbringing, which explained how the latter was driven to uncontrollable anger.  Also we see the hatred between Drs. Chilton and Lecter, particularly that sweet scene wherein Lecter had accidentally received a rejection letter intended for Chilton.  These two doctors were meant for each other.<p>Missing, however, were Graham's struggles and connection with the case, his dreams about his family and the musings that gave us a glimpse of his thought processes.  Non-vital but stinging moments were omitted -- the Leeds' phone ringing while Graham was at that murder scene, and Valerie Leeds' voice on the recorder; Graham's admonition to Crawford, "I'm not going to recognize him standing on a street corner" and identify him; Graham's bitter declaration, after being sucked into the case, "It's just you and me now, sport" -- these instances in which we identified with the hero were replaced by sensational (and fabricated) scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter.<p>Lecter, it was implied here, conceptually solved the case early on, hinting that the killer was visually attracted to the women he murdered.  The real Will Graham actually solved the case on his own; the only reason he had visited Lecter in the first place was "to get the scent back."  Graham observed, retained and analyzed; he was far more naturally talented than Clarice Starling, whose primary asset was determination.  Graham's legwork appears more extensively in the book and the first film, while the new version supplants all that shoe leather with visits to Lecter.<p>The sad fact is, this remade movie was warped to a significant extent in order to accommodate box-office drawing card Anthony Hopkins.  It would have been a lot better if they had just stuck to the author's original story and hired a younger, less famous actor to play Hannibal.  Someone as powerful as Brian Cox was, in Manhunter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>Red Dragon is based on the book by Thomas Harris,like the other two and it's the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs and it's just as great as the first one.Of course,Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal(and like TSOTL,he's was only in for about 30 to 40 minutes)he's more chilling in this one then Hannibal,I don't know who was more creepy in the movie Hopkins or Ralph Fiennes,who was scary he gave me the willies.Edward Horton who is always a pleasure to watch was a great chioce for the role of Will Graham.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is annoying but good,Harvey Keitel is just ok as the role of Jack Crawford,which was greatly played by Scott Glen in Silence Of The Lambs.But the real treat was to see Anthony Heald as the head of the Baltimore Mental Clinic.Wonderful performances,great story and more scary then gory make Red Dragon a really enjoyable movie to watch in the dark and after you'll choose who's more creepy,The Tooth Fairy(Fiennes)or Hannibal(Hopkins).Have fun and bon-appetite.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Better then the previous prequel 'Manhuter'.  ToothFairy is a lot more sinister in this version (thanks to the extraordinary Ralph Fiennes, can't wait to see him as Voldmort).  Anthony Hopkins could play Hannibal Lector in his sleep.  Strong performance by both Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson.  Thought Edward Norton gave a very lack luster performance, nothing like his in American History X or Primal Fear, so he was the weak link.  Very erie feel to the movie. Has one or two rough spots but all in all I would diffently recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I just got up from watching this movie and I have to say it certainly was strange and intense to say the lease.  We are faced with a seriel killer, who kills entire families and is dubbed as the "Tooth Fairy Killer."<br /><br />Our young detective Will is faced with a true challenge and a race with the clock to figure out what makes this killer tick, protect his family and stop this madman.  He enlists the help of none other than Lector, the feared killer that we all know from "Silence of the Lambs," who is now safely locked behind glass but who still seems to be able to influence the bizzard killings and the killer.  Always creepy.....when he is encountered. Always a game with the mind.<br /><br />We are taken to the past of our killer and find abuse which seems to have played a large role in who he is and what he is trying to become. We have a glimpse into his twisted mind as the storyline is played out and  wonder how many of these types of people are out there now. Very unsettling.<br /><br />A good movie, great characters and good storyline. If you are into movies about seriel killers this one should do quite well.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>I had already entered 1986's "Manhunter" into my personal cult film pantheon, and was worried that a remake would just screw up that fine movie.  I was pleasantly surprised that the producers of "Red Dragon" did the right thing and didn't attempt to take Manhunter on head-to-head, but instead to provide additional context to the Harris book.  Yes the ending was a cliche, but I think the writers' reasoning was that those who had already seen Manhunter needed to be surprised too.  I can respect that, and I think the ending was well done.<br /><br />Comparisons are inevitable, so here goes.  Brian Cox vs. Anthony Hopkins: very favorable, I think because the writers and producers had Sir Anthony on a much tighter leash than in Hannibal.  The role called for restraint and Hopkins delivers.  I particularly liked the first scene, where Graham realizes that Hannibal is a cannibalizing murderer.  Fans of the earlier movie may recall that Graham's realization is slightly different (in Manhunter, Graham glances at a book on war wounds, and realizes that Hannibal is the killer) but aesthetically the opening scene makes perfect logic in its own right.<br /><br />William Peterson vs. Edward Norton: both fine actors, with somewhat similar styles.  Mr. Norton is excellent in the role in the remake.  Mr. Peterson was more melodramatic (think: wiping hand on thigh while watching the Jacobi's home movie) but I believe that's more a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Tom Noonon vs. Ralph Fiennes: both were excellent and believable in their roles as the psychopathic Francis Dollarhyde.  I suppose Noonon was a little bit higher octane, but that's again a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Dennis Farina vs. Harvey Keital: I'm a *huge* fan of "Midnight Run" so I'm biased in favor of Dennis Farina.  I liked Dennis Farina better in the original.  He had a lot more energy than Mr. Keitel.<br /><br />Overall, the film is very enjoyable for both fans of Manhunter and those who have not seen the original.  I recommend it for all.  Like the Amazon.com review says, this film could have fallen into any of several pitfalls and it didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>If a sense of deja vu hangs over RED DRAGON - Director's Edition, it's because producer Dino De Laurentis already made Manhunter, a 1989 version of Thomas Harris's brilliant best seller.  <p>This time around, Brett Ratner directs, and Anthony Hopkins is back as insane Dr. Lekter (without Sir Anthony, there's no real justification for this film). Baby faced Ed Norton is disappointing as the reluctant collaborator of Lekter in tracking the somewhat sympathetic &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; killer wonderfully underplayed by Ralph Feinnes.  Ted Tally's lean screenplay includes the book's jolting finale, something the first film version strangely omitted.  <p>The loaded two disc edition has a featurette on FBI profiling and Ratner's interesting video diary (including a weird visit to the set by Michael Jackson). The unusually incisive commentary by Talley and Ratner is as interesting as the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>The prospect of a remake to a film that many loved in it's original form and wouldn't want to change in any way usually makes those very same people gasp and groan. "Psycho", anyone?. This isn't one of those cases. "Red Dragon" is a re-make of 1986's "Manhunter". While that film is just fine, it isn't one of those films were there isn't an open door for improvement or re-doing. Thus, "Red Dragon". Based on Thomas Harris' 1981 novel of the same name, this new version is heads and shoulders above it's first incarnation. First of all, let's get to the plot. The movie begins with a nifty opener(not in the book or first film)that deals with Dr. Hannibal Lecter's capture by FBI agent Will Graham(Edward Norton). While Will was horribly injured in the process, he survives and stops Lecter. Flash forward several years and Will is retired in Florida. He works on boat motors with wife and little boy. Jack Crawford(Harvey Keitel)visits and asks for Will's help in solving a case. A serial killer named 'The Tooth Fairy' is stalking families and then brutally murdering them. The identity of the madman is Frances Dollarhyde(played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes). He is a seriously disturbed psychopath who had a rather harsh childhood. Will goes to Dr. Lecter to ask the brilliant madman for his help in tracking down the killer. Ah, Hannibal. There has never been a screen villain like him in cinema history. While we were all disappointed with "Hannibal", the character that we know and love and get creeped out by in "Silence", is back. Boy, is he back. Anthony Hopkins returns to fine Lecter form here. His voice and way of speech are creepier than ever. His motions and expressions are classic Lecter. This is the performance we should've seen in "Hannibal". The character works better with a smaller, supporting role. The much larger, starring role he had in "Hannibal", just doesn't work. Imagine Darth Vader in every frame of "Star Wars". Just wouldn't work. Some reviews say it's camp and funny. Sorry folks, that was "Hannibal". Not here. Some people also worried how Hopkins would look since this movie is supposed to be years before "Silence". All I can say is that he looks just like he did. Sure, there's some age there, but it's nothing big or noticeable. He looked just like he always did in my book. Not that age has anything to do with anything anyways. Edward Norton is a great actor. One of the better ones we got going nowadays. However, I couldn't get over the feeling of how he was miscast. He does a good job. There's nothing wrong with the performance, it's just that he's too young and feels out of place in the role. Ralph Fiennes as Dollarhyde is magnificent. His portrayal is scary, creepy, and has depth and emotion. I didn't think I would forget Tom Noonan's original portrayal, but I just did. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also appears as an annoying reporter for a gossip rag called 'The Tattler', and british star Emily Watson appears as Dollarhyde's blind co-worker that he falls for. The talented Mary Louise Parker also co-stars as Norton's wife Molly. She pretty much has nothing to do but be scared. The script is tight and clever. Ted Tally who wrote "Silence", and won an Oscar for it, is back writing this one. Thank god. He keeps it like "Silence" and we can't thank him enough for it. Director Brett Ratner shows that he can be a serious director, and not just the guy who did the "Rush Hour" movies. He did an admirable job. Good for him. Two other familiar faces from "Silence" appear, but I won't say who. The end scene is also a nice wink to "Silence". The movie is far more gripping and dark than "Manhunter" could ever dreamed of being. It's clever, intelligent, and suspenseful. One of the sharpest thrillers to come out of Hollywood since....well, since "Silence". One of my favorite films so far this year. Watch it with some fahva beans and a nice chianti.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>While Silence of the Lambs is still my favorite movie because of the stunning acting of Hopkins and the engaging storyline...this one is a close second.

Best remake ever!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I was extremely skeptical when I first heard about this movie. Afterall, what else could possibly be done with this insane, yet incredibly well told story? A lot as it turns out. RED DRAGON is a "pre-quel", occuring before agent Starling's arrival. Yes, Hannibal Lecter (sir Anthony Hopkins) is in it. He is still the sinister black heart of the series. This time, he's called upon to help the FBI track down the equally evil and mysterious "Tooth Fairy" (Ralph Fiennes) killer, who is killing entire families and leaving bizarre clues behind. Ed Norton is agent Will Graham (who incidentally put Lecter away after being stabbed nearly to death by the good doctor). Graham has been  retired ever since, with his wife (Mary Louise Parker) and child in Florida. His ex-boss (Harvey Keitel) Coaxes Graham out of retirement in order to try and stop the TF before he kills again. Graham eventually seeks Lecter's genius and intimate knowledge of the subject matter. Together, they slowly put the Pieces in place. Can the Tooth Fairy be caught before killing again? What is the secret behind his murders? Norton and Hopkins are excellent in their roles. Feinnes is great as a truly menacing psychopath. He plays his twisted yet pathetic character with ease and believability. He pulls off the near impossible task of being a serial murderer deserving of at least some sympathy. Emily Watson plays a blind woman who unknowingly finds herself in love with the Tooth Fairy! I would put RED DRAGON in the same league as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It's smart, scary, and packs quite a punch, even for this jaded viewer...</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>There are a few different ways you can look at Red Dragon. You can look at it as a prequel to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, or you can look at it as a remake of Manhunter. Either way though, the potential for disaster was huge going into making Red Dragon after the dreadful Hannibal was released in 2001, but all's well that ends well here. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lecter, though he is in more of a supporting role here. Ed Norton stars as Will Graham, an FBI profiler brought back to use his unique talents to track down a brutal serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (a tattooed and frequently naked Ralph Fiennes). Being a fan of Manhunter, I was leary when hearing that it would be re-made as Red Dragon (but not surprised considering all the money Hannibal banked), and was even more leary when I had heard that Brett Ratner was directing, but now I'm pretty much eating my words here because Red Dragon turned out to be much much better than I had expected. The only real flaw with Red Dragon are the scenes between Hopkins and Norton. In Silence of the Lambs, the interplay between Hopkins and Jodie Foster was what made that film as good as it was, but it doesn't work between Hopkins and Norton for one simple reason: Hannibal isn't scary anymore. In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was a truly scary character that could make your skin crawl just by hearing him talk, but after Hannibal was released, he's just become a Hollywood circus side-show attraction that makes creepy sounding pronounciations. But besides all that, Red Dragon is an above average thriller that delivers the goods, and Ralph Fiennes' performance as the Tooth Fairy is reason enough to see the film.  This Director's Edition DVD contains an extra disc of features that is exclusive to this edition.  While a few of them are worth watching (Brett Ratner's student film is of interest), this overpriced edition isn't worth owning if you already have another edition of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>After seeing Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Red Dragon was a bit of a let down. A set of grisly murders brings FBI Agent Will Graham (Norton) out of retirement and puts him in search of "The Tooth Fairy" (Fiennes) who's driven by the image of a painting. Yet his only means of survival and success are to seek the help of another madman, whom he himself captured, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). Marked by past scars and quickly running out of time, Graham finds himself tangled in a heap of madness, sacrificing his work, his family, and above all his own life, to put an end to pure evil.<br />The biggest problem with Red Dragon is Edward Norton as Will Graham; he just doesn't fit the part. To the films advantage, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson both give outstanding performances. Anthony Hopkins plays the part brilliantly! Unlike Norton, these three actors seem totally natural and don't seem out of place at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>In the opinion of this reviewer, public fascination with the flesh eating psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter, should cease after "Red Dragon".  After the truly gross-out brain scene in "Hannibal", we get a more subdued interpretation of both the man, played by Anthony Hopkins, and the subject matter.  But the lack of gore isn't replaced by the hyper-paranoid sense of tension in "Silence of the Lambs".  PLOT WISE: An ultra bland government agent (portrayed by the ultra-bland Edward Norton) is called back into service after a series of slice and dice family homicides leave the FBI baffled - as if!  There is a sense, even from Hopkins, that he's played this role one too many times.<br />The transfer is pretty much first rate.  Colors are rich, warm and well balanced.  Flesh tones infrequently adopt an orange hue but nothing that is extremely out of character.  Contrast and black levels are accurate.  Fine detail occasionally gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Film and digital grain are both present but not at levels that would distract.  Edge enhancement crops up now and then.  Shimmering of fine details and pixelization are present but at a minimum.  The 5.1 audio is nicely balanced with deep bass and natural sounding dialogue.<br />Extras: A documentary that is pretty much average, some outtakes, audio commentaries and behind the scenes junkets that don't enhance or detract from the over all presentation.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie is nothing to write home about.  The transfer is considerably better.  But don't you wish, just once, that a truly worthy movie, like say "Gone With The Wind" would get an ultra amazing digital treatment on DVD.  Ah, now that would be real coup!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Anticipation for Red Dragon was huge following the success of Silence Of The Lambs, although anticipation to slate it was also there with the mis-step that was Hannibal.  However, by assembling the kind of impressive cast that would seem to be more at home in a Tarantino or PT Anderson picture, people were prepared to give it a chance.  Based on Thomas Harris' book of the same name that wipes over previous adaptation Manhunter with a much more glossy reinterpretation of Lecter's capture and the man behind it, Will Graham.<p>That's it for story really, with the old 'cop coming out of retirement for one last job' trick being pulled again.  Edward Norton, actor of a generation to anyone who's seen his performances in American History X, Fight Club or Primal Fear, is handed a dull part in Will Graham.  Whereas the novel and first adaptation Manhunter focused much more on this character, describing how the job was slowly destroying him, Red Dragon's script barely allows for such character development.  Norton does the best with the slight material handed to him, as does Harvey Keitel, but unfortunately (and for the first time ever) both fail to make much of an impression.  Anthony Hopkins has appropriately toned down his over-the-top performance from Hannibal here, and thankfully directot Brett Ratner chooses not to overuse the character as was the case in the latter.  Still, though his performance is good, you can't help but look at his scenes with Norton alongside those he shared with Foster and the chemistry just isn't there.  Despite these set of almost disappointing appearances though Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are wonderful.  Perhaps surprisingly given how well he's fared in epics such as The English Patient and Sunshine, in a supporting role Fiennes makes one of his most indelible impressions as The Tooth Fairy, the mass-murderer who uses Hannibal Lecter as his template.  Emily Watson also proves that she is amazingly versatile as the blind woman who Fiennes' character pursues in what turns out to be the best plotline the story has to offer.  Their nervous partnership is genuinely interesting and much better than the, albeit limited, blood and gore scenes.<p>The main problem that most critics seem to have had with Red Dragon is that it doesn't live up to Manhunter.  Whilst it's true that Manhunter is definitely the more intelligent effort, with Red Dragon reeking of a cash-in.  In addition, the almost grainy camera work is fooling no-one that this is a serious crime picture - it isn't.  Even so, it's all perfectly enjoyable whilst it's on screen, and whilst it might not be clever, insightful or as long-lasting as Silence Of The Lambs, it was definitely one of the more enjoyable blockbusters of last year and is by no means a shame to the Hannibal canon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I had relatively low expectations for the prequel to 1991&#65533;s &#65533;Silence Of The Lambs&#65533; but to my surprise, &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; surpassed my expectations and in my opinion, a somewhat underrated and underappreciated movie. <p>The movie begins in a dark and suspenseful arena where Agent William Graham encounters the extremely evil and psychopathic serial killer Doctor Hannibal Lector. However, after witnessing the extremely disturbing scenes of grisly murders that took place in someones house though creates enormous emotional trauma in Graham that causes him to retire from the FBI but three years later, two families are slaughtered on the full moons and Graham comes out of retirement and goes into a hunt to stop the next murder of another family when the next full moon occurs in three weeks. However, the next target of the mysterious Tooth Fairy Killer is Graham&#65533;s own wife and son, and to the dismay of Graham, the only one who can be able to help him stop the horrific wrath Francis Dolarhyde aka Tooth Fairy Killer, is Dr Lector himself, the same man Graham stopped and put away years before. However, Dolarhyde is also being assisted by Dr. Lector in his murder spree and is the main villain known as the &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533;. Dolarhyde though is approached by an innocent woman whose blind (loss of eyesight) and falls in love with him, or so it seems. The psychopathic tendencies of the &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; are driven by a painting that brings back memories of his childhood where he was horribly abused by his grandmother and the mental illnesses that resulted and he shows the remaining &#65533;human&#65533; that still exists. Sometimes in a way, it&#65533;s hard not to feel at least a bit sorry for him. <p>I have to say that this movie had a wonderful and incredible cast and couldn&#65533;t have been much better. Ralph Fiennes absolutely brings out the evil and extremely disturbed inner being of &#65533;The Red Dragon&#65533;. Anthony Hopkins wonderfully and cleverly portrays the disturbed mind of Dr. Hannibal Lector. Edward Norton was wonderful as William Graham. Quite frankly, this movie benefits from the excellent acting by all of the actors and actresses in the movie. <p>The movie has a ton of suspenseful and dramatic storylines and is a wonderful adaptation of the book and kind of replaces &#65533;Manhunter&#65533; from many years earlier. &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; is just the forerunner to what was to come on &#65533;Silence Of The Lambs&#65533;. The movie kind of drags on a bit during the first 45 minutes or so but then really takes off from there and becomes an intense thriller. A definitely classic this film is! Two thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>I'm not at all opposed to a good remake of a classic film, but I believe it should have something new to say, something that makes it relevant to the modern age and time.  Almost a shot-for-shot remake of the original and woefully underrated classic "Manhunter", "Red Dragon" fails on this score, and lacks the tortuous internal struggle of its detective and the trancelike, music-video pacing that made the original so creepy, poetic, and melodic.  <p>"Red Dragon" comes across as a bloodless, boring, dispirited, dreary, and mechanical cloning of the first film, directed by Michael Mann, which told the same story back in 1986 with style, wit, horror, and cinematic aplomb. Trouble is, Anthony Hopkins hadn't signed on to the role as society psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer Hannibal Lecter at the time, and Hollywood didn't have two massively successful Hannibal Lecter movies under its belt to capitalize on.  The solution: remake "Manhunter", this time casting Hopkins as the cannibalistic Lecter.<p>"Red Dragon" introduces Hannibal Lecter by way of Will Graham (Edward Norton), an FBI profiler brought back to work on the case of a new serial killer nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy" by a yellow journalist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at the National Tattler. Graham, nearly killed by Lecter, needs help in tracking and identifying the killer, and, like Clarisse Starling in 'Silence', visits the good doctor to get a 'scent for the hunt'. <p>There are some slight alterations, none of them for the better. Where "Manhunter" was about the internal voyage of the troubled Graham into the soul and mind of a serial killer, "Red Dragon" is Hannibal Lecter's movie. The first scene of the movie, which replaces the far eerier flashlight introduction to the Tooth Fairy in "Manhunter", is an account of Will Graham's near fatal encounter with Lecter. The scene is amusing, well-paced, and akin to the baroque sensibilities of Ridley Scott's "Hannibal", and earns the one star I've offered in this review; the viewer would do well to cut off the movie at this point and go watch "Manhunter." <p>In every comparison with Michael Mann's original, the movie falls far short; having seen "Manhunter" and watching this workmanlike copy is like looking at your uncle's yellowed polaroid of the Mona Lisa, after having seen the original on display. The treatment of the villain in "Red Dragon" is similarly flawed; the Tooth Fairy is introduced too soon, Ralph Fiennes (who does a competent job with what little he is given) is unable to evoke the bestial Dolarhyde, and even one of the film's horrific centerpieces, the flaming-wheelchair scene, comes off as a disinterested photocopy of the horrifying original. <p>Gone is the mounting suspense of Graham's troubling inner journey into his own wounded psyche and his terrifying relationship with Lecter; in its place we have Norton's complacent banter with a visibly mellowed Anthony Hopkins, who manages to make a cannibalistic serial killer look like a purring, content kitten. Gone too is Mann's use of contemporary music to evoke the Lecter's nihilistic universe and Graham's tortured one; notable in its absence is the modern equivalent of Iron Butterfly's 'Anna Gada Da Vida', used to startling effect in the original to make the culminating sequence of that movie approach Italian grand opera. <p>What do we have in place of all this? A clumsy, contrived 'explanation' for the Tooth Fairy's depravity, a psychosexually abusive relationship with his dead mother that could have been lifted directly from "Psycho." <p>"Red Dragon" is a technically competent movie, and to those viewers unfamiliar with the cinematic source material Rattner has pillaged it might serve as 2+ hours of pleasingly bland serial killer fare. But the viewer is best served to go out and buy "Manhunter" for a glimpse of true horror and a better perspective into the mind of a psychopath; "Red Dragon" is tapwater to "Manhunter's" chianti.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002)<p>It is the rare film that succeeds not because of its director, but in spite of him. The latest of such films is Red Dragon, a thriller helmed by a comedy director (Ratner is best known for the Jackie Chan vehicle Rush Hour and its sequel). It also succeeds in spite of there already being a perfectly capable adaptation of the book in Michael Mann's wonderfully impressionist Manhunter (1986). It succeeds for one reason: The Silence of the Lambs. <p>Ratner reprised most of the cast from Silence who also show up in Red Dragon (Scott Glenn is replaced by Harvey Keitel, who is capable but a bit jarring), and adds on Ed Norton in the main role of Will Graham, Crawford's golden boy before the advent of Clarice Starling. Graham, who retired from the FBI after almost being killed by Lecter, is brought back in as a consultant by Crawford (Keitel, in one of his few "normal" roles). Graham quickly becomes obsessed with the case, much to the chagrin of his wife (Mary Louise Parker) and child (Tyler Patrick Jones, last seen in Minority Report). Graham is tracking a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), a man with his own demons to overcome (one of them voiced by an uncredited Ellen Burstyn).<p>Made with the lush budget and relaxed atmosphere one would expect from the newest film in a billion-dollar franchise, Ratner was able to play this one a lot closer to the vest than Michael Mann was when he filmed Manhunter back in 1986. But Mann, showing the mark of a great director, took his lack of budget and made a film that is more impressionist than it is true to the source material (not that staying true to the source material of Thomas Harris makes for good flicks; both Mann and Demme departed from the book when necessary, while Ridley Scott stuck to his guns, and the writing, in the dismal Hannibal). So while comparing the two is inevitable, it's like comparing apples and oranges. Yeah, Ed Norton is pound for pound a better actor than William Pedersen, but the Will Graham of Manhunter is a far different psychological beat than the Will Graham of Red Dragon. And the Hannibal Lecter played by Brian Cox is a different beast than the Lecter played, once again, by Anthony Hopkins.<p>And it is in Lecter that the movie finds its greatest failing. Hopkins, here, suffers from what I call Freddy Syndrome. Did you ever notice that, as the Nightmare on Elm Street series progressed, and Freddy Krueger became a more popular character than the kids he was slicing and dicing, he became a nicer guy? He went from an almost unintelligible "I'm gonna kill you slow!" while pursuing Nancy in the first flick to tossing off comic-book style one-liners in the King's English by the third movie. (And as a physical marker, note that his sweater gets cleaner in every film. Really.) In a few short years, Freddy Krueger went from nightmarish serial killer to witty raconteur, the kind of guy you'd invite to a Hugh Hefner roast, as long as he put on some pancake makeup. Hopkins has the same problem. In Silence and Manhunter, you were never allowed to forget that Hannibal Lecter is not a nice guy; he's a sociopath with a taste for human flesh, and given the chance, he'd rather dine on ladyfingers than talk to them. But here, Anthony Hopkins plays the role in a far more charming manner; in the opening scene, when he attempts to kill Graham, you expect him to say something along the lines of  "sorry, old chap, rules of the game you know." (And what you actually get isn't all that far off.)<p>It's worth seeing for Ed Norton's performance, as is every Ed Norton film to date, but watch Manhunter first to get an idea of what it could have been-and, actually, what it once was. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Brett Ratner's biggest problem is the numer of yardsticks - looooooong yardsticks, at that - against which his film can be instantly measured. There's Thomas Harris' novel of course, and Michael Mann's derivative mid-eighties interpretation of it, sub nom Manhunter (apparently so as not to be mistaken for a martial arts movie!). Looming even larger is Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs, which most critics (this one included) will tell you is the pick of the Lecter Bunch. Weighing in for good measure is Ridley Scott's baroque, and markedly under-rated, Hannibal.<p>Ratner's Red Dragon is indebted to all, but transcends none, of these. It is a much better picture than Manhunter (I don't understand how conventional wisdom has managed to conclude that Manhunter is good cinema: it just isn't); Red Dragon is better executed; there's better workmanship; clearer plot exposition, it's far less a hostage to style - but on the other hand it borrows its style wholesale from Silence of the Lambs.<p>Overall, Red Dragon is workmanlike and no more. Anthony Hopkins can be dealt with quickly: the character of Hannibal Lecter has already been fully mined for chill (in Lambs) and as some sort of hammy, homicidal galloping gourmet (in Hannibal), so he steered an easy course between the two, relishing his one or two choice lines, but otherwise sleepwalking it. Harvey Keitel was a big disappointment: here he demonstrates how little he can actually act (he is terrific in films where he doesn't have to), while Edward Norton turns in a solid performance, leaving only Philip Seymour Hoffman to add any colour. Emily Watson stands out as Reba McLane and Ralph Fiennes acts well - he plays it extremely straight - but is handicapped (ahem) by his fundamental lack of ugliness. Note to file: without substantially more in the way of prosthetics, Francis Dolarhyde should not be played by one of the most handsome men on the planet. <p>Silence of the Lambs had the element of surprise and novelty, but more than that it succeeded through the complex character of Clarice Starling and her absorbing relationship with the equally fascinating Doctor. Red Dragon has none of this. Will Graham is a less interesting literary character than Clarice Starling, and to the extent there is an underlying story (in the novel Harris makes much of Graham's questionable sanity and his empathy with serial killers), Ratner largely fails to bring it out, and when Graham does get a line on the subject, at the very end (having read Dolarhyde's scrapbook, he admits he feels sorry for him), Norton misses the opportunity to imbue it with any real meaning.<p>The screenplay is patchy, too. There's no excuse: its writer, Ted Tally, scripted Lambs. But there is some pretty clumsy plot exposition, mostly out of the mouths of Keitel and Norton. And some things which work in a novel just don't play out on celluloid: the idea of Dolarhyde eating a William Blake painting is all very well as a figurative device. But just try filming it. Foolishly, Ratner did.<p>But for all that it's an entertaining film, even if it is a pretty obvious potboiler. But no work of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>"Red Dragon," directed by Brett Ratner, could be considered a "prequel" to "The Silence of the Lambs," in which Anthony Hopkins so memorably portrayed cannibalistic serial murderer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins reprises the role in "Dragon." Here he is joined by Edward Norton as Will Graham, the FBI agent who puts Lecter behind bars. In this film, Graham seeks the imprisoned Lecter's advice in capturing another serial murderer, Francis Dolarhyde (played by Ralph Fiennes).<p>Suspenseful and well-acted, "Dragon" is a superb companion piece to "Silence" and its follow-up, the way-over-the-top "Hannibal." "Dragon" contains some really startling, horrific scenes that match the other films in intensity. The film is marked by superb production details, including some really dramatic makeup effects. The story is well-paced.<p>Because of the characters' shared history, the dynamic between Lecter and Graham is much different than that between Lecter and Agent Starling, the doctor's sparring partner in the previous two films. This new dynamic gives a different twist to the film.<p>Norton and Hopkins are superb in their roles. They are joined by a truly amazing cast. As the murderous Dolarhyde, Fiennes shows us just enough of the man inside this bizarre, ritualistic monster. Harvey Keitel brings effective gravity to his role as Graham's supervisor. And Emily Watson is stunning as Dolarhyde's blind co-worker, Reba; this is a compelling character, and the humanity of Watson's performance really helps ground the film. To sum up, "Red Dragon" is a potent blend of horror, suspense, and gripping human drama.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>After HANNIBAL, the Hannibal legacy quited down it's reign of praise for a while.  RED DRAGON is the next of the Lecter legacy, although chronologically the first; it follows retired FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton), who is called back to action help track down a serial killer (Ralph Fiennes) who is more than he seems; at the same time, he enlists the aid of Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whom Graham imprisoned years before.  Norton leaves an excellent first impression on me; Fiennes is great and brings much more sympathy to the character than Ted Levine did in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; Hopkins is, of course, excellent.  There is a great score by Danny Elfman, and surprisingly terrific directing by RUSH HOUR's Brett Ratner.  Scripted by Ted Tally, who adapts the novel so well that it serves as an example for adaptations everywhere.  Hannibal lovers, dispair not; writer Tally has also added in a larger part for Dr. Lecter than in the novel.  Thomas Harris' best-selling novel was previously adapted in the much inferior MANHUNTER in 1986.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>While it lasted this seemed quite respectably sick and nasty, but after it finished I thought: Hmm. Then I read the seriously critical reviews, and they began to explain why this show didn't satisfy. There was something empty about it, although I had a sort of advantage, in that I'd seen Silence, but not Manhunter. With this fine cast I thought I couldn't go wrong, but it became obvious that it was mostly just a cash-cow, milking the crowd-pulling Hannibal. Actually, I didn't think Silence was all that marvellous, either. The idea is that one homicidal loony can understand the mentality of another homicidal loony; but that's the only real idea, and after that it's just play it again, Sam. Oh, I suppose underlying this is that we're all loonies, since we can understand the other loonies. Then we can thrill to the sight of the handicapped, hare-lipped and blind, and the thought that happy, healthy, normal, nuclear families are getting massacred. It's all fairly sick, really. Richard III is better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This is a good thriller.  Anthony Hopkins is one of the top actors in the world because he is able to play very good characters and very evil characters with flare and a lot of believability.  That, in a nutshell, is what makes him such an excellent and compelling actor.  I would agree with this reviewer:<br /><br />"The cast is top-notch, as one would expect from actors the caliber of Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Especially good as the loathsome Freddie Lounds..), etc. Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, and Anthony Hopkins are all spellbinding in their respective roles as Fed, Serial Killer, and Imprisoned Cannibal, and the actual depiction of the capture of Lector, as well as his infamous dinner party is a real treat."<br /><br />Fiennes was very chilling and his immense self absorption and egotism seemed very real on the screen.  These are not "lightweight" actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>While none of the Lechter trilogy reaches the masterpiece proportions of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, RED DRAGON is a tense and involving thriller buoyed by the star performances of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  As the movie opens, Norton captures the elusive Hopkins, not without suffering some physical and psychological repercussions.  Keitel convinces Norton to return to the FBI to help snare a monstrous killer who has been dubbed Tooth Fairy by Hoffman's tabloid publication.  This includes Norton's decision to seek the assistance of the equally vile Hopkins.  Moody and atmospheric, RED DRAGON is well paced by director Brett Ratner with an ominous score by the ingenious Danny Elfman, and a twist ending that might leave you squirming a little in your chair.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After 3 movies had chronicled the exploits of the deranged, cannibalistic doctor, Hannibal Lecter, with great critical and commercial success I might add.  Universal Studios felt it wise to return to Lecter's beginning as a serial killer by making the Thomas Harris novel, Red Dragon (this book contains the first appearance of Lecter), into a movie yet again.  A previous version already existed called "Manhunter", starring William Peterson as Will Graham and Brian Cox as the 'good' doctor Hannibal Lecter.  Universal Studios, for the sake of continuity, wanted to remake the movie "Manhunter", this time starring Anthony Hopkins who had portrayed Hannibal the Cannibal as he became known, in "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal", so that all recognized movies in the Lecter series would feature Hopkins as the doctor.  Though many critics felt this was doomed to be a mistake on Universal's part, critics felt that Hannibal's story was played out after "Hannibal".  But to Universal's credit they marched on, hiring director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour & Rush Hour 2) to helm the movie, and casting Edward Norton to play Will Graham alongside Anthony Hopkins.  The choice of director's was another cause for concern for the critics, and many fans as well, but all nay-sayers were quickly silenced, when the positive reviews started rolling in for this prequel to "The Silence of the Lambs", and "Red Dragon" went on to do big numbers for Universal, earning it's place as an incredible opener to one of the Studio's darkest movie series'.<br /><br />"Red Dragon" begins as FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is set to retire.  Graham is the man responsible for the capture of Dr. Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), but before Graham can retire he is asked to profile, and hopefully hunt down a vicious killer that is dubbed 'The Tooth Fairy', before he strikes again.  To do this, Will must come face to face with the one man he hates and fears most in the world, Hannibal Lecter.  In siding with Lecter, Graham hopes to shed some light on the deranged murders of this new killer.  But at what cost to himself or his family?<br /><br />Brett Ratner really shined with his direction for this movie, he had shown his knack for action/comedies with "Rush Hour" and "Rush Hour 2", and his ability for drama with "Family Man", but there was still nervousness surrounding the young director, since this film focused on one of the most famous movie villains of all time.  With "Red Dragon", Brett Ratner solidified his place amongst Hollywood's best directors, earning him the respect he deserved.  Edward Norton was great as Will Graham, and his scenes with Anthony Hopkins were terrific.  He expertly portrayed the fearful respect Graham has for Lecter, while at the same time conveying the underlying hatred he harbors towards the doctor.  Anthony Hopkins, though looking somewhat older than he did in "The Silence of the Lambs", does a wonderful job of showing a somewhat more energetic and younger Hannibal Lecter.  Universal Studios clearly made the right choice in remaking "Manhunter", as "Red Dragon" does an excellent job of bringing the series together with Hopkins as the evil Lecter.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movies "The Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", or "Manhunter", then "Red Dragon" is for you.  In my opinion, after you see "Red Dragon", I doubt you'll have a need to watch "Manhunter" again, except maybe for nostalgia.  That's not meant as anything negative against "Manhunter", Michael Mann did an excellent job with the adaptation, but after reading all of the Thomas Harris novels, I feel "Red Dragon" really gets the job done in a more truthful way in regards to what is contained in the book.<br /><br />"Red Dragon" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Hannibal the Cannibal is back with a vengeance, though in fact it is his first episode. This thriller is marvellously well done. The killer aims at women, but the FBI agent who is going to solve the problem has retired after arresting Doctor Lecter, after finding out Doctor Lecter was the criminal he was looking for with the doctor's help, misguiding help, of course. It is when the cop understands that the killer kills his victims to eat them, in fact to serve them to his guests that he understands the Doctor is the killer. But this retired FBI agent who goes back into service in this new case discovers with imagination, vision, intelligence and observation some facts about and characteristics of the killer. But this is not enough. He has to profile the killer psychologically and this is very difficult. So he tries to cut the task short with the help of Doctor Lecter and this help is expensive in privileges or in manipulations. The doctor even goes beyond and becomes really dangerous, looking for his own vengeance. But this is not enough, yet, to arrest the killer. The cops have to sweep wide and comb thin to get across small details that become big opportunities. Once again it is observation that is essential, but with imagination and inspiration. Once the cops have found the small detail that is going to lead them on the road to the killer things are easier, though not at all less dangerous. And the killer plans the reactions of the cops and takes them into account in his own plans, which enables him to come with an ending that is quite different from what we are all expecting. This film, like the book behind, is interesting because it reveals that serial killers have to be intelligent, creative and extremely good chess players. They have to plan ahead enormously and foresee the reactions of the police. In other words, these killers would have been good cops if they were not moved by the desire to kill or even make other people suffer. But this film insists on the severe childhood years this killer has been through and how he inherited of his killing instinct from the mistreatment he got from his own relatives. What happens when he finds himself alone, no longer dominated and controled by these relatives ? He is haunted by them and kills in order to pacify them. And it is understanding this that makes the cop able to solve the last stage in the thriller. We can even wonder if a cop does not have to become a bodydouble or a clone of the killer to be able to find him and arrest or stop him. <p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Previously produced in 1986 as MANHUNTER (by &quot;Miami Vice&quot; producer Michael Mann), RED DRAGON is the adaption of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel and the latest installment in the Hannibal Lecter series.<p>Chronologically the first in the Hannibal series, Edward Norton plays retired FBI agent Will Graham, who is taken out of retirement by FBI Special Agent Jack Crawford (Keitel, taking over from Scott Glenn), because Graham has the psychic ability to see inside the mind of serial killers.  Now he's tracking the elusive &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; (Ralph Fiennes), but Graham knows there is only one way he can get on the right track after all these years of retirement.  Now he must travel to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and visit insane genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whom Graham put away years ago.<p>This is a high improvement over Michael Mann's cult classic MANHUNTER, returning the Hannibal Lecter series to it's original form.  Brett Ratner, director of RUSH HOUR, pulls off his job considerably well.  Ted Tally returns to write the film, and does a good job.  Danny Elfman scores, and his score is excellent.  And, of course, while the cast is all terrific, Hopkins is the stand-out...although Norton (this was his first film that I'd seen) left a good first impression on me.  RED DRAGON is also lighter than the previous Hannibal films, particularly THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<p>Thomas Harris fans will be pleased with the outcome of this film, and well they should be.  It is a terrific film, top-notch entertainment and the second greatest out of all the Hannibal films.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>I HAVE TO SAY I THINK "RED DRAGON" IS THE CONCLUSION TO A TOP-NOTCH TRILOGY. YES, IT IS THE TRILOGIES CONCLUSION.. BUT WILL WE SEE ANTHONY HOPKINS REPRISE HIS ROLE AGAIN. I'M ALL FOR IT. HOWEVER, I WILL BE CONTENT WITH "RED DRAGON" BEING THE LAST HANNIBAL LECTOR FILM. ANTHONY HOPKINS (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, BRAM STOKERS DRACULA), EDWARD NORTON (FIGHT CLUB, PRIMAL FEAR, PEOPLE vs. LARRY FLYNT), HARVEY KEITEL (THE PIANO, RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION), RALPH FIENNES (SHINE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT), MARY LOUSIE PARKER (FRIED GREEN TOMOTOES, LONGTIME COMPANION, BOYS ON THE SIDE) ARE ALL GREAT WITH A CAPITOL GEE!! MOST NOTED EDWARD NORTON WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER SINCE  "PRIMAL FEAR". AS FOR THE MOVIE.. RIGHT WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER, A CHILLING CLIMAX CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. WHICH LEFT ME TWICE AS SATISFIED. CLOSER TO "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" THAN "HANNIBAL". A MUST FOR FANS OF ANTHONY HOPKINS AS HANNIBAL THE CANNIBAL. NOTE: THIS FILM IS A PREQUEL. IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE "THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS".</p></br><a href="../users/A1HS9F7J51E9CB.html">A1HS9F7J51E9CB</a><br/><p>Anthony Hopkins, smooth and suave as always, had too much face time in "Red Dragon." Hannibal Lechter is a hard act to follow in the monstrous killer department, and he has Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) at a disadvantage. That being said, "Red Dragon" is beautifully directed by Brett Ratner, and the cinematography is brilliant.<p>Will Graham (Ed Norton) almost died in the capture of Lechter and is now semi-retired, burnt out and trying to embrace serenity at gorgeous digs on the coast of Florida with his wife and son.  His boss, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) calls the reluctant Graham back to active duty on a grisly serial killer case.  The press has labeled the killer "The Tooth Fairy" because of his modus operandi in murdering entire families in their homes.  Will, like Clarise in "Silence of the Lambs," has an eerie ability of transference into the thoughts and minds of deranged killers.<p>The picture beautifully foreshadows Dolarhyde's insanity with glimpses of his journal, voice-overs of the horrendous grandmother that raised and twisted him, and quick cuts of the spooky Home for Convalescents where he grew up.  Harvey Keitel plays Crawford brusque and brutal which gives the film some much-needed grittiness.  Ralph Fiennes and Ed Norton are both movie star handsome, which is not necessarily a plus in this type of film.  In spite of Fiennes' subtle acting and his tortured psyche, I was just too sympathetic with him to get properly scared.  Norton just did not seem like he was a battle scarred veteran or particularly traumatized; he looked like an ideal leading man, which he is.  <p>Big kudos on the cinematography and visuals:  a quick cut that shows the viewer the only horrifying way that Dolarhyde can reach a sexual climax took less than a minute and would have taken hours to explain---Dolarhyde's magnificently tattooed back making him appear a sinuous monster of prey.<p>Special congratulations to Philip Seymour Hoffman who makes the screen sizzle with his portrayal of the smarmy tabloid reporter, Freddy Lounds.  He plays off Dolarhyde's revulsion and fury with frightening realism.  Emily Watson as Dolarhyde's blind, unwitting love interest is spot on in her portrayal of a blind person, but a little too worldly wise to be believable as a na?ve victim. <p>"The Red Dragon" is a well-made, beautifully produced film.  The pace is good and doesn't have a boring moment.  Don't wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>...and the Hannibal saga goes on. The third installment of this trilogy had a few surprises up its sleeve: notably, the incredible cast, secondly that it's a very worthy continuation of the other two (a lot of people were expecting it to fail dramatically).<br />This time around it's Lecter back to his coaching methods again as he directs an FBI agent (Edward Norton) to find the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; killer (Ralph Fiennes).<br />The new elements in this film compared to its predecessors are that it contains more fear, more intimidation, and less dosages of dark humor. All these work in a positive way: they are not overblown out of proportion, in fact the film is superbly balanced throughout.<br />And, speaking of balance, the biggest trick is balancing big time actors like Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and of course Hopkins himself. Indeed, it's not Hopkins that dominates the proceedings here (even though it's impossible to even think of ignoring his presence) but Fiennes portraying the psychoting serial killer that the &quot;doctor&quot; is helping to track down. Fiennes gives a memorable (and tone setting) performance in one of his very best roles of his career.<br />Fiennes's performance helps shift the focus point from Lecter in an overwhemling way. Aided by Norton's subtle but ultra-convincing acting the whole film becomes a classic not only for fans of the Hannibal trilogy but for fans of the genre in general. Keitel is great in his rather small role and it goes without saying that Hopkins maintains his reputation as one of the all-time classic cinematic psychos.<br />The script is very well-crafted and maintains the suspense and the &quot;edginess&quot; from beginning to end, but what really does the trick are the dark optics that accompany it particularly the sequences involving Fiennes and his horrifying deeds.<br />As it has been mentioned already &quot;Red Dragon&quot; can be viewed either as a sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; or a prequel to the previous two parts. But even if viewed as a sequel it's actually incredible when you think that it could've been a disaster especially because of the hype prevailing the other two films before it. It's far from that, it's simply a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>The problem with this film is that it's too short. The story starts at the wrong place, at exactly when Lecter is discovered and captured, purely by accident by Norton who is consulting him for advice on the murders.<br />Is it just me or are we unaware exactly WHAT Lecter did? Unless you read the books or look at the commentary then you don't know. It would've been nice if a half an hour or forty five minutes was given to Lecter's crimes and victims so that we would get a feelign of how evil he's supposedly.<br />Without that the other killers in this and subsequent films seem gruesomer than the master. It would be nice to see WHY these killers idolize him so much.<br />Ralph Finnes is good here but has very little to work with as we know he's going to be caught, there's no build-up to what makes one nut love another to the point of them working together to kill their rivals enemies and their families.<br />Ed Norton is as always sensational in a wearied performance as a man who's seen too much but still cares. Unfortunately the fact that we don't know what he's seen is the problem.<br />Emily Watson, one of my favorite actresses is ok as the blind woman who is forward with Finnes, thinking he's simply repressed and shy and not the whackjob he turns into. I have a theory about the Hannibal series which I detail in the other reviewes, making this movie important as part of teh triology watched as a whole but not as a stand alone film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>Prequels are usually like sequels in that they should never have been made.  Just see Star Wars for a prominent example.  Silence of the Lambs was a great movie and Anthony Hopkins was great as Hannibal Lecter.  Red Dragon occurs before that story and we see a little of the crimes Hannibal committed as well as his capture, but little else.  Instead we are shown a ho-hum story about another serial killer played by Ralph Feinnes.  The story is not as suspensful and the killer is not as interesting as in Silence.  Also, while I like Ed Norton, he was a poor choice to play the FBI investigator-very bland and dull.  It was also tough to accept that this was before Silence since Anthony Hopkins looked older, fatter, and balder than in that movie.  With such a strong cast I had high hopes for this, but it was ultimately disappointing.  HD DVD picture quality was ok, but dark movies like this rarely look much better than the DVD-perhaps a bit sharper on my 106" screen.  Maybe worth renting if you like this genre, but definitely not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Red Dragon, the third in the series of flicks featuring Dr. Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter is merely okay as a psychological thriller.  I found the character development, particularly that of Francis &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; Dolarhyde to be superficial, with Dr. Lecter's character the notable exception.<p>The story was an intriguing one but for the most part the characters seemed to be made of cardboard.  Ed Norton, one of the finest young contemporary actors, as the FBI profiler was meek and whiny.  Ralph Fiennes, a brilliant classical actor seemed uninspired as the driven and diabolical killer.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant, as usual, as the cultured, refined yet horrific Dr. Lecter.  Harvey Keitel was nothing special but Anthony Heald as the self serving and loathsome Dr. Chilton was terrific.<p>With a wonderful cast to work with director Brett Ratner came up short in his shallow adaptation of Thomas Harris' chilling novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Now I know that Dino DeLaurntiis passed on recently this isn't ment to be mean at all but back in 1986 Manhunter flopped at the box office for whatever reason De Laurntiis said "I do not like Manhunter it is not Red Dragon." So he had no involvment with Silence Of The Lambs but when that movie was a hit he saw money so he produced the sequel which I will admit it was a decent sequel but honestly it would've been like when Hallloween III flopped when John  Carpenter & Deborah Hill stopped producing cause  everybody wanted Michael if you remember.  Then  when H4 was a sucess Carpenter & Hill decided to come back & produce the Halloween movies.<br /> A year & a half later Red Dragon was released many aren't aware that this is a remake of Manhunter based off the novel by Thomas Harris. I say watch Manhunter 1st if you haven't saw either movie. It has a huge cast a great cast great job but that's really it. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Edward Nortan plays Will Graham Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dollarhyde Harvey Kitel as Jack Crawford Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds. Basically you start off "Will Graham is looking for a killer "Graham" thinks he's figured out he's dealing with a cannibal. So it can't be good "Graham" finds a book how to cook people while at his friends house Dr Hannibal Lecter. I'm thinking why wasn't this cut it is so predictable cause William Peterson talked about it in Manhunter. Both "Graham & Hannibal hurt each other we go to a few years later & FBI director "Jack Crawford" asks for "Graham's" help. so he goes looking for a killer named "The Tooth Fairy" It really does feel like most of the lines are reused from Manhunter like when Ed Nortan says a line the William Peterson delivered much better the way Norton does it & his facial expressions are too laughable. The scene where "Graham" talks to Hannibal is line for line just like Manhunter. While William Peterson was intemidated by Lecter in Manhunter cause of there history he stood his ground even Jodie Foster stood her ground Ed Norton looked like a nervous wreck like he was going to hide in corner. Were introduced to "Freddy Lounds" only it's not as cool as Manhunter. & "Francis Dollarhyde" I'm sorry compared to Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde Ralph Finnes Dollarhyde is wuss. Noonan was more interesting they mentioned his messed up life but they didn't totally dwell on it. A lot of his actions througout the movie he's begging to be caught. Finnes "Dollarhdye" is just way too cliched hearing voices & all. Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde would have no problem kicking Finnes "Dollarhye's" a  z  z.<br />I mean there is a scene where he is at this newstand the guy tells him to come back later he purchases a paper anyway looks at the guy with a threating look. Lecter giving out the Graham's address is still there "Dollarhyde" takes "Lounds" has him in that wheel chair sets him on fire & goes down the same street where that newstand was at gee that guy at the newstand could put 2 & 2 together. The Brooklyn Musem scene was a giant WTF?! The finish is different cause "Dollarhyde" makes it look like he kills himself it turns out that it is the guy that he killed in Reba's yard. Basically the movie thinks it's smart & it is pretty predictable cause a lot of the lines & scnes are used from Manhunter. Basically "Dollarhyde" shows up at The "Graham house & we get a lame duck finish.  The Ending Dr Chilton tells Hannibal that there is a lady from The FBI & Lecter says "what's her name? LOL brillant not! I know it's closer to the book then it's a s hi t  t  y  book then. Ted Tally why didn't you just make a Hannibal sequel get Jodie Foster back or even William Peterson & end it on a good note. Brett Ratner wasn't a good choice to helm a Hannibal movie. I like Rush Hour 1&2 even X3 is better. Edward Norton is a good actor but he doesn't cut it for Will Graham. It's worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. Harvey Kitel was ok but he's done better like Bad Luitenant. Ralph Fiennes is I'm not farmilar with but he didn't cut it for me. Phillip Semour Hoffman is just there. It's wathcable it's just not up to par with Manhunter. I mean if you like this movie that's fine but it's my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Red Dragon is actually a remake of the 80's Michael Mann version of this story.  So I had the characters already set as to my expectations, and Manhunter did a beautiful job with the story to begin with.  I'm sure that is what hurt this film for me.  It certainly wasn't the casting or the story.  This version was a little more 'splashy' than the gritty nature of Manhunter, and the grit I think helped the original movie more than this did.<p>Fiennes was a surprising Dollarhyde.  He is truly one of the most gifted screen actors we have.  Hopkins is too identified with Lector to not like him, even though his part is scant.  Even Norton, who can't seem to fail at a part, gives Will Graham a vulnerability much different than William Peterson's original.<p>I think the casting gives you most of an expecation for a 'bigger' film, which this story can't be.  I just felt that the casting and manner the story was told in Manhunter 'fit' better than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>It was a badly needed update, but I just hate knowing the end.

Plus, it features Sir Anthony doing his thing as Hannibal.<p>Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I've seen "Red Dragon" years ago but couldn't recollect it from my thoughts. Last night it reappear to me that it's a great film. This of course is a remake of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00026L7OA">Manhunter (Full Screen Edition)</a>," the first in the series of films centering on FBI profilers, serial killers, and the infamous Hannibal Lecter, who I suppose is the modern day equivalent of "Jack the Ripper." I haven't read the novel by Thomas Harris so I can't say which is the more authentic, but they're both very good films.<br /><br />As in the original, "Red Dragon" centers around the character of Will Graham, a retired FBI profiler who is brought back to help find a serial killer (Ralph Fiennes), known as "The Tooth Fairy," preying on women with families. He kills once a month in sync with the lunar cycle, so Graham has time to investigate the two crime scenes and look for evidence that would indicate who the next target is. The beginning of the scene will capture your interest right away, because it sets up the relationship of Hopkins and Norton; it also gives Hopkins, without whom this film wouldn't exist, more screen-time.<br /><br />Also as in the original, Hannibal Lecter is a supporting figure, not the main attraction, though Anthony Hopkins certainly chews up the scenery in a performance he's gotten quite good at. The relationship between Lecter and Graham never intrigued me as much and I'm not convinced that Norton was the best choice for the part of Graham. Somehow, Norton came across to me as too innocent and youthful for the kind of role he was playing. Towards the end he turns out to be a good performance. The movie doesn't play up his character as much as "Manhunter" did for William L. Petersen, but that's just a style difference in the directors. Weaknesses, though, were compensated for by a marvelous performance from Ralph Fiennes as the killer as Dolarhyde, and he's downright creepy. Michael Mann cast one of his favorites, Tom Noonan, as Dolarhyde in the original, and he played the part brilliantly. Though here, the killer is developed more and you see why he became such a twisted figure. Think Norman Bates on steroids. And that tattoo is down right gorgeous. Emily Watson did a good job as Reba and there's really not much I can say about her.<br /><br />When Michael Mann made "Manhunter" in 1986, he was at the peak of his success with "Miami Vice" and the movie reflected that genre, with hip characters and rock & roll music on the soundtrack. Who could forget the ending when Will Graham crashes through the window while "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" is blasting away. Here, Brett Ratner (the "Rush Hour" films) directs "Red Dragon" as a more traditional suspense film without the flashiness of Mann's creation. Different creations of the same story, but both very good in their own way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Don't expect a film better than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; because &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is far from that.  This is the prequel to that film and a replacement for the 1986 film &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<p>&quot;Red Dragon&quot; once again stars Anthony Hopkins as the excellent Hannibal Lector, whom Edward Norton &quot;consults&quot; with to find out more about the Tooth Fairy serial killer.  The Tooth Fairy is played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The only problem is, it is a very long time into the film where he does anything frightening.  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; had multiple suspense moments, whereas Red Dragon really lacks in this department.<p>Overall, I was quite disappointed with &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.  I found Edward Norton very dull, and too long before anything interesting happened.<p>For die-hard fans of the series only.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...this is a moderately entertaining upgrade of the Michael Mann cinema Manhunter with THE Hannibal Lector, Anthony Hopkins, pre-queling his role. Fiennes as Dolohyde does an adequate job. Edward Norton should have never done that Death to Smoochy movie and this within a three year span...I couldn't get him out of that purple rhino suit. In the Manhunter movie the detective was made to be a bit on the psychic side. You don't get this here. Nevertheless, it is a good movie, but not of the excellence exhibited in SOTL or, in hindsight now, Hannibal. Hannibal now is up a coupla notches because of this in my opinion...A Note:  Why are all serial killers obsessed with classical literature or art? Or a parent or grandparent beat the crap out of him? I ask only rhetorically. There needs to be a new serial killer paradigm...and quickly. Also, Frankie Faison should have never been put in all three movies because his weight fluctated...A LOT..he was relatively more thin in SOTL...(that's just one of those odd things I notice.)</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>The producers went to great efforts to make a slick porduction, with attention to the detail.

Almost identical in content to 1986's MANHUNTER save the very beginning and Hollywood cookie cutter ending, RED DRAGON is merely there.  Manhunter was the better film and BRIAN COX deserves more credit for basically inventing the LECTOR character for film by paving the way for HOPKINS tour de force in LAMBS. Although both performances excellent, it was nice to see two different takes on the same psycho. The canibal has now pretty much been turned into a mockery of himself and the 'franchise' needs to take the vacation DR. CHILTON did.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Red Dragon" is a movie I liked better the second time I saw it. The first time I thought it was made merely to capitalize on our fascination with brilliant arch villain, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. There is some validity to this opinion since the book by Thomas Harris, the first of three in which Lecter is featured, was filmed in 1986 under the title of `Manhunter". [The first version, by the way, is a very good movie.] The second viewing, however, convinced me that, for whatever reason it was made, "Red Dragon' stands on its own as a first-rate thriller. <p>The movie opens with a chilling encounter between FBI agent Will Graham [Edward Norton] and Lecter [Anthony Hopkins]. Just as Graham realizes that Lecter is the serial killer he has been looking for, Lecter attacks and nearly kills him. Graham survives, and Lecter is captured and incarcerated for life in a mental institution. Traumatized by the ordeal, Graham retires to Florida with his wife and young son. A few years later his old boss [Harvey Keitel] lures him back to help find another killer dubbed The Tooth Fairy. Finding himself in a dead end with the case, Graham reluctantly seeks the assistance of his old nemesis, Dr. Lecter, whose help turns out to be Graham's worst nightmare come to life. <p>Part of the success of "Red Dragon" is due to its `dream' cast. Besides Norton and Hopkins, it has Ralph Fiennes as the killer in question and Emily Watson as a blind woman the Tooth Fairy falls for. Other assets include the astute screenplay by Ted Tally, who penned the one for "Silence of the Lambs', and the chilling musical score by Danny Elfman. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the assured direction by Brett Ratner, heretofore known as the director of fun but forgettable comedies such as "Rush Hour" and "Family Man".  <p>If you are expecting this movie to top the classic "Silence of the Lambs", you may be disappointed. If you view it on its own terms, you may see it as very good - not extraordinary, perhaps, but way above ordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Just because there were three &quot;Lecter&quot; books written doesn't mean they should have made them all into films.  Manhunter and Silence were enough.  Overdosing on Hannibal Lecter makes him less and less scary(Hellraiser suffered the same fate in the sequels by desensitizing us to Pinhead).  My main gripe withh this is the same as most reviewers that gave this a negative review: Edward Norton.  As much as I admire Edward Norton, he was just a bad choice.  That character called for someone totally different.  I think I speak for most people when I say that when reading the book, you don't picture anyone remotely like Edward Norton as Graham.  Ralph Fiennes was okay I guess.  Emily Watson was decent with her extremely cutesy , wild googily eyed look.  Keitel was there just coz they needed an older stern looking guy for Crawford(I guess Scott Glen wasn't available this time).  People knock Keitel in this, but I think he did what he could with the not-so-demanding role of Jack Crawford.  Hoffman was completely wrong for Lounds.  This movie wasn't terrible or anything(that title goes to Hannibal), but it has a very strong &quot;been there, done that&quot; vibe going on all through it.  I think it was very late in the game to make this film, coz it offers nothing that we didn't already see in Silence Of The Lambs or Manhunter(if you saw that one!).</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>For the past several years we have been treated to the bizarre tales of Hannibal Lector.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (Part 2 of the Trilogy by Thomas Harris) surprised the public with a formidable tale well acted by Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster.  That film was excellent.  The second installment HANNIBAL (Part 3 of the Trilogy) was a sequel to SILENCE and while it veered a bit to the excesses of Hollywood it was still a good film with Julianne Moore stepping in very well for the Jody Foster role of Clarice.  Now RED DRAGON (Part 1 of the Trilogy) completes the appetite for the tale of horror of the life and misdeeds of Hannibal Lector.  In many ways this is the strongest of the three films, due in part to the fine performances by Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, as well as Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Some liberties were taken with the original story, but this incorporation of what we already have learned about Hannibal only adds to the spectrum.  A well cast, edge of the seat thriller, RED DRAGON is  a must if you've followed the other parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The key thing about watching &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is to realize that this is not a Hannibal Lecter story.  The character was a compelling but relatively minor figure in both the Thomas Harris novel and &quot;Manhunter,&quot; the original cinematic adaptation by Michael Mann.  Obviously screenwriter Ted Tally and director Brett Ratner have enhanced the role for this 2002 film, but Anthony Hopkins's part is not a central part of the story.  Once you understand that you will discover that &quot;Red Dragon&quot; exceeds your expectations.  But if you cannot get around this idea then you are probably going to be bitterly disappointed with this film.<p>Clearly a major strength of this film is the stellar caste, which in addition to Hopkins has Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anthony Heald, and Mary Beth Hurt (add to the list Ellen Burstyn as the voice of Grandma Dolarhyde).  But what makes this film work is its intelligence, for which Harris and Tally get the credit.  Will Graham is an intelligent man, an F.B.I. profiler who constantly shows throughout this story that he has a gift for saying the right thing, whether he is talking to Lecter, a room full of police officers, the head of a company, or the Red Dragon himself.  Yes, he has been scarred psychologically as well as physically by his capture of Lecter, but it is not an incapacitating condition as was the case with Clarice Starling.  In "Silence of the Lambs" the climax of the film involved a cinematic commonplace that has always enraged me, when a law enforcement officer has a gun drawn and aimed at a suspect who then manages to get away.  I thought the climax of "The Red Dragon" involved an exhilarating series of intelligent, brilliant moves by the good guys.  <p>The other aspect of this story that makes it compelling is that the villain is a monster with a soul.  The idea of a serial killer falling in love, struggling to thwart the demonic voices and try to stop his descent into hell is brilliant.  The circle becomes complete when you notice that all of the main characters in this film are complex; granted, not as complex as the Red Dragon, but enough that the actors reading this script would be drawn to the parts.  But the ability of the villain to be surprising is critical because usually in the final analysis it is the villain that makes the film.  Again, this underscores the fact that Lecter is not the villain of the piece.  But he was in "Hannibal," and look how well that film was received.  Here we are back to the pivotal idea that even when this character is bound and gagged in a cell he is still capable of killing you.  <p>Ultimately Hannibal Lecter remains the problematic element in the film; more often that not his scenes are suggestive if not outright reminiscent of scenes from "Silence of the Lambs."  One of the obvious questions that springs to mind is whether Hopkins's Lecter would have made as big of an impact if "Red Dragon" had indeed been the first of the reconstituted trilogy.  Ultimately the answer has to be "no," but because this is clearly a prequel made fully cognizant of the film that comes after it.  To appreciate how difficult this is to pull off look at other recent prequels such as "Gods and Generals" and either of the two Star Wars films.  The argument here is not that "The Red Dragon" is a better film than "The Silence of the Lambs," but that it is a worthy successor to that classic film, even if it takes place first.  <p>Final Note:  The commentary track with Ratner and Tally is well worth a second viewing of the film, more so in terms of tidbits about the production than analytical insights into the adaptation.  The rest of the DVD extras are at least average, but the commentary is the big attraction here.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Don't ever try to compare "Red Dragon" with "The Silence of the Lambs."  The "prequel" of the story of Hannibal Lector, which is once made by director Michael "Heat" Mann as "Manhunter" before, is just an OK thriller.  You get scared, certainly, but not by the undercurrent phychological power of "Lambs," but by sudden big noise and loud, pounding music by Danny Elfman.<p>The story is virtually same as that of "Manhunter" except that you see Dr. Lector as a civilian in Boltimore, listening to classic music among other law-abiding people (a rare scene, indeed), and that the relation between Dolarhyde and Reba has been explored more.  A retired FBI agent Will Graham agrees to go back in work to investigate the two related bloody murders of families, and to have an aid he meets again Master of Evil, Hannibal Lector, now in maximum-security custody in institution, as you saw in "Lams."  But with Lector's cunning trick Graham and his family are exposed to the danger of the still unknown serial killer, who is sure to commit another murder within days.<p>The speed is fast enough to forget the plot holes, and the thrills are provided a lot, thanks to Ted Tally's good script.  The new cast is also effective with Edward Norton as Graham and of course Anthony Hopkins as Lector.  Norton, unlike his predecessor William Pertersen in "Manhunter", doesn't yell at TV set to "think like the killer," which is a good thing.  Philip Seymore Hoffman is also good as a gossip-hungry journalist while my favorite, impressive Harvey Keitel replaces Dennis Farrina role as an FBI partner.<p>But I found two defects in "Red Dragon"; one of them is that there is no sizzling interaction between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins across the cell wall.  The same set was recreated for this film, I heard, but there is no tension during their dialogues (which I found almost the same as those in "Manhunter.")  It is curious because they must have decided to remake this one to capitalize on the popularity of Hopkins' Lector, and as if to show that to us, they give more chances for Graham to meet Lector (in "Manhunter" they meet only once face to face).  The reason for the lower tension might be attributed to Hopkins's less interest, but my feeling is that it should be owing to director's skill.<p>The other flaw is less convincing relation between the characters by Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes.  It is certain that their roles are given more time, but I frankly say that I find that part boring.  I simply couldn't help thinking that they overact a bit, especially Fiennes with body tattoos and exaggerated gestures, which are bordering on caricature.  As for this sub-plot, Tom Noonan and Joan Allen did a better job.<p>"Red Dragon" succeeds as fast-paced thriller, but without depth.  Brett Ratner is famous for two "Rush Hour" films, which are certainly hits, but no definite Jackie Chan film.  If you need a definite Lector, you must watch "Lambs" again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>One of the screens most delectable villains is back and better than ever, to help bring yet another cinematic miscreant of social de-evolution to justice, in "Red Dragon," a taut suspense/thriller directed by Brett Ratner, featuring an all star cast that includes Anthony Hopkins once again reprising his role of Dr. "Hannibal the Cannibal" Lecter.  Those who have seen "Silence of the Lambs" and/or "Hannibal" will know what to expect here (and will not be disappointed); the uninitiated, however, should be forewarned, as this film will take you into the darkest recesses of the human psyche, and afterwards will not allow you to go gently into that dark night that waits beyond the secure confines of the theater or the safety (?) of your own front door.  Indeed, this is one that will be with you for some time, so be prepared.<p>In the Deep South, two entire families have been ritualistically slaughtered, and though they are located hundreds of miles from one another, there are similarities that lead the F.B.I. to believe they are connected.  The killings occurred nearly a month apart, each during the full moon, and though agents have sifted through the crime scenes with a fine-toothed comb, they've come up empty.  They are looking, but not "seeing" anything.  And they're running out of time; it's three weeks until the next full moon, when they believe the killer will strike again.<p>This leads Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), the agent heading up the investigation, to call in former agent Will Graham (Edward Norton), the profiling specialist who captured Lecter, to take a look at the crimes and offer any suggestions he may have.  But Graham quickly realizes that to solve a case of this magnitude, and quickly, it will necessitate getting into the killer's mind; and as time is of the essence, it leads him to seek the assistance of his old nemesis, Hannibal Lecter.  And so, with no time to spare, the games begin.<p>And into the mind of the killer is exactly where director Ratner takes you, and he does it on a number of levels that range from the subtle and implied, to the undiscriminating.  Working from a tightly written, intelligent screenplay by Ted Tally (from the novel by Thomas Harris), Ratner finesses the horror at the heart of the story to the surface, initially offering only glimpses, visually, of the heinous crimes.  Instead, he plants and builds a picture of what happened in your imagination, routing the information through Graham's investigation, so that you know, at first, only what he knows; then, with Lecter's assistance, along with Graham you begin to get an idea of the man behind the madness as his portrait emerges.  <p>But Ratner soon transcends the usual parameters of the genre, as he makes you privy to the madman himself, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes), whom the F.B.I. has dubbed the "Tooth Fairy," in reference to one of the more obvious peccadilloes displayed during the manifestations of his insanity.  It is here that Ratner objectively explores the possible cause and effect of Dolarhyde's demented mind by proffering glimpses into his past, but without suggesting it as an excuse for his actions in any way.  Ratner, in fact, must be acknowledged for his careful and effective handling of this material, which had to be a challenge for the director who previously gave us the lighter "Rush Hour" and "Rush Hour 2," as well as the insightful "The Family Man."  In this film Ratner covers all the bases, and he covers them quite well, with an imaginative presentation that incorporates a concise understanding of human nature and the human condition.<p>Ratner, of course, had a cast that would be any director's dream with which to bring his story to life, beginning with Hopkins, who eases back into Lecter's skin seemingly without effort, as if he'd never left (Hmmmm.  Will anyone who knows the REAL Anthony Hopkins please step forward, to perhaps shed some light on this?).  And in visiting with Dr. Lecter again, it's easy to understand why Hopkins was awarded the Oscar for his initial portrayal of Hannibal in "The Silence of the Lambs."  He conveys a natural eeriness in his countenance, and in the coldness of his eyes there is more menace than any deranged mask-wearing villain with a chainsaw could ever hope for.<p>Edward Norton, meanwhile, provides the perfect counterpoint to the abhorrent Lecter/Dolarhyde personas, with a subtle and understated performance that is so inherently honest and convincing that the credibility of the entire film is established by his character alone.  There is a precision in the unfettered nuance of his portrayal that few actors have the talent or ability to achieve.  His strength is in his reserve, and Norton's intuitive presentation of Graham lends the character a ring of absolute truth.  Ironically, the meticulousness of Norton's performance will probably deny him the acclaim he so richly deserves for it; in a kind of catch-22, he is SO good, and his portrayal is structured so economically and efficiently, that it will be perceived as too easy and natural.  Yet it is precisely when the actor does not appear to be "acting" that he is decidedly at his best.  And Norton certainly is here.  <p>With the exception of his Amon Goeth in "Schindler's List," the role of Dolarhyde is something of a departure for Fiennes, who usually gravitates toward more romantic, or at least amiable (if often moody or complex) characters, and he takes on his character with relish.  He gives a strong, solid performance through which he manages to evoke empathy without any accompanying undue or misplaced sympathy.  He successfully conveys the definitive disfigurement of the character-- that which lies within, beneath Dolarhyde's obvious physical deformity-- and therein lies the true strength of his portrayal.  <p>Also turning in performances of note are Emily Watson, as the vulnerable Reba; Mary-Louise Parker (Molly); and Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy), all of whom add to the considerable impact and overall success of "Red Dragon."</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>There are a few different ways you can look at Red Dragon.  You can look at it as a prequel to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, or you can look at it as a remake of Manhunter.  Either way though, the potential for disaster was huge going into making Red Dragon after the dreadful Hannibal was released in 2001, but all's well that ends well here.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lecter, though he is in more of a supporting role here.  Ed Norton stars as Will Graham, an FBI profiler brought back to use his unique talents to track down a brutal serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (a tattooed and frequently naked Ralph Fiennes).  Being a fan of Manhunter, I was leary when hearing that it would be re-made as Red Dragon (but not surprised considering all the money Hannibal banked), and was even more leary when I had heard that Brett Ratner was directing, but now I'm pretty much eating my words here because Red Dragon turned out to be much much better than I had expected.  The only real flaw with Red Dragon are the scenes between Hopkins and Norton.  In Silence of the Lambs, the interplay between Hopkins and Jodie Foster was what made that film as good as it was, but it doesn't work between Hopkins and Norton for one simple reason: Hannibal isn't scary anymore.  In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was a truly scary character that could make your skin crawl just by hearing him talk, but after Hannibal was released, he's just become a Hollywood circus side-show attraction that makes creepy sounding pronounciations.  But besides all that, Red Dragon is an above average thriller that delivers the goods, and Ralph Fiennes' performance as the Tooth Fairy is reason enough to see the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>I did not yet view the 1986 'Manhunter' that already brought Thomas Harris' novel 'Red Dragon' to the screen, but I cannot imagine anyone portraying Frances Dolarhyde, the voice-hearing psychopathic killer, any better than Ralph Fiennes.  Even if you don't like or are tired of Hannibal Lecter after the campy focus on him in the last film installment, (Hannibal) Ralph Fiennes' performance of a quiet man filled with inner rage stemming from a horrible childhood simmers with surpressed sexuality and yearning and is not to be missed.  "Dee" as he is nicknamed by co-workers is a churning river of past angst that demands renumeration, like a tide that cannot retreat, he encroaches on his unsuspecting victims, passing through with a tempest's increasing strength. The only calm allowed to this storm seems to be in the person of a blind woman played by Emily Watson. As she cannot see his slight facial deformity, he accepts her more readily, allowing his need for contact to creep through while his killer persona is on short hiatus.  With well-honed acting skill Fiennes waxes pathetically spellbound by her attention---one gets the sense that during this sequence the eye of his storm is passing; her questions regarding his life titillate and exhilarate what little humanity is left him.  Particularly touching is a moment where "Dee" takes Reba to "see" a tranquilized tiger, to further buttress one of her last sights before illness stole her sight. Fiennes is magnificient, his shyness poignant, his madness heart-wrenching.<br />Other remarkable performances include Emily Watson as Reba, Philip Seymour Hoffman as the scruffily annoying journalist and of course, Anthony Hopkins as the chillingly trumped Dr Lector--here as this is a prequel, sporting as dark Eurotrash slick-backed queue.  Edward Norton does an adequate job as the FBI agent Will Graham. Attacked by Lector in an unforgettable scene before the opening credits, Norton achieves an understandable wariness that sometimes borders on downright reluctance to ever see Lector again,let alone confer with him.  Rather than have his motivation to capture the Fiennes character be the threat to his wife and son and its obvious connection to the new killer's focus on family, I would have liked to have seen more of his personal terror--maybe in fugue states flashing key moments of Lector's attack on him. I would have also liked to have explored that portion of Graham's character that Lector intimates from Graham's success in flushing Lector out as being composed of part pride, part mental superiority and part affinity with the criminal mind.<br />Nevertheless, the film is great---intense----psychologically satisfying and disturbing enough to warrant after movie discussion. Not only does it keeps one's attention from start to finish, but despite some of the disgustingly gory sights, (not for children!!) compels one to keep both eyes on the screen at all times.  Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Red Dragon is my second favorite film from the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, the first being the silence of the lambs. This movie once again portrays Thomas Harris's novel which I just started reading. This is the first of the trilogy even though it was released last. This is when Hannibal Lecter is captured for the first time by William Graham played by Edward Norton. Anthony Hopkins is at his best while Harvey Keitel plays the best Jack Crawford yet. But of course, once in prison, Will Graham must interview Lecter, trying to find information on a new killer.<br /><br />Graham was on the verge of retiring when he decided to come back to the force. What's good about this movie is that it isn't disturbing like the other two, so a larger range of people could problably watch it.<br /><br />What distinguishes this one from the others is that you see the killer's battle against himself. Ralph Fiennes plays the killer with lots of force, and he tries to conquor himself and his anger. He basically does everything a painting tells him to do, but once he starts seeing a blind lady for whom he falls for, he tries to stop doing what he does.<br /><br />The movie has MANY amazing scenes and sequences and the conclusion makes your heart beat as much as the silence of the lambs did. It's not as good as the remarquable silence of the lambs, but saying that it's almost as good as it, that's pretty remarquable itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>It is odd that the third best of the 'Lector' novels written by Thomas Harris should turn out to be every bit as good as the others when taken to film.  Much is due to Brett Ratner's ability to stay focused on creating an unselfconscious story line that sticks to the material and the atmospherics around it.  Another large amount is due to Anthony Hopkins ability to recreate a character who exudes evil and fear.  But the entire cast of this film manage to play their parts well.<br /><br />This is the prequel (or near prequel) to the events in Silence of the Lambs.  Edward Norton plays Will Graham, the FBI agent who brought Lector to justice in the first case.  He has 'escaped' from seeking serial killers and is now making an anonymous life repairing boats.  But his retirement is short-lived as Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) seeks Will out for help on a troubling case where entire families are being killed in a grim ritual.  As we quickly find out, one of the things that's wanted is for Will to work with Lector again, this time with the mad psychiatrist behind thick plate glass and bars.<br /><br />What we find out early in the film is that the new killer is somehow linked to the old.  Lector's uncanny ability to reach out and manipulate minds is still strong, and the real story is Will Graham's struggle to evade Lector's plans while trying to identify the killer with Lecter's help.  The detective and his family are the goats in a dark hunting game.<br /><br />Hopkins plays Lecter to perfection.  Not the slick Lecter of Silence, but as a man still developing his style.  For all his ego, Lecter's real problem is his inability to see Will Graham as anything but an alter-ego.  The agent, who survived catching Lecter only by accident has no such self-delusions.  His honest brilliance is a counterpoint to Lecter's deviousness.<br /><br />Another near perfect acting Job is done by Ralph Fienne, who plays Francis Dolahyde, the Red Dragon of the title.  This isn't a hysterical portrait.  Dolarhyde has his own brilliance despite his emotional ineptness, and Fienne brings this out perfectly, capturing Dolarhyde's fumbling love affair with Reba and his power as a controlled killer with surprising sympathy.<br /><br />The extras consist of commentaries, interviews and the usual 'making of' film.  I tend to look askance at the modern habit of expanding the credence of a film by piling on self-important tidbits, but these are well done, and enhance the viewing experience by surfacing some of the fine details that make this a successful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I have to be completely honest.  As interesting a character Hannibal Lector is, I really haven't enjoyed the Hannibal Lector movies that much.  This goes against the popular vein, but other than the acting and some interesting cinematographic effects, I wasn't impressed by SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; MANHUNTER (the original film based off of the novel Red Dragon) was a colorful piece of cinematic art quite creative in its use of lighting, sound, and color; and though I enjoyed HANNIBAL the most of Lector movies, it is very violent and unbelievable absurd.  Nevertheless, I was looking forward to watching RED DRAGON, the prequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and remake of Michael Mann's MANHUNTER. With Anthony Hopkins back as Dr. Hannibal Lector, the brilliant Edward Norton playing detective Will Graham, and the mysterious Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde (aka "The Tooth Fairy") I thought the movie would be the best of them all.  I should be used to movie disappointments by now.<br /><br />The movie begins with prologue illustrating how Will Graham was able to successfully capture Dr. Hannibal Lector. The movie then fast forwards in time three years. A new serial killer is loose killing entire families one an evening when there is a full moon. Graham's former boss at the FBI asks him to come out retirement to help track the madman down.  After some internal conflict, soul searching, and weighing the risks Graham agrees. The case proves more difficult than anyone thought and even with the assistance of Dr. Lector, no major leads are discovered.  But the killer, "The Tooth Fairy", like the legendary Frankenstein's monster, ends up falling in love with a blind girl.  She is oblivious to his flaws.  Touched by grace, the killer falls deeper and deeper into a confusing downward spiral of self-loathing and bittered anger.<br /><br />On the surface, the movie is interesting and entertaing enough. The prologue at the beginning of the movie is brilliant and makes the movie watching solely for that. However, the deeper elements I was expected from the film just weren't there. Edward Norton is a great actor, but he's much too young to play Will Graham and just wasn't able to capture the internal epic struggle that Graham feels throughout.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. However, Ralph Fiennes' talent wasn't used as the role of Francis Dolarhyde seemed to be cut down to a cardboard caricature more than a real life flesh and blood character. Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy Lounds), Emily Watson (Reba McClane), and Harvey Keitel (Jack Crawford) did wonderful jobs in their supporting roles, but it isn't enough to counter-balance Norton's miscasting and Fiennes' lack of a meaty role.<br /><br />Also missing in this film were any elements that would lend it some credibility as a crime drama/thriller. I didn't enjoy MANHUNTER very much, but Michael Mann at least played around with light, color, and sound to produce an ode of moving art. RED DRAGON has none of that.  There aren't any outstanding images and the movie's score and soundtrack are seriously lacking. Besides the prologue at the beginning, the pacing of the movie also seems slow, almost too slow for a thriller such as RED DRAGON.  In fact, for all intense purposes, RED DRAGON is basically the same type of movie that Hollywood churns out all the time, only with a talented (but misused) cast and a very interesting prologue.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, RED DRAGON is worth watching. Other than that, the film really isn't a must see, but is fun to watch on a weekend if you have nothing better to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>..."Red Dragon" was suspenseful and faithful to the story, while the filming was not as dark as the Michael Mann version.  Brett Ratner, a favorite from "The Family Man", succeeded brilliantly with the film.  It's great to have fans who have not read the books get the idea of how Lechter was captured in the first place, and Hopkins sparkles in the role -- you can see that his antagonism with Will Graham (Norton...a surprise for me; terrific as the agent!) is even stronger than with Clarice.  In adding to Lechter's role, the screenwriters and Ratner not only capitalized on the character's fame and Hopkins' brilliance, they gave us footage that was crucial to understanding the triangle between the three men.<p>Ralph Fiennes is disturbing as Dolarhyde, and the house in which he lives is even creepier than in the book. Emily Watson is delightful as the "foil" for his strangeness.  The tattoo was done masterfully.<p>One of the chief positives for me was the wonderful score by the greatest name in movie music, Danny Elfman.  Alternatively brooding and menacing, with soaring leaps of action, the music deserves its own awards.<p>Outstanding, all the way around!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Oh, where to start?<p>First off, I really like actor Edward Norton.  I think he is a brilliant actor.  With that out of the way, he is miscast in this movie.  There, I said it.  So is Harvey Keitel.  And Ralph Fiennes.  And even the superb Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<p>The book Red Dragon has already been made into a movie, and definitively so.  It was called "Manhunter", and it was even made by the SAME PRODUCER who made this one.<p>Ted Tally, screenwriter of "The Silence of the Lambs", is credited with the screenplay on "Red Dragon".  However, there are SO MANY lines in this film that are word-for-word reproductions of dialogue in "Manhunter".  Either he copied them word for word from that film, or the lines were directly from the book and they were used in "Manhunter" too.  Either way, Tally is taking sole credit for someone else's work.  <p>Yes, I am a big fan of "Manhunter", and I've seen it many, many times.  And I bet "Red Dragon" director Brett Ratner has too.  Ratner is a self-described movie nut, too, as well as director.  I would find it VERY difficult to believe that he hasn't seen "Manhunter" at least a few times in the past.  And so much of "Red Dragon" seems lifted directly from "Manhunter" that it goes beyond coincidence.<p>Well, he lifted a lot of stuff but not its style.  "Red Dragon" is to "Manhunter" what paint-by-numbers is to a Van Gogh.  <p>So many things in "Red Dragon" seem like blatant copies of things from "Manhunter", down to shot selection, scene structure, editing choices, etc.<p>Unfortunately, those of you who have seen "Red Dragon" but have never seen "Manhunter" can never see "Manhunter" with the same set of eyes that we "Manhunter" fans have.  So you may never know the excitement and thrills of that movie quite the same way.<p>But believe me when I say that "Red Dragon" copies so many elements of it but never reaches the level that "Manhunter" does.<p>Brian Cox played Dr. Lektor in "Manhunter" (don't worry about the spelling), and he was spot-on perfect.  It made Hopkins' subsequent version seem over-the-top and too theatrical.  William Petersen played former FBI agent Will Graham, and he was old enough and battle-scarred enough to play it perfectly.  Norton just can't pull it off with the same intensity or believability.<p>Sadly, in "Red Dragon", even Hopkins seems to be phoning it in.<p>For "Manhunter", director Michael Mann had a cast of largely unknown actors (at the time).  Casting higher-profile actors for "Red Dragon", while a smart business decision, was a poor artistic one.  <p>And in "Manhunter", we didn't need spooky atmospherics to set a mood.  Hopkins' Dr. Lecter in this movie and in "Lambs" is imprisoned in a dank, creepy basement.  But in "Manhunter", Cox's Lecter was in a pristine, all-white, sterile environment, and he STILL was creepier than Hopkins.  In "Red Dragon" we are shown Lecter's attack on Graham, and we are shown The Tooth Fairy's Dickens-ian childhood traumas.  It is all spelled out for us.  In "Manhunter", those elements are merely referred to fleetingly, but you can read the rest from the actors' eyes and performances.  <p>"Red Dragon" is a FAR INFERIOR version of the novel by Thomas Harris than Michael Mann's brilliant "Manhunter".  And it even borders on plagiarism in spots, IMHO.  It is more than obvious that this film was made only because Dino DeLaurentis, who owns the film rights to the characters, felt he could bleed a few more bucks out of the franchise.  And that's all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>"Red Dragon" has possibly the finest cast of any movie in the last decade: Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Mary-Louise Parker, and of course the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins, reprising his career-defining role as everybody's favorite psychopath, Hannibal Lecter. The cast acquits itself honorably, and the movie is very entertaining, yet it lacks either the pervasive foreboding of "The Silence of the Lambs" or the stylishness of "Manhunter," Michael Mann's original film version of Thomas Harris' novel of "Red Dragon." Brett Ratner is a good journeyman director; he paces the movie well, and gets a good share of thrills from the terrifying story. But he lacks the distinctive style of either Mann or Jonathan Demme. Compare how Ratner and Mann stage the ultimate fate of the sleazy tabloid reporter played by Stephen Lang in "Manhunter" and by Hoffman in "Red Dragon." The basic situation is horrific beyond belief, but Ratner's staging is pedestrian compared with Mann's, which rolls down the garage ramp into our nightmares. Among the "Red Dragon" cast, Fiennes and Watson make the most of their satisfyingly showy roles, but once again it is Hopkins, with his dead-fish stare and malevolent grin, who is the truly unforgettable and indispensable member of the cast.</p></br></body></html>

When Amsterdam was a small child, his father, 'Priest' Vallon, leader of the Dead Rabbits gang, was slain in a vicious street battle by the Native Americans' boss, Bill (the Butcher) Cutting.<br /><br />The parentless boy is sent by his father's killer to an orphanage some miles away. When finally of age, he returns to the Points to learn that Irish immigrants still clash for control of their run-down neighborhood with the Butcher's forces. Young Vallon has sworn to avenge his father's death, but first he becomes Bill's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. His later failed attempt on the Butcher's life leaves Amsterdam alive, scarred and temporarily humiliated. After recovering from his wounds however, Vallon, as leader of the revived Dead Rabbits, challenges Bill and his minions to a formal rowdy-dow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, widespread riots and the lynching of innocent blacks occur when necessities of the Civil War impose America's first conscription act on those too poor to pay $300 for a military service waiver. The Army is called in and chaos reigns, even as Bill's Natives and Amsterdam's Irish meet in a grand street war to determine the future of their horrid tenement neighborhood.<br /><br />With an attention to detail that few motion pictures have every approached, director Martin Scorsese's superb modern masterpiece is equally brilliant in every other respect.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.4) Gangs of New York (USA/Italy-2002) - Leonardo DiCaprio/Daniel Day-Lewis/Cameron Diaz/Jim Broadbent/John C. Reilly/Henry Thomas/Liam Neeson/Brendan Gleeson/David Hemmings (uncredited: Martin Scorsese)</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film should have been the one that delivered the Oscar gold to Martin Scorsese.  It has many of the elements in place.  Good ensemble acting(in one case, great), breathtaking art direction, costumes, and cinematography.  The one thing the film lacked was a cohesive script and ultimately that was the heart of this film.  The screenplay is credited to multiple contributors which usually is not a good sign.  Ostensibly the film concerns itself with the turf wars between the "natives" and the recent Irish emigres in New York in the mid-nineteenth century.  One of the Irish, Amsterdam Vallon, vows revenge against one of the natives, William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting for the murder of his father.  To do so he has to first gain the confidence of Bill and infiltrate his gang.  There is also a love triangle involving Amsterdam, Bill, and Jenny, a pickpocket.  Interspersed  throughout the film various historical figures pop up(Boss Tweed, Horace Greeley,P.T. Barnum) as well as allusions to historical events (Tammany Hall scandals, the Civil War draft riots).  The film probably should have focused more on the central conflict between Amsterdam and Bill and less so on these peripheral issues.  As Amsterdam and Jenny, Leonardo DiCaprio give adequate performances.  The revelation here is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  Lewis embodies the villainy and brutality of Bill completely.  One chilling scene in the film is one where Bill relates how he gouged out his own eye after losing to a superior opponent in a turf fight.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a great 19th century epic movie and one of my personal favorites, Gangs of New York, brings to the screen two main stories which are unfolding simultaneously: Gang warfare in NYC between nativists and immigrants with the Civil War taking place in the background.  In addition, the movie portrays superbly and in great detail, both the corrupt politics as well as the attitudes and mentality of New Yorkers during the Civil War, thus providing insight into a very important period of US History. There is one scene in particular in which newly arrived Irishmen are getting off the ship that brought them to &quot;paradise&quot; (America) only to be drafted within minutes into the Federal Army in order to be sent down south to fight against the Confederacy.  A great movie indeed which shatters several misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding northern attitudes towards the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation i.e. northerners were anti-slavery and yet very racist, something which is difficult for people today to comprehend, and the fact that most northerners did not want to keep the southerners part of a country that they did not want to be part of, (needless to say going to war was not even an option for the average northerner and they had to be forced to sign up).  Lincoln's decision to order the bombardment of the Northern &quot;jewel&quot; city of NY by the US Navy in order to put down the NYC Draft Riots also provides for historical truths which had been suppressed for long years in the name of &quot;patriotism&quot;...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good historical film on gang wars during the middle and late 1800's. It may not be totally historically accurate, but the feel and look of this time period is dead on. Leonardo and Cameron are okay, but nobody can compare to the brute force and flat out great acting ability of Daniel Day-Lewis. His portrayal of the ruthless Bill the Butcher should have won him the Oscar last year, not that human twig Adrien Brody who only had about twelve lines of dialogue in "The Pianist." DDL has always been good at totally changing his look and accent to fully become the character, much like Johnny Depp. DDL was in retirement from acting for over five years before he decided to do this film. If this indeed is his last on screen performance, he will be remembered for it forever. Not only because it was his personal best, but because it is one of the best overall performances in the history of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Before I start my review I want to note that I do not feel this movie is a 5 star film. Moreso a 4 star film. I am only giving it 5 stars because I want the avg. costumer rating to be higher. Now, on with my review.<p> Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" is a movie I'm sure many will argue about concerning whether or not it's one of his best. Well, lets for the moment say it's not one of his best. Then I feel, it is his most impressive and visually stunning movie. It's probably his most ambitious. "Gangs of New York" does have a grandioso feel to it. It's one of the rare times when a Hollywood movie wants to tell a story and actually be about something. That though is not unusual for Martin Scorsese. To many he is the greatest living filmmaker.<p> "Gangs of New York" starts off with a "war" sequence that is as harrowing as the opening moments in "Saving Private Ryan". It's not for those with a weak stomach. Make no mistake about it. This is a violent picture. Many might say it has too much gore. But, to these people, what exactly were you expecting? Here's a movie dealing with 19th Century New York. A time when people were at a civil war. Hate filled the air, and were you expect a nice good hearted fairy-tale? I'm sorry but you'll be disappointed.<p> In the opening scene Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads his troops of Irish Americans against "Bill the Butcher"'s (Daniel Day-Lewis) troop of "real" Americans. As the Butcher likes to say. Vallon has a son, Amsterdan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who witness this war. At the end of it, Priest Vallon dies. What's to become of Amsterdan a small boy, without a father? He is sent away, but, naturally can never forget the sight of seeing his father killed. He plans revenge and will wait as long as he has to. This is the set-up.<p> When Amsterdan does get older he will of course head back home to find "Bill the Butcher". Things have changed since he was a boy. It's a new world, and it seems like it's "Bill the Butcher"'s world. He seems to rule to five points of New York.<p> It's when "Gangs of New York" hits this part of the movie it reaches the tone that will be played throughout. "Gangs" is really a very impressive movie. There is such craft clearly seen. The movie was done with such passion and understanding by a man who truly loves the history of New York. If you can't appreciate this movie strickly on those reasons alone, than I doubt you have any real love of cinema. It's those things besides acting that make the movie what it is. The cinematography, the art direction, the costume designs, & the production designs. All of these things added together give the movie what it is going after.<p> Is "Gangs of New York" for everyone? Of course not. Nothing in life is 100%. But, I do feel people should make an effort to see it. Even if you didn't like the movie at the very least you can say you saw it and explain why you didn't like it. Most I think will enjoy the movie. And maybe as time passing on, people will have a kinder reaction to the movie.<p> The movie also stars Cameron Diaz, in what I felt was one of her best roles. She has really surprised me. I honestly felt the woman can't act. But than she does a movie like this or "Vanilla Sky" and shocks you. She plays Jenny Everdeane. John C. Reilly plays a small role "Happy Jack". And Jim Broadbent plays William "Boss" Tweed, yet again, another small role.<p> Bottom-line: One of the best films of 2002! A movie of craft and ambition. So, it might not be Scorsese's best, it is still one of his most impressive films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>The 168 minute GANGS OF NEW YORK is a huge epic combining fiction and fictional characters with a few historical ones (Boss Tweed, Horace Greely), real places and events (the 1863 Draft Riots) with tall tales, and legends all being driven by a simplistic story of revenge. It's  a flawed, depressing film, filled with brutality and bigotry.  It contains brilliant sequences and memorable acting and should be seen on the big screen.<p>The film has a lesson to share about progress --what it is, what it means, and how little progress has taken place in the last few hundred years.  The U.S. definition of progress has always been one fueled by money and greed that says the ends justify the means-even means that include murder, and racial cleansing.  Time and some whitewashing will cause unpleasant historic events to fade away.  GANGS OF NEW YORK pretends to be the warts and all history.  It's science fiction actually, or as Scorcese has said: "it's like a western only set on Mars." <p>Martin Scorcese last indulged himself in the works of Italian filmmakers, particularly the neo-realists to create one of the best documentaries on film you'll ever see, MY VOYAGE TO ITALY.  The influence of him revisiting the films that made him fall in love with film in the first place is evident all over GANGS OF NEW YORK.  He has borrowed from the Neo-Realists he loves, and also from David Lean, Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, Fellini, Goddard and others to create homages to the filmmakers he loves .<br /><br />The film has among the best production design work you're ever likely to see.  It seems no detail, no matter how small has been overlooked or short changed. Fingernails are dirty, teeth are not always white, several characters have greasy unkempt hair. The costumes, props, set dressings, the infamous jar of ears...great stuff.  Huge sets were built to allow for big wide shots that one rarely sees in period films. We see a coach spraying people to help fight lice and cholera, neighborhood fire companies brawl with each other letting an apartment house burn and then raid the building next door for goods before it burns down.  A theater production of Uncle Tom's Cabin is created, complete with a levitating Abe Lincoln character.  These are all-memorable and colorfully realized sequences showing us another world, another life we have never seen before.<br /><br />One of the most glaring flaws is how the period feel established right from the start of the film is temporarily derailed when a modern driving film score music is used in the first battle scene. Perhaps we're dealing with a concession, a battle that Scorcese lost with Harvey Weinstein-but I doubt it, it could be the work of Howard Shore or Robbie Robertson we are seeing.  <p>The best reason for seeing the film is to witness one of the most colorful, riveting and daring performance you're ever likely to witness. Daniel Day Lewis delivers the kind of performance people will talk about for decades. It's a balanced tight-rope without a net performance, but Daniel Day Lewis never falls or conjures up a safety rope of camp or self parody.  Daniel Day Lewis' exaggerated way of walking for example is about his character navigating along sometimes slippery and muddy streets with fancier shoes than he should be wearing and not a ham actor's affectation.  His energy allows us to enjoy being in the presence of malevolence and so makes the character believable as a powerful leader.  The trust that both Scorcese and Day-Lewis must have had for each other is remarkable-it's the kind that allowed DeNiro to create his Travis Bickle (Taxi-Driver), Jake LaMotta  (Raging Bull) and Rupert Pupkin (King of Comedy) for Scorcese two decades ago.  You can also be assured Scorcese is not softening or playing it too safe when you see this performance.<p>Leonard DeCaprio doesn't ruin the film by not being in the same league as the other actors.  The rest of the cast treat him as if he is their equal and so he fades into an every man kind of blandness.  His character should be intense and full of confidence and resourfulness.  Since he spent 16 years in a tough reformatory he should be hard and cunning, perhaps bitter and cold.  Instead DeCaprio seems na?ve, innocent and too frail and angelic to witness the cruelty and brutality he sees constantly.  One thing that drove me crazy is how DeCaprio's Amsterdam, often looks away from unpleasant things.  His father had told him to NEVER look away.  Yet, he is constantly looking away and Scorcese lets him without using it to make a point. It's hard to empathize with someone you want to slap. Johnny Depp would have been a better choice.<br /><br /> Cameron Diaz has taken on a role that could have been particularly thankless.  She doesn't let DeCaprio drag her down into blandness, but allows her energy and spark to reflect effectively off of him.  She is the only strong female character in the entire film.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting characters are colorful scalawags for the most part and played by interesting actors who have big voices and charisma to burn..  Jim Broadbent is positively Shakespearean in his portrayal of  Boss Tweed  a powerful political force (and based on a real historical character).  Liam Neeson isn't around for too long, but makes the lasting impression he needs to.  John C. Reilly and especially Brendon Gleeson are perfectly cast and know when less is more. Few actors seem to understand their charisma and use it as flawlessly as Gleeson does.  <p>--Christopher J. Jarmick co-wrote the critically acclaimed The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder.

The cinema and sets for the timeframe are amazing and Daniel Day-Lewis is perfect in his role as the Bill the Butcher.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon who is a son of a well respected gang leader.  He sees Bill the Butcher kill his father.  Amsterdam, now fully grown, wants to get revenge against the Butcher for his father's death. The movie shows how Amsterdam gradually works his way into Bill the Butcher's group and eventually earns his trust and respect.  Amsterdam also meets and has to deal with the beautiful Jenny Everdean (Cameron Diaz) during his quest.  It seems like this is more of a chore than love most of the time, although Jenny is a beauty.<br /><br />The cinematography and historical sets of New York were amazing.  The movie was good, but overall could have been smoother in connecting the scenes.  The chemistry between DiCaprio and Diaz was not there.  The Gangs of New York is a solid "good" - but could have been fantastic if the editing hadn't created a somewhat choppy story.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Long as it was, it ended too soon for me. Some call this its famous director's flop, but I disagree. This tale of revenge, corruption, and of immigrants vying for a place in the landscape of American society balances fantasy and history and with its authenticity regarding period attitudes on race, ethnicity and status it is among the more courageous motion pictures made in a long time. As far as storytelling for the sake of storytelling goes, Gangs of New York gives three hours of great characters, intricate mid-nineteenth-century scenery, and a plot that never drags. Violent, mesmerizing, gritty, it is among Scorsese's top films, and Daniel Day Lewis deserved an Oscar for making Bill the Butcher the best cinematic villain so far in this decade.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Bill the Butcher as an blood hungry, beyond-twisted, knife-throwing crime lord with a sense of entitlement and a perverse respect for his adversaries practically steals Martin Scorsese's film. He's one of the best villains ever put on film. The movie itself is an involving, violent epic. It's ambitious, important and a departure from Scorsese's usual takes on New York's mean streets. The central scene involving Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and a knife-throwing stage exhibition is the most tense one I saw this year, and the final scenes involving the Draft Riots, though historically inaccurate, are a startling and fitting conclusion. Because Scorsese is so good, this film will probably not go down as one of his best, yet, if anyone else had made this film, it'd be hailed as a complete masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This film shows the violence which was prevalent in New York in the mid-1800's.  &quot;Native&quot; Americans are pitted against the immigrant Irish and men being drafted into the Union army rebel against joining a war that they care little about.  There is plenty of fighting and plenty of blood.  The conflicts are personified by Leonardo DiCaprio who swears vengeance on the man who killed his father when he was a young boy and left him to be brought up in an orphanage.  As a grown man he seemingly joins the man they call The Butcher, while plotting his death.  Cameron Diaz is the love interest who leaves The Butcher to join DiCaprio.  This is a dark film, both visually and content-wise and it will probably not be taken as seriously by viewers as the film-makers might wish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Gangs of New York' is definitely not a great movie, but it's not as bad as some have labeled it either.  It's certainly long enough, although with a film of this epic grandeur it probably could have used some more battle time.  The weakness in this film falls in the hands of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio who fails miserably to command his role.  He lets Daniel Day-Lewis run away with the entire show, and run he does.  As Bill `The Butcher' Cutting, Day-Lewis is at his most charismatic and impressive, chewing up every ounce of scenery at his disposal, and at an almost three-hour running rate he has quite a bit of time at hand.<br /><br />The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) as he strives to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting.  Leo never quite develops his character fully and leaves the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz does well but the film has little use for her and it shows except for one scene involving a knife throwing scene with Daniel where their chemistry is bright and she makes good for herself.<br /><br />This isn't, as I mentioned, a great movie but it's a decent one that has its share of good moments, most of which include the aforementioned Daniel Day-Lewis.  This film also sports a rich cast of supporting players like John C. Reilly (just love him) and Jim Broadbent and of course is rich and beautifully shot by none other than acclaimed director Martin Scorsese who proves once again why he's so well loved.  It's not a movie you'll hate, but you may end up scratching your head as to how it received 10 Oscar nominations, most shocking being that Best Picture nod that could have gone elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>In New York City in 1846, a child witnesses the violent death of his father in a gang battle between the Irish immigrant "Dead Rabbits" and the "Natives" who want the power in the city to stay with those who were born American. Ten years later, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo diCaprio) is a young man determined to avenge the death of his father years ago. He returns to lower Manhattan's "5 Points" neighborhood in search of Bill "The Butcher" Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis), the Native warlord who killed his father and still holds sway over the 5 Points. Amsterdam's intelligence and courage attract Bill's attention, and Bill invites him into the Natives' inner circle. There Amsterdam falls in love with a professional thief named Jenny (Cameron Diaz) who enjoys Bill's protection. As the years pass, the nation becomes embroiled in War, Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed seeks Bill Cutting's help to win support in the 5 points, and Amsterdam becomes a sort of surrogate son to Bill. Eventually, Amsterdam's identity is betrayed to Bill and he is forced into hiding. But Amsterdam is able to raise an army of Irishmen to challenge the Natives' power.  In 1863, the new "Dead Rabbits" and the "Natives" do battle again as Draft Riots sweep the city and New York erupts in violence and flames.<br /><br />"Gangs of New York " will probably not go down in history as one of Scorsese's masterpieces. But I really appreciate what director Martin Scorsese is trying to do in this film. "Gangs of New York"'s story of love and revenge is a little corny. But the substance of this film is found in the environment in which the characters live: The 5 Points, New York City, circa 1860. The film's theme is bold. And so you won't miss it, as it's stated in the movie's tagline:  "America Was Born in the Streets." This nation's framework was laid in documents, with signatures, and in civil -and uncivil- debate, by wigged gentlemen in wood-paneled chambers. But the nation itself was forged in cauldrons of hate, greed, chaos, and extreme violence. And it continues to be today, as our culture  makes this nation what it is, not our lawmakers. Daniel Day Lewis gives a great performance as cunning, sociopathic, seductive Bill Cutting. Lewis has never been slimier. Jim Broadbent, as Boss Tweed, has all of the best lines in the movie and is a lot of fun to watch. If you have lived in New York City, or perhaps any city, you may recognize the roots of the city's modern politics and public services in this film. And it may make you chuckle at how little some things have changed. "Gangs of New York" is a worthwhile and entertaining lesson in social history. Note that the film is very violent and not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is the leader of the Dead Rabbits gang. William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the leader of the Nativist gang.  Both gangs wage a bloody war against eachother, ending in the death of Priest Vallon.  Witnessing this tragedy is Vallon's son (Leonardo DiCaprio) who  is sent to a reformatory for delinquents.  Some years later, he returns as Amsterdam to seek revenge against Bill the Butcher, his father's killer.  The worst thing about this movie were the Irish accents of Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio.  They were bad enough to make your ears bleed.  The movie was ok but it really didn't need to be over three hours long.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece with his long awaited "Gangs Of New York." Though the film is far from perfect, Scorsese has succeeded in fulfilling his desire to make a movie about New York City's gangs, and underworld elements, during the corrupt reign of "Boss Tweed" and Tammany Hall. He also portrays the plight of poor Irish immigrants, and the prejudice they face when arriving in New York. Scorsese's attention to detail, the sets, costumes and period language, provide a spectacular and realistic backdrop for this very energetic historical film. He effectively incorporates the personal lives of his characters with the film's political and historical elements - really superior work!<p>My primary issue with the film, is that while the Irish did cause a tremendous riot, and murdered African-Americans, the film didn't focus on the reasons for this historical event, or really clarify, even for a brief period of the movie's 168 minutes, the reason for the riots. Instead, the upheaval was portrayed as something that grew out of the gang wars. Scorsese's interpretation skews history a bit, and leaves the viewer wondering why African-Americans were being victimized. Or perhaps that part of the film was left on the cutting room floor.<p>By 1860, one of every four New York City residents was an Irish-born immigrant. They worked as unskilled laborers on the docks, as ditch diggers and street pavers, and as cartmen and coal heavers. They competed directly with the city's African-American workers for jobs. The racial tension ran high before the war, and peaked in 1863. The National Conscription Act was passed in March 1863. Many immigrants were drafted right off the boat, knowing little about the cause, or politics, of the War Between the States. In the spring of 1863, in the midst of a strike of Irish dock workers, strikers attacked and beat African-American strike-breakers before federal troops arrived to protect the black workers. It is during these "Draft Riots" that the film's extraordinary finale takes place.<p>The action begins in 1846. A group of Irish immigrants living in the Five Points slums of New York City are part of the "Dead Rabbits Gang." They are led by the noble priest Vallon, (Liam Neeson), in a turf war about control over the money they earn, and over the streets of the Five Points slums, on New York's lower East Side. The already well established "Natives Gang," Protestants whose ancestors fought in the War of Independence, are extremely prejudiced against the Irish Catholics. Bill "the Butcher" Cutting, (brilliantly played by Daniel Day- Lewis, who always turns in a superb performance), is the "Nativist" gang leader, who collects a portion of everyone's earnings, and runs the local gangs and underworld criminals. He conspires with "Boss Tweed" and the local police to make more money, lining the politicians pockets as he does so. During the gang fight, filmed using dramatic camera shots, unusual angles, occasional slow motion, and backed by an extraordinary musical score, Vallon is killed by "The Butcher." The priest has a young son, Amsterdam Vallon, who witnesses everything and swears revenge. "The Butcher" places the boy in an institution, where he lives for the next sixteen years. When he is released, Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio), goes back to "Five Points" looking to settle his score with "The Butcher." Unexpectedly, Bill takes a liking to Amsterdam, who assumes an alias to protect his identity. The two form a bond, of sorts, which makes it difficult for the young Vallon to take his revenge.<p>What follows is an absolutely riveting movie, with an excellent cast. The actors certainly shine under Scorsese's direction. Daniel Day-Lewis' character, the charismatic, barbaric psychopath Bill, is the film's central figure. Day-Lewis is one of the most talented actors in the industry. Although I do not care for Leonardo DiCaprio, he puts in a decent performance as Amsterdam Vallon. Cameron Diaz's, as the quick fingered Jenny, lover of young Amsterdam, more than holds her own. The supporting cast is top-notch. I do think the editing could have been done better, to provide a smoother flow. However, with all its flaws, "Gangs of New York" is well worth watching and deserves a full five stars!<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This movie from the director of The Age Of Innocence is mildly interesting at best, because of the main premise and the three lead actors: Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. My main problem with this film is that DiCaprio's Irish accent comes and goes. One second, he's sounding like an Irishman and the next, he's sounding like a true American (that's how he ounds during the bits where he's doing the voice-over narration). Cameron Diaz fluctuates between an American and an Irish accent. The only actors who remained consistent with the accents are: Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, John C. O'Reilly and an uncredited Liam Neeson. I don't know any of the history that's covered in the film beyond what I remember from American History in high school, which is very little. I do, however, know a lot about the pilgrims who came to this country from England and Holland on the Mayflower in 1620, the Revolutionary War, the Declaration Of Independence and the Constitution of this hitherto God-blessed country (and still in the process of learning more about it). Worth a one-time viewing only, but Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is nothing less than the best of an incredible actor who goes to great lengths to prepare for a role. SPOILER ALERT!! The finale, in which Amsterdam faces off against Bill The Butcher, is a bit of a downer, as I fully expected a massive and epic fight to the death between these two mortal enemies. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Rated R.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Shamefully overlooked in the Oscars, no one really wants to acknowledge that America was devised on the back of mass genocide, gang wars, thieves, crooked politicians all coupled with heavy doses of bitter bloody racism. Gangs of New York is all about that and then some more.<p>The film starts with an almost primordial scene as the different warring factions of a place in New York known as the "five points" come together to sort out their discrepancies using clubs, knives, swords, hatchets and claws. Its the "Native American" versus the "Irishman" or the "Native American" versus whoever else sets foot on their land. Bill the Butcher (a massively impressive, larger than life, Uncle Sam from Hell type character played by Daniel Day Lewis), leader of the Natives, wins the initial battle for the five points and soon enough the numerous other failed gangs have had to resign under his power. The leader of the Irishman is killed during the battle and his only son escapes, vowing revenge.<p>16 years later the son (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back to avenge his father by joining the natives to murder Bill the Butcher as an insider. By this stage the five points is starting to look more like New York and there are plenty of set pieces along the way including the abolishment of slavery marches, warlords feuding, gangs causing trouble in various ways, fire brigades battling each other, corrupt politicians trying to win votes, P.T.Barnum and his shows and DiCaprio's love interest (Cameroon Diaz playing... Cameroon Diaz) caught between two and even more men.<p>Historically you will love it, however the film does fail in that the premise is pretty much just your average revenge story with a whole load of "other" factual historical stuff on the outside, but it moves along at a cracking good pace and the screen time is mostly devoted to Daniel Day Lewis (wise choice from Scorsese - DeNiro is hardly missed at all!), who is an absolute powerhouse and it is his character alone that makes this movie worth its weight it Gold. For all its misgivings the movie still screams past most other historical dramas. Sure it is a little light on plot, but come on - its like the antichrist just directed his version of "Titanic" on a really bad acid trip. It is thoroughly outrageous stuff indeed. What did you expect - Oliver Twist?</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>There's been a lot of flack directed at Gangs of New York for it's supposed "Historical Inaccuracies". I can't add anything except this: If you go to the movies for your History Lessons, something's wrong with you. If you go to be entertained, Gangs of New York is just the ticket.<p>  Based on Herbert Asbury's turn-of-the-century book, Gangs tells the epic tale of the Five-Points section of Manhattan, and the colorful gangs (The Dead Rabbits, The Plug Uglies, The Swamp Angels, The Nativists, etc.) that ruled her mean streets.<p>  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who witnessed his father "Priest" Vallon 's murder at the hands of Bill "The Butcher" (The amazing Daniel Day-Lewis) as a child, and in typical movie fashion, swore revenge. Amsterdam is released from reform school sixteen years later, and heads off to kill the Butcher. Along the way we get the usual romance, with Cameron Diaz acquitting herself well as pickpocket Jenny Everdeane, despite the fact that she isn't really given much to do in the film.  <p>  Like other Historical epics (Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan), Gangs takes the central topic and places fictional characters into the action. Although there really WAS a Bill the Butcher, he died well before the draft riots that end the film. Director Martin Scorcese deserves high marks for bringing a piece of seldom-seen American history to the screen. Despite it's nearly three-hour length, Scorcese keeps the film moving briskly along, and the opening battle, an exquisitely grotesque symphony of violence, is worth the price of admission alone. Only Scorcese could make such savagery seem beautiful...<p>  The performances are all good, but Daniel Day-Lewis is a revelation as the charming and deadly Bill the Butcher; He blows everyone else off the screen. If he doesn't win Best Actor at The Academy Awards it'll be another black eye to their selection process. Hopefully Scorcese will get some long overdue recognition as well. While Gangs isn't his best film, it's still head-and-shoulders above most of 2002's movies. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>1.)

At 2 hours and 45 minutes, "Gangs of New York" moves at a brisk pace that keeps the viewer hooked to the screen.<p>3).

Colors pop and detail is remarkably sharp throughout. Audio sounds terrific as well although the previous edition sounded quite good as well. Aside from some minor ringing (particularly when characters are against a white background--doesn't happen too often in this movie though), the presentation looks terrific.<br /><br />We get all the previous special features from the previous edition as well including Martin Scorsese's informed and entertaining commentary track. The special features are still in standard definnition but that's a minor issue--I'm just happy that Touchstone/Disney/Miramax was willing to go back and correct the error with the original mastering.<br /><br />You can tell the remastered vs. the previous edition because the cover picture with the main actors is smaller and bordered by black. The Blu-ray holders also have a sticker on the cover indicating its been remastered.<br /><br />For those interested in the plot--Set in New York in 1846 (during the height of the draft for the Civil War which contributed to a massive violent revolt by the poor which plays a part in the film as well), Leonardo Dicaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon who returns to lower Manhattan seeking revenge against Bill "the Butcher" (Daniel Day Lewis)who killed his father in a confrontation between their respective gangs. To kill Bill Vallon must become close to Bill and infiltrate his gang earning his trust in the process but Vallon finds that his vendetta against Bill gets lost in a much larger conflict between the various gangs of New York to run the city.Amsterdam feels conflicted particularly when Bill takes him under his wing and gains a grudging respect for him despite his brutality. Daniel Day Lewis gives a superb performance as Bill and although Dicaprio's accent varies quite a bit his emotionally complex, conflicted performance adds to the drama as well. When I first saw the film I was surprised at just how good Cameron Diaz could be as an actress as well.<br /><br />A well made flawed film, "Gangs of New York" manages to be involving and director Martin Scorsese crates a vivid recreation of New York before the turn of the century with detailed recreations of teh hovels and mud strewn streets, The film suffers because of a shortened running time (and it runs around 2 hours and 40 minutes but could have easily run an additional 20-30 minutes giving us more background on the conflict between Vallon's father who led the Dead Rabbits and Bill. Then again the action would have taken longer to get to and our main story focusing on the conflict between Vallon and Bill would have taken quite a bit longer to start as well.<br /><br />Even Scorsese's flawed films are stronger than most other directors great films and the ambition of "Gangs of New York" is welcome even if the film can't deliver on all of Scorsese's points. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Overshadowed by the controversy over lobbying for Academy Award nominations, Gangs of New York is a visually stunning but flawed minor classic from director Martin Scorsese. The film concerns a forgotten period in New York City's history when a variety of gangs controlled the five corners area. Corrupt politicians, the draft (for the Civil War) and a massive wave of immigrants created a turbulent environment. A huge anti-immigrant campaign helped fuel the many conflicts between the various gangs. Scorsese also incorporates a real riot that occuried during this time. The riot required army troops to come in and prevent further looting and murder.<p>The basic story focuses on the conflict between two rival groups--the Natives led by Bill &quot;the Butcher&quot; and the Dead Rabbits an Irish immigrant group led by &quot;Priest&quot; (Liam Neeson). Their conflict leads to the death of Priest witnesses by his young son Amsterdam (later played by Leonard DiCaprio). The Butcher arranges to have the child sent to a Reform school where he's raised by Catholic Priests.<p>Upon his release Amsterdam goes looking for Bill with revenge his primary goal. What Amsterdam finds is a changed world; the Natives control much of the corrupt police force and politicians in the five corners area. Bill is well regarded and, in fact, many of the Priest's old gang members work for Bill now. Amsterdam eventually meets Bill and is treated like a son by Bill. This creates a considerable conflict as Amsterdam has developed a gruding respect for the terrifying Butcher. His life is further complicated when he becomes involved with a woman (Cameron Diaz)who was saved by the Butcher as a child. <p>The production design is stunning capturing a time in New York's history that had been long forgotten by many of its residents. The shacks, stores and buildings that make up the five corners area have an authentic appearence to them. Scorsese and his production designer Dante Ferretti manage to make the audience not only feel the environment but taste and smell it as well.  Director of photography Michael Ballhaus lighting brings a rustic feel to the environment. <p>The major problem with the film is the screenplay. It clearly passed through a number of hands besides the three screenwriters credited (Jay Cocks, Steven Zallian and Kenneth Lonergon). The first two-thirds of the film are classic Scorsese; there's a vibrantcy to the script missing from the last third. That's the problem with the film--it's two-thirds a classic. During the last act the film literally falls apart and is very narratively disjoined. It's clear that Scorsese had a much longer cut of the film in mind; there's a lot that appears to be missing from the film cut, no doubt, to make the already long running time (167 minutes) functional for a movie theater. Since this is the DVD edition, I'm surprised that Scorsese didn't go back and recut the film adding extended dramatic sequences that might have made the last third a stronger act.<p>The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis (completely immersed in his character of Bill) is stunning. His falt, slightly rounded New York accent is as much a part of the character as can be imagined. The rest of the cast give varying performances with varying success when it comes to their Irish accents. Leonard DiCaprio makes a valient attempt to equal Day-Lewis but ultimately comes up slightly short of the perfection of Day-Lewis' performance. Still, he's believable in the role and manages to command your attention when he's on screen. <p>Cameron Diaz also makes a game attempt with her role. Her character really doesn't come to life until the middle of the film. Henry Thomas (E.T., Psycho 4) gives a memorable and solid performance as Amsterdam's friend. It's a role that could have been pushed into the shadows by the lead character but Thomas invests his character with a quiet, powerful presence. <p>Scorsese's direction is sharp and it's clear he's thought long and hard about how he wanted to present this picture. His confident direction keeps the momentum of the film from dragging and, until the last act, he knows exactly where he's going and what he's trying to achieve.<p>The DVD transfer is, generally, exceptional.  The picture is nearly flawless with few of the digital compression problems that have marred similarly epic films. There's virtually no analog artifacts and the print used here is crisp, clear and clean. The 5.1 sound mix and is also representative of what you might have heard in the theater. There were some problems with the discs. The first disc ends rather abruptly. There's a scene on the second disc where the music is mixed a bit too loud for the sequence and there appears to be other sounds leaking through the mix that shouldn't be there. <p>The extras are profuse. There's a nicely done costume design feaurette and a sequence where the audience can explore the sets for the film. Additionally, there's a documentary (originally shown on The Discovery Channel)that focuses on this little known time from New York's past. It's much more than a glorified promo for the film. Scorsese's commentary is, shall we, say effusive and interesting. His intelligent comments and observations make the film come alive a second time.  While I like U2, I could have done without the music video and would much rather have seen an a couple of interviews with Day-Lewis and other cast members on their craft.<p>While it's a flawed film, Gangs of New York captures Scorsese in top form throughout most of the film. If the film doesn't hang together the way it should, it's probably due to the fact that Scorsese had to trim more from the film than he would have liked (how else to explain Neeson's appearence in what amounts to a glorified cameo?). Scorsese takes considerable risk in telling the type of story that isn't in vogue with Hollywood any longer. Gangs is an intelligent, well acted drama with a larger than life performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that makes up for some of the films shortcomings. I'd suggest renting it first and, if you like it, move on to purchasing it.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>what a magnificent film! my only regret is that i waited until the dvd release to see it! i've been mesmerized 3 times in 2 days as to it's vast beauty, spectacle, and non stop entertainment values! yes, daniel day lewis is as brilliant as always, but mr. dicaprio as well as ms.diaz blend in beautifully in a great ensemble of great actors to help bring to the screen mr. scorceses awesome vision and imagination. this is his finest work and really should have been honored at oscar time. i say bravo to all involved and thank you for a flawless dvd!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>It took Martin Scorcese 25 years to start production of "Gangs of New York".  Had he started any sooner, it may not have resulted so magical.  The special effects and the art direction are amazing.  Who knew that so much blood could be so magical?<p>  Daniel Day-Lewis deserved his Oscar nomination for this role.  He never loses his character for one second.  Leonard DiCaprio made an amazing comeback with this film, which he was dissed for the Oscar, as was Cameron Diaz.  She proves that thieves can be emotional(this can only happen on screen).  For that, I expected her to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress before the nominations were released.<p>  "Gangs of New York" may also be a history lesson of how the Irish and other immigrants/minorities had to fight oppression in the 1800's.  If you are sensitive to graphic violence/war scenes, you may want to choose another movie.  Otherwise, you will be very satisfied of Martin Scorcese's outcome.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>For a movie that was almost 3 hours, I never managed to get bored. Viewers will love to hate Daniel D. Lewis in this role. What a performance! Many ancestors could have been part of these gangs. How people survive the times is a thought that comes to mind while watching. I can only hope that the violence depicted in the film was somewhat inflated. Have things changed since the late 1800s? Sure, but gangs still exist and corruption is more rampant than ever. In the 1840s.

And after growing into an anonymous young man, returns to reap his revenge, yet unwittingly becomes the butcher's prot&eacute;g&eacute;...<br /><br />Scorsese was bringing a long treasured project to the screen with Gangs, creating a hype that suffered from setbacks, delayed releases and mixed reviews. In hindsight what we have is no masterpiece, but it remains an undeniably good film, with many fine qualities to make up for its flaws.<br /><br />Scorsese's recreation of the city is stunning: the level of detail completely immerses the viewer into an atmosphere scarcely read of in History books. Moreover, the rich criminal world depicted here maintains a delicate balance of understandability and chaos. Scorsese couples this with his flair for music to create a truly intoxicating mood. The photography reinforces the overall effect tenfold, wonderfully sustained and carrying scattered sparks of pure genius. For example: in one shot, Scorsese pans from newly arrived immigrants who are welcomed, given the nationality, provided a uniform, and enlisted into the Union army to coffins of dead soldiers being unloaded on another peer.<br /><br />Ultimately, a film lives or dies by its screenplay and acting, and herein lies Gangs of New York's polarizing point. Whether you focus on the slightly uneven story (oddly shortened in places by pressured editing) or the fantastic performances will determine whether Gangs makes it or breaks it, but for its sheer visual power and acting it deserves to be seen. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly are all a joy to see when on top form, but the true feast here is Daniel Day Lewis's grand-standing, violent and xenophobic Bill The Butcher. A role that Robert De Niro (for whom it was originally intended over the years). The chances of this film becoming a favorite are slim, but at the very least you'll walk away with an indelible character to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Gangs of New York" is, for all its merits, not a masterpiece.  That's cerain no matter how you try to defend it.  The script is weak, the cast is wasted, and most of all, the conclusion is overblown -- see how the film ends, and no one can gives this film a full mark.<p>In a way, the film title tells it all -- it's all about the "Gangs of New York" before the time such films like "Godfather II" covers.  The film starts in 1846.  Over the territory called Five Points, two groups -- Irish "Dead Rabbits" and "Native Americans" -- are about to settle the final score by the most bloody battle on the snowy street in New York.  During the battle, one of the leaders is killed by the other, and the now orphaned boy is sent to an institute to be raised there.  <p>Cue to years later.  Now the boy Amsterdam (DiCaprio) comes back to town, and comes to know how to live streetsmart, under the wing of Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), the very person who murdered his own father before.  Now learning the way of living in this rough and tough dtrrict, Amsterdam meets his love, a beautiful and smart pickpocket Jenny (Diaz), who has a shady past she wants to leave behind.  <p>Thus the story goes.  But as you will see, the plot is there as if to be an excuse for showing the detailed re-construction of New York City and its now forgotten customs, and the character of Amsterdam is too unconvincing because we don't know what he really wants to do all through the film.  Actually, the love-triangle around Leo's character becomes nothing just before the meticulously researched details of New York in the 19th century.  So, you will see how the fire brigades fight each other (not the fire) because of their disputes over territories; or how things can be stolen from aristcratic mansions with ease.  Details are the life of the film, and the story is almost non-existent.<p>This is the greatest merit and demerit of watching "Gangs of New York."  Don't expect too see DiCaprio's character display any depth, or Diaz's groundbreaking acting.  There is none simply because the film does not allow that.  Even the ever-great Day-Lewis is often buried among the tidal waves of facts about New York, which in themselves are visually striking in the same way as the London of David Lean's "Oliver Twist" (which the production designer Dante Ferretti saw with the director).  <p>The film ends with one of the most overproduced conclusion, and though as a storytelling the film is a mess, the visuals are always impressive -- after all you know that they all created  these buildings in Italy for this occasion only.  The cast is great, but I could not believe Ms. Diaz is really suitable for the role of 19th century drama -- she has shown herself too many times in films like "The Sweetest Thing" -- and as I said, if you are a fan of DiCaprio, you can skip this one and go to see "Catch Me If You Can" -- not least when you love him as Romeo or Jack.  There are impressive cast -- Liam Neeson, JC Reilley, and Jim Broadbent -- but regrettably too small amount of attention is given to their roles, making them look truly wasted.  <p>This is, I think, Scorsese's "Apocalypse Now" -- he is trying to draw a grand-scale picture which he can never finish.  And see the analongy here -- the cost, the confusing ending, good cast behind the overblown productions, and long, grueling shooting.  Like Coppola's film, "Gangs of New York" might need some time to be appreciated.  But remember, some people still say that Coppola's film is not a masterpiece, if a great attempt.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Based on characters taken from Herbert Ashbury's book, The Gangs of New York, the film opens in 1845 with Amsterdam Vallon who witnesses the death of his gang leader father, The Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) at the hands of William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), the central figure in the naturalised, anti-immigrant America. Cut to some 16 years later and Amsterdam (DiCaprio) returns to his father's old stomping ground of Five Points, Lower Manhattan in a bid to seek vengeance on the man who killed his father.<br />As consistently violent a film as Scorsese has made, Gangs of New York is thankfully absent of romanticism when it comes to the natives of the hellish Five Points, and his view of the history of his city is honest and true.

Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is killed in a bloody stuggle between the immigrants and the "natives" (led by Billy Cutting, played by Daniel Day-Lewis). Years later, Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), plots revenge for his father's murder. Cutting, unknowing, takes the young Amsterdam under his wing, practically adopting him as the son he never had. Amsterdam, who has never known a father and is starving for familial affection, battles daily with his internal demons.<br /><br />This movie is long, but it is incredibly atmospheric. One gets a true sense of what life might have been like in New york in the 1850's - dirty, crowded, a real struggle for survival, the cacophany of cultures being thrown together in close quarters for the first time, the great disparity between the rich and the poor. And, most of all, how the passage of time erases all of man's great struggles, leaving only slight scars on the cityscape.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, looking for the first time like an actual man and not some scrawny teenager, turns in a good performance. But the real star of the movie is Daniel Day-Lewis. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, "Geez, he looks like an idiot. Who did costumes for this thing?" But when I saw his performance, I was positively blown away. He is absolutely inspired in this film. As a viewer, I felt both attracted to him and repelled by him. His nuanced character is capable of such cruelty, but he is also a man of great principle, and he feels an almost boundless pride and love for Amsterdam. He also has great respect for Priest Vallon, Amsterdam's father. (He feels that they were cut from the same cloth, believing that only their differences in religion separated them.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a great film, and I definitely recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's a beautiful picutre.

I hear that it was originally supposed to be 4 hours long, which is just baffling.  Perhaps at that length it had some elements which made it seem truly expansive, but now it just seems like a severely padded run-of-the-mill revenge story.  Now, mind you, I'm not inherently opposed to lengthy movies or anything like that, but the story here just doesn't seem at all suited for the epic format, as the final product clearly demonstrates.  However, I can't say that the padding isn't fairly interesting, and it's all reasonably involving.  The film looks terrific, has some very cool fight scenes, and the acting is generally excellent apart from DiCaprio.  (And DiCaprio isn't exactly bad here, and he's proven elsewhere that he is a good actor he just isn't given much of anything to do even though he's the main character.)  Daniel Day-Lewis, in particular, is a total hoot as Butcher Bill.  Not exactly the most believable character around, but he's certainly entertaining to watch.  Still, the story is only interesting as spectacle i.e. I never cared about or was even much interested in the characters, and though the film seems to think it's saying something about New York and America or whatever, I don't see it.  And, again, damned if anything actually happens in the middle section of the film.  But I was never bored, so I think it's worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>New York is renowned for being a tough town.  Only, in the mid-19th century it was more reminiscent of hell on earth.  In the midst of it all, natives and non-natives (mostly Irish) fought for their land, culture, and their home of Five Points.<br /><br />Scorsese, renovating the modern epic film, chooses New York as the backdrop, and the life of the gangs as his story.  This is all well intentioned, and as you might see, the film was pretty good.  However, this movie was limited by context, and in the sad story of it all.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (as an Irish immigrant) and Daniel Day Lewis (as an already victorious kingpin) played the two main antitheses.  Both did extremely well, and Leonardo was successful yet again in breaching out to a new and exciting character: the underdog immigrant.<br /><br />Now, New York history has never been my interest, and although this movie sparked that in many others, and me there seemed to be an incredible lack of reason for this film's existence.  Now, I realize that this would never be an issue for an awful film, because there would be just a short brutal critique.  So maybe extra scrutiny is not justified, but Scorsese just never seemed to bring home the plot, the moral, or the point of this film.<br /><br />If anything it is brutal is as brutal does.  For the townspeople's lives (for they were that more then gang members) were built in blood, and although their farce of a society seems peaceful, one of the two leaders, or both, will have to do die in blood.<br /><br />Summarily, this is a nice timepiece for New York history.  Drawn out like a History Channel film, yet vivid and piercing as an action film.  A gory immigrants tale if there every was one.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>I did not expect much from this film because I don't like the cast much, and the story is also not within the purview of my own interests. Usually I avoid things with stories that don't have much redeeming value to me personally, but in this case, I thought I might as well watch. The DVD fell into my hands, and I figured it could not hurt. I can say I was impressed with the film... grand scale, interesting... but overall, it seemed a bit much. This is why I just think it was average or a bit above average. The grand scale in essence was too over the top for my liking, but I did find myself entertained and engaged in the story enough to stick with it through the whole length. It was gory, bloody and dramatic, also not my favorites, but I think the film is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>"Gangs of New York" is my first movie directed by the much-lauded Martin Scorcese.  And I must say I was impressed.  Scorcese brings New York amazingly to life in the early 1860s' and during the escalating Civil War.  Driven by exquisite and extraordinary production and costume design, Scorcese drops you into New York and fills your eyes with color, filth and a good amount of blood.  The opening fight scene between the native and Dead Rabbits gangs is a raw, blood-soaked battle that brings to mind, surprisingly, the vicious hand-to-hand combat of "Braveheart."  A boy named Amsterdam witnesses the battle (Leonardo Decaprio, eventually) and his father slain at the hands of William Cutting (a superb Daniel-Day Lewis).  From then on, he is bent on revenge, wanting to kill Bill the Butcher, but make it convincing and a spectacle, the same way he killed his father.  <p>But a revenge-dominated plot has been done so many times in movies, but Scorcese has a trick up his sleeve.  The bulk of the movie focuses on the political corruption, lawlessness and turmoil of of the Five Points, Amsterdams' stomping grounds.  The Butcher has plenty of savvy here, and Day-Lewis hits every note right about him.  Day-Lewis creates a multi-layered, complex and unpredictable character from the moment he shows himself on screen.  Dicaprio stumbles at first with Amsterdam, but as the movie goes on, he becomes more confident, leading to the films' fiery and explosive climax when the Draft Riots insue.  Also, Cameron Diaz is effective as the pickpocket Jenny Everdean, but has the same problem that mirrors Dicaprio in her early troubles but eventual growth into her character.<p>Where the "If Flawed" part of my title comes from a script that is at times too ambitious and overreaching.  Where the screenwriters paint a vivid picture life and strife in the Five Points, they have difficulty developing characters other then Bill the Butcher and his cohorts.  Diaz was able to pull a respectable character of Jenny Everdean from a part that was often lacking.  There was the same problem with Amsterdam, though not as much.  They needed more text to describe Amsterdam in as much detail as they did Bill the Butcher.  Over the course of the movie though, the character of Amsterdam becomes clear, but not as readily or as satisfying as William Cutting.<p>Is "Gangs of New Yrok" Scorcese's best film?  Probably not, considering his past successes.  But it is a worthy entry in his repatuare, for its powerful vision of Civil-War era New York and Daniel Day-Lewis' deft and steady development of his big, bad William Cutting.  With repeat viewings, "Gangs" will reval itself more, showing more of its bravado and sinewy nature.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Meh.  This is a painfully heavyhanded, broadly played, on-the-nose, over-the-top dud.  Scorsese just can't help himself, can he?  I recall reading reviews of this film which concentrated on Daniel Day Lewis's supposedly delicious turn as a villain -- but his role was one of the central weak points the film, and was, in all honesty, just a rehash of the same old, tired, badguy schtick that Robert DeNiro does with equally belabored relentlessness.  Anyway, a potentially fascinating story -- of the outlandishly violent, corrupt gangs that ran New York City in the later 1800s -- is ruined by Scorsese's blunt, pointlessly aggressive direction and a remarkably unsubtle script.  You can practically hear him goading the actors on keep "giving more" and indulging their hammiest impulses.  Thus, the film is drowned in a deluge of overly-obvious violence, cheap melodrama and garish visual design.  If done right, this could have been a masterpiece.  As is, it's a real stinker.  Wish I'd skipped it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From the time of it's release, Gangs of New York was destined to be a critically underrated film.  And despite the fact it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one, losing in most categories to Chicago (Miramax's other big budget juggernaut).  However, deep within the film's flesh and bones, director Martin Scorsese has crafted a cinematic masterpiece with one of the finest cast's I've seen in a long time.  Leonardo DiCaprio, no matter what anyone might say or think about him, perfectly fits the part of Amsterdam Valon; who as a youth witnessed his gang leading father (Liam Neeson) get killed by the brutal Bill "The Butcher" Cutting (an Oscar nominated Daniel Day-Lewis).  Years later, Amsterdam returns to New York and becomes a protege of Cutting's; while all the while keeping the memory of his father's demise.  Cameron Diaz is on board here as well as a pick pocket who catches Amsterdam's eye, and she does a much better job here than she has been given credit for.  Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, and John C. Reilly are on board as well in smaller roles and give good performances, although it feels as if Reilly is a bit underused considering how good an actor he is.  Daniel Day-Lewis steals the entire film with his brutally convincing performance, which is his best in years.  Yes, Gangs of New York is a bloody and violent film, but nowhere near the excessive violence and gore of some past films which have been regarded as modern day classics.  All in all, Gangs of New York is an underrated modern day masterpiece that displays the film's marketing tagline: "America Was Born in the Streets".</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>GANGS OF NEW YORK has been hailed as a magnificent recreation of a pre-Civil War New York torn by racial and ethnic prejudice.  Others label it in the same words but without the qualifier 'magnificent.'  The truth is probably somewhere in between.  Director Martin Scorsese clearly wanted GANGS OF NEW YORK to fit in with his frequent mythological interpretations of purely American character and history.  Scorsese succeeds in capturing the overblown essence that was surely the chaotic mess of the Boss Tweed era.  However dangerous New York might seem today, the proliferation of gangs and crooked cops make the waterfront section of the Five Points seem as hostile as Beirut ever was.  In nearly every scene, Scorcese places muggers, burning buildings, hookers, pickpockets, and urban warfare.  <p>The unifying theme that Scorcese sought was that of revenge, most often for the murder of a family member.  There are no less than three separate examples of revenge sought as a reason to wreak further havoc.  The primary seeker is, of course, Amsterdam Vallon, hugely miscast by Leonardo DiCaprio.  In nearly every scene that DiCaprio is in, he shows no more emotion than the ubiquitous picture of his late father shows.  The only exception is the fistfight between him and one of Bill the Butcher's lackeys.  For a child who saw his father killed in street warfare, DiCaprio as an adult is remarkably unconcerned.  He is meant to be the dramatic center, but he is so lacking in the gravitas required of an action hero, that the audience by default looks elsewhere.  This dramatic vacuum is soon filled by Daniel-Day Lewis, who plays Bill 'the Butcher' Cutter, in one of the most memorable screen villain performances ever.  Lewis steals the show in much the same way that James Earl Jones did as Darth Vader in STAR WARS.  Lewis struts, rhapsodizes, bullies, and tosses knives as he embodies the very essence of a thug who knows how to build and to maintain a criminal empire.  He even engages the audience's sympathy as he shows himself to be a 'butcher' more in the job sense than in the psychological one.  He kills people, true enough, but he does so with his own hands.  His cohort-in-crime, Boss Tweed kills far more in allowing New York to be a cesspool that gobbles up thousands of disembarking Irish on a daily basis. Further, Bill as the Butcher, kills Amsterdam Vallon's father in fair and open combat and even praises his fallen foe as a worthy opponent whose corpse ought not be defiled.  Cameron Diaz as Jenny the pickpocket has little to do but first attract Amsterdam's attentions then heal his physical wounds.  <p>The lasting impression of GANGS OF NEW YORK is how Scorcese depicts the anarchy that was New York during the anti-draft riots of the Civil War.  The swirling gangs with colorful names like the Plug-Uglies, the Dead Rabbits, and the Bowery Boys are seen ultimately as the collective consciousness of a city that was being inundated by immigrants who themselves were immigrants only one generation past but now call themselves 'nativists.' Given the length of the film (167 minutes) it would have been difficult for any director to keep the audience focused on the titular hero.  But in this case, Scorsese unwittingly proved once again that a charismatic villain can easily overshadow a bland hero to such an extent that the audience identifies more with this villain than either with the hero or the plot.  Still, the resounding spectacle makes GANGS OF NEW YORK required viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>Like Gladiator and Braveheart, this one's to be loved for its sweeping epic scenes, stunning landscapes, solid cinematography and a few stand out performances - namely Lewis.'<p>A dark mood is effectively captured as is a real sense of the adventure and danger of settling this country. Suspending some critical judgment is always good with pictures like this. Simply go with it and get swept up in its grandeur.<p>For me that is the real magic of film.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>One has high expectations for any Scorsese film, as a result of triumphs such as "Taxi Driver" and "Goodfellas."  He is one of the great American directors, and on top of that, the man really loves film as an art form.  As a result, it's particularly disappointing when a Scorsese film misses the mark.<br /><br />This movie tried so hard to be an epic that it failed in the most basic departments of story and characterization.  The enormous sets, the costuming, the size of the crowds--all of it screams "hey, I'm an epic!"  But ultimately this movie is a collection of trappings of an epic film badly stitched together into something much less than the sum of its parts.  For the three solid hours that we spend with the characters, we never know any of them (other than Bill Cutting) very well, nor does a coherent plot ever coalesce.  And although the performances are generally quite good, neither DeCaprio nor Bill the Butcher ever quite figure out what accent they want to use and stick with it.  Indeed, about every third line of Bill's sounds like Fat Tony from the Simpsons, and the others sound like standard American English.  And what was up with the ending?  Both anticlimactic and somewhat baffling, it makes the viewer wonder why he just sat through three hours of film.<br /><br />If this movie had been about an hour shorter and focused more on substance than style, it would have been a real winner.  As is, this is best rented, and only if you have 3 hours of time on your hands for something that you probably won't like very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Martin Scorcese's epic tale of gang warfare in New York at the time of the Civil War is an overblown, exaggerated account that is very watchable but ultimately fails as a cohesive story.  I don't doubt that much of what happens in this film is inspired by fact, but I don't think that the actual participants looked quite as much like the cast of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; as do the characters in this film.  Take, for example, the main villain, William Cutting AKA Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis).  One of his eyes is a steel ball with an American eagle on it; he cut out the original to present as a gift to the man who gave him a magnificent beating.  There's also a woman who has filed her teeth into fangs.  And a guy whose club is notched to commemorate his victims.  Star Leonardo DiCaprio's father (Liam Neeson) wore a priest's collar even as he marched into battle.<p>I have come to expect gritty realism from Scorcese, but in this film he goes way over the top.  The enormous (and surprisingly well-lit) catacombs and cavernous interiors with ratty characters hanging from bamboo scaffolding seem like left-over shots from &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;.  It often seems like a film made by a much less skillful director who is willing to sacrifice the reality of his scenario for a cool effect, a bit of dramatic posing, or some easy violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>The only reason this one doesn't get 1 star is Daniel Day Lewis who is impressive in this movie as he is in all others. Dicaprio and Diaz however are laughably bad in this, and the movie is meandering and often seems lost in it's own murk. I would only reccomend this to Day Lewis fans, Scorsese fans should skip it because it doesn't add anything to what he has done, this one is kind of an embarassment. Scorsese has had his great films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, that's why I've been confused with his recent stuff, The Aviator wasn't that great either. My advice is simple...Dicaprio, DeNiro you are not.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>The idea for Gangs of New York, a film about the oppression of the Irish immigrants in 1860's America, had been floating around the head of Martin Scorsese for nearly thirty years and after continuous production delays and release date changes, his dream film is finally making it to theaters. Most of the buzz generated for the film had been created by the film's problems both on and off the set. Such rumors included fights on the set and Leonardo DiCaprio delaying production over money issues. Whether or not it was over money, the film was delayed several times over the course of a year being moved from December 2001 to July 2002 only to receive a release date on the week before Christmas Day 2002, one year after it was originally planned. If the film is truly another masterpiece from the famous director then all these headaches will be worth it. But could all these problems overwhelm the $100 million budgeted film?<p>The story for Gangs of New York focuses on the oppressions of the Irish Americans forced upon them by the "native" Americans. Amsterdam Vallon returns to the city of New York after spending nearly sixteen years in jail. New York was once his home before his father, leader of the "Dead Rabbits" gang, was killed by Bill the Butcher, the leader of "natives" who opposed immigration in America. Amsterdam returns to the mean streets seeking revenge and joins the "natives" in order to get closer to Bill. Bill forms a special bond with Amsterdam and treats him like the son he never had, not knowing that Amsterdam is secretly plotting his demise. Along the way, Vallon sees the horrible conditions the Irish are living under and decides to raise up a gang not only to fight against the "natives" but the corrupt government of New York. The story of Gangs of New York may seem great on paper but when it is brought to the screen, it just becomes too confusing by the end. The main focus should have been the historical aspect talking about the time period and political corruption but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the two stories get too jumbled together to find a clear perception on what is going on. <p>The Martin Scorsese flick is impressive for its large assemble cast alone but the main characters are well done as well for the most part. Gangs of New York is the first of two films Leonardo DiCaprio opening around Christmas Day 2002 but both roles show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. He does a pretty good job at making the audience accept him as an Irish immigrant but the main problem is with the character's story involvement. Amsterdam is way too complicated to fully understand that the plot never fully clears up unanswered questions about him but that is not DiCaprio's fault. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Bill the Butcher. The accent he gave the character as well as the stirring emotions sets the mood for a "native" New Yorker in the 1860's. The only character in the film that seemed out of place was Jenny Everdeane, played by Cameron Diaz. Once again it is not the actor's fault but the fault of the script. Diaz does a wonderful job with the character but there just seems to be no point to her outside of being attractive eye candy.<p>Overall, Gangs of New York, as good as the buzz tries to make it out to be, is a big disappointment. The story of the film is the most noticeable problem. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the problem is that the film fails to remind people what is going on at this time. When they join the historical aspect of the script with the Amsterdam revenge plot, the whole thing just becomes too jumbled together to get a straight story out of it. How the historical aspects were handled was also a problem. The fact that the Union and the draft were shown in a bad light was probably the most upsetting part of the entire film. The three hour time length of Gangs didn't help the story as most just seemed drag on. When one part of the story seems to be going in one direction, it ends up just being turned into another direction. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct us straight to the ending instead of dragging it out. Speaking of the ending, this has to be one of the most disappointing endings in quite awhile. They built all this emotion and intensity into the characters but that is just ruined with this ending. There are good things about Gangs of New York but they are so few and far between that they can be mentioned right now. See the film by all means if you really want to see it. If not then wait for the rental on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>An epic on the scale of "Gangs of New York" only comes once in a blue moon. The film's scope is so great that Scorcese's literally and figuratively utilized the proverbial "cast of thousands". Mammoth sets and period costuming accentuate the story of a young man seeking revenge against the man that slew his father many years earlier. A secondary element of the plot is its tale of a country in transition. The emergence of the "gangs" in New York is a reflection of the various ethnic groups that made up much of the immigrant populations and the clashes of such strong Old World cultures. The corrupt city officials that ran New York at the time are also part of this riveting story. <p>Daniel Day Lewis's "Bill the Butcher" is the kind of reprehensible character that audiences love to hate. Lewis embodies the character's warped sense of patriotism with a swagger of bravado that is magnified on the big screen. When given the right role, DiCaprio shows his mettle as an actor. "Gangs" gives him that in the part of "Amsterdam Vallon", a young man seeking vengeance as well as respect for his people. Cameron Diaz's "Jenny Everdeane" is miles away from anything that the actress has done before or since. Henry Thomas is also impressive as DiCaprio's friend and betrayer. <p>One of the great mysteries is why this film did not sweep the 2003 Academy Awards. It should have for all parties concerned. <p>But, the world, especially the Oscar-voting contingency, is not a fair place.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Any film that tries to recreate mid-nineteenth-century New York has to have something going for it, and director Martin Scorsese's gorgeous recreation of the Five Points and Paradise Square in the 1840s and 1860s certainly is the sort of the thing you won't get to see very often. The plot of this expensive over-the-top mess has something to do with how "America" (by which Scorsese means... New York? Manhattan? the immigrant population?) was supposed to have been established by mob violence waged between the Irish, represented by (wait for it) Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo di Caprio), and the self-named "Natives," led by "Wild" Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). (There's even a U2 rock anthem at the end, "The Hands that Built America," to hammer home this  dubious point.) The whole thing is ridiculously overscaled and all kinds of historical figures from the day keep wandering in to make cameos, from  Horace Greeley to P.T. Barnum to Boss Tweed, as Di Caprio and Day-Lewis go at each other with every kind of deadly bladed implement you can imagine. The film's bizarre messing of history finds it nadir during the Draft Riots (which forms a chaotic set-piece conclusion), when Scorsese shows the mobs storming and burning the mansion of the Schermerhorns (suggesting they're going to kill them) and the Union fleet warships firing  their big guns into lower Manhattan.<br /><br />What was Scorsese trying to do with this movie? It seems to be on the same silly scale as Brian Di Palma's SCARFACE, but somehow mixed with BIRTH OF A NATION; the whole thing seems staggeringly misconceived. Neither Di Caprio nor Cameron Diaz as his pickpocket love interest seem to have the slightest idea what they're doing in the film. As the Grand Guignol villain, the fictitious Bill Cutting (who is even given a glass eye he likes to tap with a knife point), Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wildly sweaty and over-the-top performance that many people for some reason took very seriously at the time the film was released.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>This was pushed as THE film of the year.

Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast, completely. Diaz's role seems so unclear, like they said hey, let's stick Diaz in here for star power. DiCaprio, usually a very talented actor, looks like a little boy trying to play big boy and worse, his performance was so dull as if we walked through the whole film. At time, his efforts are near comical. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a stunning performance, but nearly stomach churning at times.

He attempts to tell the story of the origin of the country in a violent, unceremonious bloodbath.  This is a wonderful film even for its flaws.  Just as my heading says, it is a near masterpiece.  The flaws are there, every reviewer will tell you this.<br /><br />One of the problems with the film is the character's motivations.  Amsterdam returning to avennge his father's death is perfect, but some of his actions seem faulty.  He appears to be fickle for no reason at times in the film.  Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) is the same way.  He betrays his "friend" for no other reason than to drive the plot forward.  I could go on in detail about the miscuses of other characters, touching on Diaz's lack of pickpocketing after it served its purpose for the storyline but I'll move on to what I liked about this movie.<br /><br />For one, it's absolutely beautiful, the sets, the lighting, the shots, everything.  The recreation of Old New York is magnificent.  I can't imagine why (COUGH*Harbey Weinstein*COUGH) the Academy did not award Dante Ferretti and Martin Scorsese for this wonderfully designed film.  The cinematography is just as excellent, with the scenes popping, figurately and at times literally, off the screen.  The colors are vibrant and exuberant, the buildings the pefect shade.  It looks remarkable.<br /><br />Another strong point is its absorbing power.  Once the story gets going, you just watch, amazed at what a great job Scorsese did.  It's not without its pacing problems, but it does a great job of keeping you entertained.  The last thirty minutes is when everything falls apart though.  The grand draft riots has no buildup.  It occurs, which, if it had happened at any other point in the film it would have been all right, at the end, when you need a dynamic ending to push the film into the epic stratisphere.<br /><br />A near masterpiece that, in the future, will be remembered as one of Scorsese's greatest accomplishments, probably right below <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RP2">Mean Streets (Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062IVKS">Raging Bull (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RKW">GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and in the same company with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCNV">The King of Comedy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1559409037">The Last Temptation of Christ - Criterion Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8S">The Age of Innocence</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VZ9DK">Casino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Now, for the DVD specs.

It's not a must see, but it's real close.  The violence may be a little unnerving but it's definitely needed to tell a story like this.

This is set against the backdrop of the civil war, corruption in politics and prejudice against immigrants to the US.<br /><br />While the stars do their usual good job with a wonderful supporting cast, the true star of the film is the violence of the era.  This leaves us with little to like about the film as the characters are manifestations of a culture of violence and predation.

The lack of emotional and spiritual depth leaves a feeling of dullness and lack of resolution at the end of the film.<br /><br />This film is mildly interesting visually but I felt more could have been done in this arena as well.

If so, I would strongly recommend you take a trip to "Gangs of New York" and see how much worse things USED to be in the not too distant past.  The film is Martin Scorcese's epic paean to the Lawlessness That Made America Great, a theme most often explored against a Far West backdrop, out on the open prairie or in two-bit towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas.  Here it's been transferred to 1860's New York City, which in Scorcese's vision, turns out to be a veritable Dickensian hellhole of vice and corruption, a place teeming with rival gangsters, pickpockets, corrupt politicians, lawbreaking policemen, and even firefighters so obsessed with matters of jurisdiction that they do physical battle with rival departments while an unattended building goes up in flames behind them.  This is a world where life has no value and where a man's existence can be snuffed out without so much as a by-your-leave or a single person left behind to mourn him.  The members of these rival gangs make the Sharks and the Jets - who would make their appearance on the same turf a full century later - look like mere pantywaists in comparison.  <p>Visually, the film is a masterpiece, offering some of the best cinematography, art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002.  With the help of some master craftsmen, Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself, one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before.  The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal, with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foot-tall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration.  It is truly an astonishing, eye-popping achievement.<p>The same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film, however.  Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks, the screenplay by Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting.  The main drawback is the story itself, which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes.  Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man who, as a boy, witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of Bill "the Butcher" Cutting, the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis.  Bill, who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments, is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear, and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area.  After a 16-year absence, Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime, determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life.<p>Despite the glories of the setting, Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life.  Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hard-as-steel Bill Cutting (who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in "Oliver Twist," a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors).  Perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match.  Perhaps, too, the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here.  Whatever the reason, the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of  "Gangs of New York."  Moreover, the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired, consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and half-baked philosophizing.  Lucky for us, then, that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued, if not quite fascinated, throughout. <p>What does fascinate us, however, is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story.  These include the ever-present backdrop of the Civil War, which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit, and the anti-war riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart - both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town.

Reilly, Gary Lewis, Stephen Graham.<br /><br />Running Time:  166 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for intense strong violence, sexuality/nudity and language.<br /><br />"Gangs of New York", Martin Scorsese's epic that nearly never hit the big screen, begins when the year is 1846, and a clan of Irish immigrants, lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) have come to the deadliest part of the burgeoning New York City, the Five Corners, to battle with a madman named William Cutting, aka Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), and his horde of Anglo-Saxon `natives.' When Priest Vallon is killed by William, his son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent away to an orphanage, and spends the next 16 years stewing in his plans for retribution. Arriving back at the Five Corners, Amsterdam plots his way to William, who now runs the city. Seeking help from all the individual gangs that creep and swindle around the streets, plus assistance from a pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) who has direct access to William, Amsterdam tries to overthrow the Butcher. And all the while, the city is bulging with the violence which will culminate in the draft riots of 1863.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a masterpiece, offering some of the best cinematography, art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002. With the help of some master craftsmen, Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself, one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before. The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal, with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foot-tall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration. It is truly an astonishing, eye-popping achievement; however the same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film.  Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks, the screenplay by Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting. The main drawback is the story itself, which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes. Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man who, as a boy, witnessed the murder of his father (Liam Neeson) at the hands of Bill `the Butcher' Cutting (played very well by Daniel Day-Lewis), the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis. Bill, who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments, is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear, and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area. After a 16-year absence, Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime, determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life.<br /><br />Despite the glories of the setting, Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life. Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hard-as-steel Bill Cutting (who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in "Oliver Twist", a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors). Perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match; perhaps, too, the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here. Whatever the reason, the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of "Gangs of New York".  Moreover, the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired, consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and half-baked philosophizing. Lucky for us, then, that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued, if not quite fascinated, throughout.  What does fascinate us; however, is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story. These include the ever-present backdrop of the Civil War, which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit, and the anti-war riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart, both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town. In moments like these, "Gangs of New York" almost touches greatness. Also of interest is the way in which the film highlights the fervid anti-immigration attitude that has so completely permeated the history of a country that, in a bewildering paradox, has always prided itself (in theory, at least, if not always in practice) on being the great `melting pot' for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised to flock to - and the film reminds us of how prevalent that anti-immigrant attitude still is today in many quarters.

The movie is great, all around.  The gang fights, the performances, the sets, the story, everything is masterfully crafted.  Scorcese makes another great movie(goodfellas, casino), they all kick a$$.  The only thing holding back this movie from being a 10 out of a 10 is the smut and the movie is seperated on 2 discs on the DVD, why its not that long really, if they can fit the green mile on one disc why not this one, i hate having to get up and change the disc.  Its a 9 out of a 10 for the movie because the smut and lack of one gang fight that i thought it could use in the middle to kind of even it out alittle.  Overall its a good movie worth owing, and probably Scorcese's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>Still reeling from his past projects of teeny-bopper fame (Titanic) I initially cringed at the thought of voluntarily watching something with Leonardo Dicaprio in it. Unless you are a 12 year old girl, his acting does not offer much, and I always feared my brains turning into mush as an inevitable side-effect of watching any of his projects. <p>That is until this film....<p>Dicaprio plays John, the member of an Irish immigrant gang, who are earnestly trying to make their way in turn of the century NYC against insurmountable odds (including anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic sentiment). Juggling basic survival needs against resources, he sets out to avenge the death of his father himself killed off by one of the street gangs <p>Boss Tweed (Daniel Day Lewis ) is only open to these afforementioned newcomers to the extent they will maintain his power structure exactly as it is. The actual provision of social services as myself and many other 21st century Americans understand them (even in the era of goverment downsizing) is non-existent. Mutiple fire departments spend more time amongst themselves arguing who should be privlleged enough to put out an inferno (and receive money) than saving lives. <p>The Civil War is roaring, but the North is just as suceptible to racism as the more doccumented South from liberal usage of racial slurs throughout the film, and scenes of one pro-slavery rally. For individuals such as myself who were students of American policy and had fancied ourselves educated individuals, complex reality was very jarring. The working class youths volunteering for Union Army conscription do so out of realization this may be the only practical way to get food than racial justice as myself and others currently understand that concept.<p>Eeerily foreshadowing the Flordia 2000 scandal, Boss Tweed's political coruption is a centrail theme of life for many imigrants. Personally, these same people do not like him, but understand a working relationship is important for their survival. Individuals who do not vote when and how the machine wants can expect swift retribution and vote counters themselves wield inordinate amounts of political power. American society made some important advances since the Nineteeth Century, but in some respects we are dealing with the same issues because they were not properly handled the first time. <p>For all of it's mentioned pluses, this film has some serious limitations. The realities of abdominal surgery (dangerous/fatal until development of antiseptic surgery and antibiotics during the 1930's) is repeatedly ignored in several storylines so the characters can make medical recoveries commonplace with Twentieth and Twenty First Century medical innovations. Only once is the procedural-historical seriousness remembered (Cameron Diaz's Cesarian Section) but even this scene only dwells on the risk temporarily instead of treating it as a running theme throughout every person's life. <p>Overall, this is a good film which will readily entertain political and party animals alike. The long run time is compensated by the lively plot and characters throughout the entire film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>I have to admit that Martin Scorcese's "Gangs of New York" threw me; on the one hand, it's one of the more brilliantly cinematic American films to come along in years, with more in common with the sense of artistic maturity known to films 40 years ago than the usual scatterbrained claptrap boxed up and shipped stinking to theaters today.  One can see strains of the great international directors, too, from David Lean to Akira Kurasawa to Bernardo Bertulucci in Scorcese's vision, though he seems to equally raid the Mad Max sequels, stockpiles of Victorian Era clipart, and everyone's favorite muckraker, Upton Sinclair.  On the other hand, I felt like the story of European immigrants and their unending hostility to each other and everyone else has been told so many times in one form or another that a roll of the eyes was in order.  And it's still another gangster movie.  I finally came down on the film being closer to the superb side.  That the main plot ultimately boils down to a simple revenge story--and, too often, I did not care about the plight of its characters, who are more animals than people, even with their hypocritical pretensions of civilization--is surmounted by a tour de force of acting and spectacle, most of it driven by Scorcese's attention to period detail.  In short, the director is in top form as a visualist, certainly better than in the much-hyped but dramatically weaker "The Aviator."  He's so good here, he manages to get a watchable performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, but thinking-man's villain Daniel Day-Lewis and batty rumpshaker Cameron Diaz are the showhorses in this lavish production about the sociopathic goings-on in the crime-ridden slums of Old New York.  It's not the sort of film I'd need to watch twice, but it certainly held my attention more than I would have expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>You'll need a strong stomach for this one.  No doubt there was a deep seated prejudice against the Irish immigrants in the 19th century, there was crime in New York, anti-Lincoln feeling, and race riots occurred there also.  But this movie made one think that there was nothing but hate, poverty and riots in Manhattan.  Don't believe it!<br /><br />It is hard to know what the movie was trying to say.  Was it a social statement or a Hamlet-like tale about revenge.  Everyone was shown as corrupt including the Mayor and his people, the leaders of the gangs, the police and the armed forces, the outstanding newspaper publisher in the City and the protagonist and his love interest.  How did the City ever get to the 20th century?<br /><br />The movie had little focus, lots of violence, mostly unnecessary violence, and there was no one worth one's admiration, sympathy or pity.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Gangs of New York" will sit amongst "Donnie Brasco" and "Casino" in the modern male film library, in the not-quite-great category. There are great things in this movie," enough for some wishful critics to declare it one of the best films of the year. But the it's either too long or too short, depending on how you look at it; it's the kind of film, quite frankly, that should have been two films. As it is, the movie is 2 1/2 hours and it still feels painfully rushed. You can sense director Martin Scorsese wanting to linger, but feeling the pressure to keep his oversized story on the move. It just isn't quite the work the master's fully capable of -- it could be, in fact, one of his most uneven directions ever.<p>There is one incredible thing in the movie, and that is Daniel Day-Lewis, who swallows whole the character of Bill The Butcher, the criminal boss who runs the Five Points neighborhood in 1861 New York. Day-Lewis is a beast; he could stalk DeNiro's shadow any day of the week. Bill is a brilliant, emotionally ravaged monster -- a Jack the Ripper type, really -- with only his sense of honor and his enjoyment of power to stave off his enraged impulses; his moods are held together by the thinnest of threads. <p>Not so good is Leonardo DiCaprio, who simply lacks the toughs for a role like this. He looks like a model posing as a middle-of-the-century meany; on certain occasions, he rises to imbue his Amsterdam with shades of greatness, but not enough. You just can't buy the kid as a reasonable adversary to Bill. I'm not sure what young actor might have succeeded -- Colin Farrell, maybe? -- but DiCaprio is too much a movie star to ball up his fists convincingly. <p>Cameron Diaz, similarly, is miscast. Nope, not her in this movie, as a young pickpocket who must choose to stay loyal to Bill or love Amsterdam. Not enough fire. Diaz, at best, is emotionally unstable, a la "Vanilla Sky." But gritty? Huh uh. Too much "prim" in her "prim-lookin star gazer."<p>Scorsese tears the movie in too many directions. The final battle sequence is incredible, but a lot of viewers aren't really going to understand it. Scorsese never paints the broad strokes of a new America honing in on Five Points very well; a lot of people I saw the movie with thought the ending was a mistake. Actually, it's rather well-conceived thematically -- the government using the guns the gangs swore to keep at home -- and the images are outstanding, but its connections to the larger scope of the film remains on the page. Here we were, screwin around with all this gang nonsense, when all that was going on outside the Five Points? The ending is cool, but it feels like an intrusion we didn't want.<p>You see my point for two movies. The first, obviously would have ended with the first battle for the Five Points, which could have freed up the second movie to focus more on the growing America. As it is, jamming it all into one film, with some jarring edits, makes for an incomplete film experience; I fear "Gangs of New York" was slightly doomed in conception. it's a testament to the talent of the parties involved, especially Day-Lewis, that the movie nonetheless feels spectacular in parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>"Gangs of New York" is one of those periodic films that grabs a lot of Oscar nominations and comes away with no statuettes.  "Peyton Place" was the reigning champ in this dubious category but Scorcese's film gave them a run for the money.  After watching it the other night, I came to understand why this happened; The movie opens strong and closes nearly as strong while the interminable bulk of the movie meanders in a repetitious drone.  If Scorcese had a point, he should have made it.  I took time out for supper without a second thought.  Leftovers were better than what needn't have been served in the first place.<br /><br />When I say that the film opened strong I guess I'd better qualify my statement.  The build-up to a gang war with no quarter was a bit overdone but at least it gave the viewer a sense that this was going to be one of those action movies that can succeed without the extranvagance of a plot.  That's the problem; without the action we are left with a rather ridiculous cast of characters.  I understand that this is based on real Gotham history and I was focussed on the subtleties leading up the the New York Draft Riots.  However, that singularly important event was forced to play a duet with a lesser talent.  The resulting Armaggedon left me wondering if there was anything left in New York City that was worth salvaging.  I read complaints about the lack of a "Director's Cut" that would have added an hour or so to this lengthy Leviathan.  This was not a case of too much left out but, rather, too much shoved in.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Gangs of New York is an epic crime story about the son of Priest Vallon, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), who looses his father in a street brawl.  Amsterdam returns to his neighborhood, the Five Points, in the year 1863 during the peak of the Civil War when masses from Europe are immigrating into the US.  Amsterdam is seeking revenge on the killer of his father, William &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting, however, he is approaching cautiously.  Despite Amsterdam's lack of interest in political issues, he is drawn into them anyway through his fathers murderer who is highly engaged in such issues.  Gangs of New York offers a brilliant cinematic experience through the supreme mise-en-scene, the exceptional cast who performs very well together, and the complex story telling that will engage the mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie a lot, even recognizing some of its big flaws.<p>The best part is Daniel Day-Lewis.

He's one of the best actors that EVER lived.<p>The rest of the cast is also good, but simply does not have much material to work with. Cameron Diaz's character is lost in the middle. DiCaprio did his best, but, once again, the writers did not offer to him a good script.<p>Also great are the scenarios and the historic background. I mean, it's just a background, don'pt expect a history lesson here. It's like TITANIC, foe example, where Cameron used a hystorical background to tell a love story. Here, Scorcese used history to talk about the old cliche of revenge, the diffrence being that he got enthusiasthic about his movie and really tried to pass a message.<p>Good movie, it could have been better, but, I'm not a director, just a consumer!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I found little meaning in this movie.

It is about Leonardo Dicaprio as the son of Liam Neeson, who confronts Daniel Day Lewis and his gang in a turf war but is slain before his five-year-old eyes. All very Shakespearean, with revenge as the prime motivator throughout. Besides Bill "the Butcher" Cutting and his gang, there are the many other gangs, the criminals, the thieves and stealers, as well as the remnants of the Irish gang Dead Rabbits, with ghouls like Hellcat Maggie and all the rest of the filth and scum that make their living in the wickedest den of scum and villainy. People living sad, fearful lives where even the sex is frightening and traumatic. There are parallels and betrayals and regret and valour, but mostly there is a fearful loss of life, with no honour. What a crazy world. Is it still like this? The most interesting point is when the film ends with the fearsome New York Draft Riots of that year, showing a time when anti-draft sentiment was whipped up and the mobs marched on the house of the mayor, destroying everything, when they looted and raped and lynched, and when they fought against the cannons that the military had to fire on more than just the four dead in Ohio.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Yes, hard to believe that I've managed to miss "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull", but "Gangs of New York" is truly my first foray into the films of Martin Scorsese. If this is any indication of what goes on in them, it may just be my last.<p>I had only just "heard" about this movie, and that it had something to do with 19-century New York when Marion asked me if I wanted to see it. As an amateur historian of NYC, I had no problem with that! First word that comes to mind after having seen it? Violent. Second? Disgusting. It only gets worse after that. <p>Once upon a time in New York, the Irish were trash living in a filthy and dangerous section known as the Five Points. Irish gangs battled Nativist know-nothing gangs in riotous situations.  While it is true that 19-century Five Points was a hotbed of crime and debauchery, I seriously doubt whether Boss Tweed would kowtow to anyone like Daniel Day-Lewis, the de facto king of Five Points. DD-L is indeed the best part of the movie, sounding oddly enough like an imitation of Robert De Niro. Yet, much though his performance is a tour de force, I cannot truly recommend this movie to anyone, because of the excessive violence depicted in telling the story. For instance, when DD-L becomes angry with Leonardo DiCaprio for doublecrossing him, he proceeds to stab him, brand him with a white-hot knife blade, and fairly beat him to death with his own forehead! And this wasn't even the climax of the movie. <p>For me, this was just a question of endurance as to whether I really would be able to stay to the end. Gentle Marion had long ago buried her face in her hands to block out the images on screen. Concluded with an incongruous and ugly rock music score over the end credits. <p>Bottom line? Vicious, overly violent movie, not much fun at alll.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>GANGS OF NEW YORK, directed by Martin Scorsese, is perhaps a caricature of the time and place it ostensibly portrays.<p>The film begins in 1846 when "Priest" Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads poor, Irish, immigrant brawlers from the most wretched of New York City's slums into the street confluence known as Five Points to confront a mob of native-born, New York thugs led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). In the resulting spasm of jingoistic violence, Bill kills Vallon while the latter's young son looks on, and the immigrants are soundly defeated. In the blink of a cinematic eye, the young Vallon then spends 16 years in a city orphanage before emerging in 1863 to take the name of "Amsterdam". At this point in history, the U.S. is convulsed by the Civil War, the Irish are still the main immigrant group flooding into NYC, and the Butcher remains the strongman leading the virulently nationalistic (i.e., anti-Catholic and anti-Irish) confederation of urban gangs. Now played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Amsterdam insinuates himself into Bill's service hoping for the opportunity to avenge the death of his father. <p>DiCaprio is presumably the lead in this visually arresting period piece, but his stiff performance is completely upstaged by Day-Lewis playing the vicious, charismatic, curiously rakish Bill the Butcher, who kills his victims with knives and cleavers. Daniel is the best - and perhaps only - reason to see GANGS OF NEW YORK. Cameron Diaz adds little as Jenny, Bill's moll who catches Amsterdam's eye.<p>For me, the most interesting aspect of the movie was the insertion into the plot of the New York City Draft Riot, those 3 days in July 1863 when perhaps 50,000 rioters, mostly Irish, protested Abraham Lincoln's conscription of men into the Union Army by burning and looting buildings, and attacking and killing Black residents. Perhaps 100 citizens died (although the film implies a more extensive massacre). Units of the army, fresh from their victory at Gettysburg, had to be brought in to quell the violence. By the film's conclusion, the confrontation between the Irish gangs and those led by the Butcher is submerged in the larger conflict. Indeed, were I to try and hypothesize the point of this epic, it would be that the tantrums of the federal government render inconsequential the squabbles of lesser mortals. Beyond that, GANGS OF NEW YORK seemed totally pointless except as a lengthy exercise in period costuming and blood-drenched violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>You know how every year, there are usually a few best picture nominees that are completely forgotten and when you look back on them you wonder why they were even nominated in the first place. Well, Gangs of New York is one such picture. I have yet to see The Hours or The Pianist (heard nothing but great things about the latter), but so far, I've been quite disappointed by the crop of 2002 best picture nominees. <p>The plot to Gangs is really quite simple. Leondardo Dicaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, whose father was murdered in a gang war by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) for control of the Five Points in lower Manhattan. Vallon, as a young man, returns to avenge his father's death, but becomes conflicted when Bill takes him under his care. There's also a lazily inserted love story that's purely on auto-pilot.<p>Gangs of New York is a film that's hard to categorize. Primarily, I'd say it's a drama, but a drama about what? The titular gangs are hardly given much depth or development, a surprise coming from director Martin Scorcese, the man who gave us Goodfellas. Almost as damning is the fact that Vallon's burning desire for revenge is hardly touched on (yup, after the prologue, we skip several years later). Instead, the movie often gives way to Dicaprio's love story with Cameron Diaz, and the two share the flattest romantic chemistry I've seen in recent years. Any scene just featuring these two is a pain to watch.<p>The opening battle sequence, while sufficiently brutal and violent, is a mess of a scene, looking more like a setpiece suitable for MTV than an epic drama. I'm talking about headache-inducing quick cuts, herky-jerky slow motion, cheesy wide angle shots, and extreme close-ups. Almost all the power of the scene is sucked out by Scorcese's odd directing choices. <p>Keeping the movie afloat and semi-watchable are Day-Lewis' performance as Bill and the production design. At least the film captures the look of the time period, if not necessarily the feel (in all honestly, I'm not sure what the &quot;feel&quot; would be like, given that I've never actually seen a movie about gangs of new york set in the 1860's). Day-Lewis is fine in his role, shining comfortably while most everyone else tends to slink into the background.<p>Scorcese hasn't done much worth mentioning lately, his last solid film being Casino, which was a virtual remake of his best work, Goodfellas. Running at nearly three hours, Gangs of New York feels even longer than it is, probably the harshest criticism I could give to a so-called epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>It might take eons to review a debacle like this one.The period leading up to the NYC draft riots is not well known; suffice to say that the British-Irish tensions throughout the country running rampant is obviously depicted well in this film. But, where is the Chinese-British hatred, mentioned in passing? Better yet, what of the Irish- black confrontations? Secondly, the riot involving the 'priest and the'butcher' could easily have been used to conclude this abomination with the Irish forces victorious. That would have excluded DiCaprio and Diaz and allowed these bumbling, mercurial lovers to take a well needed vacation,helping Timmy and Lassie with their farm chores. Next, we have a cast of characters, too numerous to mention, all flying around the screen, distracting the viewer, a possible prelude to "Ocean's 13" 145 years in advance.On we go! Has anyone ever seen a slower paced film with rioting as a main focus? 167 minutes of film time that was originally scheduled for 239 minutes! This isn't cricket, old man! Summing up, if this movie really did receive as many award nominations as claimed, then I've been beamed into a parallel universe by James T. Kirk,fooling around on his control panel, in a stunt dreamed up by Allen Funt and Durwood Kirby.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>Before I begin my review, I would like to say congratulations Martin Scorcese for adding yet another great film to your long career. This is the kind of film that doesn't hold anything back; the violence, the lifestyles these characters live, and like always Mr. Scorsese leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. What I mean by "bad taste" is the sinful images that this films evokes. The killing, the prostitution, the revenge are all sinful things.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />The film starts in 1846 and ends in 1863 with the draft riots. The setting is New York's five points, the most violent part of the world at the time. The story is risen out of the conflicts between the whit Anglo-Saxon "natives" and the Irish immigrants coming into the five points. One boy needs to avenge the death of his father.<br /><br />THE ACTORS<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest natural actors that I've seen since Michael Keaton. Natural acting is getting into character but at the same time still being yourself; in other words you're infusing your own personality with the character your assigned to portray in the film.<br /><br />Gary Cooper was a natural and so was Spencer Tracy. Leo's performance in this film is far better than "Titanic." In "Gangs of New York" Leo shows an unending rage that the audience has never seen before, in "Titanic" he's just a pretty boy. One of the problems with Leo's performance is that his accent comes and goes through out the film, just as Mel Gibson's accent did during "Braveheart." Mel wasn't nominated for best actor in "Braveheart" so I don't think Leo will get nominated for this movie for some of the same reasons, one being accent authenticity. However, I will expect a nomination for him in `Catch Me If You Can.'<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's gives his best performance since "My Left Foot." Daniel has always shown the dark of every character that he's played and he incorporates some kindness and humanity as well in his performances.<br /><br />I expect an Oscar win for Daniel but Dennis Quaid presents immense competition in his performance in "Far From Heaven.' Cameron Diaz has been giving terrible performances since "Any Given Sunday" but with "Gangs Of New York" she's proved her dramatic ability is still intact and is once again one of my favorite dramatic actresses.<br /><br />THE PROBLEMS<br /><br />One of the problems with this film is the first battle scene. Every time Daniel Day-Lewis knifed someone there was no blood present. That's when I understood what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said, "Scorsese didn't put all of his heart into this film." I now know what he's talking about because you can tell Martin was not into this story because of his directing. Usually Scorsese tells the story and keeps the audience interested with his directing. His directing carries all of his films, but in this film he lets the actors carry the film and not his directing. That's not Scorcese's style but that is Spielberg's style, Spielberg puts the camera or trails the camera with the actor and just lets them act; no fancy editing and barely any music. Spielberg's directing style is similar to David Lean's style in many ways. Scorsese is a dynamic director. He puts the camera between the actors; he uses music as he manipulates the scene constantly as he goes.... crazy with the camera. Sometimes he adds various types of lighting to his scenes to describe them, and he always uses slow motion via editing and camera work to go from actor to actor. His work is not static. In some films he uses a single tone to bring you into the scene. In "Gangs of New York" he forgot why he's famous in the first place. He forgot why people love him as a director and as an artist. In "Kundun" he changed his style purposely for the film and it was evident because he directs "Kundun" the way David Lean would direct "Kundun" using a similar style, and I expected that. I believe he directed "Kunden" the way he visualized it and the film worked. I felt no emotion when he is directing of "Gangs of New York', because the emotion for the entirety of the film is carried by the actors. I was disappointed this by this movie for those reason I listed. My message to Scorsese is stick to what you know best and what you do best.... better than any other director. Scorsese did remember the fireworks. In every film of Scorsese there are fireworks.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This was an excellent movie about immigrants and how they were treated when they settled in America. It was just about one place in the US which was New York. Ironically, the statue of Liberty is there which reads:<br /><br />"Give me your tired, your poor,<br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,<br />Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,<br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"<br /><br />What the movie was trying to say is that if the immigrants didn't benefit or agree with the "political party in power" they were not really welcome. With this distrust of others and the greed of money, gangs were formed within each group. The plot then thickened because of one leader was killed by another with the survivor being the dead leader's son seeking revenge against his killers. The plot was excellent with excellent cast roles in the story. I highly recommend this movie that wants to see what it was/is really like for "immigrants" coming to the US.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Strangely enough this film about New York at the time of the Civil War is more about the end of the hellish gate to some kind of lawless and wild wild west it is living through than its real depiction. New York was the immigrating harbour and as such had an enormous and constantly changing population. The turn-over as they say today was extremely rapid. It was also a very cosmopilitan city that accepted all nationalities but also all races. But the political and security organizations and institutions were far from up to what it should  have been. In other words, and corruption demultiplied this phenomenon, gangs were everywhere and particularly the good old gang of native Americans, meaning the Americans who had been born in American, in the US, against all the others, the immigrants, the foreigners who come and eat your bread out of your mouth as is well known. Constant fight, constant strife, constant rivalry and daily casualties in a constant violence of every single second, day and night. Killing, hanging, lynching, stabbing, shooting, and so many other variants of these were everyday entertainment and distraction. The film focuses on the Irish as the main opponents of the native American gang. I find the film a little bit complacent as for the picturing and illustrating of this violence, and that pushes other issues a little bit in the background, for instance the rich bourgeoisie of fifth avenue, the merchants and the industrialists. The working class in the sweatshops are not shown either. This is slightly regrettable, because we do not understand then why politicians feel obliged to have some kind of alliance with one gang or the other. They have to choose such an alliance as opposed to the possibility for the working class poor to come together and join forces with the various minorities and fight for their own candidates in the elections. The Civil War provides the best surrounding environment for such a film too because of the anti-draft movement that develops in New York around 1863-64. This anti-draft movement could be the element that might make all the segments of the poor coalesce in one invincible majority. Scorsese shows very well, through the gangs and through  the two leaders of native Americans and the Irish, how a possible alliance could have come out of this situation, but the gang war going on prevents basic interests to prevail in the name of jingoistic community interests. Scorsese seems to be wishing for us to believe that gang violence has always been the way for the establishment in New York to sail through all tempests, storms and other social hurricanes. It is a very pessimistic film that opens no perspective whatsoever. Then what about the acting of the various actors ? It is essentially Leornardo Di Caprio that I observed, following his iron hard and steel cold eyes in the film. He is so static most of the time, and when he is not , when he is moving he seems to be sliding slowly across the room, the street  or the screen without any body language. Even his face seems to be expressionless except for his eyes. He looks like an actor who has risen or been raised in an environment of violence that has left some kind of shock in him, the shock that makes him step back, melt in the wall tapestry and keep out of trouble all the time. Will he ever learn how to use his body to express feelings, action, speed, and so many elements that have to be made visible on the screen because they cannot be described with words ? He has a real problem now his adolescent looks and naivety and charm have gone and he is obliged to move a body and move in it that has become slightly too heavy for him. Having seen what he did in The Departed, I believe he can learn, but he definitely still has a lot to improve. Good luck on the way to San Francisco.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese could easily be his worst epic ever! I could never get into this bloody, violent film. Cameron Diaz looks so out of place in this film and that horrible accent she tries to pull off, jeez she belongs in a romantic comedy! There's no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are gifts to the acting world but even these talented guys can't save this slow, boring train wreck. If you want a great Scorsese film then see Raging Bull.</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>This movie was very interesting &amp; had a outstanding cast. I was a little irritated that they threw a nude scene in the movie though. That's the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Leonardo was awesome in this movie. Liam Nieson also was in th movie for a short period in the begining. This was a great New York Movie!  I RECOMMEND YOU SEE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Other than Daniel Day-Lewis' good performance there is little to recommend this movie. Both Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz are brutally miscast and the story falls apart after the first hour. Good cinematography and Scorcese's vision of Manhattan in the 1800's may be worth a look but ultimately this is a huge disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was a film with huge expectations when the movie hit the screen in december of 2002. The fans of the great director Martin Scorsese were eager to see his latest film in years. Well, finally &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; was in theaters and the movie got a lot of mixed reviews, and I think it's obvious why that happened. You make a movie with a long running time (almost 3 hours), with a plot based in a controversial book, you throw graphic violence and racism, and obviously you will offend a lot of people.<p>Those are the controversial elements in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;, however the movie has a lot of things to talk about. This film has depth in almost every single technical aspect: the sets are beautiful and above all, they are very real. The costumes and makeup are very specific and believable. The music score was made by the always efficient Howard Shore. Most of the performances are excellent, specially Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot;, he created one of the scariest villains in recent years, also he got a lot of acting awards for this role. Liam Neeson is outstanding in a brief, but essential role, he plays Priest Vallon. John C. Reilly as Happy Jack and Jim Broadbent as William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed are also highlights in the cast.<p>Of course, there was a lot of controversy with the selection of Leonardo DiCaprio in the leading role, some might find him too weak and some might find him outstanding, I think that he did a good job in this movie, but this is not one of his best performances. The acting talent of Cameron Diaz had little use in this movie. The direction of Martin Scorsese was very good, because he had a lot of elements and he made a complex movie, not a lot of directors can make a convincing work with such a complicated material.<p>Now, the plot does have highs and lows. The opening scene is one of the most impressive battles in recent years, overall all the battles in the film are excellent. But I think that the movie could have been edited more efficiently, there are a lot of scenes that doesn't add continuity to the plot. The movie lengths almost 3 hours, I think that 130 minutes could have been more effective, but at the end of the day there are more good things in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; than flaws.<p>The DVD features are very interesting (if you liked the movie, of course), the audio commentary by Martin Scorsese is the highlight of the DVD features. The documentaries are very detailed and informative, they offer a lot of different perspectives. The Five Points study guide and the multi-angle sets are just amazing, almost make you feel like you are in there, so if you liked &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; you are going to love the bonus disc.<p>&quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; may offend a lot of people because the movie tells a story about violence and obviously says that USA history is plagued with violence and racism since the beginning, but the movie also says that a lot of brave people fought to create the USA. So yes, the movie may be controversial but &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot; has too many good things, so rent it first, if you like the movie, this DVD is a must-own. Specially recommendable to fans of Martin Scorsese.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>One thing that can be said about Scorsese is that he has a passion for history.  Some of his most famed movies(Goodfellas, Casino) were based on true stories.  This movie shows all the same, it has the harsh realism that most of his movies, just as graphic and in some ways more so than Goodfellas.  With this movie he goes with the same formula as he did with with Casino.  He tells a story, and he does his best to pull us into the era that the story was in.<p>In this case it is based off Irish Immigrants in the times before and during the Civil war, climaxing with the infamous Draft Riots of NY.  It is based off of a character played by Leanardo DiCaprio, called Amsterdam Vallon.  He witnessed his father die in a brutal gang fight when he was 8, and wants revenge.  He is put away into an orphanage of sorts and when he is released years later immediately begins his plans of revenge.  He decides that his fathers killer, William Cutting, is too dangerous and decides to play at being his friend, but he starts to feel an attachment, and his plans are brought into question.<p>This movie had mixed reviews and it is one of those movies that you will either like or love.  The main problem that a lot of people had with it was it was too long.  Though that is more of a patience level issue than anything to do with unecessary scenes.  There are scenes that could be cut, but they don't really take away from the movie in a whole.  They are similar to scenes in Casino, he was trying to make you feel that you are in civil war era New York and it shows.  They constructed the set in Europe and it has a gritty feeling to it that is lacking in cgi generated cityscapes.<p>This movie has a lot of great points.  First off most of the acting was excellent.  <p>Daniel Day Lewis was amazing as the vicious bigot William Cutting.  He is barely recognizable as he is in other movies, here he is William Cutting(Bill the Butcher).  Based off a real life person of that same era.  He was a member of the know nothings(political group), and may have been a member of anti immigrant gangs.  In this he is part of a group of laborers that form a gang that is patriotic and believe that immigrants of that era are taking away the American Dream.  He defeats the immigrant gangs in the early part of the movie in a bloody battle, and rules the NY underwold from then on with an iron fist.  No one has either the courage or skill to match him.  <p>Cameron Diaz is playing an unusual character for her.  A bitter and streetwise girl named Jenny Everdene.  She's a pickpocket, a house thief, and prostitute.  Diaz looks good as a redhead, she also is believable as a street girl.  Her character is pretty but not gorgeous, tough but not necessarily smart, quick thinker but not a far thinker, good with charming people but short tempered and mean, etc.....<p>Brenden Gleeson plays an interesting role in the character Walter 'Monk' McGinn.  Another character from history they changed slightly for the movie, he wasn't in the time period of this movie, but the character fits.  He is a somewhat noble, but bitter, and a  street fighter, a renowned one.  He carries a club with him that he notches for every man he kills.<p>Jim Broadbent plays the infamous William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed, part of the Tammany Hall political group.  Who genuinely seems to enjoy this role, one of the most corrupt politicians in American History.<p>That wasn't the only good part of the movie.  The costumes and cinematography was excellent.  The story was interesting and moving, I really got to like the characters and was interested in what happened.  The treatment of history was good despite the minor changes they made.  As well as the classically brutal action sequences, gang fights with clubs, axes, swords, etc....<p>The only really bad parts of this movie that I see is the acting job by Leonardo DiCaprio, whom looks the role of some street tough, scowling and looking thuggish even at times of peace.  But just didn't seem like he was into the role, that his mind was elsewhere.  The delivery of his lines just didn't feel real.<p>All in all I give this movie four stars, I would give it five, but the lead character was just too poorly chosen.  Though he looks right, he just takes away from the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did.  I realize that Scorsese takes some historical liberties with the plotline but everything about Tammany Hall was interesting to me.  I know that the director had been thinking about making Gangs for a couple of decades and his long-term planning certainly paid off.  I've seen it twice but both times I rewound to see the first fifteen minutes again as the introduction is absolutely priceless.  There are few better fight scenes that can be found than the one in the beginning of "Gangs of New York" where Lewis and his Natives square off with Neeson and his Dead Rabbits.  It's visually stunning.<br /><br />Personally, I now view Daniel Day-Lewis as being the world's greatest living actor.  For a refined, artistocratic Englishman to put forth such a magnificent, and buyable, performance as a maniacal killer was truly amazing.  Even his accent was perfect.  I can't say enough about his skills and presence.<br /><br />In juxtaposition, while Lewis is outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio manages not to impress.  He is average in this role and really, when considering the talent around him, is actually a disappointment.  To me, the love story between DiCaprio and Diaz was the low point, in an otherwise stupendous, film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Tale of survival and vengeance in the ethnically divided burroughs of 1860s New York where Leonardo DiCaprio seeks to avenge his father's killer and gang chief played by Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />Certainly Scorcese brings out the smell of the tensions of the time, however, the acting and backdrops fail to bring any flavor to the story. The latter are too melodramatic and two-dimensional to bring the movie out of its Hollywood stereotype formula. Daniel Day Lewis plays his role well but the script and character is more archetypical than anything else; the characters psyche and motives aren't well explored. With so much of the film focusing on gangs and strife, one wonders why Cameron Diaz' character is included the story. The movie also has serious historical flaws as to events and the prevailing attitudes of the day.<br /><br />In the end, you feel as if you just watched an average blood-fest movie and not much else.</p></br></body></html>

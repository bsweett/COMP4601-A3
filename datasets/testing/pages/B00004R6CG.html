Vertigo is a film that not many people will get upon first viewing.  In actuality, it took me a second look just to understand what I just saw.<br /><br />The film is filled to the brim with story.  One of the most complex and yet simple stories of all time.  This is a film that you need your undivided attention to realize just how powerful it is, without any outside interference.<br /><br />It's a movie that even the smallest hint of plot would give it away.  The only thing and best thing to describe it is, a former police officer suffering from Vertigo is paid to watch a rich man's wife.<br /><br />Another thing about Vertigo that makes me love this movie is its absolutely gorgeous look.  One of the most beautifully shot movies of all time.<br /><br />It's one of my all time favorite movies, and one of the best EVER, in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />The DVD features, as already discussed her on Amazon, feature a commentary track with the producers and restoration team, and a documentary on the making of Vertigo.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>"Vertigo" is the fulfillment of master director Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant career, a richly colorful tapestry placed on celluloid to the tune of a masterful Bernard Hermann musical score and a probing script by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor containing unending clever psychological twists.<p>James Stewart suffers from vertigo or dizziness from scaling heights after a close scrape with death on a tall San Francisco building left the fellow officer who attempted to rescue him dead, resulting in Stewart's retirement from the force.  Stewart is sought out by former college classmate Tom Helmore, who has become a powerful shipping magnate through marriage, to take on a private sleuthing job.  Stewart at first adamantly refuses, then changes his mind.  Helmore reveals that his wife is under the spell out one Carlotta Valdez, a former San Francisco resident who committed suicide one century earlier.  Despite believing the idea cockeyed, Stewart agrees to undertake the job.<p>The gripping psychological drama finds Kim Novak, in one of her early roles, playing the dual part of Madeleine Elster, the alleged wife of Helmore, and Judy Barton, a San Francisco department store sales clerk who agreed to undertake a role to aid the unscrupulous shipping magnate.  Helmore wants his wife out of the way and devises a ghoulishly clever plan to achieve his objective without suspicion being directed his way.  The discovery by Stewart leads to dramatic results.<p>Stewart is at his best as a sincerely intentioned ex-cop who falls head over heels over a woman he ultimately learns never existed, except in counterfeit form.  Helmore did a perfect job of making the commonly spoken, decidedly middle class Judy Barton into the elegantly dressed and articulate aristocratic socialite Madeleine Elster.  Stewart desperately seeks to make over Barton after meeting her, while she attempts to hang on to her individuality and get him to love her for herself, fearing that he will unlock the mystery surrounding her past. The psychological clashes are stupendous with Stewart and Novak making screen magic.  She loves Stewart while he cannot forget the haunting image of Madeleine Elster.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>James Stewart plays a retired cop who quit because his vertigo caused a co-worker's death. An old school chum hires him to tail his wife. She believes she is a Spanish woman named Carlotta who lived over a hundred years ago and came to a bad end.  She tries to kill herself by jumping into San Francisco Bay, Stewart saves her, and falls in love with her. They try to solve the mystery of her so-called possession by visiting the tiny mission town where Carlotta lived, but there is a shocking accident...<p>James Stewart is wonderful as the obsessed and heartbroken detective.  He is tender, haunted, and desperatly in love with a woman he doesn't reallly know.  Kim Novak is excellent in the dual role of the school chum's classy wife and a very brassy shopgirl. The writing is great:  you really care about the characters.  The soundtrack sets the mood for the film:  suspenseful and shocking.  If you like romance, mystery, and suspense, Vertigo is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.<p>There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters.  Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.<p>Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and the locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career, so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him.  This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance. I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction, because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's "Dallas") also give excellent performances.<p>Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene.  Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.<p>The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.<p>This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.  However, it endures in the opinion of many as one of the best suspense thrillers ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>You know, maybe I shouldn't even do reviews of Alfred Hitchcock movies. I mean, anything might give away the secrets, make it less fun to try to figure out what the heck is going on. But I'll try not to be a spoiler.<br /><br />In the prologue, James Stewart plays John "Scottie" Ferguson, a detective chasing a bad guy across rooftops in San Francisco with a uniformed cop. He slips and is hanging way, way above the street by just a rain gutter. A rain gutter that is bending with his weight. The uniformed cop reaches for him, says, "Give me your hand," but how does he do that when he needs both hands to hang on? The uniformed cop reaches further to try to lift him, and falls to his death below. We don't see how Scottie finally gets rescued, but he's in his artist [female] friend's apartment with a cane next, and they are discussing how he has resigned from the force because he has developed acrophobia, and gets vertigo when he stands on the kitchen step-stool.<br /><br />He gets a call from an old school chum who has married money. Shipbuilding money. Gorgeous office, and gorgeous wife. Only problem is, gorgeous wife (Kim Novak) is haunted by her great-grandmother, and seems to think she is destined to commit suicide like great-grandma did. Old school chum begs Scottie to follow his wife, find out where she goes, what she's doing, all that. Scottie finds out about the great-grandmother, but when he reports this to his old school chum, he finds that OSC already knows about said ancestor, and wants Scottie to follow her to protect her. Sure enough, she goes out to the Presidio and jumps in the Bay. Scottie rescues her. And, inevitably (we ARE talking about Kim Novak at the height of her considerable powers) falls in love with her.<br /><br />No more. I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say that all is not what it seems, which is no surprise of itself when it's a Hitchcock film. One of his better ones, in fact.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Released in 1968, Vertigo has claimed the #61 spot on the AFI Top 100 listing.<br /><br />My first part of this review will be fully spoiler-free, since this is a Hitchcock mystery film. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I'll warn you where to stop reading. If you have seen the film before, and are curious about all of my thoughts, I provide those as well.<br /><br />So, to begin with the spoiler-free part. Vertigo is one of Hitchcock's darker films. James Stewart is a police detective who has to retire because he realizes he has vertigo - a fear of heights. Soon an old college friend of his has a task to keep him busy. The friend's wife has been acting very oddly, and the friend hesitantly mentions that she might be possessed by the spirit of a suicidal relative. Stewart of course scoffs at the idea - but soon he's getting intriguing clues from her behavior. She does in fact seem obsessed with this long-dead relative. She isn't aware of many of the things she's doing.<br /><br />Stewart quickly falls in love with her, and wants to get to the bottom of what's going on.<br /><br />There are only a few characters in play here, and each one is well portrayed. You get a sense of Stewart's intrigue and of the wife's confusion. The locations are great, as you explore the landscapes around San Francisco. You quickly get sucked in, wanting to know what happens next. The twists and turns catch you off guard. So it's definitely a movie I recommend watching - and watching, if at all possible, without knowing what the end will be.<br /><br />The movie is great in terms of male-female roles. Stewart and Novak are both equally strong here, both have characters with depths and histories. In terms of the Bedschel test, though, we fail. There are only two females in the entire story and they never get near each other. They are the two different parts of Stewart's life - his romantic love, and his caring friend.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT - STOP READING<br /><br />I greatly appreciate Vertigo as a well crafted movie, and certainly I like how you never know what is going to happen next. When Novak dies, but clearly the movie has a way to go, you wonder just what is going on.<br /><br />At that point I was rooting for Barbara Bel Geddes to then become the girl in his life. She stood by him the entire time and she was there at the hospital. It was therefore fairly depressing to have her just vanish from the rest of the movie, never to be seen again. Clearly she adored him. He made a mild quip about being available for her early in the movie - and she seemed almost embarrassed by it. It made me wonder just why they had broken up. Had she sensed that he wasn't really in love with her? It certainly seems that she cared for him during the movie period, even going to the extent of painting herself into his obsessive scene in order to catch his attention. It only served to upset him. And then he's off again, chasing ghosts.<br /><br />But not only chasing ghosts - Stewart wants to remake this "new" woman completely in the form of the previous one. At first I thought he knew who she was and was trying to force her to admit it. But no - he was just being obsessive and wanting to squish down the present woman and make her into a doll of the previous one. She even asks him if he'll love her if she looks like his old lover, and he says yes. That's upsetting.<br /><br />And really, when one looks at it, just why did he love the first woman? Novak was pretty. She needed help. That's about all he knew about her. He didn't know her interests or hobbies, or anything else. He just wanted her pretty form near him and a sense that he could help her. And he seemed to fall for her in about two weeks.<br /><br />Finally, with the way the movie ended, his witness that the husband was a murderer just died. I suppose he could try to tell police the story, but how could they believe him, what proof would there be? It would be a hard sell. So now two women were dead and the killer gets away.<br /><br />The male character was flawed and someone I didn't approve of. The female character was a flawed murderer. To me the only good character is the female friend, and she gets abandoned partway through the movie. If she came back and integrated into the ending I would have liked it more. As it was, it felt like a tragedy where nobody is ever really punished, and people just hurt each other. While I appreciate the idea of a tragedy, I greatly prefer those by Shakespeare, like Romeo and Juliet, to this.<br /><br />So I'll give it 4/5 for great cinematography and acting, but minus a star for not being a story I'd enjoy seeing again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Movie buffs take note - Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo has recently been reformatted. This newer formatting is so artistic that it adds a new dimension to your experience. Not having seen the movie for many years, I was astounded at the fresh quality. James Stewart and Kim Novak (a Chicago gal) are mysteriously intriguing right to the last frame.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>This happens to be my favorite Hitchcock film.<br /><br />The DVD is great.  There are interviews and extras galore!<br /><br />This is considered Hitchcock's most personal film.  I think it might have something to do with the fact that almost the entire film is shown solely from Jimmy Stewart's perspective.<br /><br />Scotty has had an accident and discovers he has vertigo.  Almost simultaneously, an old friend calls upon him to follow the Mrs.  Apparently she slips into trances that take her back to another time (and into insanity!).  But complications arise as Scotty realizes his attraction to her has little to do with the job ...<br /><br />This is a movie I watch over and over again.  The funny thing is, I have talked to many others who have the same obsessive reaction to it as well.<br /><br />Give it one viewing, and you will be hooked.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>John Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired cop; he's got a severe case of vertigo and remorse after his friend fell off a building to his death in an attempt to save John. Now, he mopes around the house all day with his admiring friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) in tow, hoping he'll snap out of it. He gets his chance when he is approached by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a man concerned about his wife. It seems Madeleine (Kim Novak) has been going into trances and wandering around town. Gavin wants John to follow her around to gauge the severity of the situation and to determine whether she should be institutionalized. John takes the job reluctantly, and begins to fall for Madeleine in the process. She seems to be channelling a doomed ancestor, and John's fondness for her makes him all the more adamant at finding the cause of the problem instead of sending her away. However, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />This is an interesting role for Stewart, who normally plays a wholesome good ol' boy with a heart of gold. His character here is much more realistic, but since he is the eyes of the viewer, he is still likable. John is an imperfect character, so it is an interesting part to see him play. Stewart's blue eyes photograph really strangely so they create a haunting effect, the way blue eyes looked on the silent screen. Hitchcock most likely used this to his advantage to show the viewer that every character is suspect regardless of how pure they seem.<br /><br />There are many twists in the plot, as is typical of Hitchcock. Not all of them are welcome twists. The subject begins with a psychological and paranormal context, but ends in realism. This descent from one extreme to the next is somewhat disappointing, but it is certainly an interesting ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock made "Vertigo" at the height of his creative power. I first saw it in 1984, during its first release in almost twenty years, and viewed it over a hundred times since. In 1996, James Katz and Robert Harris painstakingly restored it, and although I have some issues with the restoration of the audio tracks (there are some sound cues missing, a couple obvious tape drop-outs from Herrmann's soundtrack), "Vertigo" would've disappeared without the TLC they put into saving it from total deterioration. It is this restoration that is on this DVD.<br />What really makes "Vertigo" stand out is its synthesis of both pure technique and pure emotion. This is a rare combination in any art form, as the technical is often equated with cold, objective detachment, and emotion is equated with sloppiness.<br /><br />Hitchcock was probably more personally involved with the making of "Vertigo" than any other film, and it shows. Beginning with Madeleine Carroll, Hitch obsessively cast cool blondes as his heroines. Following Carroll were Joan Fontaine, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich and Anne Baxter. But it was Grace Kelly whom Hitchcock felt most represented ideal woman. She starred in three of his movies ("Dial 'M' For Murder," "To Catch a Thief" and "Rear Window"). When she married Prince Rainier of Monaco, Hitchcock felt the loss deeply, and tried to recreate Grace in the form of other actresses. He attempted to groom Vera Miles to fill Grace Kelly's shoes (literally, Hitch was a foot fetishist you know), but Miles got pregnant as shooting got underway on "Vertigo". Hitch then brought in Kim Novak from Columbia studios, and found an actress with depth, beauty and empathy far beyond what Grace Kelly ever achieved. It is eerie, watching Jimmy Stewart re-create a love lost, realizing all the while that Hitchcock was attempting to recreate and monumentalize his own unrequited love for Grace Kelly. Strangely, Hitch's molding of Tippi Hedren into Grace's double during the filming of "Marnie" (1964) mirrors Stewart's obsessive attempt to bring Madeleine back from the dead.<br /><br />The acting is stellar across the board: Jimmy Stewart's fear, depression and cold sweat come across as real, not as some "method" acting technique. You sense that he brought out a lot of his own hidden fears, desires and obsessions in fleshing out Scotty Ferguson. The supporting actors, Barbara Bel Geddes as Stewart's plain, practical girlfriend, Tom Helmore as the suave, manipulative Gavin Elster and Konstantin Shayne as Pop Liebl, the bookstore owner with a knack for oral history, are all perfectly cast.<br /><br />But what makes "Vertigo" is more than just acting. To have realized this film, Hitchcock's crew was so in-sync with each another that "Vertigo" is experienced as the singular vision of one mind. Samuel Taylor's screenplay, which was worked out in writing sessions with Hitchcock, is intelligent, yet emotional, and the actors' lines resemble poetry more so than everyday conversation. Yet, the lines are delivered naturally.<br /><br />Saul Bass' iconic whirling abstract titles open up the movie and set its tone. You realize that you are in for a movie unlike any other you've experienced.<br /><br />Robert Burks was Hitchcock's cinematographer, and on no other film, was Hitchcock's visual sensibility so keenly felt. Burks was a DP at Warner's, and his impeccable craftsmanship can be seen in such non-Hitchcock movies as "The Fountainhead" (dir: King Vidor) and "The Spirit of St. Louis" (dir: Billy Wilder). But, it was his work with Hitchcock that his potential was most realized, and "Vertigo" has got to be the most beautifully filmed movie ever seen. The infinite perspectives, the jarring angles and the surreal lighting attest to Burks' visual genius. Working with editor George Tomassini, who cut this film really tight, and Technicolor advisor Richard Mueller, "Vertigo" shows what is possible in color moviemaking. The scene in which Kim Novak is dropping broken flower petals into San Francisco bay with the Golden Gate Bridge receding in the distance, silhouetted before a cerulean blue sky is reminiscent of a Vermeer painting, and just as skillfully executed. The interiors were designed by Henry Bumstead, and are expressions in simple elegance. Bumstead had to design the bell tower for the Mission scene, and its staircase is a visual expression of the vertigo that haunts Scottie.<br /><br />Edith Head was Hitch's favorite costume designer, and Kim Novak's severe yet sensuous gray tailored suit is the most beautiful woman's costume I've ever seen in any movie. Much talk is made about how Head won the Oscar for "Sabrina" when Audrey Hepburn was really wearing a Givenchy gown, but Kim Novak's entrance in that gorgeous emerald evening gown always makes every head turn, and makes Hepburn look like a gawky teenager in a rented formal by comparison.<br /><br />But it is Bernard Herrmann's beautifully Romantic and polytonal score that really completes Hitchcock's artistic vision: It is a haunting and obsessive score, and the ostinato of the swirling strings accentuates the vertiginous feelings Robert Burks' complex camerawork instills in the viewer. In the scene in which Scottie finally has recreated Judy in Madeleine's image, the kissing and caressing that is a prelude to their lovemaking is set to Herrmann's Wagnerian "Scene d'Amour," which runs over five minutes with only a few seconds of dialogue. However, Herrmann's scoring was so integral to the film that the scene never seems like a showcase for the music; instead, one can really understand how Hitchcock was a master of silent film, and how Herrmann composed music that was the perfect counterpart to the action onscreen.<br /><br />It is really astounding when one considers how all these masterful artists' talents are so seamlessly woven together. "Vertigo" is truly larger-than-life and unrepeatable, despite its numerous imitations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>I was always of the opinion that this was Hitchcock's best film and I'm very happy to see that so many other reviewers feel the same way.I'll not ruin things with a detailed description,but I first saw "Vertigo" as a kid and was totally spellbound by it (no pun intended). The film was then out of circulation for years afterwards for reasons that I'm too lazy to look up.In those intervening years,however, I came to realize what I was missing: a really terrific film that seems to captivate all age groups, even the most restless of children and adolescents.Which brings to mind another Hitchcock trait: his films are almost impossible to compare. Granted, "Vertigo" may not stand up as well as "Psycho" as far as multiple viewings are concerned, yet the quality of the photography, the interweaved plots and subplots, the overall dimensions of the story itself, leave the viewer almost completely agog at film's end.The irony, as others have mentioned,that this film never won the acclaim it deserved, may in fact be its highest compliment. What award has the "Mona Lisa" ever won?</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's psychological tingler was not a huge success on release, but understandably has achieved cult status over time. Ambitious, dense and more than slightly twisted, "Vertigo" is both an elaborate puzzler and a meditation on man's basest fears and desires. Though perhaps a trifle old for the part, Stewart brings a barely suppressed desperation to Scotty that resonates, while Novak is ideal in a dual identity role, playing Madonna-like Madeleine, and the garish, earthy Judy, whom Scottie meets later in the saga. Glorious San Francisco locales, and a peerless Bernard Herrmann score complete this winning package from the master of suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>VERTIGO remains one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen.  I still remember my first taste of this film (at least thirteen years ago!).  It's safe to say (without exaggeration) that it changed my life and how I view cinematography.  Yes, I know that is a tall statement to make about this movie, but it's well-merited.  Why?  For starters, Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of the medical condition of vertigo (extreme dizziness onset by perceived or actual drops in height--example:  standing at the top of a tall staircase and glancing down at the ground floor from where you stand) feels like, both, a deep acid trip (complete with spinning imagery and disorientation), as well as a really extreme look at the effect of this condition on Scotty (James Stewart), a retired policeman, hired by an old friend to follow his beautiful wife (Kim Novak) who believes is possessed by the dead soul of a mad woman.  Of course, this woman also has a penchant for ascending to great heights and attempting to jump off of them.  This only adds another twist to Scotty's pursuit of the woman.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock always had a flair for bringing the ironic, gothic and darkly comedic all to the foreground, in his films.  Cinematography was one way he achieved (and manipulated) these emotions in the stories he wove so eloquently, on screeen.  VERTIGO is no exception.  What's more, Kim Novak is a very compelling and beautiful actress who stepped out of her more "cheesecake" roles to play the role of Madeleine, a very deeply disturbed (and perhaps, psychologically pursued?) woman with a secret.  What's more, I love James Stewart, here.  His relationship with Madeleine is conflicted and borders on pseudo-erotic.  Of course, I won't divulge more plot details here.  I just figured dropping that clue would tease and tantalize you enough to want to see this great film for yourself.  I am so glad that it was given the kudos it deserved, with a re-released DVD addition.  Great news!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>1953-1963 is, in my opinion, Hitchcock's most brilliant decade. In that period he directed, amongst other films, "I Confess" (1953),  "Rear Window" (1954), "Vertigo" (1958), "Psycho" (1960) and "The Birds" (1963) any of them deserves to be ranked as "one of the best suspense movies" of all times.<br /><br />"Vertigo" touches many different subjects and Mr. Hitchcock blends them with masterful hand: a detective's story, paranormal experiences, love affair and obsession.<br /><br />From this mixture the Suspense Master extracts a film that keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat.  The story involves a retired police detective that is hired by an old acquaintance to follow his wife, which he suspects is going mad. From this start onwards events start to get complicated, pointing out to such weird issues as possession and compulsion.<br /><br />In a film with very few main characters, three of them give a hallmark performance: James Stewart as Det. Scottie Ferguson, Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster and Barbara Bel Geddes as Marjorie Wood.<br /><br />Stewart's Detective is a strange character in his filmography; he depicts a man troubled first by a vertigo syndrome, then deeply depressed and finally obsessed by a dead person. Not quite the "good and straight fellow" that he usually fleshes.<br /><br />Kim Novak is fascinating in her troubled, mysterious and dubious double impersonation of Madeleine and Judy. She gave the character a definitely sexy and classy touch.<br /><br />Barbara Bel Geddes as the "girl around the corner" in hopeless love with Scottie is just perfect.<br /><br />This is a film to be enjoyed by Hitchcock's fans and any detective or mystery film lover.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock gives you James Stewart as you've never seen him before in a great suspense thriller of tragic love and high rise fright, Kim Novak in two amazing roles that are the loves of James Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece "VERTIGO" in the 4th and final collabaration with Stewart and Hitchcock, San Fransisco acrophobic detective John "Scottie" Fergeson retires from the force and wishes to settle down, until a friend is need of him to follow his sucidial wife,Madiliene whom he ends up saving after she falls in the bay, but this story gets deeper and deeper when Scottie and Madiliene fall in love, but will they live happily ever after......

It is a masterpiece that continues to motivate heated discussion on its many themes, specifically its inferred representation of male dominance, mysogyny and obsession.<p>Freudian notions run rampant in ~Vertigo~: the woman as sexual object and the eternal 'dark continent' that Freud himself, because he couldn't make fit in his theories, abandoned - the female psyche that is...however, these critical interpretations have turned a bit stale over the years. But this is a very complex film, and the fact that it can be interpreted on many levels, studied and analysed endlessly by professionals and academics in various fields, really is a testimony that ~Vertigo~ is in a class by itself.<p>The popular interpretation of the film posits the central protagonist, Scotty, (Jimmy Stewart) as an obsessed misogynist, a pathological stalker, chasing the object of his sexual desire through the streets of San Francisco. He loses the object, Madeline, (Kim Novak) because of her apparent suicide. The poor man then slides into a deep melancholia, (the character doesn't speak for a year) to surface again to discover Madeline's doppelganger on the city street. It is at this point in the film that the reader's sympathies begin the shift. Scotty doesn't act like a victim anymore, and intentionally manipulates the 'new' sexual object into the image of the old one. He goes to extremes - down to what she can wear and her hair color. There is no denying it - the character becomes an oppressive chauvinist, and when his wish for the perfect image of his desire does not eventuate, he inadvertently destroys the object, casting her over the edge of the tower to her death: man as oppressor, woman as victim.<p>After watching the film again, a new thought came to mind: it is possible that the male protagonist is the true victim of manipulation throughout, led by the woman, unconsciously, into the murky world of obsession. When the protagonist discovers that his love and the object of his love has all been a sham, a product of clever manipulation, he simply feels betrayed and retaliates. Scotty is the true victim in the relationship, not the woman. Because of guilt for betraying the man she loves, Madeline destroys herself, which can be seen in the last scene. Perhaps.<p>It is well known that Hitchcock was a autocratic director, instructing his actors, male and female, to move and speak exactly to his specifications, giving the actors no creative room at all. This interestingly manifests in ~Vertigo~ in a variety of ways, symbolically and otherwise.<p>The million dollars spent by Universal to restore this incredible film was well worth the money: Hitchcock's creative and dynamic use of color can now be viewed in its original glory. This is the type of film that will never get old or become cheesy over time. ~Vertigo~ continues to maintain its depth, originality and beauty. And will undoubtedly continue to do so in another fifty years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BSS2M2DPPV4T.html">A3BSS2M2DPPV4T</a><br/><p>Considered by many (including myself) to be Hitchcock's finest film. It's easy enough to appreciate the best of Hitchcock's films and to be jolted by them, but VERTIGO stands alone in its ability to move audiences emotionally. What's remarkable about this deservedly celebrated film, is that considering all its plot twists, VERTIGO definitely works even better after a first viewing. The film's genius is depicting such perversity as merely circumstance-crossed love. In other words, its genius is in revealing the perversity behind accepted "normal" practices. Once the secret's out, (and I ain't gonna spill it, folks!) it's a completely different film, and a better one - No longer a harrowing (albeit hokey) ghost story, it's a profound study of sexual obsession, tied together by the city which best displays the essential acrophobic metaphor. VERTIGO was not particularly successful at the time of its release in 1958; it is now considered one of Hitchcock's greatest films. The voyeuristic impulse behind Hitchcock's style is most immediately evident in the tourist sensibility that pervade his American films - a tourist will keep his careful distance from the grit of the world. Here, The Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Podesta's flowershop, Ernie's restaurant, Coit Tower, Fort Point, etc. make up San Francisco's slick surface through Robert Burks's sharp edged Technicolor. Hitchcock's silent film mastery pays off in the scenes involving Scotty's extended tailing of Madeleine, accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's haunting score. A unique film experience and definitely one of the most fascinating and intricate movies of the last century!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>Vertigo is one of those rare films that runs on atmosphere. This film pushes you into a  a world of murder, lust, lies and a dream like state so real It's as if everything around you disappears and you're in a dream and not watching a flick at all. Stewart is Ferguson a cop who is afraid of heights after he watches his partner fall to his death while they chase a suspect, after this he retires and then is hired to watch over a friends sucidial wife (Novak) who he comforts after she throws herself into San Fransico bay! When the wife dies suddenly Stewart is left heartbroken and finds a new love who reminds him of th egirl he lost. The film pushes into overdrive but in a subdued and calm manner. Vertigo is pure cinema at it's most daunting and magical. Not for a second do you believe anything that is happening on the screen. If someone was to tell you this story over the phone you would probably laugh till you wet your pants-but have you ever had dreams where the same person vists you over and over again or a case of deja-vu, then this film isn't so funny anymore. Hitchcock takes these elements of illusion and throws them at us one after another for the entire film. Stewart is brilliant the drawl in his voice underlies his paranoia perfectly and Novak shines as an uneven object of desire. Novak gives the best performance of her carreer. Vertigo leaves you spun and weak after each viewing because to watch it, a little bit of you has to belive what is going on and you have to just let go and fall into the film's premise and if you are afraid to do so-well then you have the flick Vertigo my friend!</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>The newly restored version of Vertigo is a very impressive accomplishment of time and devotion. It never looked or sounded better. I prefer the Dolby Surround sound on the widescreen tape to the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on the DVD. The Dolby Surround has more ambient effect and the rear channels have more sound emanating from them. However, the VHS picture can not compare to the high quality image of the DVD. This is Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece for sure. Solidly told and acted it manages to intertwine a very intriguing plot with the delicate emotional manipulation of its main characters, which explores the fragile nature of the human psyche.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite filmmaker of all time.  No other director (and uncredited screenwriter with his wife Alma) combines brilliantly constructed and suspenseful plots with exquisite filmaking craftsmanship.  Sometimes doing as many as seven script drafts, combined with production designer sketches, Hitchcock knows what a movie will look like, scene for scene, before he starts filming and rarely deviates from the script during the filming.  And VERTIGO (1958) may be his masterpiece.  One of the most haunting and beautiful love stories in the American cinema, VERTIGO combines Hitchcock's inspired use of San Francisco and other Bay Area locations, Robert Burks' dreamlike color photography, production designer Henry Bumstead's beautiful use of greens and reds and grays, and Bernard Herrmann's elegant classical music score to perfection.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to talk about why VERTIGO is so brilliant without discussing its mystery plot in detail.  So I am going to ask my readers to do something first--see the movie on either DVD or letterboxed VHS tape, then meet back here to discuss the plot.  Maybe you are scared to see the movie; don't be.  Please, everyone, see the movie you have maybe put off seeing for years.  I will then assume that you are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline and want to analyze its incomparably romantic and mysterious elements with me.<br /><br />* * * * * *<br /><br />(CAUTION:  EPIC NON-STOP PLOT SPOILERS FOR THIS ENTIRE REVIEW!!) OK, I am now assuming my readers have now seen Hitchcock's VERTIGO at least once and wish to explore its fabulous mysteries in more depth.  A dark and neurotic James Stewart plays Scottie Ferguson, retired San Francisco police officer because of his vertigo, or fear of heights.  A shipbuilder named Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) hires Scottie to trail his mysterious wife Madeleine (a never-better Kim Novak) all over San Francisco-not because she is necessarily unfaithful, but because she is suicidal and haunted by a great-grandmother (?) who died at age 26, Madeleine's current age.<br /><br />Scottie takes the job and follows Madeleine by car from a downtown florist shop, to the graveyard at Mission Dolores, to an old wooden hotel in the Western Addition, to the Palace of Legion of Honor.  Friends, that is the whole city practically.  He returns back to girl friend Midge Wood's (Barbara Bel Geddes) Russian Hill apartment, then his own nearby place one block east of the crooked part of Lombard Street.  (A VERTIGO driving tour is very popular for movie lovers.  These two could not be seen living together in 1958 because censorship was still in effect, but they spend a lot of lonely time there.)  Scottie and Midge look up Madeleine's family history in an antique book store.<br /><br />The next day, Scottie again follows Madeleine to the Palace of Legion of Honor at the western end of San Francisco, then down to Fort Port at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Robert Harris and James Katz' incomparable restoration of the movie a few years ago makes the whole city seem brand new and a valentine to my childhood in the 1950's.  When Madeleine jumps into San Francisco Bay, Scottie dives in to rescue her.  (Mostly done in a studio because there is no staircase here, but a bunch of rocks and a sheer rock wall.  I have stood where Madeleine stood--no staircase.)  Scottie takes Madeleine back to his apartment at the east base of Russian Hill.  We are about 50 minutes into a 128 minute movie.<br /><br />Madeleine is haunted by a mission with a stable and bell tower.  Bingo, San Juan Batista down the San Francisco Peninsula.  Scottie and Madeleine go there.  In the stable, the two share a kiss and Madeleine says enigmatically, "It wasn't supposed to happen this way." She runs away from Scottie, who chases her up the mission's bell tower,  (The tower was built in a studio.  The real mission has no tower.)  But an accident occurs and Madeleine falls to her death.  Scottie goes into a state of shock as an inquest takes place.  The verdict is "suicide while of unsound mind."  Scottie has now caused the death of two people, including a cop in the opening scene.  There is a haunting shot of Scottie walking around an empty night Union Square in downtown San Francisco, then a vivid color nightmare.  Midge is with Scottie in a hospital to help him recover.  This will be her last scene in the movie.  Long fade-out.<br /><br />Fade-in on a spectacular 180 degree panorama of 1958 San Francisco, the way it looked when I was seven years old on the Peninsula.  Scottie is walking through Union Square in sunny daytime this time and spots a beautiful shop girl working at I. Magnin.  He follows her to the York Hotel, with its beautiful green neon light at night.  The woman is named Judy Barton from Salina, Kansas, and she truly reminds Scottie of the dead Madeleine.  Scottie first met Madeleine at Ernie's Restaurant at the east end of North Beach.  He takes Judy there for dinner, then becomes obsessed with transforming her into Madeleine.  He takes her to Ransohoff's to get the same gray suit that Madeleine wore, then has Judy match Madeleine's hair style.  Stewart bravely does nothing to make Scottie any more likeable.  An obsessed Scottie wants an exact duplicate of his beloved Madeleine.  There is a lovely sunny day scene at the Palace of Fine Arts near the San Francisco Marina with them out walking--I have never seen another movie with so many San Francisco locales used so creatively and dramatically, including dozens of hills for a lead character with vertigo.  Not even BULLITT (1968).<br /><br />Then Hitchcock and writer Samuel Taylor do something shocking-3/4 of the way through the movie, they give away the central mystery plot to just the audience as Judy writes a letter to Scottie, reads it voice-over to us, then throws it away.  Judy really IS Madeleine, or at least a surrogate Madeleine.  Gavin Elster killed his wife Madeleine, then hired Judy to pose as Madeleine, knowing that Scottie had a fear of heights.  It was the real Madeleine who was already dead and thrown by Elster off the bell tower.  But Judy had not counted on falling in love with Scottie.<br /><br />In an incredible kissing scene, Scottie and Judy are on an apartment turntable that goes 720 degrees, with the eerie green glow from the YORK hotel neon sign at night, backed by Herrmann's incomparable music. Both characters get dizzy.  But a beautiful necklace then gives away the secret to Scottie.  He has been deceived, fallen in love with an imposter, and doesn't like it.  The two head down the Peninsula again at night to the San Juan Baptista mission. "I need to go back into the past one more time, Judy.  Then everything will be clear."  Will he throw her off the bell tower, causing a third death?<br /><br />The very enigmatic ending of VERTIGO is open to many interpretations, which may be why Hitchcock discarded a short final optimistic scene that is on the DVD under Bonuses.  Anyway, Scottie and Judy both get to "the scene of the crime", the top of the bell tower.  A nun appears and says, "I heard voices".  Caught off-guard by a figure who may remind her of the ghost of Madeleine, or confused when Scottie calls her "Madeleine" a couple of times by accident, Judy falls backward to her death.  "God have mercy," the nun says.  As the movie ends, Scottie is looking down at the lower tile roof where his beloved Judy has died.<br /><br />Will he join her in death?  I doubt it.  My feeling is that Scottie is now cured of his acrophobia and looking down at the third person he has let die accidentally since the opening scene.  It packs a real wallop, but seems the perfect cryptic ending for one of the most disturbing and romantic love stories of all time. The most unforgettable romances often end in death.  So it is with VERTIGO, one of the great motion pictures of all time.<br /><br />But so much is not in this plot summary of VERTIGO.  There are the towerihg performances by James Stewart and Kim Novak.  He has never seemed so troubled and frightening, and she gives the performance of a lifetime as two different women.  Of course, Edith Head had a fun time creating Madeleine's wardrobe in greens and grays, then giving Judy both her own wardrobe and Madeleine's in the second half.  Though much of the movie was filmed in a studio, production designer Henry Bumstead (still active-MILLION DOLLAR BABY) created dozens of San Francisco interiors on sound stages so that you never know it is not fully on location.  The rear projections as Scottie follows Madeleine all over the city twice are outstanding.<br /><br />But the real glory of this incomparably romantic and enthralling movie for me are Robert Burks' dreamlike mustard-haze photography and Bernard Herrmann's classical score that is played over whole driving scenes with no dialogue.  It is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful and hypnotic scores in movie history.  And Hitchcock does magical things with color--greens in a dress contrast against a hotel neon sign and a blouse.  And a car.  The red in a bathrobe plays off the rear wallpaper at Ernie's.  Madeleine and Judy are both in gray.  I love the mission graveyard and have been there looking for the grave marker.  And the orange in the Golden Gate Bridge parallels a scene in Muir Woods (really Big Basin near San Juan Baptista) with brownish-orange redwoods.  It is a movie of rich colors and richer music.  They cast an unforgettable spell over the viewer.<br /><br />This masterpiece should turn you on to the incomparable cinematic universe of Alfred Hitchcock, which Amazon should help sell to you at discount prices.  Try NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) next to discover how lighthearted he could be, then the American Gothic nightmare PSYCHO (1960) for pure terror and scares, and the carefully plotted and suspenseful Hitchcock favorite SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943).  Happy viewing!</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>Scotty (James Stewart) is a retired policeman with a big handicap, vertigo. He simply cannot stand heights, something that he didn't know until the moment when he was unable to help a fellow officer in danger. His vertigo paralyzed him, and as a result the other policeman died. Traumatized, he retired and decided to take up a job as a detective.<br /><br />His first task in his new job is following the rich wife of an old acquaintance, Madeline (Kim Novak). Madeline is a beautiful and very rich woman, who supposedly has suicidal tendencies that trouble his husband. The problem is that after some time Scottie starts to fall in love with the enigmatic Madeline. Strangely enough, the same thing seems to happen to her when they meet. But will both live long enough to enjoy their love, or is someone bent on a dark scheme that will inevitably end in death?. What does Scotty's vertigo has to do with those plans?. How far do lies go in this whole story ?. And when does love turn into obsession?.<br /><br />The answer to all these questions, and many more, can be found in this 1958 Hitchcock's classic. Someone told me that some films are called classics for a good reason. I think "Vertigo" is one of them. If you haven't seen it, please do. I think you won't regret doing that, and that you will pleasantly surprised by all the twists in this strange plot. Strongly recommended!!!.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Although Alfred Hitchcock is universally acclaimed as a film director and something like 70 or 80 movies were made under his gifted hand, only a few have risen to be considered &quot;cream of the crop&quot;, and &quot;Vertigo&quot; stands alongside &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot; as among the Master's greatest.<p>Vertigo is a very &quot;adult&quot; story, and although there's nothing in the movie that would be inappropriate for children to watch, this movie only &quot;means&quot; something to people who understand things like lust and love and betrayal.  Jimmy Stewart did some of his greatest work for Mr. Hitchcock - particularly in Vertigo and Rear Window, and Kim Novak gives one of the greatest femme fatale performances in cinematic history, even though Vera Miles was Hitch's first choice for the role.<p>To preserve the value of his estate for his heirs Hitchcock removed 5 of his movies from circulation and the first time I saw &quot;Vertigo&quot; was in an art-house cinema at it's reissue in the mid-80's.  At the end of that viewing I sat motionless in the theater for several minutes with my heart pounding from the emotional response produced by this film.  I can't think of any other film that stunned me as much as this one.<p>Like many film lovers I have compiled a list of my very favorite movies and my &quot;top five&quot; list is:<p>1. Raiders of the Lost Ark<br />2. Casablanca<br />3. To Kill A Mockingbird<br />4. The Godfather<br />5. Vertigo<p>If you fancy the first four and haven't seen #5 on my list - I recommend it.<p>One word of caution:  The film requires close observation from start to finish.  There are extended sequences that contain no dialogue whatsoever and &quot;following&quot; the story requires that you watch what the characters are doing.<p>The score by Mr. Herrmann is one of his best and fits perfectly.  The costumes, set design, cinematography are all perfect fits for the story.  In addition to being just a doggone fine movie, there were also many innovations that have been copied over and over since.  For example, the famous &quot;vertigo&quot; shot (produced by zooming the lens forward while simultaneously physically moving the camera backwards) was invented for this film.  And think about how many times you have seen THIS shot: the characters are motionless in the center of the frame while the camera circles 360 degrees around them and the surroundings swoosh by - as far as I can tell this technique was first used in this film as well.<p>Another technical note: The movie was perfectly restored more than 2 decades after it's initial release, and the transfer seen on this DVD looks fantastic.<p>I can't recommend this more highly, although this version of the DVD seems to be out of print and the &quot;special edition&quot; DVD is the same transfer.<p>Get this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Like "Pyscho", "Vertigo" is one of those films that when you start to review it, you're immediately at a loss for words. I mean, the filn has only appeared on hundreds of "best-of" lists, been deepyl analyzed by film students across the country, and has been called masterpiece 500x over. So, really what's left to say? Well, I'm a little stuck, but I'm gonna try.<br /><br />When Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" was released in 1958, it was, as most people know, initially a flop. Perhaps it was because of its deep subject matter, it's frank portrayal of sexual obsession, or maybe because it was simply ahead of its time. Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter anymore, as "Vertigo" has stood the test of time to become a defining masterpiece of American cinema.<br /><br />Hitchcock neever worked better behind the camera than he did with this film. Every far shot, closeup, etc. was and is just perfect. The film's plot was definitely somewhat of a sensitive topic, eritten expertly by Alec Coopel & Samuel Taylor. And of course, the performances in this film are superb. As the back cover states, Jimmy Stewart is brilliant as Scotty Ferguson, a San Francisco cop with a deathly fear of heights known as vertigo. And Kim Novak simply smolders in her dual role as Madeline and Judy. Novak deserved an Oscar for her role. Barbara Bel Geedes (who unfortunately left us this past summer) offers strong support as Midge, Scottie's ex. And of course, some of the best scenes ever put on film. The bell tower sequence is up there with the shower scene from "Pyscho", and has been payed homage to millions of time, most notably in Tim Burton's "Batman" (1989).<br /><br />The dvd comes with several extras, including a making off documentary and a beautifully put together booklet. "Vertigo" is a masterpiece that belongs in any dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>Vertigo is one of those films that is so good, no one at the time of release is able to appreciate it. It was dismissed by critics, ignored by audiences and, to my knowledge, didn't win a single Academy Award (this  last part isn't shocking -- Citizen Kane didn't win Best Picture). It's  interesting that the reputation of this film seems to have grown  substantially since the public found out more about Alfred Hitchcock's  private life. For example, Scottie Ferguson's obsession with Kim Novak  mirrors Hitch's own obsession with beautiful blondes, most notably Grace  Kelly. Actors often bare their souls to the world, but very rarely are we  aware when a director bares his/her soul. Those who dismiss Hitchcock as  just a taskmaster director of suspense films should study Vertigo. He is  essentially dealing with his own weaknesses and inner demons on  film.<p>Vertigo also contains two great performances -- those of James  Stewart and Kim Novak. Stewart reveals a dark side that might shock those  who just know him from Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful  Life. He is completely believeable as a man (Hitchcock's alter ego) who is  consumed by obsession. Likewise Kim Novak is wonderful and totally  convincing as Madeline/Judy. Vera Miles (Lila Crane in Psycho) was  originally cast, but it's hard to see anyone else but Kim Novak in the  role. She is utterly convincing as the distant, aristocratic Madeline AND  as the earthy working class girl Judy. I can't think of many actresses who  could be so effective in both roles. Grace Kelly, for example, might have  been able to pull off Madeline, but probably would have been laughable as  Judy. It's too bad more directors couldn't see past Novak's sex kitten  image and cast her in more substantial roles.<p>In case you couldn't guess,  I highly recommend this DVD. The documentary about the restoration of the  film is very interesting and makes you realize what a job it is to restore  a film. The DVD edition also includes an ending that was only on the  foreign release prints. This edition does Hitchcock's masterpiece all the  justice it deserves and then some.<p>(An additional note: I live in the San  Francisco Area and have visited many of the locations featured in the film,  including Madeline's apartment, Muir Woods, Mission Delores, The Palace of  the Legion of Honor and Fort Point. Just to clarify for those of you who  might be wondering: (1) there is no portrait of Carlotta at the Palace of  the Legion of Honor and (2) there are no stairs leading down to the water  at Fort Point -- the stairs were an in-studio shot that enabled James  Stewart to more easily fish Kim Novak out of San Francisco Bay.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>It is unusual to see a director produce his best work after the age of 50, but that is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock did. Starting in 1948 with "Rope" and ending with "The Birds" in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. "Vertigo", in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.<br /><br />It is funny to note that when this film was first released in 1957 that it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.<br /><br />As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.<br /><br />Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever "real" opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart) - if only he could have gotten to Madeleine (Kim Novak) in time, if only he could have rescued the policeman from falling to his death at the beginning of the film, if only he could have seen through the scheme that manipulated him so perfectly and ultimately drove him temporarily mad - but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.<br /><br />Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice.<br /><br />As an aside, this film is so contagious that I am sure that it has influenced other filmmakers over the years to the point of plagiarism, the most obvious example being Tim Burton's 1989 film, "Batman". The Joker dragging Vicki Vale to the top of Gotham cathedral's stairway and the confrontation and revelations of the past once at the top of the tower sure look like the closing 15 minutes of this movie.

Although unfair, irrelevant, and short-sighted, it's an argument one could make about the Master's oeuvre-with the exception of "Vertigo," a film that exceeds the control of its director, a movie that bears the stamp of the auteur yet must be judged a deeply resonant, collaborative triumph by three of the screen's indisputable geniuses: Hitch, Bernard Herrmann, and James Stewart.<br /><br />On my third screening of this film, the story of obsession became my own, producing a reeling sensation that has yet to lift.  Compared to "Vertigo," the other films of the so-called Hitchcock great trilogy--"Rear Window" and "Psycho"--indeed do seem shallow.  Prior to this viewing I had listened to Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde" with its thrilling "liebestod"-the moment when the consummation of passion must also be its end because it is a love of love rather than of a person.  Then I began to reflect back on similar stories-Morte Darthur, Troilus and Cressida, Romeo and Juliet, La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Wuthering Heights, The English Patient.  "Vertigo" belongs to the same narrative pattern, perhaps realizing it more compellingly than any other representation.<br /><br />In the moment when Scottie forces Judy to become Madeleine, Herrmann's score recalls Wagner's liebestod, crescendoing to an unforgettable emotional peak, at once riveting and disturbing.  In the same moment that Madeleine has been exhumed from the dead by the obsessive man-child, we see that Judy's desperate attempt to draw Scottie's attention to the "real" Judy is doomed and that Scottie's fixation is beyond cure.  The lost child that won't release Madeleine/Carlotta, the compulsive boy who can not be "taught" to love by either Judy or Midge, the frustrated and pathetic "mother" Midge--all remain forever disfigured by the fantasy constructed by Stewart's obsessive, stubbornly regressive, character.<br /><br />In the film's last scene, Scottie overcomes his vertigo but not the need to avenge himself on the figure who has betrayed him and his boyish fixation. Here Stewart's voice takes on the same feminine register, breaking and cracking, changing timbre, speaking in irregular, breathless meter, that we see in George Bailey's conflicted moment between strangling and loving Mary before giving up his dream in favor of marriage and the savings and loan.  "Vertigo" is the George Bailey who left Bedford Falls, determined to pursue his magnificent obsession and the elusive grail.  It may not be a wonderful life, but it's a life that haunts the moviegoer's consciousness like no other film I've seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This review is for the DVD version itself.  The restoration and color is beautiful.  Breath-taking.  The wide-screen is almost a full-screen.  It is not as irratating as the DVD version of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.  Of all versions I have seen, this DVD version made me give &quot;Vertigo&quot; a second look.  Colors are important in this restored version because the color of say a door or the clothes that Kim Novak wears explains the psychological state of the character.  One of the bonuses is a fine documentary, originally seen on American Movie Classics cable network, about the films' restoration and includes new interviews with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>There are not enough words in the English language - or any other - that can accurately describe the PERFECT film.  This is one of those pictures that only improves after each viewing.  James Stewart and Kim Novack are  stellar in this true masterpiece of filmdom.  Bernard Herrmann's score  complements the movie immensely and is an integral part of the story.  Only  Alfred Hitchcock, a man who epitomizes the movie-making art could have made  this film.  No one can touch the master, Sir Alfred, and the film is  evidence of that very fact.  To show genius at work, the viewer needs to  check out the backgrounds or the beautifully photographed scenes of San  Francisco and surrounding areas; they are as meticulously done as any of  the works of such painters as Degas or da Vinci.  Hitchcock may not have  invented the motion picture camera, but he certainly understood it!  It's  too bad that the rating only limits me to five stars.  THIS ONE RATES A  10!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Vertigo is a different Hitchcock movie than we have seen before.  Instead of a crime thriller like "Rope" or "Rear Window," Vertigo is a romantic, haunting mystery with a strong supernatural element, along the lines of "Laura." The screenplay was based on a French novel, "D'Entre Les Morts," or "From Among the Dead."  Vertigo is definitely the "chick flick" of Hitchcock's films.  It moves at a slow pace for the first three quarters of the film.  The sweeping shots of San Francisco Bay, the swelling romantic score, the lingering close-ups, and the love triangle would draw most women in and make some men bored for action.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart stars as Scottie, a police detective who has retired on disability.  This disability was caused when a fellow detective fell to his death while trying to rescue Scottie.  Scottie suffers badly from vertigo, a paralyzing fear of heights.  Scottie feels guilty about the man's death, and dreams of it nightly.  Scottie is reluctantly coaxed out of retirement when an old friend begs him to help him follow his wife, who has been acting strangely.  The supernatural element of the film is introduced in chilling fashion as Gavin says to Scottie, "Do you believe that someone out of the past - someone dead - can . . . enter and take possession of a living being?"<br /><br />Gavin's wife, Madeline, is played very well by Kim Novak, who plays a dual role in the film.  Madeline is so beautiful, yet  vulnerable.  Scottie falls in love with her.  Many twists follow, almost all of them gripping and horrifying.  It is a film that deserves multiple viewings.<br /><br />Vertigo was retrieved from the vaults and lovingly restored at the cost of a million dollars.  The widescreen VHS edition has a making of Vertigo documentary at the end that shows clips before and after restoration.  The documentary also contains present-day interviews with Kim Novak and others who worked on the film.  You will gain a greater appreciation of Vertigo after viewing the documentary.  The film restorers did an amazing job.  The widescreen VHS edition is even better than a DVD because it has a unique foldout cover with a limited edition booklet about the movie and it's making.</p></br><a href="../users/A27W5AJNP6YX7Z.html">A27W5AJNP6YX7Z</a><br/><p>So apparently this movie was a miserable failure at the box office and it was only years and years later that it was regarded as one of Hitchcock's greatest films. Why? Because we audiences of today are oh so much more sophisticated than the silly people of back then, who just didn't get it. (Oh, and something about how it was personal to Hitch.) Well, I have to say I disagree. While there are still good movies made today, I sadly have to opine that the art of the film has seriously deteriorated.<br /><br />That said, while I find this movie fascinating, it is not my favorite Hitchcock film. I've seen it a few times and maybe I just need to see it a few more to get all the subtleties. But honestly, it is probably more the subject matter - the poor treatment of women - that kept me from enjoying this film fully. Normally, the excellent acting, intense suspense, intriguing plot, and amazing camera work would be enough to overcome all that. But I don't know. It was just so... disturbing. Jimmy Stewart was always so pleasant, the guy next door. This role was such a departure for him, and he was very convincing. My goodness, what a creep. Making over his new girlfriend to resemble the woman he was in love with! Frankly I thought Kim Novak was more attractive as the second woman, with the darker hair she wore down around her shoulders, and the more colorful clothing. I can sort of understand why she was willing to change for him, because she was already in love with him. But seriously... what if she had stayed with him the first time? Would she have never been able to change for the entire rest of her life?<br /><br />But then, this movie probably intended to make us think and ask questions. In that, it really succeeded.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>So much has been said already about this masterpiece that I won't go into describing the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for that.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />What else can be said about Vertigo (1958), except that's it's a masterpiece in Alfred Hitchcock's collection.  That sums it up.  This classic stars James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes (of "Dallas" fame), Tom Helmore, Henry Jones, Raymond Bailey, and Ellen Corby (of "The Waltons" fame).<br /><br />This movie's setting is in San Francisco.  It's the perfect setting and atmosphere for a movie like this.  The bay, the hills, the streets, etc. make San Francisco ideal for this movie of obsession and mystery.<br /><br />One thing that makes me laugh is the scene in Scottie's dwelling after Scottie rescues "Madeleine" from San Francisco Bay. In this scene, "Madeleine" wakes up and asks where she is, as she doesn't seem to remember what happened (jumping into San Francisco Bay).  Her wet clothes are hanging up in another room, which means that Scottie had to have removed her clothes while she was sleeping.  I think it's funny, even though "Madeleine" does realize at one point that Scottie had to have removed her clothes and she doesn't seem too embarrassed by it.<br /><br />This movie has been restored because it's a classic.  Even though the film still shows signs of wear and tear, the picture quality has been greatly enhanced.  The colors are fantastic.  The sound is great.  I've read reviews where some people are complaining about the music being tinkered with (too loud) and some sound effects being thrown in that were not in the original film, or sound effects being replaced with new sound effects.  This stuff doesn't bother me.  It's still a great film to watch.<br /><br />The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is fantastic and really fits the movie well.  It is one of the great movie scores of all time.  The opening credit sequence is classic.<br /><br />One of the extras on this DVD is about how the film was restored, narrated by Roddy McDowall. It was restored by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz. There is also commentary from associate producer Herbert Coleman, along with comments from Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes.<br /><br />The original game plan for Hitchcock was to make Vera Miles into a star by having her play Madeleine, but she got pregnant and had to cancel out. Kim Novak was her replacement. I don't think either actress would have done better than the other.<br /><br />This movie didn't get great reviews when it was released in 1958. Now it's considered one of the greatest movies ever made. It's funny what time does to the status of a lot of things.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It is considered Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, and he made tons of films.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>With fifty feature-length films to his credit, Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) churned out nearly a film a year for the better part of his adult life. 2008 marks the 50th anniversary of Vertigo, a film of dark dreams, obsession of a type that is more like possession, madness, fear, love and guilt. And no small amount of mystery and intrigue until the final minutes. Set in San Francisco, Jimmy Stewart stars as Scotty, a detective who had to retire from the police force because of a traumatic experience with heights. We know what his vertigo begot in the first minutes of the film, but not in the very last scene. Scotty does his college friend Gavin a favor, which is to tail his wife Madeleine who has been "possessed" by the long-dead Carlotta Valdes. That kindness turns out to be a distinctly bad idea. The scenery, the ominous musical score, the now quaint roles of gender and justice, and Hitchcock's genius for mining the depths of the human psyche all make Vertigo well worth watching fifty years on.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>I wonder if Sir Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a statement that we as moviegoers are voyeurs and are just as fanatically obsessed by the images on the screen as "Scottie" Ferguson is with Madeleine in VERTIGO. VERTIGO is in effect a movie about people who love the cinema and are captivated by it. Those people who do not like VERTIGO state that it is not realistic and too improbable. That is just the point. VERTIGO is about an artificial world and the fascination of that world. Those who like VERTIGO are drawn to it over and over because it is about something that is inside each of us that is ever so fleeting and will always remain unobtainable. Bernard Herrmann, the film's composer seems to have understood the essence of this film as he captured the erotic passion and ultimate hopelessness of its characters with his haunting score. Herrmann had always expressed his desire to be a symphony conductor, yet the lure of the cinema was more than just a means of collecting a paycheck for him. I think he had a great understanding of the cinema and its power over human emotions, yet it seems to have remained an enigma even for him. I have always enjoyed this VHS copy of VERTIGO.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Released in 1958, "Vertigo" was not a box-office hit as the 30-minute documentary "Obssesed With Vertigo" says. The film itself is a masterpiece, right up there with "Psycho," "Rear Window," "To Catch A Thief" and "Rebecca" (a masterful adaptation of the novel by Dame Daphne DuMaurier starring Laurence Olivier [fresh from his double success as Heathcliff in William Wyler's production of "Wuthering Heights" the previous year & his cold and calculating, yet sensitive Mr. Darcy in "Pride & Prejudice" the same year] and Joan Fontaine; please see my review on it). The story needs no rehashing, as the indelible performances of Stewart and Novak speak for themselves, along with Bernard Herrman's haunting score. The DVD also includes 2 trailers, original storyboard designs and a foreign censorship ending, shot by Hitchcock against his better judgment, under pressure from foreign distributors who opted for a more conventional ending. Rated PG for thematic elements.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>There's a lot more going on here than meets the eye; it's perhaps the most self-revealing film Hitchcock ever made. James Stewart plays a forced-to-retire detective (he has a fear of heights) who is hired by an old college chum (played by Tom Helmore) to watch his wife (Kim Novak); he's afraid she's living a life in the past, assuming the life of a woman who committed suicide in 1857 or so, with her own life in danger. Stewart falls in love with her and one night they re-enact a scene from her supposed past in the tower of a church. The twists and turns of the plot lead to a big surprise and a desire by Stewart for Novak to "become" again who she was in the past. (It's convoluted and hard to explain without spoiling the surprises.) It's here where Hitchcock is most autobiographical, and it has to do with Vera Miles who Hitch wanted to star in this movie, but who had married and become pregnant, with the role then going to Novak. Thus he attempted to recreate Novak in the image of Miles, similar to what Stewart does to her in the movie as the characters they play. Regardless of all this, it's a great movie. The story is terrific, with a great climactic ending, and the psychological complications are intriguing. The use of new technology to get that dizzying effect caused by Stewart's vertigo was invented and used for the first time in this movie. Definitely worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Vertigo is one of the most compelling films ever created. Hitchcock is somehow able to create intrigue just by watching. The camera becomes a voyeur following Kim Novak around as we take immediate identification with the James Stewart character.<br /><br />I always feel completely absorbed by this movie no matter how many times I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone - and would place it among my favorite films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>A typical first reaction to this film is disappointment. I, too, was somewhat deflated when, having been introduced to Hitchcock through Psycho and North by Northwest, I saw Vertigo and wondered what the fuss was about. On subsequent viewings, however, the film has become to me the masterpiece I expected it to be in the first place.<p>Its success cannot be pinned down to the plot or the thrills, because purely as a suspense thriller it is only adequate. The dialogue is not breathtaking, and if we expect a taut, credible storyline, we will not be satisfied; but that is hardly the point, for Vertigo's power lies in the emotions it conveys. Hitchcock's colours, Burks's ethereal lensing of San Francisco, Herrmann's score and the fittingly passionate performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak bring vitality to a story that could otherwise have been pedestrian. The more I watch this film the more I allow myself to be swept away in its tide of emotion: The sense of yearning for lost memories; the desire to recreate the past; the frustration of being trapped in time; the mythic quest for beauty. These themes are at the heart of the story, of course, but more than that, they are revealed in the entire ambience Hitch successfully creates: The dreamy settings entrance you and pull you into their spell; The film's key images haunt you long after the film is over. It is hard to describe the power Vertigo contains: It ought simply to be experienced; Let its themes and images and sounds wash over you.<p>When I am drawn back to the film, it is precisely because of that sense of yearning for something lost. I want to let it affect me all over again. I want to relive the experience. Vertigo does not only tell you about this intense human desire to relive the past: It makes you feel it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>This movie works on so many levels, right down to the clever choices of colours for the actors costumes.  Hitchcock created a tour de force showcase for Jimmy Stewart (only Rope ranks has a better performance) and the simply beautiful beyond words Kim Novack.  The pace is mermserising, slowly drawing you deeper and deeper into the complex study of man and fears and his obsessions.<p>Just does not get any better than this!  You might also check out Bell, Book and Candle which teams Stewart and Novak (even more beautiful then) in another charming tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Sir Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a statement that we as moviegoers are voyeurs and are just as fanatically obsessed by the images on the screen as "Scottie" Ferguson is with Madeleine in VERTIGO.

But I would scoff and say "pshaw" go back and watch The Lady Vanishes again, or Shadow of a Doubt.<p>I really had no idea what I was missing.<p>This is a fascinating film.  Not only because of the surprises thrown at you, but also because of the performances.  Jimmy Stewart is cast against type (although he is still the everyman we identify with) as a man obsessed with a woman he fell in love with, and then lost to a bizarre suicide.

It is obvious why he was a favourite of Alfred Hitchcock's. Here he shows not only his usual charm, but also a slightly sinister side, evidence of his great talents as an actor and not just a star. The plot is interesting, and best enjoyed if you don't try to guess ahead. The restored version shows the beautiful colour of the original and particularly the fine costume design. The sound restoration is also worthy of mention. It is handled sensitively by re-creating the sound effects in stereo and adding a clean copy of the Bernard Hermann score to the best versions of the dialogue the restorers could find. It might lack authenticity but it does make the film more enjoyable than some of the worn-out prints we had been used to, which really did not do the film justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Sir Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a statement that we as moviegoers are voyeurs and are just as fanatically obsessed by the images on the screen as "Scottie" Ferguson is with Madeleine in VERTIGO.

The spectral apparition of the lost love reclaimed, like a ghost from the mists of eternity, has an emotional impact like no other scene in the cinema. Tragic, obsessive love is a staple of literature, but not so much one of movies, which after all must have happy endings to keep people buying tickets. Alfred Hitchcock gambled on tragedy with Vertigo, and lost the original bet insofar as ticket sales and critical comment ran in 1958; but he won the ultimate battle with posterity. Like a great novel or epic poem, Vertigo has layer upon layer of meaning and nuance that can be unveiled only by successive viewings. It's redundant now--but still vitally necessary--to praise the powerful performances of James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes; the swirling, hypnotic photography of Robert Burks; the haunting music of Bernard Herrmann, in what must surely be the greatest film score ever composed; and, of course, the genius who brought them all together to make &quot;Vertigo,&quot; my nomination for the greatest film of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This timeless thriller is one I love to watch often on a Sunday afternoon.

It is a piece of film  history not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Vertigo, like many films of the 1950s, is showing its age a bit. The movie conventions of the day -- in which a man follows a strange woman into her hotel room and then strong-arms her into distant buildings -- do seem quite dated (not to say sinister) to modern eyes. Still "Vertigo" retains the creepy charm that Hitchcock intended, and results in a psychological thriller of surprising darkness.<br /><br />Scotty Ferguson is a police detective whose recent near fall from a tall building during a chase gave him an unshakable case of acrophobia and forced his retirement from the force. With plenty of time on his hands, he takes a commission from an old college chum to tail his wife, Madeleine Elster, an attractive blond with an unhealthy interest in a mysterious, long-dead California woman. Unlike her husband, Scotty doesn't believe that the wife is actually possessed by the dead woman's spirit. But he is strangely and increasingly intrigued by her beauty, melancholy and evident suicidal tendencies. After she takes a plunge into San Francisco Bay, the two fall in love, for reasons unclear to me, until tragedy parts them. Scotty, in grief over his lost love, becomes obsessed with her, seeing her in every light-haired woman he meets. Soon, he latches onto red-headed Judy Barton, and can't stop trying to change her, piece by piece, to resemble Madeleine.<br /><br />The premise of romantic obsession is pretty strange, but is quite watchable. Jimmy Stewart handled the role adequately, often seeming unsure of how to express his twisted emotions. I was disappointed that Hitchcock's directorial style left out so much of his characters' emotional development. Perhaps it was acceptable in the '50s for characters to move suddenly from disinterest to obsession, with none of the intermediate stages. But for me it was weird and distracting. Still, I had to admire Kim Novak's range, moving from pathetic to earthy over the course of the film.<br /><br />The neat twist in the middle of the film, coinciding with Stewart's switch from Madeleine to Judy, revived my flagging interest in the movie whose plot line was seemingly set. The abrupt ending did not have the impact it was evidently supposed to have (as indicated by loud and desperate cues from the musical score) but was pleasing enough.<br /><br />"Vertigo"'s biggest misstep was Stewart's silly long-lost love interest, Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. That she and Jimmy were old college sweethearts, and that both were unmarried and still palling around years later was hard to believe. I assume that this otherwise unnecessary plot line was added only to titillate (she drew underwear ads!) and as a red herring to suggest a potential love triangle. The "special effect" -- which attempted to depict Stewart's vertiginous malady -- were almost comically obvious, obviously shot with interlocking, telescoping boxes that represented a stairwell.<br /><br />The DVD extras were limited to a viewing of the censor's lame ending to the movie, plus some short descriptions of the movie's psychological aspects. The colorizing was fairly good, except in very dark scenes (including one in which a character was completely obscured) and when one scene faded into another.<br /><br />All told, "Vertigo" was worthwhile to watch. In fifty years, it has lost a bit of its weird punch, but gained more thanks to a change in American culture and film conventions, but it is still entertaining, creepy and worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Complex themes, a suspense story that seems resolved by the first third of the film, an obsessive love story VERTIGO is all this and more. This is Hitch's most mature statement as a film director and artist and certainly  is one of the ten best films made.<p>Executives at Paramount thought that  Hitchcock was mad when he explained the &quot;suspense&quot; elements of  the plot less than midway through the picture. Most were sure that  audiences would walk out and, indeed, the film didn't do well financially,  but for different reasons. It just so happens that VERTIGO was 40 years  ahead of its time. This was a Hitchcock new to audiences expecting the fun  suspense of STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. The complex narrative, themes and  characters helped develop new standards for American film. <p>VERTIGO,  along with TOUCH OF EVIL, stands out as among the very best of American  cinema in the 20th Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Confession to make: the only Hitchcock film I've seen is Psycho and that's it. Films like Rear Window, Vertigo, the Birds have been endlessly parodied yet I never saw the originals. Well on a renting spree I saw it and thought, well why not. It's certainly one of Hitchcock's more personal and some argue his best although I'd say it's just a good movie period.<br /><br />Scottie, a police officer, had a little accident while chasing a criminal, costing the life of his partner as well as giving him an extreme fear of heights. Now off the police force, he takes smaller jobs. One such request from a man is an odd one: to trail his wife Madeleine not because she might be cheating but she potentially has the spirit of a woman from mid 1800's.<br /><br />It's simple at first but he ends up falling in love with the woman. Only he receives some news: the 1800's woman died at 26, the same age as Madeleine. After Madeleine jumps to her doom(this is no means a spoiler), Scottie is broken and damaged until he sees a woman who looks remarkably similar to Madeleine. His love for her remains so he tries to make this new woman Judy the same as Madeleine. It's love turning into obsession that's not as healthy as you'd think.<br /><br />At 2 hours long, the film at times felt its length. More than once I looked at my DVD timer to see only an hour and so passed. But these would usually be a sign of a good film where you want it to last for awhile cause you're so caught up in it. Frankly Psycho had better pacing.<br /><br />It's funny how Vertigo was known more for the "shot" rather than the film. In at least 4 instances, the middle of the frame seems to sink while the outside grows. Hence the famous "vertigo shot". Steven Spielberg and many others used a technique similar to this. There's also a little freak out near the end with an effect that I always called the slowed down Batman shot. You know the old 60's show where the face would go closer to frame than back with the music going "da na na na na!". Same thing here only more surreal.<br /><br />The actors do their parts extremely well, including Jimmy Stewart who plays a part that you wouldn't see in A Wonderful Life. Kim Novak in a duel role with each part more distinctive than the other so it's not just the same performance in different makeup.<br /><br />The restoration process unfortunately isn't all that great. I noticed a couple of specks and the audio at times had a weird buzziness. But with Hitchcock and the many films he's done, after Psycho and the Birds, try Vertigo.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Do you know how long I've wanted to see Vertigo? For years! Simply because of all the fuss over it. I recently got hold of the restored print DVD and looked forward to seeing the film that is known as Hitchcock's masterpiece.<p>Sitting through the first hour I was confused at what exactly all the fuss was about. The first hour dragged, and nothing significant seemed to happen (other reviewers have also mentioned the slowness of the film). Ten minutes into the second hour, the movie started to pick up. However, I kept waiting for the fantastic storyline to unfold that I had been promised, but it didn't really eventuate. It's not the complex film I was expecting.<p>The problem with Vertigo, as I see it, is that the storyline is quite basic and not overly interesting. The film didn't do well at the box office on its initial release either which is a significant point - moviegoers hated it back then for its slowness. For it to become the classic it has become can only be for the following reasons: Hitchcock loved it over all his other films, Hitchcock is no longer with us, and Kim Novak was in it. it was her only major film. I've never seen the appeal with Jimmy Stewart, and wonder why Hitchcock used him so often. <p>All these things said, Vertigo is one of those films that you will want to see at least once ... to see what all the fuss is about. Sadly, you will still be left wondering &quot;what is all the fuss about?&quot;<br /><br /> DVD SUMMARY: American die-hard fans will want to purchase the Australian DVD which has a widescreen anamorphic presentation.

It surely isn't down to the plot, which is one of the goofiest and most unbelievable ever filmed. Gumshoes are often presented as pretty stupid guys who don't really know what they're doing, but Stewart comes across as just about the dumbest, most naive and amateurish detective who ever lived. You mean he took on this ridiculous assignment, tracking Novak all over the place, without doing any checking on his client, the background to this crazy set-up, or even seeing a photograph of the mentally challenged wife? Where was she anyway all this time? OK, Hitchcock was never strong on convincing stories, and we are told he didn't give a hoot about believability. That isn't what his films were about: apparently what he was doing was playing on the audience's emotions as if he was a kind of Wurlitzer-meister. OK. So it still doesn't explain what the ravers see in this film. Here's a suggestion. This is a woman's picture, and it is devised to explain to women why men don't love them, or why both parties wind up disappointed in each other. Men are in love with some kind of remembered fantasy of the perfect woman, which no real woman can ever be. This fantasy is probably their mother, who is barred to them anyway (except in the case of Oedipus, just like Freud said). Barbara Bel Geddes, who looks like a really nice real person, keeps calling herself Stewart's mother. He can't take this; which is why he's a grey-haired aging bachelor who lives alone. (Actually, he's supposed to be the same age as Bel Geddes). Novak looks like a cream cake, good enough to eat, especially for a small boy. Trouble is, too many cream cakes make you feel sick. Novak knows this, but she has low self-esteem, so she plays along with Stewart's fantasy, hoping it will work out after the marriage. It never does, of course. So is this what the critics recognize as so great about this story? I wouldn't know. The narrative is slow, true, but bearable if you're feeling relaxed. The acting by Stewart and Bel Geddes I thought was good. Novak was playing an amateur actress anyway, so she was OK. Some of the shots were pretty memorable. The dirty double-dealing husband sounded English to me; and that figures, in an American film. Well, I'm still puzzled. No 4 in the hall of fame? I don't get it. Three stars.<br /><br />November 2006. Eureka. Now I begin to get it. This is after watching it several times in an effort to understand why it gets so many votes. And I've also been greatly helped by a discussion on the Imdb website. However, nobody on this site has put forward what seems to me the convincing theory which is at last emerging, based on the many plot holes and flaws in the story, which is otherwise being praised for its beauty, scenery, acting and so forth.<br /><br />It is often said that just before his death a man's entire life flashes before him in his mind. Not that I know how anybody knows this, but it's a persistent folk-belief. Its application here is that what we are seeing is the inside of Jimmy Stewart's mind during the split-seconds between the moment that his police buddy falls to his death, and the moment Stewart himself also crashes to his own death on the street below.<br /><br />One of the nagging flaws in the story, as told, is that we are never shown just how Stewart got rescued from where he was hanging from the rooftop gutter. Was he actually rescued at all? If he was rescued, why is he wearing a corset? Did he break his back from falling? How could he have survived falling from such a height?<br /><br />Second flaw. The whole story is entirely goofy. The murderer's plot is so complicated and insane, it couldn't possibly have been planned with any hope of succeeding --- if it had been real.<br /><br />Third flaw. How did Kim/Carlotta do her disappearing act in the old hotel? Was the little old desk lady in on the trick? Why wasn't this explained?<br /><br />Fourth flaw: Are we seriously being asked to believe that Kim/Carlotta and Kim/the shopgirl in green can't easily be recognized as the same person? And how did Kim/Carlotta come up with all that brilliantly improvised dialogue when playing her part as Carlotta?<br /><br />Fifth flaw. Where did the nun come from? And there are others. Why is the couple sometimes shown driving on the left-hand side of the road? What about that strange backdoor entrance to the flower-shop ? With no way for Stewart to pass the other car? And so on.<br /><br />Finally: why does Stewart make that strange gesture with his arms in the final shot of the film, when he is shown as if from the top of the tower, looking down at Novak's body?<br /><br />The solution would be that that is the moment when he dies, both emotionally and physically, and is lying as a crumpled corpse on the street. The whole sequence of events consists of things that are going through his mind, dredged from his past, as he is clutching at straws but actually falling to his death. The story is a rip-off of Ambrose Bierce's brilliant short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, also made into a brilliant film, where we experience the thoughts of a man about to be hanged. Time and again through the film, Stewart is pleading for a second chance, for survival, for release from his sense of guilt, from his hallucinations and bewilderment. But the answer is that it is too late. He has let his hands slip from the guttering, which has probably broken anyway.<br /><br />As a poet once wrote: We do not die of death, we die of vertigo.<br /><br />But I can't change the stars when I edit my review. I'd add an extra star, if I could, but it's still not 5.  It's a rip-off. See also the Lee Marvin film, Point Blank.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I think that this movie, though interesting, is overrated and has flaws.  I notice that the only time it seems permissible to give Vertigo less than 5 stars is if you are criticizing the DVD quality, not the movie itself.  Well, I will have to break the mold here and give the movie itself only 3 stars because of its flaws.  We have a tendency as a culture to place certain things on pedestals and not look at them critically, and Hitchcock is one of them.  It's like the story of The Emperor's New Clothes.  This movie is good, but it's not worthy of being the icon that people make it out to be.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet (and you are the only one left in the country who hasn't), don't read the rest of this review, because I am about to completely reveal the ending.  It is the biggest flaw in the movie.  It is terrible, not because it is sad, but because it is just plain stupid.  That was my reaction, and it was also the reaction of the person I was seeing it with.  Why?  Because it is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Judy/Madeline gets spooked by the approach of a nun, and jumps to her death.  Idiotic ending.  But it fulfills the old film adage that crime doesn't pay.  Since she had lied to our hero, and since she had been part of a murder plot, it was not permissible for her to end up in a happy marriage.  She had to die because crime doesn't pay, and she had to be punished for her lying and her complicity in a murder.  The rules had to be observed.  Reality be damned.  Reasonableness be damned.  Let her jump to her death the way the murder victim's body was thrown.  What a nice way to tie up loose ends.  Sorry, it's just too damn stupid.<br /><br />Being prepared to overrate Hitchcock, I was surprised early in the movie when Jimmy Stewart's character took a fall from a step ladder and landed oh so conveniently in the arms of his pal.  When you fall from a step ladder like that, you come crashing down, messily, probably backwards.  His fall was so staged, so unrealistic, so neat and clean.  If you have seen it, and if you have any standards of reality, this scene has to offend you for its phoniness.<br /><br />Other than that, I have to commend this movie for being interesting and giving us some good twists and turns.  But to say it is the best picture ever made, or close to it, is an insult to movies that are better.<br /><br />It all reminds me a bit of the overrating of the Hawthorne book Scarlet Letter.  It too has a foolishly unrealistic ending, and it too is overrated.  Hester Prynne, unexplainably, abandons her daughter and grandchild in England in order to return to New England where she was humiliated.  What?  What a load of nonsense.  The ending to this movie is almost as weak.  Hey Charlie, let's have the chick jump from the same place that the body was thrown from, wouldn't that be a hoot.  Yeah, great, nice neat little ending.  Come on.<br /><br />If you love this movie and want to tell me off, don't email me.  Don't do anything.  This is my opinion.  I'm entitled to it, and you are entitled to yours.  It's amazing how Amazon customers can be so opposed to freedom of speech and expression if the opinions expressed differ from their own.  Some people just don't "get" America and what it stands for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This film was on my &quot;must-see&quot; list for years because of its great reputation.  I finally watched after a co-worker raved about it, and I must say that I have never encountered a more overrated film.  It started  very well and I had high hopes for it.  Many scenes were indeed hypnotic  and beautiful, but they just went on too long.  I was still intrigued,  though, and a great ending would have banished my doubts.  The finale,  though, was so abrupt and ludicrous that I laughed out loud...and then my  jaw dropped in disbelief that this was actually the end of the film. <p>At  the time of its release, this film was not warmly received; now it makes  lists of the top ten films of all time.  Go figure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>A lot of people consider this to be one of Hitchcock's best film but I strongly disagree.  It is perhaps the most long winded, boring, and drawn out Hitchcock films I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  The first hour or so is spent with Jimmy Stewart on some wild goose chase following a friend's wife to see if she's possessed by a demon(?!?). For some inexplicable reason, he falls in love with her. Once we reach what we're first to believe is the climax, we learn he's been duped somewhat. As have we.  The last 45 minutes certainly move more fluidly, but Jimmy Stewart's character becomes so obsessive and controlling, he ought to have been served a restraining order.  Also odd are a surrealistic dream sequence that gets so near to a cartoon it reminded me of the "Pink Elephants" sequence in Dumbo, and an ending that redefines the meaning of "abrupt".  But if you're like me, and enjoy Hitchcock films for their pure ability to keep you tense and on the edge of your seat, Vertigo is not the film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Watching the films of Alfred Hitchcock reminds one of the fairy tale of Goldilocks And The Three Bears. Not so much in the actual filmic nature of the art, but in the critical reception accorded the films. As example, some of the films that are labeled masterpieces, like Psycho or The Birds, are just right in their assessment. Other films that are critically neglected are, in fact, among Hitchcock's better films, such as Rope and Frenzy. Then there are the films that are hailed as masterpieces, but which are profound disappointments. If they are not outright bad films, they certainly are only marginally solid films, and achieve their solidity mainly through technical accomplishments. In this category I would place Rear Window and Vertigo.<br />  It's not that Vertigo is an awful film, for technically it's very well made- especially considering that era, but the flaccid and absurd screenplay simply does not hold up a half century on. Add to that the fact that the film is glacially paced, and you have a fairly boring film; one that even Jimmy Stewart's crotchety presence can barely enliven. However, I have long lauded films that do not place plot ahead of character development, so one might ask why am I asking for a better plot and more briskly paced film? Well, simply put, all of the characters are cardboard cutouts, and plot details are easier to resolve than character depth. If one is going to give mere archetypes (and that's being generous, the characters are really more stereotypes than archetypes) then the plot better zing and have a good payoff. This one does not. Part of the problem with the screenplay is the utter dependence for the propulsion of the plot upon the Neolithic psychiatric pseudoscience of the era, which too many of Hitchcock's films are dependent upon, and which leave most of his films in very shallow waters intellectually. This lack of intellectual and emotional depth is part of the reason he is rightly looked down upon when compared to greater masters of film, such as Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Werner Herzog, Ingmar Bergman, or Martin Scorsese.<br />  A film like this points out the fact that Hitchcock not only was not a `deep' director, but could not have been, for by sacrificing what he did best- manipulation, suspense, and twists of plot, all he did was sacrifice what he did best. He had no Bergmanian depths to plumb. Is it really believable that Scotty would become a deaf-mute for a year over his supposed guilt in `Madeline's' suicide? Stewart projects far too much sanity in this role, and as a filmic persona. When Midge is fussing over him he does not look remotely catatonic, merely sleepy. There were plenty of other downright bad moments in the film, of course, such as where Scottie is standing on a chair, looks out Midge's window, and faints gently into her arms. Now, he dwarfs her in size, and falling from several feet, he would not waft into her arms, but thud, and probably hurt both of them. This scene is set up only to show that Midge will always be there for Scottie, despite whatever convolutions their relationship has had. But, we get this from every moment they are together. There are many, many other screenplay moments that fail, and this surprises, for the co-screenwriters, Samuel Taylor and Alec Coppel, based the film upon the novel D'Entre Les Morts, by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, who also wrote the story for Henri-Georges Clouzot's great thriller Diabolique, a tale that Hitchcock tried to get the rights to, but failed. Given Diabolique's greatness one can only assume that the screnwriters, in concert with Hitchcock, ruined what was probably a great story.<br />  If the script and direction is weak, however, the best parts of the film are the score, provided by Bernard Herrmann, and the camera work. The music directs the viewer, but does not lead nor overwhelm, save for the trite and sappy love scenes, which are bad all around. Even better than the film's soundtrack is the cinematography by Hitchcock's long time cinematographer Robert Burks. The palette is lush with reds, greens, and browns, as the shots of the sequoias, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the art museum are gorgeous, making the most of the now outdated Technicolor technology. There is also a brief scene which features Ellen Corby, who would later go on to fame as the crotchety grandmother in the television series The Waltons, that is humorous. For those interested in Hitchcock's cameo, it comes about eleven minutes into the film, in a throwaway shot designed only for the cameo, where we see him crossing a street before we get to the interior of Gavin Elster's office.<br />  Yet, even more so than the implausibilities, bad screenplay, and sexism, that damn the film is the fact that Vertigo is simply dull. Add that to a lead character who is a creep with problems, its love story pathetic, and its `mystery' being rather pallid and given away too soon, and the claim that Vertigo is one of Hitchcock's most overrated films is a good one. At best, it is merely a mediocre film. And, as Goldilocks might claim, that sort of assessment is `just right.'</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Scottie (James Stewart) is a police officer forced to retire due to injuries and his dizzying fear of heights.  His old friend Gavin (Tom Helmore) needs his services, however.  Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) appears to be going crazy.  She wanders around town but has no recollection of the events.  What really worries Gavin is that Madeleine is at the same age her great-grandmother committed suicide by jumping to her death.<br /><br />Scottie eventually agrees to the job, but doesn't put much stalk in the theory that Madeleine is possessed.  At least at first he doesn't.  Is she really possessed?  Can Scottie save her life?<br /><br />And does the audience care?  I've only seen a couple Hitchcock flicks, and I was less then impressed with them.  I decided it was time to change that, and started here.  It did nothing to change my mind.<br /><br />The story starts out okay, just moves very slowly.  I was drawn into the early story wondering what was really happening to Madeleine.  That is, when the plot moved forward.  I mean, we get shot after shot of Scottie following Madeleine around San Francisco.  We get it already!<br /><br />But then the second half comes and things go down hill.  It's obvious to us early on what is happening, so we get bored waiting for the characters to catch up.  Meanwhile, the acting gets so bad that it's actually laughable.  And the climax?  There isn't one.  The story ends with a whimper.<br /><br />I'm beginning to see why I haven't seen that many Hitchcock films before.  If this is an example of what I have to look forward to, I won't be watching many more.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>Kim Novak does fine work here, as usual, but the entire story is way too far-fetched to be believable.<br />Movie is overrated.<br />And that ending?

There is a chase on the rooftops. One man slips and falls to his death. The other survives with a foot injury. [Does he look out his Rear Window?] Acrophobic? Can a cantilevered brassiere be revolutionary? John Ferguson is "available", like other Frisco bachelors. Is his problem curable? [Is there subtle humor here?] San Francisco is changing since the war. [Shipping was moving across the bay.] John is hired to follow another man's wife; there is fear from the dead. Reluctantly, Scotty accepts for an old friend. Scotty's Dodge follows the Jaguar. [The cars date the picture.] Isn't he following too closely?<br /><br />The Mission Dolores is an old historical church. "Carlotta Valdes 1831-1857". Next the Museum. Whose picture is on the wall? Then the McKittrick Hotel. "It does seem silly." Did she drop her tail? Scotty will consult a local expert at a book shop, and learns Frisco history. "Poor thing." Madeleine has jewelry owned by Carlotta Valdes, her great-grandmother. [Would a suicide be buried in a church cemetery?] Next to the Presidio, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Will Madeleine jump into the cold water? What next? Will Goldilocks sleep in Papa Bear's bed? "What happened?" [Note the coffee percolator.] Madeleine leaves, Scotty follows. [Does this film move slowly?] They go for a ride in the country and look at an old redwood tree. There is talk about not knowing the recent past. "How do you know?" Do the conversations make sense?<br /><br />Scotty's old girlfriend Midge is skilled at painting. But Johnny is not impressed. [What does that tell you?] Next they travel to a historic mission church. "There's an answer for everything." [But is it the correct answer?] They climb the stairs to the bell tower. Something falls past the window. There is a coroner's inquest: suicide from an unsound mind. [But now I got a hint to the ending.] "You and I both know who killed Madeleine." Scotty has dreams or nightmares. Does Mozart's music have healing qualities? Is Johnny sedated? After his release he revisits their former places. Does he recognize a woman on the street? Johnny follows her to a hotel. Judy Barton tells her story. She's not in Kansas anymore and has a driver's license to prove it. There is a flashback to what happened at that bell tower? Judy writes a letter and tells the truth. But she decides to stay and dine with Scotty. They visit the Exposition during the day. Scotty is controlling, he wants Judy to dress like Madeleine. Why is he doing this? [Does he have a clue?] Then he notices Judy is wearing that same necklace? Will Scotty break free of the past? What will Judy say or do? [Is there a pattern of deaths in the presence of Scotty?]<br /><br />The "Foreign Censorship Ending" is much better than the short ending since it wraps up the loose ends. Any investigation into Madeleine's recent past would have revealed the plot. The spouse or boyfriend is always the prime suspect in an unusual death; a person who profits from the death doubly so. Once you've seen this you will understand the rationale for the 1984 film "Body Double", a better film which echoes the ideas from this film. Contrast this plodding film to "North by Northwest".</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Watching the films of Alfred Hitchcock reminds one of the fairy tale of Goldilocks And The Three Bears.

It is every bit of that and then some.  It's just that I like some others a little more.  This may be Sir Alfred's most complex and deep movie ever.  Unlike North by Northwest, which came out the year after Vertigo and was very much a fast paced action film without a lot of thinking involved, Vertigo takes place almost exclusively in the characters' minds.  Until you realize that, the movie can seem slow and dull.  Once you see how Jimmy Stewart is manipulated, you understand the horror of Vertigo.<p>Stewart plays Scottie, a former detective who had to quit because he lost a partner in an unfortunate fall from a roof.  Scottie developed a fear of heights from this accident and has vertigo when he climbs even a little ladder.  This renders him almost useless in the field of detective work.<p>A former friend named Gavin, knowing Scottie is out of work, hires him to trail his wife (Kim Novak).  Gavin thinks his wife is crazy, that she believes she is someone who died many years ago.  Scottie reluctantly takes the job and begins following the woman to report to Gavin how she spends her afternoons.  It is strange what she does.<p>What I have done is just set the physical scene.  But believe me, the real story is ahead.  There is tragedy in the movie, along with a complete switch of characters.  Eventually the watcher learns what has happened to the characters in the movie, but the way Stewart is cruelly manipulated throughout is tragic.  I would rather not give away what is really going on.  I would only encourage you to give the film at least two viewings to try to catch the whole story<p>This has been called Hitchcock's most personal film.  It is certainly the most emotional of his work, showing the heartbreak that comes with true love being ripped away in an incredibly cruel manner.  It took me several viewings to really grasp what this movie was about.  I have loved it since.<p>By the way, the top 5 Hitchcock movies in my opinion:<br />1) Notorious<br />2) North by Northwest<br />3) Psycho<br />4) Rear Window<br />5) Strangers on a Train</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I've seen this 1958 film before and was therefore familiar with the plot.  Watching it now, I was again impressed with its complexity and the way that Alfred Hitchcock made sure that the audience understood it.  Knowing the plot, however, added to my enjoyment of the film because I could relax and concentrate on the performances and the skill in which the entire film was put together.<p>Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who's terrified of heights.  It's his Achilles heel and the bad guy in the story takes full advantage of this. Stewart's a fine actor and he's outstanding in this role, which requires him to show weakness and neurosis.  Kim Novak is cast in complex duel role, which calls for a both an icy mystery around her as well as earthy sensuality.  She's a competent actress, but she is so strikingly beautiful that her physical presence overshadows her acting abilities.  Barbara Bel Geddes is cast in a comedic role as a friend of Stewart's who can't hide her attraction for him. It's a small part and she plays it well.<p>It's the story itself and the way that Hitchcock directed it that drives the film and turns it into a masterpiece.  There are the camera angles and the sense of vertigo created by zooming forward and tracking backwards.  There's the use of color and filters to give a dreamlike quality to many of the scenes.  There's scrupulous attention to detail in the choice of costumes and there's hypnotic music throughout.  The DVD explains all this as well as the painstaking job of restoring the original film.  I was intrigued by it all as it added depth to my understanding. <p>I highly recommend Vertigo, especially on DVD.  It hasn't lost any of its original luster.  In fact, it's gotten even better through the years.</p></br><a href="../users/A35AMPDFAB8JLT.html">A35AMPDFAB8JLT</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's "Vertigo" (1958) is about a San Francisco detective, John "Scottie" Ferguson (James Stewart) who has acrophobia (vertigo). He is hired as a private detective, after having retired from police work, by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), in order to follow his delusional wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). Though after a time, it is Scottie who is apparently losing his mind. There is a haunting scene at Muir Woods National Monument, among the coastal redwoods, where Madelaine has slipped away from Scottie. The forest acts here like a metaphor for his decent into a labyrinth of confusion.<br /><br />When Madeleine gets ahead of him at the Mission at San Juan Bautista he realizes his mistake, and chases her up the tower, but he is too late to help as his vertigo prevents him from catching up to her, and he sees her fall from the roof top. Scottie's guilt pesters him from this point on, and he begins to see Madeleine whenever he sees a blond. This is Scottie's hell on earth as his obsession takes over and he circles back to the same moment, again and again. He seems to be losing his mind, and is eventually confined temporarily to a sanitarium. Once Scottie is out of the sanitarium he eventually finds a girl who looks a lot like Madeleine. We wonder if he has lost his mind, and is only seeing what he wants to see.<br /><br />The vertigo that Scottie experiences, which is repeated in various circular motifs throughout the film, from spiral stairways, to the circular form of Madeleine's hair style, seems to be pointing Scottie down a vortex of confusion, as his life gets ever more lost in a madness that he can't seem to control. Hitchcock employs many ingenious devices to convey Scottie's plunge into insanity, from dream sequences, to scenes that spiral about him. In one brilliant scene Scottie and Judy are embracing in a room that spirals about them to reveal them now in a horse stall, and then again in the room, with the background turning to a brilliant, hypnotic blue. It is scenes like this, and the hypnotic pacing, as the film progressively speeds up, that reveal this movie to be the masterpiece that it is. In the last half of the movie we see why Hitchcock is the master of suspense. The film builds to a feverish pitch as Scottie's passion, and obsession, seem to be overriding his reason.<br /><br />As a footnote, this film has been remastered. The original film was badly faded, and has been greatly improved through modern techniques. In October 1996, the restored "Vertigo" premiered for the first time in DTS, and 70mm, which is a format similar in frame size to the VistaVision system that the film was originally shot in. The one caveat though is that Foley's sound effects were totally re-recorded. Harris and Katz sometimes also added extra sounds, and it is said that the new mix puts too much emphasis on the film score by Bernard Hermann over the sound effects.

A man who has been disabled by life, or rather by his profession - he was a cop and saw his partner die by falling from a roof when trying to save him - and his developing a severe case of acrophobia, is hired by a friend of his to watch his wife and find out what she is doing in her afternoons when she gets out and does not seem to remember later in the evening what she has done. The man falls in love with the woman who is of course not the wife but a bait that is supposed to make that man witness her suicide, or rather the husband's wife's murder by the husband himself. But that he cannot know. And that love will survive that event, and even his second phase of disability, this time entirely mental since he feels guilty for having been unable to stop the woman when climbing in the tower of the Mission's church because of his acrophobia. And this love survives so well that he falls again when he sees the woman again in the hotel room where he had seen her when she was baiting him into the drama, though now he does not know it is her, he just thinks she looks like her. And she falls again herself in spite of all her attempts at resisting. And the next phase in the drama is going to lock up these two in total bleakness. But there I stop. You have to find out these superb details all by yourself. The second reason that the film is a masterpiece of global cinema is because it is a thriller that is so well sown up and patched up and glued up that even if you know every detail you will enjoy it just the same: it is a thriller that deserves to be watched a hundred times. The haute cinematographic couture of Hitchcock makes every single viewing more enjoyable than the previous one. Even, I think, you may see in the one hundredth viewing elements you had not seen before because the film, each frame of the film, each image of the film, is loaded with myriads of details that are all more significant than the others. And yet it does not look neither baroque nor rococo. It is just perfect and yet so rich that the perfection takes one hundred viewings to be seen. The third reason why this film is a jewel is that Hitchcock plays on height and stairs and staircases and climbing, and descending or ascending, as he so often, or should I say always, does. Here the stairs are coming naturally since we are in San Francisco and the streets are going up and down, and the houses are perched on slanting slopes, and the embankments have stairs to walk into the Bay, and naturally all buildings, churches, hotels, and whatever have stairs in the front and stairs in the back and stairs inside to go up to the upper floors. And the best is of course the staircase going to the top of the church tower in the Mission, and we will go up that winding staircase twice. And we will fly down that staircase twice in exactly the same way. And the whole film will be dominated by the long apparition of the Golden Gate Bridge, that bridge under which all fish bite into the bait that is thrown at them and are fished out of the foaming water into the burning furnace of the hell of a frying pan. The staircase metaphor is powerful in that film, and so natural, that we just wonder if at that moment Hitchcock has not been able to control his own derangement and we can maybe envisage the fact that he is not completely schizophrenic or psychotic, just psychedelic. The last thing I would like to say on that film is that Hitchcock is also a master of rhythm. He must have been a conductor in some other life of his and his temperament is definitely not perfect. He likes rhythmic variations and he can have scenes that seem so slow that they must last hours and some others that go in a wink of an eyelid. But it is neither haphazard nor unjustified nor in any way disturbing or boring. Every single pace, no matter what, is entirely ingrained in the plot and is part of the beauty of the film and our pleasure. We don't even have the freedom to breathe some when the rhythm is going down because then the dramatic tension goes up and vice versa. The denser the slower and the faster the least intense, but then the two together always give the maximum meaningful signification you can imagine.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock made "Vertigo" at the height of his creative power. I first saw it in 1984, during its first release in almost twenty years, and viewed it over a hundred times since. In 1996, James Katz and Robert Harris painstakingly restored it, and although I have some issues with the restoration of the audio tracks (there are some sound cues missing, a couple obvious tape drop-outs from Herrmann's soundtrack), "Vertigo" would've disappeared without the TLC they put into saving it from total deterioration. It is this restoration that is on this DVD.<br />What really makes "Vertigo" stand out is its synthesis of both pure technique and pure emotion. This is a rare combination in any art form, as the technical is often equated with cold, objective detachment, and emotion is equated with sloppiness.<br /><br />Hitchcock was probably more personally involved with the making of "Vertigo" than any other film, and it shows. Beginning with Madeleine Carroll, Hitch obsessively cast cool blondes as his heroines. Following Carroll were Joan Fontaine, Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich and Anne Baxter. But it was Grace Kelly whom Hitchcock felt most represented ideal woman. She starred in three of his movies ("Dial 'M' For Murder," "To Catch a Thief" and "Rear Window"). When she married Prince Rainier of Monaco, Hitchcock felt the loss deeply, and tried to recreate Grace in the form of other actresses. He attempted to groom Vera Miles to fill Grace Kelly's shoes (literally, Hitch was a foot fetishist you know), but Miles got pregnant as shooting got underway on "Vertigo". Hitch then brought in Kim Novak from Columbia studios, and found an actress with depth, beauty and empathy far beyond what Grace Kelly ever achieved. It is eerie, watching Jimmy Stewart re-create a love lost, realizing all the while that Hitchcock was attempting to recreate and monumentalize his own unrequited love for Grace Kelly. Strangely, Hitch's molding of Tippi Hedren into Grace's double during the filming of "Marnie" (1964) mirrors Stewart's obsessive attempt to bring Madeleine back from the dead.<br /><br />The acting is stellar across the board: Jimmy Stewart's fear, depression and cold sweat come across as real, not as some "method" acting technique. You sense that he brought out a lot of his own hidden fears, desires and obsessions in fleshing out Scotty Ferguson. The supporting actors, Barbara Bel Geddes as Stewart's plain, practical girlfriend, Tom Helmore as the suave, manipulative Gavin Elster and Konstantin Shayne as Pop Liebl, the bookstore owner with a knack for oral history, are all perfectly cast.<br /><br />But what makes "Vertigo" is more than just acting. To have realized this film, Hitchcock's crew was so in-sync with each another that "Vertigo" is experienced as the singular vision of one mind. Samuel Taylor's screenplay, which was worked out in writing sessions with Hitchcock, is intelligent, yet emotional, and the actors' lines resemble poetry more so than everyday conversation. Yet, the lines are delivered naturally.<br /><br />Saul Bass' iconic whirling abstract titles open up the movie and set its tone. You realize that you are in for a movie unlike any other you've experienced.<br /><br />Robert Burks was Hitchcock's cinematographer, and on no other film, was Hitchcock's visual sensibility so keenly felt. Burks was a DP at Warner's, and his impeccable craftsmanship can be seen in such non-Hitchcock movies as "The Fountainhead" (dir: King Vidor) and "The Spirit of St. Louis" (dir: Billy Wilder). But, it was his work with Hitchcock that his potential was most realized, and "Vertigo" has got to be the most beautifully filmed movie ever seen. The infinite perspectives, the jarring angles and the surreal lighting attest to Burks' visual genius. Working with editor George Tomassini, who cut this film really tight, and Technicolor advisor Richard Mueller, "Vertigo" shows what is possible in color moviemaking. The scene in which Kim Novak is dropping broken flower petals into San Francisco bay with the Golden Gate Bridge receding in the distance, silhouetted before a cerulean blue sky is reminiscent of a Vermeer painting, and just as skillfully executed. The interiors were designed by Henry Bumstead, and are expressions in simple elegance. Bumstead had to design the bell tower for the Mission scene, and its staircase is a visual expression of the vertigo that haunts Scottie.<br /><br />Edith Head was Hitch's favorite costume designer, and Kim Novak's severe yet sensuous gray tailored suit is the most beautiful woman's costume I've ever seen in any movie. Much talk is made about how Head won the Oscar for "Sabrina" when Audrey Hepburn was really wearing a Givenchy gown, but Kim Novak's entrance in that gorgeous emerald evening gown always makes every head turn, and makes Hepburn look like a gawky teenager in a rented formal by comparison.<br /><br />But it is Bernard Herrmann's beautifully Romantic and polytonal score that really completes Hitchcock's artistic vision: It is a haunting and obsessive score, and the ostinato of the swirling strings accentuates the vertiginous feelings Robert Burks' complex camerawork instills in the viewer. In the scene in which Scottie finally has recreated Judy in Madeleine's image, the kissing and caressing that is a prelude to their lovemaking is set to Herrmann's Wagnerian "Scene d'Amour," which runs over five minutes with only a few seconds of dialogue. However, Herrmann's scoring was so integral to the film that the scene never seems like a showcase for the music; instead, one can really understand how Hitchcock was a master of silent film, and how Herrmann composed music that was the perfect counterpart to the action onscreen.<br /><br />It is really astounding when one considers how all these masterful artists' talents are so seamlessly woven together. "Vertigo" is truly larger-than-life and unrepeatable, despite its numerous imitations.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>The script has James Stewart deliver this line not once but twice near the end of this once-in-a-lifetime movie.<br /><br />The observation underscores a simultaneous strength and weakness of the movie.  How plausible is it that someone could be so overtaken by a "job" of assuming someone else's identity, for money or love, that they would complete that job with such conviction?  However, the movie's acceptance of that plausibility is itself questioned by Stewart's pleading and accusatory statement.<br /><br />"You did such a good job that you convinced me to love the person you became," he says to her in these lines.<br /><br />But the movie's greatest resonance is that we all do this when we fall in love.  Love's noblest outcome is that the lover strives to become everything her partner comes to desire, and can define no other role for herself than the one she has assumed.  "Why couldn't you learn to love just me instead of the person I imitated to gain your love?"<br /><br />The timeless quality of this film is that, in the coldest and seemingly most hopeless terms, Hitchcock tells us, honestly and simply, that romantic love is mutual deception at best and narcissism at worst.<br /><br />If you don't get scared off the tower by an approaching nun, try jumping off...<br /><br />This sounds really depressing, but underneath that is the film's haunting and puzzling final visual image, Stewart is unafraid to look down, and see reality for what it is.  He is cured of his illusions and, nasty as that shock was, he is now healthy.  Hitch's message is that delusions, even romantic delusions, help nobody, and that honesty is much, much better than overadaptive madness.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This legendary 1958 masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock plays like grand Baroque opera full of exaggerated character motivations and preposterous plot turns, yet it is one of the most consistently involving of his impressive canon of films perhaps because he takes an unsavory subject, sexual obsession, and shapes around it a remarkably perceptive character-driven mystery thriller. Co-written with intricacy by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, the tightly drawn story focuses on John "Scottie" Ferguson, a plainclothes detective who quits the police force after his partner dies during a rooftop chase where Ferguson is debilitated by a severe case of acrophobia. An old college acquaintance, now a shipping tycoon, convinces the now-retired Ferguson to follow his disturbed, potentially suicidal wife Madeleine, and thus begins Ferguson's first obsession.<br /><br />The film twists and turns until her apparent death from a fall from the San Juan Batista mission church steeple. This is where Hitchcock does something quite audacious. Suffering from this unexpected tragedy, the hero of the movie becomes a darker character we are suddenly not sure about. By fate back in San Francisco, Ferguson meets a shopgirl named Judy who bears enough of a physical resemblance to Madeleine for him to stalk her and force her to change her appearance to look like his lost love. At first, it feels rather necrophilic if not downright deranged for Ferguson to act on his obsession of a dead woman, but regardless, a final twist makes the love between Ferguson and Judy impossible to endure. Hitchcock lends a deepening sense of emotionalism to the maddening but addictive spirals of the plot which ultimately makes the film's title even more resonant than the medical condition Ferguson has.<br /><br />Casting is crucial to making the storyline relevant to a viewer much less credible. In a nice change-of-pace, James Stewart makes Ferguson's obsession palpable, and his everyman demeanor takes on a convincing sinister edge, even though his natural affability sneaks through effectively as a counterbalance. In what remains a most underrated performance, Kim Novak manages to play her dual roles with a surprising lack of affectation, from the cool mystique of Madeleine to the desperate eagerness of Judy. Hitchcock uses Novak's natural detachment as an actress to the movie's advantage, as I doubt the more versatile Grace Kelly could have played at least the Judy part as well. Barbara Bel Geddes has precious few scenes in the relatively thankless role of Midge, Ferguson's sometime girlfriend. The San Francisco locations are used to great advantage - the Palace of Fine Arts, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, the now-defunct Ernie's restaurant, the Podesta Baldocchi flower shop, the cemetery at Mission Dolores -  all shot in lustrous detail by Robert Burks. Bernard Herrmann contributes one of his great scores to complement the pacing and atmosphere of the mystery and suspense.<br /><br />The DVD has the splendid 1996 restoration which captures all the visual and aural splendor of the film. It also includes an alternative commentary track that features Novak, restorers Robert Harris and James Katz, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and most interestingly, associate producer Herbert Coleman who is full of anecdotes. Harris and Katz figure prominently in an interesting 1997 half-hour documentary on the original production and restoration process. There have been many knock-offs - including Brian DePalma's derivative 1976 "Obsession", Kenneth Branagh's blackly humorous 1991 "Dead Again" and most recently, Jun Ichikawa's coldly antiseptic 2005 "Tony Takitani" - but this is most definitely the one to experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>`Scotty' Ferguson (James Stewert) quits the force after a rooftop criminal chase goes horribly wrong, carrying over a case of dizziness whenever he finds himself on a height. Rich shipyard owner, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), presses the retiree to undertake a detective job following his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who Gavin believes may be under some kind of supernatural possession and who seems to be a reincarnated version of her grandmother. Following a near death drowning Scotty becomes embroiled in an affair with Mrs. Elster, using several attempts at psychoanalysis to try and find what is at the root of her mysterious illness.<br /><br />Hitchcock's hypnotic tale of suspense and intrigue builds itself around the premise of obsession and compulsive disorders. The director even conjured up a pre-sixties trippy montage sequence. Vertigo is shot rich in color with lots of moving lighting effects even simulating cloud clover over the sun. The choice of filming at a number of popular American landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge gives Vertigo its grandeur along with geographical attraction.<br /><br />The deconstruction of Scotty who goes mad towards the end of the film has a sense of urgency about it as he quickly becomes the `control freak' of all movies. It is an interesting note to see shop models wearing the clothes that people want to buy. The last scene invokes a sense of history repeating itself for those who try to free themselves of the past. Vertigo is classic Hitchcock.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>A brooding, romantic, psychological thriller, Vertigo is considered by many critics today to be Hitchcock's most sublime cinematic masterpiece.  Upon its initial release the film was something of a misfit for audiences who had been weened on more narrative film fare.  But Hitch's highly personal exploration of phobias and obsession continues to enthrall.  James Stewart is a P.I. with a fear of heights who is contracted by an old friend to follow his wife (Kim Novak).  The catch, the whole plot is a sham designed to cover up a real murder.  Both Novak and Stewart give stellar performances.<br />In the 1990's a complete restoration was performed on Vertigo under the meticulous supervision of Robert A. Harris and James Katz. But the DVD doesn't take full advantage of those efforts.  Gone is the DTS stereo track, replaced with a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix instead.  Also, although presented in its original VistaVision aspect ratio (1:85:1) as reprinted onto 70mm film stock, the DVD has not been enhanced for 16X9 televisions - a real bore.  Over all, the picture quality is remarkable.  Colors are rich and textured and flesh tones are accurate.  There are a few minor occasions where shimmering details are noticed but nothing that terribly distracts. Still, Universal needs to go back and remaster this title again, this time with DTS and a new anamorphic transfer.  Since that doesn't seem to be a likely possibility in the near future this disc will have to do for the time being.  As a restoration effort, Vertigo definitely won't disappoint.  The DVD's just a bit of a disappointment, that's all.<p>Included: the AMC documentary, "Obsessed with Vertigo", theatrical trailers and an audio commentary track.  Nicely put together. A true legend deserves no less.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the 50 best movies ever made. I personally know one person who watches it every two months and still discovers in this movie some food for his mind. It's true that VERTIGO has been analyzed in numerous books after the brilliant articles in &quot;The Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma&quot; written by the future heroes of the Nouvelle Vague : Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Fran?ois Truffaut. VERTIGO is one of this movies which directly speaks to your heart if you're a cinephile, like Peter Bogdanovich's THE LAST PICTURE SHOW or John Ford's THE SEARCHERS.<p>Why does this particular movie speak to me more than the others ? For a simple reason, James Stewart is the mirror through which every cinephile can recognize himself. During long moments, Alfred Hitchcock films James Stewart in his car following Kim Novak ; no words are spoken, there is only Bernard Hermann's musical score and the face of James Stewart. At this moment, you are staring with intensity at a man who stares with intensity at a beautiful woman you too would like to stare at with intensity. Then, you enter the movie lover's vertigo, you become James Stewart.<p>No need to say that VERTIGO was the first DVD I've bought and should have a place, in my opinion, in any honest man's library (in the XVIIIth century meaning of the word). English, spanish and french subtitles, a commentary, trailers, the second ending and other goodies. <p>A DVD which is already in your library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is so complex in its intentions and so intricate and fascinating in its scope that it will take multiple viewings to uncover and comprehend the savagely beautifullandscape of Hithcock's  most  poetically vunernable and unberably passionate film. The damaged  heart of Scottie Ferguson portrayed so dramatically and effectvely by James  Stewart, in his most accomplished role, illustrates the damage caused by  romantic obession and the danger inherent in loving a fantasy. This  meticulously crafted Hitchcock masterwork is so unbeleiably vivid in its  emotions and true to its own creative genesis that it remains Hitchcock's  definitive work dealing with love, loss, romance, illusion, and romantic  obsession. A movie watchers must-see. The DVD edition is also quite a  package within itself as gives the viewer abundant Vertigo extras including  an alternate ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>VERTIGO is the most beautiful movie Hitchcock created, with stunningly brilliant cinematography, the magnificent costumes of Edith Head, and an unforgettable score by Bernard Herrimann. It is also perhaps the greatest romantic psycho-thriller of all time.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart as a retired acrophobic cop was never more compelling, or complicated, and Kim Novak as the breathtaking, and coldly sensual Madeleine, and the much less, refined Judy, was positively mesmerizing.<br /><br />The story is about a tragic love affair, murder, and madness. John, ( Stewart ) is so obsessed with his dead lover that he attempts to remake a girl ( Judy ), into his dearly-departed because of the strong physical resemblance she bears to the deceased. Judy has fallen so badly for John that she allows him to totally dictate her life ( Svengali had nothin' on this guy ). The performances of Stewart, and Novak resonate long after the movie ends ( of course, I have seen the film at least forty times... ).<br /><br />I personally found D'ENTRE LES MORTS ( the book VERTIGO is based on ) to be a little hyperbolic for my taste, but Samuel Taylor's screenplay breathed life into the characters.<br /><br />Much has been made about the famous 'dream sequence' in VERTIGO.

Starting in 1948 with "Rope" and ending with "The Birds" in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. "Vertigo", in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.<br /><br />It is funny to note that when this film was first released in 1957 that it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.<br /><br />As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.<br /><br />Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever "real" opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart) - if only he could have gotten to Madeleine (Kim Novak) in time, if only he could have rescued the policeman from falling to his death at the beginning of the film, if only he could have seen through the scheme that manipulated him so perfectly and ultimately drove him temporarily mad - but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.<br /><br />Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice.<br /><br />As an aside, this film is so contagious that I am sure that it has influenced other filmmakers over the years to the point of plagiarism, the most obvious example being Tim Burton's 1989 film, "Batman". The Joker dragging Vicki Vale to the top of Gotham cathedral's stairway and the confrontation and revelations of the past once at the top of the tower sure look like the closing 15 minutes of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>In viewing VERTIGO, one must admit the supreme directorial abilities of Alfred Hitchcock.  Here we have a typical Hitchcock movie, with its long silent following sequences, which were much imitated later by Brian de Palma in BODY DOUBLE and DRESSED TO KILL, particularly.  Hitch, however, mastered this technique and let us feel the hopeless frustration of Scottie Ferguson and the unquestionable mysterious attraction to the perhaps mad Madeleine.  Having seen this classic several times, one can see how gullible Scottie is, and how devious Madeliene has been, but even in multiple viewings, one can't help but wish the two could come together.<br /><br />The performances of the three leads is impeccable.  Remember, up until this time, we've seen James Stewart mostly as a heroic figure, a man of principles and high moral standards.  This time, Jimmy plays a man who becomes totally obsessed with Madeleine, to the point of having an affair with his best friend's wife.  His descent into this obsession and ultimately a nervous breakdown is very disturbing and his final scene in the church tower isn't like anything we've seen Jimmy do.  It's a brilliant performance, and the highlight of his magnificent career.  The beautiful Kim Novak is also in top form as the duplicitous Madeleine/Judy.  It would be easy to toss her performance off as just a pretty face, but in looking at her performance, one can see how she goes from the smooth, silky Madeleine to the earthy, desperate Judy.  Her realization that Scottie is trying to turn her into Madeleine shows her range in the desperation of not wanting to be Madeleine, but needing Scottie.  And let's not overlook the wonders of Barbara Bel Geddes as the hopelessly in love with Scottie Midge.  Miss Bel Geddes takes the sweet girl next door to its supreme limits, and when she realizes she will never have Scottie, her slow walk down the hospital corridor is heartbreaking.  Trivia note:  Miss Bel Geddes played Miss Ellie on DALLAS for years and when her health failed, the role was taken over by fellow Hitchcock femme fatale Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />VERTIGO is a spellbinding, hypnotic and disturbing film, filled with surreal images and an ending that still manages to chill.  One of, if not, the best of Hitchcock's movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>This one is my Number One movie of all time.

I've seen it on the big screen where it's unbelievable, Freudian theme, magnificent color, and the filmed record of San Francisco of 1959 are as eerie as the script of murder and obsessive love. I'm very fond of Kim Novak and I realize big 1950's blondes aren't everyone's turn on, but in this film, with all her wide skirts and painted eyebrows, she does it for me. Hitchcock did scores of interesting shots that added mood to this film. Stewart and Novak realize they are in love and kiss passionately at a rocky California beach. The ocean crashes on a big boulder and sprays behind their heads. Perfect timing or fifty takes, I don't know. After careful thought, the script seems implausible. A man in love knows what the woman of his dreams looks like and certainly would know that the shop girl, though in different hair color and clothes is his love. The story line portrays a straight murder mystery, but after a number of viewings I realize how complicated and layered the individual motivations and neurosis that Stewart and Novak suggest with brilliant subtle underscore. The murder itself makes no sense either. How did the husband and Novak hide and get away from the horrified onlookers and police? The truth is, the fantasy is so compelling, nobody cares. Great art is a suspension of disbelief. Vertigo is great, great art.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>I must admit that reviewing a movie like &quot;Vertigo&quot; is a bit intimidating.  Here is a classic that's been dissected, analyzed, and studied by film gurus everywhere.  What can be said about this film that hasn't been said before?  James Stewart, Kim Novak, and director Hitchcock are all at their career best.  It's startling to know that it was a box-office and critical disappointment upon release in 1958, but over the years, it has apparently since been hailed as a masterpiece.  No argument here.  Even better is the DVD presentation.  The picture is Ginsu-sharp and clear, with vibrant colors.  The guys who did the restoration apparently put a lot of love into the project.  I should also add that, as far as I know, this is the ONLY Hitchcock DVD featuring 5.1 surround sound.  At times, it reveals its age, but it works best during Bernard Hermann's awesome score.  While my favorite Hitchcock movies are &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;Psycho,&quot; this film is a confirmed classic that belongs in every collection.</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>When San Francisco police detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) is forced to step down from his job after beginning to suffer crippling attacks of agraphobic vertigo, a former friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), approaches him with a job.  Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) is delusional, and obsessed with Carlotta, a relative from generations passed, who killed herself in the name of love; and Gavin is afraid that Madeleine has a similar death-wish.  Could Scottie trail Madeleine in an effort to uncover the truth?  Scottie agrees, and finds himself slowly falling for the ghostly blonde.<br /><br />This is Hitchcock's ultimate tale of obsession and fascination.  Hitchcock himself held an often frightening obsession for his leading ladies, and one can't help but feel that perhaps Hitch also explored his own inner turmoils whilst working on VERTIGO.  The story itself was based on "D'Entre Les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; Samuel Taylor (of "Sabrina" fame) and Alec Coppel developed it for the screen.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart reveals a frightening, hitherto-unexplored side of his screen persona in his performance as Scottie.  The final portion of the movie is especially unsettling as Scottie's obsession completely overpowers him.  Costumed in a gray silk suit and washed-out blonde hair, so as to look like she's "just stepped out of the San Francisco fog", Kim Novak is a brilliant Madeleine.  One character I wish they'd spent more time exploring was Scottie's best friend Midge (played with great skill by Barbara Bel Geddes).  She sort of disappears without any real closure, and I feel the character deserved much more.  There are distinct holes in the plot, but at the end of the day, this is Hitchcock, and fabulous Hitchcock at that.<br /><br />I hope it comes to Blu-ray soon, for a full High Definition transfer will only heighten the quality of the glorious Katz/Harris restoration print, which has been the basis for the last three DVD releases.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>One of Hitchcock's best films, which still holds up today, on DVD. Primarily, because it is a very visual film, at times, almost dream like, supported by the Bernard Hermann score, and the acting talents of Jimmy Stewart.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>John Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired cop; he's got a severe case of vertigo and remorse after his friend fell off a building to his death in an attempt to save John. Now, he mopes around the house all day with his admiring friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) in tow, hoping he'll snap out of it. He gets his chance when he is approached by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a man concerned about his wife. It seems Madeleine (Kim Novak) has been going into trances and wandering around town. Gavin wants John to follow her around to gauge the severity of the situation and to determine whether she should be institutionalized. John takes the job reluctantly, and begins to fall for Madeleine in the process. She seems to be channelling a doomed ancestor, and John's fondness for her makes him all the more adamant at finding the cause of the problem instead of sending her away. However, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />This is an interesting role for Stewart, who normally plays a wholesome good ol' boy with a heart of gold. His character here is much more realistic, but since he is the eyes of the viewer, he is still likable. John is an imperfect character, so it is an interesting part to see him play. Stewart's blue eyes photograph really strangely so they create a haunting effect, the way blue eyes looked on the silent screen. Hitchcock most likely used this to his advantage to show the viewer that every character is suspect regardless of how pure they seem.<br /><br />There are many twists in the plot, as is typical of Hitchcock. Not all of them are welcome twists. The subject begins with a psychological and paranormal context, but ends in realism. This descent from one extreme to the next is somewhat disappointing, but it is certainly an interesting ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>Now this is how DVDs should be made!  Universal has done an excellent job with this Hitchcock classic.  <p>First of all, as far as audio commentary goes, more DVDs should take their cue from this one.  VERTIGO features at  least 3 different voices and points of view as narrators.  You do not have  to listen to the same person for two hours.  Granted, some audio  commentators are very entertaining (see/hear Terry Gilliam's commentary on  BRAZIL or 12 MONKEYS).  Some are not.  Plus, it's more bang for your buck  listening to VERTIGO's film restorers and original associate producer.  Another disc that handles the commentary issue well is CONTACT.  <p>Back to  VERTIGO:  The other bonus stuff is great.  We get to see original and  re-release trailers; lots of great production photos; and the &quot;Foreign  Ending&quot;, which is very interesting.  <p>The documentary about  restoring VERTIGO (which was originally on cable's A&amp;E channel) is  fascinating and well done.  I find the restoration process very  interesting. The picture and sound on the DVD are exquisite.  It's never  looked better!<p>VERTIGO, the film, is a classic.  I agree with some of my  fellow reviewers that the story's structure is a bit odd -- Hitch reveals  the &quot;secret&quot; half way through the movie.  However, VERTIGO is a  film about obsession.  It doesn't matter who Madeleine really is.  Scottie  is in the throws of his own personal vertigo and that is far more  interesting to watch than a gimmicky who-done-it.<p>This DVD is definitely  for the collection!</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>As much "art" film as Hollywood product, VERTIGO was generally savaged by critics upon its release; today it is widely regarded as Hitchcock's single finest film. The story is extremely well known: a retired police detective with an incapacitating fear of heights, Scottie, is engaged to shadow a beautiful woman, Madeline, whose husband suspects her of being suicidal.  Scottie soon becomes obsessive about Madeline--but circumstances quickly spin out of control, and his love turns to tragedy and maddness.<br /><br />Unlike most Hitchcock films, VERTIGO unfolds slowly, drawing the viewer into the relationship between Scottie and Madeline at the same pace as the characters experience it.  At the same time, Hitchcock presents the viewer with a number of visual motifs (such as the famous spirals found in the film) to reenforce the increasingly disturbed nature of the story.  As the film progresses, VERTIGO develops a powerfully hypnotic quality rather like the dreamed nightmare of a slow-motion fall.<br /><br />To a certain extent, the stars of VERTIGO are cast against type.  This is particularly true of James Stewart, who is best known as the All-American Everyman, and his performance as the increasingly neurotic Scottie is all the more disturbing for our knowledge of his more typical performances.  Although usually noted more for beauty than for acting ability, Kim Novack gives a remarkable and extremely believable turn in what is easily the finest performance of her career.  The supporting cast--which includes particularly fine performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and Konstantin Shayne--is also excellent, and Bernard Hermann's excellent score adds tremendous dimension to the film. Some viewers, particularly those enamoured of such rapid-fire Hitchcock romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, may find themselves impatient with the film's leisurely pace; some viewers will themselves unable to see beyond the twists in the script to grasp Hitchcock's statement on obsessive love.  But for most viewers--myself included--this is the ultimate Hitchcock film, the great masterpiece by a director reknowned for masterpieces.  A personal favorite, and very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>**MINOR SPOILERS WITHIN**<br /><br />If you ask movie fans to name their favorite Hitchcock titles, you'll get a lot of different answers. Some would mention Psycho or Rear Window, while others might mention Dial M for Murder, The Birds, Notorious or The 39 Steps. There are probably at least 20 strong candidates. My own favorite is Vertigo because the mystery element appeals to me and James Stewart is involved.<br /><br />Mulholland Dr. is my favorite film and David Lynch has mentioned how much he likes Vertigo and Rear Window because of the mood each creates. I can see why. Vertigo's mood never reaches the darker depths that Lynch's work inhabits, but there are similarities.<br /><br />Vertigo begins with a rooftop chase in which Scottie Ferguson is left clinging to the guttering. When a cop tries to save him, Ferguson sees him slip and fall to his death. The traumatic experience leaves Ferguson mentally scarred and he quits his job as a detective. He's hired as a private detective by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who claims that his wife, Madeleine (Novak), wanders off at random and doesn't remember where she's been. He thinks she might be possessed.<br /><br />While that sounds unlikely, Hitchcock gives us reason to think that Madeleine really might be possessed as her husband suggests. Ferguson follows her all day. She takes flowers to a gravestone and stares at it as if she is somewhere else. The name on the grave is Carlotta Valdes. Madeleine also spends time in an art gallery staring at a picture, Portrait of Carlotta. The woman in the painting wears the same necklace and has the same hairstyle as Madeleine.<br /><br />The following day, Ferguson follows Madeleine again. This time she drives to the Golden Gate Bridge and jumps into the bay. Ferguson manages to save her and ask her about her behavior. She doesn't even remember jumping into the bay. We find out that she's the same age Carlotta was when the woman committed suicide. Is the spirit of Carlotta making Madeleine do these things? Is it safe to leave her on her own?<br /><br />That's the setup and I hope that I've managed to describe the unsettling atmosphere that Hitchcock creates. The plot is more complex than most of his films. Some of the twists are so surprising that I can't bring myself to reveal them here. If you haven't seen Vertigo, you deserve to discover those things for yourself.<br /><br />The film uses a lot of red and green filters and you'll see the color green featured throughout. Whether it's Madeleine's dress, her car, or a neon sign, you won't be permitted to forget that color. There's an impressive effect created every time Ferguson looks down from a great height. It was achieved by zooming in and moving the camera away from the image at the same time.<br /><br />Vertigo is sometimes criticized for being boring. I understand why some people might think that, but it's not a view I share. Ferguson spends a lot of time following Madeleine and most of those scenes require us to watch the events unfolding without the use of dialogue. Yes, this is a film that allows you to form your own opinion about what you are seeing. That said, the resolution reveals all of the mysteries. You won't be left to figure out what just happened. The beauty of the film is the way in which the revelations make sense of all the events which preceded them.<br /><br />I'm always impressed when I look at the list of actors that Hitchcock worked with. James Stewart teamed up with Hitchcock in Rope, Rear Window and The Man Who Knew Too Much and all of those are worth your time. Stewart was very effective as Ferguson, particularly in the final 30 minutes of the film when he confronted his fear and obsession. Kim Novak also did a good job in a demanding role.<br /><br />I've mentioned David Lynch, Madeleine and Ferguson in this review. I finally understand why Lynch named a character Maddy Ferguson in Twin Peaks.<br /><br />The film was restored in 1996. Now all we need is a good Blu-ray release and we can see it at its best. If you like mysteries or any Hitchcock film, Vertigo is a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's made a lot of great movies. Thinking about it, of all the great great grandmaster directors, I mean all of them from Fellini, Kurosawa, Lean, Kazan, you name 'em, when you take into account the sheer volume of films each has directed, and that are truly good and not just catalog fillers, Hitchcock is far and away the greatest director who ever lived. And of all the great films he's done, from his early British stuff like the 39 Steps and Jamaica Inn to his more mainstream commercial pop films like The Birds and Psycho, his greatest film and artistic masterpiece, among the 70 something films he's done, is Vertigo.<br /><br />Vertigo features Mr. Stewart as a cop who is forced to retire because of a condition called acrophobia or a fear of heights that results in the death of his partner. He reluctantly agrees to do a little investigative work on behalf of a friend whose beautiful wife played by Kim Novack is supposedly possessed by the 100 year old ghost of an unstable young woman who committed suicide.<br /><br />I won't divulge any more of the plot for anyone who has yet to see the film. I will say that I am not sure If Vertigo is not THE greatest film ever made. Everything, the cinematography, the acting, the locations (all around San Francisco), the color, the music (by Mr. Bernard Herrman), etc. etc. This is why the medium was invented. Pure escapism. In none of his films is Mr. Stewart cooler than in this film. Kim Novack is incredible playing 2 roles, but I won't be tempted to disclose what those roles are, you have to see them for yourself. As in most of his films, 90% of them, Hitch makes his customary cameo in this film but you can't blink or you'll miss him.<br /><br />I really can't say this is THE greatest film simply because there are so many films. The film it's most compared with is Citizen Kane and seeing it for the first time in years this is a pretty fair comparison. I'd call it a toss up because I couldn't subordinate one film under the other, both are the epitome of filmmaking of the period in which they were made, films that we can appreciate today, but, unfortunately, films that fewer and fewer of us can appreciate with the advent and growing popularity of formulaic films that depend heavily on 3d and cgi. But Vertigo is one-stop shopping if you're looking for the ultimate movie experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>One of the few criticisms I have of Alfred Hitchcock's work is that, at times, the viewer is very aware they are watching a "Hitchcock film" and not all that focused on the plot/characters at hand.  With "Vertigo", however, Hitchcock creates a masterpiece that transcends most of his other films and takes his directing to a whole new level.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Vertigo" tells the story of Mr. Ferguson (James Stewart), a one-time detective whose fear of heights (or vertigo) now keeps him grounded.  However, when a close friend hires Ferguson to track the whereabouts of his wife (played by Kim Novak), Ferguson is pulled into a web of intrigue and the paranormal far deeper than he could ever imagine, even to the point of having to finally confront the fear that cripples him inside.<br /><br />There is nothing I can nit-pick about this film.  Period.  It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right buttons.  The plot is infinitely engaging, and filled with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the ending credits.  The characters are well-acted and progress in interested ways as the reels keep spinning, making you actually care what happens to Stewart and Novak's characters.  Then, of course, there is the direction from Hitch, who ties everything together perfectly with his mix of unique film techniques (using Technicolor in ways it had likely never been used before), interesting visual angles, and fast-paced, yet at the same time touching, plot angles.<br /><br />Like I said, within a few minutes (once Hitch makes his ubiquitous cameo), you'll never have that nagging feeling that this movie is only good because Hitch's name is attached to it.  Instead, you'll be completely drawn into everything unfolding in front of you, perhaps even needing to be reminded at the end that it was a Hitchcock film in the first place.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Vertigo" to be not only Hitchcock's best film, but also one of the best films of all-time.  It just doesn't do anything wrong, and does oh so many things right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"Vertigo" is now acknowledged to be one of the great ones, although this was not popular opinion at the time.  No matter.  James Stewart and Kim Novak are both brilliant in this moody, twisty, and ultimately gripping thriller.  I will refrain from commenting much about the plot except to say that this film is unusually vulnerable to spoilers, and I do not want to spoil this fine film for anyone who, like me, comes to it later in life.<br /><br />James Stewart is a retired police detective who is asked to follow his friend's wife who is, to say the least, acting strangely.  The chemistry takes off, and more would be telling, except to say that very few viewers will see where this one is going.  Kim Novak's performance goes well beyond her sometimes "sex kitten" roles, showing the depth and versatility of this fine actress.  To add surprise, the film also features the young Barbara Bel Geddes in a supporting role as Stewart's old (now extinguished) flame.<br /><br />The San Francisco and Northern California locales, shot on actual location (mostly not sets), are wonderful.  This is one of those films where the setting combined with the musical score sets up the film for an almost unbearable nostalgia.  If you watch the DVD, try to find a large TV screen upon which to enjoy this wonderful film.<br /><br />A must for all movie lovers.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>For classic suspense entertainment a viewer can't go wrong with Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. The plot is  intriguing as we are first presented with an apparent tale of reincarnation or soul possession.  There are at least two major twists that are likely to really shock those fortunate enough to watch the movie with no prior knowledge of the story.  Of course with too much thought the improbability of these twists become apparent so the wise viewer will simply suspend disbelief and enjoy.<br /><br />The acting in VERTIGO is top notch.  Nice guy James Stewart plays early retired detective Scottie with just enough hint of character imperfection to make him believable.  Kim Novak is not just gorgeous but fully creates both the lovely, troubled aristocrat Madeleine and the practical beauty, sales clerk Judy.  And I especially like Barbara Bel Geddes (known to baby boomers as Dallas's Miss Ellie) playing Scottie's artist/friend Midge who somehow seems a little mysterious herself.  Baby boomers who watched a lot of TV in their youth will l also recognize Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) as a hotel clerk who puzzles Scottie and Raymond Bailey from The Beverly Hillbillies playing a psychiatrist.  The city of San Francisco and some of the surrounding area are so beautifully photographed VERTIGO could be a travelogue.  Fans of Alfred Hitchcock will not want to miss this masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Vertigo begins as a typical Hitchcock movie, with a typical "aww-shucks" performance from James Stewart, before turning everything on its head and emerging as a great film about obsession that stands as one of the best films "The Master" ever made and perhaps one of the best of all time.</p></br></body></html>

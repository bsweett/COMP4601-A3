Brad Pitt plays the brash young detective that has come to replace him.  In their week together, they work on finding a serial killer whose victims are all tortured (gruesomely) and killed to illustrate the "seven deadly sins."<br /><br />  Freeman is wonderful, as always, playing a character similiar to his "Red" in The Shawshank Redemption:  soft-spoken, patient, and wise.  Pitt (Lose the mustache and beard!) looks at ease playing the cocky, over-eager kid cop.  Gwyneth Paltrow has a small part as Pitt's wife who encounters the serial killer later in the film.  The killer is played by Kevin Spacey as a quiet, intelligent, insane madman.<br /><br />The direction and photography are top-notch.  The pace is quick, there are no wasted speeches or scenes.  Because we know there will be seven murders, we are expecting, but never quite prepared for, the horrific crime scenes.  The ending took me by surprise, which is always good.  I recommend Seven for viewers who want blood, gore, and excellent acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is a classic film with some good actors in it as a series of brutal murders are revealed and then investigated. The first one discovered looks weird to the detectives doing the investigating, and it is not immediately apparent why he died. However, as the second and third crime/murder are discovered, they realize that there's a pattern that follows the seven deadly sins with a twist ending... Ooh! I don't want to say too much because this is a movie you do NOT want to he spoiled for.

Black and white cop buddy movies are a dime a dozen, but this one is saved by a decent script and good acting. The end is a gross out, but at least we are spared actually seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>Amazing that this thriller is now 13 years old!<br /><br />I happened upon "Se7en" tonight while flipping through the channels and thought what a classic, I should post a review on it!<br /><br />There are over 500 reviews here for the movie, so you don't need me telling you the storyline.<br /><br />If by some chance, you have not seen "Se7en", definitely check it out. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are absolutely excellent in this very dark thriller.<br /><br />A top 100 movie of all time!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Seven is a brillant and creepy film from director David Fincher. This is probably Fincher's best film, his movies lately haven't been that good (Zodiac and Panic Room). Brad Pitt is nice eye candy but this guy is the real deal, he is a fabulous actor and this thriller proved it. Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow also star, both are really good as well. Kevin Spacey is flawless as a serial killer who toys with Pitt's character right up 'til the very end. I highly recommend this psychological thriller, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>As a rule, I have a high tolerance for violence and gore in movies, but this one squicked even me. It's certainly the most nightmare-inducing film I've seen recently. The setting is very noir, a dark and rainy unnamed city, in which the youngish Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is replacing Det. Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is about to retire. Then a series of horrific murders begins -- from which the camera never pans away -- themed on the Seven Deadly sins, and there's a lot of chasing about in alleys and tenements. The serial killer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey, who can be a little creepy even when he's not playing a role. It's all madness and mayhem delivered up in a tight, non-predictable script, largely as seen through Somerset's dour, pessimistic view of the world. It's the sort of film you can admire without actually liking it much. Especially the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This one still hunts my mine. David Fincher broke new grounds in 1995 with the release of the psychological thriller 'Se7en'. Since its release, the suspense genre has reached newer levels. Se7en is not particularly a deep movie, but it has the ability to leave the viewer both in deep thought and awe. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are two detectives, an old veteran and a young newcomer, that's being hired for a murder-case. This turns out to be a case of a serial-killer, and the killer's victim is people committing one of the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. . The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically. Somehow cinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the middle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak. The dark look of the movie adds to the overall feel of despair.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good as usual even though he seems like the same person as he plays in about every film I've seen him in: the old, wise and confident man who got the answer to almost every question. Brad Pitt is also good in, what may be one of the best performances I've ever seen by him. The same can be said for Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays David Mills' wife), even though I haven't seen many films from her. But the one, who steals the show, is Kevin Spacey. His straight face zombie-like pose and flat monotone dialog is downright creepy. "Seven" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning and then throws you a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and puts you in the proper frame of mind.<br /><br />The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing. If you manage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear, you can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already sat through the goriest parts. This doesn't mean that you can relax, though. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing clich&eacute;s is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). One of the best mainstream Hollywood films of the '90s.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely riveting and thrilling. It is sad, as well as freaky at times and is almost as good as the Silence of the Lambs. It isn't a shoot em up thriller as it develops slowly with detectives Sommerset and Mills, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who inspect murders, all realting to the seven deadly sins. The movie is very original and has a great performance by Kevin Spacey as the killer, John Doe.<br /><br />It does have lots of disturbing images as well as a pretty freaky plot but is reccomended for anyone who likes good thrillers. This is a scary movie because it could be real, while all of the movies in the horror section like Freddy or Jason are just stupid because it isn't realistic and the killers are invincible. I hope everyone realizes this and doesn't go to see the millions of even worse sequels.<br /><br />On the other hand, Seven is scary and is a masterpiece. This movie has all of the pieces it needs to succeed, from a good cast, to a good plot, to a well executed film, it succeeds in every possible domain. Reccomended to everyone who isn't faint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Se7en can be legitimately labelled one of the most original classic serial killer films ever produced. It truly is a masterpiece in terms of depicting monstrous evil in the guise of religious righteousness against a backdrop of modern nihilism and human degradation.<br /><br />The film focuses on the seven deadly sins created in the 13th century by Catholic theologians as a method to teach virtue and the dangers of the individual relenting to their base desires. These sins are in fact extremes of natural human desires - hunger/gluttony, laziness/sloth, self-esteem/pride, sexual appetite/lust and so on.<br /><br />The film uses this notion of sin as a metaphor for modern society in general. Every scene is dark, degraded in appearance, raining - there is nothing in the story that provides the viewer with any contrast, that is hope, light or compassion. Se7en is intended to reveal the flipside to human nature in its extremes and how far we have dwindled as a civilization.<br /><br />Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is at the end of a long career as a police detective. He has seen human degradation in its many forms, and is finally only seven days away from his retirement. As a character, Somerset is cynical, wise about human nature, however is still effected by man's inhumanity to man. He wants to get out. Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young ambitious officer, newly transferred to the city and is anxious to make his mark. By contrast, Mills is excitable, emotional and takes the job personally. Together they find themselves in the wake of vicious and methodical murders, designed around the seven deadly sins. The killer is a man with tremendous will and patience, sometimes torturing his victims for days, and in one case, a full twelve months. These murders are exceptionally horrific because the killer wants to make a grand point, because he is preaching to the world about how far he believes we have fallen as a society, morally and ethically. In the killers mind, he believes we have dwindled so far and have become so apathetic, that we need to be literally shocked to our moral senses.<br /><br />In this special edition, included are deleted scenes and extended takes with Fincher commenting in the background. One of the more interesting additions is the commentary and creation of John Doe's notebooks. They were actually handwritten and drawn with painstaking precision. These extras accurately reveal the amount of detailed work that goes into creating a film of this high standard.<br /><br />Se7en is an exceptionally well-made film, and one of those pictures that can be viewed several times over the years to still find new aspects about it never seen before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>While many people see this movie as a 'Silence of the Lambs' style psychological horror movie (and being overly grotesque abd graphical for some) - the horror is just a minor aspect of the movie. In a way, it is just a metaphore for our lives today.<br /><br />The movir centers on the relationship between supposedly opposite detectives - David Mills (Brad Pitt) is still young enough (and inexperienced enough in big city crime)to believe the system works, and that most criminals can be caught if the cops & detectives involved will work hard enough. Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), on the other hand, had more than his share of unsolved, grotesque cases to be weary of the system. His definition of a 'closed case' is when there is nothing more to be done - whether the perpertrator has been caught, or in many of the cases - until there is no way of finding him or her. He's also experienced enough to know that hard work is often not enough, and that the wheels of justiced can work better if they're greased with some bribes somewhere along the way. Unlike Det. Mills, who fights the despair he sees around him by tryingto do his best, Det. Somerset just decide to give up - with so much crime going on around him, what can he do to stop it?<br /><br />The movie assaults our sense of 'right and wrong'. Just like Det. Mills, we'd like to think everything can be resolved with logic - but are all logical decisions right decisions? The scene between Tracy & Somerset in the diner tries to tell us the opposite.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the relationship between the two detectives is getting better - not only are they becoming friends, but also manage to find a way to work well together, and to feed off each other's strength & talents. But this doesn't lead to a happy ending - even though the crime is solved. As the relationship gets better, the murders are becoming stranger, exposing us to seedier & seedier sides of life in the big city.<br /><br />Looking at the way the movie is shot, NYC is always rainy, wet, neglected. This depressing atmosphere affects the lives of everyone living in it. Even the supposedly 'perfect' relationship between David & Tracy (the highschool sweethearts we'd all like to be) had somehow gone wrong - starting with the 'vibrating apartment', and going through a stage where Tracy doesn't share the secret of herpregnancy & her doubts about it with David.<br /><br />The ending, on the other hand, occurs in a big, sunny field - the exact opposite of the wet city the characters had just left. But while the city was 'their turf', where they were in control, John Doe is in control of the situation in the field. Once again, our ideals of good & bad (crowded, wet city vs. the big, sunny countryside) are somehow used against us.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sunday, May 16, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Grisly as ever but always intriguing.  When I first saw Seven upon release I was at once struck by its utter grimness but intrigued by the plotline. It hasn't lost any of its power in the ensuing years, it is still one of the pinnacles of the thriller/crime/horror genre.  The study in contrasts in this film are striking, Morgan Freeman as the retiring, intellectual, and beaten down detective paired with Brad Pitt, wise cracking, street smart and still possessing a na?ve optimism.  Watching the slow build up as they uncover the wretched crimes of Kevin Spacey, in a chilling performance as John Doe, is a study in not being able to look away from something horrible.  Filmed almost entirely in dank, dark, raining atmosphere similar to `The Ring' the oppression hangs in the air.  Only as the film nears its still shocking conclusion do the clouds part, but rather than shining down on the washed away grime, it only serves to illuminate the final horror.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>On disc 1, the film looks and sounds GREAT!  And with 4 different running commentaries, you'll invest 8+ hours to hear it all. I'll skip the film review and synopsis - if you're reading this you have most likely already seen the film, right? Disc 2 contains only one deleted scene, but does include the &quot;extended&quot; version of some scenes - optional commentary gives you insight as to why cuts were made. Only moderately interesting.  Lots of disc space is dedicated to crime scene photos created as props, but again not terribly gripping, at least not compared to what numerous other Special Edition DVD's have to offer.  After all the goodies we've seen added to DVD's of &quot;The Abyss&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;, and New Line's own &quot;Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, and &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, DVD buyers are used to getting more behind-the-scenes documentaries, out-takes, marketing campaigns, etc.  Or maybe that's just what I was personally hoping for with this disc set. Granted, the 4 commentaries are great and insightful.  But I usually expect New Line Special Editions to go the extra mile with (as in this case) second disc supplemental materials.  I don't think they did in this case.  So, it begs the question -- rent it or buy it? Well, if you rent it, bear in mind that with the movie itself and 4 commentary tracks you'll need to watch it 5 times total to get all you can off disc 1.  So if it is a &quot;One Day&quot; New Release rental at your video store you'll be in for a long night.  But if you are a DVD collector, it's a no-brainer -- shell out the bucks, dude.  But modify your expecations.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>In the interest of full disclosure, let me tell you some things about myself:<p>I am a Brad Pitt fan.  I am a Morgan Freeman fan.  I am a David Fincher fan.  I am a fan of serial killer movies.<p>So we've perfected the recipe here, then.  All of those elements are at the top of their game.<p>Pitt is immature and kinetic, strong-willed and strong-headed.  He plays off Freeman perfectly.  Freeman, for his part, is quiet and thoughtful.  You can see just from his eyes that he is tired and spent, but feels that this one last case is important and necessary.  He does his duty.  He is a rock (to Pitt's roll?).  David Fincher is Fincher.  His style is just so addicting when he's working with a plausible (in context) script.  He gets to build an anonymous city, making it dreadful and sickening, and run his characters through its mill.  Everything is dark and wet, never letting you take a breath.  Gwyneth Paltrow, in two brief scenes, is quite sweet and touching, exhibiting both humour (with Pitt) and torment (with Freeman).  I usually can do without her, but here she is a welcome relief from all the bleakness.  And of course one of my favourite actors plays the killer, with shaved-head intensity.  It's a great secret that - even though it's already out of the bag - I won't tell.<p>...yecapS niveK s'tI<p>Top to bottom, this is a great movie.  From the first seconds of the first scene, through the opening credits (they look like a Nine Inch Nails video), to the last moments of the closing credits, it's just great.  Every scene is pulled off perfectly; all the details are just right.  Morgan Freeman looking up Dante in the library; the killer's dank little apartment; Pitt and Freeman bonding over beers in a bar... all superbly done.  Of course, the best parts are the murder scene aftermaths, based on the seven deadly sins.  You never see any violence in these scenes, but what you do see is actually a bit more disturbing: gritty tableaus of human suffering.  Fincher's greatest choice is not showing us all that's going on, letting the mind of the viewer fill in most of the grisly details.  My favourite is the 'lust' sequence.  I didn't fully understand what had happened until I watched the movie a second time.  And now I can't get the imagery out of my head.  It works quite powerfully.<p>And the denouement is just staggering.  It's 15 minutes of slow build-up.  You hope that the payoff can live up to the suspense.  And they keep going.  And the suspense builds.  And you hope... and you hope... and you hope.... And the payoff is brilliant.  It perfectly sums up the films themes, and is a very satisfying narrative conclusion to a highly suspenseful mystery/thriller movie.  And my favourite part about the ending: after 2 hours of dirty, dark, and rainy, the film ends at high noon in an open field.  A great contrast, that.  Fincher really knows how to use imagery to make a point.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>"At first sin is a stranger in the soul; then it becomes a guest; and when we are habituated to it, it becomes as if the master of the house." - Tolstoy.<br /><br />Although not originating from the bible, the concept of deadly sins is almost as old as Christian doctrine itself.  Theologians like 4th century Greek monk Evagrius of Pontus first compiled catalogues of deadly offenses against the divine order, which 6th century pope Gregory the Great consolidated into a list of seven sins, which in turn formed the basis of the works of medieval/renaissance writers like St. Thomas Aquinas ("Summa Theologiae"), Geoffrey Chaucer ("Canterbury Tales"), Christopher Marlowe ("Dr. Faustus"), Edmund Spenser ("The Faerie Queene") and Dante Alighieri ("Commedia Divina"/"Purgatorio").  And in times when the ability to read was a privilege rather than a basic skill, the depiction of sin in paintings wasn't far behind; particularly resulting from the 16th century's reformulation of church doctrine, the works of artists like Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder brought the horrific results of humankind's penchant to indulge in vice back into general consciousness with surrealistic eloquence, reminding their viewers that no sin goes unseen (Bosch, "The Seven Deadly Sins") and that its commission leads straight into a hell reigned by gruesome, grotesque demons and devils whose sole purpose is to torture those fallen into their hands (Bosch, "The Hay-Wagon" and "The Last Judgment;" Bruegel, "The Triumph of Death" and "The Tower of Babel").<br /><br />More recently, the seven deadly sins have been the subject of Stephen Sondheim's play "Getting Away With Murder" and a ballet by George Balanchine ("Seven Deadly Sins"); and on the silver screen the topic has been addressed almost since the beginning of filmmaking (Cabiria [1914], Intolerance [1916]).  Thus, "Se7en" builds on a solid tradition both in its own domain and in other art forms, topically as well as in its approach, denouncing society's apathy towards vice and crime.  Yet - and although expressly referencing the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, Chaucer and Dante - David Fincher's movie eschews well-trodden paths and grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning; and it does so not merely by the depiction of serial killer John Doe's (Kevin Spacey's) crimes, which could easily degenerate into a mindless bloodfest that would defeat the movie's purpose.  (Not that there isn't a fair share of blood and gore on display; both visually and in the characters' dialogue regarding those details not actually shown; but Fincher uses the crimes' gruesome nature to create a sense of stark realism, rather than for shock value alone.)  In addition, Doe's mindset is painstakingly presented by the opening credits' jumpy nature, his "lair"'s apocalyptic makeup and his notebooks, all of which were actually written out (at considerable expense), and whose compilation is shown underlying the credits.  The movie's atmosphere of unrelenting doom is further underscored by a color scheme dominated by brown, gray and only subdued hues of other colors, and by the fact that almost every outdoors scene is set in rain.  Moreover, although screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker explains on the DVD that the story was inspired by his observations in New York (and the movie was shot partly there, partly in L.A.), it is set in a faceless, nameless city, thus emphasizing that its concern isn't a specific location but society generally.<br /><br />Central to the movie is the contrast between world-weary Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who, while decrying the rampant occurrence of violence in society, for much of the movie seems to have resigned himself to his inability to do something meaningful about this (and therefore seems to accept apathy for himself, too, until his reluctant final turnaround), and younger Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), who fought for a reassignment to this particular location, perhaps naively expecting his contributions to actually make a difference; only to become a pawn in Doe's scheme instead and thus show that, given the right trigger, nobody is beyond temptation.  As such, Somerset and Mills are not merely another incarnation of the well-known old-cop-young-cop pairing.  Rather, their characters' development over the course of the film forces each viewer to examine his/her own stance towards vice.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt perfectly portray the two detectives; while Freeman imbues his Will Somerset with a quiet dignity, professionalism and learning, muted by profound but not yet wholly irreversible resignation, Pitt's David Mills is a brash everyman from the suburbs with an undeniable streak of prejudice, a penchant for quick judgment and a thorough lack of sophistication, both personally and culturally.  Notable are also the appearances of Gwyneth Paltrow (significantly Brad Pitt's real-life girlfriend at the time) as Mills's wife Tracy and ex-marine R. Lee Ermey as the police captain.  Yet, from his very first appearance onwards, this is entirely Kevin Spacey's film.  Reportedly, Brad Pitt especially fought hard for his casting; and it is indeed hard to imagine "Se7en" with anybody other than the guy who, that same year, also won an Oscar for portraying devilish Keyser Soze in "The Usual Suspects": No living actor has Spacey's ability to simultaneously express spine-chilling villainy, laconic indifference and limitless superiority with merely a few gestures and vocal inflections.<br /><br />While "Se7en" can certainly claim the "sledgehammer" effect on its viewers sought by its fictional killer, the punishment meted out to Doe's victims - taking their perceived sins to the extreme - pales in comparison to that awaiting sinners according to medieval teachings.  (Inter alia, gluttons would thus be forced to eat vermin, toads and snakes, greed-mongers put in cauldrons of boiling oil and those guilty of lust smothered in fire and brimstone.)  Most serial killers have decidedly more mundane motivations than Doe.  And after all, this is only a movie.<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />"Sin ... engenders vice by repetition of the same acts, [clouding the conscience and corrupting the judgment.]  Thus sin tends to reproduce ... and reinforce itself, but it cannot destroy the moral sense at its root." - Catechism of the Catholic Church (1994).<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0822215659">Getting Away With Murder</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLKN">Red Dragon (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4TJ">Cabiria</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007CVS8">Intolerance</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451208633">The Divine Comedy (The Inferno, The Purgatorio, and The Paradiso)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140424385">The Canterbury Tales (Penguin Classics)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140436324">Aquinas: Selected Writings (Penguin Classics)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3822858560">Bosch : C. 1450 1516 Between Heaven and Hell (Basic Series : Art)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>I had to catch my breath...step away from the movie<br /><br />screen...and totally regroup.  It was that kind of<br /><br />film.  I've just finished watching what critics<br /><br />deemed one of the most frightening and disturbing<br /><br />homicidal maniac films of all time --- Se7en.  And no,<br /><br />that is not a typo...just a clever marketing tool to<br /><br />emphasize the meaning of the number and the word -<br /><br />Se7en.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin.<br /><br />I don't want to give away a thing.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat for two hours.<br /><br />And why not?  Take a look at the cast.  Morgan<br /><br />Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow.  How can you lose?  I can't give away the murderer...it would detract from the horror<br /><br />of this totally insane film of 1995.  I've had it on<br /><br />my shelf for over a year and never got around to<br /><br />watching it until tonight.<br /><br />Without giving away a single storyline, if you enjoyed<br /><br />(quivered and shivered) during "Silence of the Lambs"<br /><br />or "Manhunter", this one is for you.  It builds a plot<br /><br />like building a 3,000 piece Lego masterpiece.  What<br /><br />an ending!  To me, it wasn't predicatble...probably<br /><br />because I am naive when it comes to psychotic<br /><br />killers...I don't know that many - LOL!<br /><br />Anyway, let me share a couple of things with you.<br /><br />First, I won't give away the meaning of the title<br /><br />"Se7en".  You will discover that very shortly into the<br /><br />film.<br /><br />But let me quote a couple of the lines from the film:<br /><br />"About the only thing we know about that guy right now<br /><br />is that he is independently wealthy, well educated,<br /><br />and TOTALLY INSANE."<br /><br />"...because he's John Doe by choice."<br /><br />The maniac in this film is "completing his<br /><br />masterpiece."<br /><br />"The Lord works in mysterious ways."<br /><br />With that, "Se7en" gets a resounding 6 on a scale of<br /><br />1-5 (5 being the highest) in the psycho thriller<br /><br />genre.  I purchased the New Line Platinum Series with<br /><br />a second DVD with supplemental material.  It contains<br /><br />alternate endings which I haven't watched yet...but<br /><br />I'm sure they'll be a treat.<br /><br />As Halloween approaches, it's the time of year to<br /><br />watch "Se7en."  You'll never read Chaucer with the<br /><br />same understanding ever again.  Brad Pitt and Morgan<br /><br />Freeman (the rookie meets the seasoned veteran) are well cast as determined and crafty detectives.  Don't miss<br /><br />it.<br /><br />Count to "Se7en" and buy this DVD.  You'll watch it more than once.  It is a blood-curdling masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>David Fincher is a director who has had an amazing career with his latest highlight being THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  But a film that was praised by the critics but overlooked at the Oscars is one of his very best - SE7EN. It is amazing to believe that it came out in 1995.  It was a ratrity in its time being a true horror film while at the same time being an intense, intelligent deep psychological thriller.  The blu ray is amazing and the film certainly stands the test of time.  The movie is an absorbing, shocking and frightening tale of society, man, sin and the fine line that there is between good and evil and lives on in grand style on this glorious blu ray.  The film is dark and takes place in a city with no name.  Everything is aging, decrepid and depressing.  But the black/white levels on the blu ray are superb and the detail and clarity are amazing throughout.  Colors though subdued are still very realistic and pop naturally as do skin tones.  The crispness of the pictures adds a whole new level of intensity to the film.  And the audio is a mindblower with its 7.1 lossless DTS track.  Dialogue is strong and present and surround speakers are put to excellent use.  The disc also comes packaged in a superb digibook excellently crafted with much info on the film.  There are also tons of extras on the disc.<br /><br />I highly recommend SE7EN.  This is a film that is indeed a classic.  It has standout performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey.  It is also a film that is not gratuitous in its horror.  It serves a purpose and the way it is utilized makes it linger with you that much longer.  This film is so well crafted in every aspect that repeat viewings will be a must.  I remembered the whole story line when I first watched this blu ray and it in no way ruined the experience.  The knowing of things actually added to the trepidation and appreciiation of how superb the film actually is.<br /><br />Luckily I received my blu ray packaged in a cardboard box but I have had the experience many have had here with other films from Amazon where bubble wrap packaging ruined a digibook.

In his tales featuring the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, Poe dubbed the criminal and the detective, the 'creative' and the 'resolvant' - the criminal creates a crime like a work of art; the detective analyses and interprets it like a critic.  In 'Se7en', John Doe's serial killing has an aesthetical form - not only does he pattern it according to an overarching structure; not only does the method of each crime connect thematically to its sin; but each is an elaborate, meticulously-staged tableau which the detectives must read before they can understand it and proceed.  The thrller hinges on whether the detectives are good critics - William Somerset, who deals in dedicated scholarship, absorbing the primary texts, is; the younger Mills, who skimps with 'Cliff's Notes', isn't.<p>A second model in 'Se7en' is Dante's 'Divine Comedy', which screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker reverses.  Somerset is Virgil, the teacher full of cultural and ethical knowledge who should bring his student, Mills as Dante, to progressive understanding and enlightenment.  Rather than moving heavenwards, however, 'Se7en' is a slow ride to Hell, beginning with the Purgatorial Sin nearest to Heaven, Gluttony, and working down through the rest.  The ultimate goal facing the student is not achieving redemption but avoiding damnation.  Although New York might seem like a living hell - a medieval inferno plagued by random violence, apathy, noise, decay, rain, lonely rotting lives - it is really a Purgatorial testing-ground; but Somerset is a bad teacher, Mills an inattentive student.  <p>Then there is Borges, who, in stories such as 'Death and the Compass', used the detective format and the 'clues' to be read in Great Literature, to destroy the ethical assumptions of forms and identity.<p>'Se7en' is the kind of film that only seems a masterpiece on first viewing, when shock, suspense and novelty replace our critical faculties.  As such, its effect is immediate and gut-wrenching, as the film flatters our intellect without making any demands on it.  But as would become apparent in his later films, director Fincher always pulls back from being truly radical, and what seems to be a hopeless, dank, inexorable, anti-Hollywood apocalyptic vision is actually as reassuring as the most conservative detective novel: unlike Borges, it retains a faith in patterns, taking them to their logical conclusions, giving some sort of meaning, no matter how bleak to chaos.  Despite Somerset's protests, Doe is too reassuringly, articulately psychotic to suggest a projection of inner evil, remorse or Biblical vengeance (indeed, the film might be a moral story about man's hubris in replacing God).  The script contrivances (as in imaginative short-cuts, rather than failures in plausibility) become increasingly apparent.<p>The best directors - from Hitchcock to Ray to Soderbergh - are also Critics, interrogating the scripts they film, but Fincher seems content to reproduce Walker's pretentious gloom and thematic timidity - even the grungiest scenes are filmed with exquisite symmetry and loving detail.  The script itself queasily reproduces Doe's moral censoriousness, punishing in kind a woman who simply contemplated abortion.  The film is full of beautiful compositions (the brutally ironic torchlights in the opening investigation; the neon blue as they check out the 'Help Me' fingerprints); exciting set-pieces (the first chase of Doe; the wracking final 20 minutes); and gruesome moments (the jerk of a flayed victim).  The acting is terrific, especially Brad Pitt in his first great performance, using his good-looking cockiness to devastating effect, in many ways more complex and sympathetic than Morgan Freeman's earnest elder cop, with his intriguingly failed past and sterile present.  As a whole, however, I don't think 'Se7en' holds up.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Director David Fincher made up for his dreadful directorial debut Alien 3 with this superbly crafted thriller that became the most unnerving serial killer film since The Silence of the Lambs.  Veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is teamed with young detective Mills (Brad Pitt) to track a serial killer who is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.  Freeman and Pitt are both great in they're respective roles, but Gwyneth Paltrow is mostly wasted as Pitt's wife.  The best performance however goes to Kevin Spacey as John Doe, the seemingly insane killer that we soon find out may not be so insane after all.  This is where Fincher began to display the skills of the type of director he would become in his later films like Fight Club and Panic Room.  The look of the film honestly, is pretty depressing, but that mood sets the tone of Seven perfectly, and the atmosphere of the film carries a sense of dread almost throughout the entire film.  Freeman's characterization of the weathered and disenchanted Somerset is one of his best roles in his distinguished career.  Pitt's characterization of a hot headed cop is one of his better roles as well, but as I said before, Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film and is purely chilling.  What makes John Doe chilling however, is not his crimes, but the fact that when he speaks his reasons why, he makes a frightening sense of it.  The DVD itself is packed with extras including four seperate commentaries and an alternate ending (plus an un-shot ending done with storyboards) along with tons more, and is possibly New Line's best produced DVD to date.  All in all, consider this essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Seven" starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. It's the story of a vicious sadistic serial killer. Brad Pitt plays a rookie (in this particular police division) and Morgan Freeman plays a veteran detective who is scheduled to retire in a week and both, together, are in pursuit of the insane killer as he selects his victims according to the seven deadly sins. It's a strange mixture of insanity and religious fervor, I suppose. Will they track him down and put an end to his grisly practice?<br /><br />The movie is exceptionally well acted. Morgan Freeman does a convincing job, as I would expect from viewing him in other movies. The surprise was Brad Pitt. I have viewed him as a lightweight and in this movie he does just a splendid job of acting. The other characters are competent. The filming is rather good. The sound is just so-so as the background noise tends to drown out a lot of conversations.<br /><br />Well, it's a quite good movie, but I didn't care for it. There's just an overwhelming amount of gore and grisly scenes. Some of the footage is just stomach churning. What' the point? If a person is dead and shown to be dead, why examine the rotting corpse in detail? I suppose in some instances it might make sense, but with this movie it went way, way over the line. Even though it's a good movie, I would not want to watch it again. Furthermore, I would advise people that if they are sensitive to really grisly scenes, perhaps this is a movie to ignore. But, it's your dime, and it's a worthy movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a good movie. It kept me clue to the tv.

Just outstanding acting and suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This is a unique film, it's dark even by director-writer Fincher's standards.  It's a great movie, but you feel like you need to shower after seeing it.  The ending is of course infamous, but the film is so much more than the ending, and Freeman as always is great, as for Pitt, well I'm not a fan, but he works in this film.  Fincher has a thing for deep noir and this is dark, if you like suspenseful thrillers then you will really like this film, but not for the squeamish I assure you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>And I say the best because this movie is so much more than just your typical horror film.  This film has a bite that most don't, it has a sense of reality, a gritty sense of human emotion that gets left out of most horror films.  This movie takes the time to explain it's charactors, everyone from Somerset (Freeman) to Mills (Brad Pitt in his BEST role ever) and even your killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey, Brilliant as he always is).  I thought that was the best part of this movie, that it took the time to explain your killer, took the time to get you inside his head and see why he was the way that he was and to see the reactions that he had to others and the reactions that they had to him (especially Pitt...the scene of dialog alone between Pitt and Spacey in the police car towards the end is the best scene in the film)...So our story revolves around a group of murders in NYC all based on various 'deadly-sins'...opening scene is an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst.  So you see that our killer forces his victims to kill themselves via their sin.  (The most disturbing is lust, believe me!)  So even though the film never shows a murder take place you see the aftermath of each and each one in particular is disturbing in itself.  The while air to this film is creepy, eeire and puts you in a mood before the suspence starts.  You must know that this is not the 'jump out of your seat and pee your pants' type of film, its more like the type you think about later with the lights on and your covers pulled up to your head.  It's a pschological thriller that messes with your head, makes you think about why this man did what he did and may even make you wonder if he had a point.  There is a strong moral backdrop to this movie, which is also something that is lacking in almost every other horror film.  The killer had a reason, maybe not an excuse buthe had a reason that he was able to justify in his mind for doing what he did...a reason that he calculated out, that he meditated on and most importantly, it was a reason he BELIEVED in...it was a code that he lived by and he was convinced was right even though he knew it was wrong.  Kevin Spacey is so convincing in his portrayal of a disturbed man, a man plauged by a hightened sense of morality that forced him to be morally coruptable.  This is a movie I think everyone should see, if not for sheer entertainment, see it for the message it conveys, a message that can be contorted and twisted to fit anyones interpretation, I guess the only way to really appreciate this film is to watch it and interprete it for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>Because this is a landmark thriller. I remember sitting through it in a moviehouse in 1995 and it still hasn`t overstayed its welcome. The story, characters and its visual splendour arrests you immediatly and should be in every moviecollection in every household, `round the world.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>As a film overall, Seven has all the key elements -- great acting (Freeman,Spacey and Pitt are all excellent), super photography, a creepy and compelling plot, and just enough gory visuals to keep it interesting. But it does have its flaws. First off, Tracy is a little strange from the git-go. "Nough said without giving away anything. Second, while I totally understood the ending (yes, every aspect of it), it just wasn't fulfilling. Not in any way. The viewer feels cheated, not completed. This is a major problem with Seven and what holds it back from being a Silence-type classic. There's such a thing as being too artistic.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>We plummet the depths of depravity here.  Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in  this masterpiece of monstrous intent.  Morgan Freeman stars as William  Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who  finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective  effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt.  As they try to find the killer there  develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an  engrossing movie.  Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as "John Doe," a 20th  century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a  monster from hell.  He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and  torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.<p>Momma, lock the  doors and bar the windows.  Don't let this video into your home.  You'll  watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times,  their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism  about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it  clean.<p>Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to  its old tricks.  After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to  this extraordinary commercialization of evil?  One of the penetrating  things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept  of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and  give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds.  The  ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie  would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things:  One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential  innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible  deeds are the work of only one man.  Whether he is just an insane "nut-bag"  as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is  an interesting question.<p>Serial killer film makers of the future will try  to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon.  This is  already a classic.  Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and  Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff.  I hope they're only  doing it for the money.<p>  By the  way, perfect font for the credits.</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>SE7EN<br /><br />(USA - 1995)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS<br /><br />On the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.<br /><br />Dark, gruesome shocker which set director David Fincher on the road to Hollywood glory following an inauspicious debut with the half-baked sci-fi shocker ALIEN?. Freeman loans dramatic weight to the proceedings as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt distances himself from the 'pretty-boy' roles in which he had become typecast by playing a complex, headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where moral values have been replaced by human apathy and excess, allowing the killer at the heart of the story to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme begins to overwhelm the central characters. In fact, Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good.<br /><br />The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography often belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for all concerned, this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Brilliant mainstream movies seem to be increasingly rare these days, but "Seven" is surely one that will stand the test of time.  Direcotr David Fincher, with help from a terrific ensemble cast, crafted a dark, uncompromising look at the moral failings of contemporary American society.  This is not a happy movie, and you won't feel any better after watching it, but it'll certainly make you think.  On one level, "Seven" is a mystery/suspense movie, and an excellent one at that.  The plot, which I'm sure most are familiar with by now, concerns two cops, Brad Pitt's youthful Mills and Morgan Freeman's aging Somerset, on the trail of a serial killer.  As the movie develops, it turns out that the killer is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins, and finding a fiendish way to turn each one against the sinner.  Although this concept is exceedingly clever, it wouldn't make a classic movie on its own.  What elevates "Seven" above the heap is that it exploits the allegorical potential of its subject to the fullest.  More than just a simple crime drama, "Seven" is a modern morality tale for our troubled times.  The lead characters, Mills and Somerset, become representatives for two competing viewpoints.  The young Mills still thinks he can make a difference through his work, but the soon-to-retire Somerset has allowed himself to become jaded by the constant apathy he sees in society.  Unfortunately, it seems that Somerset's view has the weight of evidence behind it.  And then there's the killer, played in truly unsettling fashion by Kevin Spacey (back when he was still an excellent character actor and not a failed leading man).  Spacey's John Doe doesn't show up until there's about a half-hour left in the movie, but during his brief role he OWNS the screen.  When he explains the rationale behind his killings, it's pretty near impossible not to think about what he says.  Fincher's noirish direction tops it all off, creating a dark and oppressive atmosphere that perfectly complements the movie's subject matter.  If you're anything like me, you'll be rather depressed after watching "Seven," but you'll be wiser for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>Disturbing and scary don't seem like good enough words to describe the film, "Seven". This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer kills his victims by using the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth. Of course you're disturbed by the killings and dark, damp feel of the movie, but you also learn about the message that the killer was ultimately trying to relay - although he didn't have to kill to get his point across.<p>Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did great jobs playing the lead characters, and Kevin Spacey is chilling as the killer. This is definitely a movie you want to watch with a friend and with the lights on!</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>In the best tradition of psychological horror that claims such memorable classics as "Dressed to Kill", "Psycho", and "The Silence of the Lambs"- this film will haunt viewers well beyond the final credits.  Director David Fincher skillfully constructs all the elements of suspense in this tale about a serial killer obsessed with the seven deadly sins:  gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust. The two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) tracking him become equally obsessed - with capturing the killer before he completes his seven murders.  Freeman and Pitt have great on-screen chemistry that lends a gritty reality to the script. <p>Despite the gruesome plot, this film has an elegance rarely encountered in a commercial film. The suspense is beautifully taut - I caught myself literally holding my breath during certain parts. The pacing is deliberate but never slack, giving the viewer over two hours of intense drama. <p>Turn down the lights, jack up the surround sound, and settle into this tense thriller.  (And make sure you're not alone!)</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Okay, for those who liked Silence of the Lambs, this is a horror film for you. It's a mix between a murder mystery, crime drama, suspense film, and horror film. Yes this is a slasher film, this is a body count film. This is a slasher film with class. Director David Fincher doesn't want his audience to be comfortable for a moment while watching "Seven." Shaky camera shots, dark sets and a disturbing script that takes its characters to the extremes of emotion all contribute to the film creating a unsettled feeling that stays with you for a couple hours after the credits roll. The first time I watched this, I didn't like it, but that is because I wasn't really paying attention to it, and the sound and color on my t.v. wasn't working right. Anyway, the film begins with the overused premise of a young cop (Brad Pitt) being teamed for a murder investigation with an veteran on the verge of retirement. The two quickly develop a tense disrespect for each other, Pitt being the cocky smartass type and Freeman the hardened, pessimist New Yorker who has seen it all. Their investigation of a bizarre murder, in which an obese man is forced to eat himself to death, turns into a hunt for a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins -- gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as his calling card. The second victim, a rich lawyer, is the not-so-subtle tip off "greed" is written in blood on his carpet. What gives "Se7en" it's unsettling impact is the way the film connects deeply with each character, even the victims who are never seen alive. Freeman, Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife are all in top form here and the audience comes to know them intimately whatever affects them, affects the viewer equally. This is especially true of Pitt, whose character struggles to maintain his optimism in the face of the horrors he sees. The killer is played, by a well-known actor who is not named in the opening credits (the producers want to keep his identity a surprize), with a calm but explosive demeanor conspicuously reminiscent of "Silence of the Lambs." The tension is so well played that even though the unsatisfying conclusion becomes obvious a good 15 minutes before the climax, it doesn't diminish at all. Because of the way it assaults the emotions, seeing "Se7en" should not be taken lightly, and must be taken seriously to fully appreciate the film. This film has good acting, excellent script and a chilling soundtrack. I recommend buying or renting this film today, and watch it alone in the dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>&quot;Seven&quot; is one of the most intelligent, thought provoking movies of the 90's. I would not, however, characterize it as &quot;realism&quot;, but rather as morbid surrealism, in the sense that the director is less concerned with getting the details of the real world right and more concerned with painting a picture of a doomed, dark, and basically evil world. This is the only performance Brad Pitt has ever given that I can stomach, and I would even go so far as to say that he does very well as the well intelligent but none too bright young detective, Mills. Morgan Freeman gives a flawless performance as Somerset, a misanthropic intellectual who is beginning to question both his occupation and the basic goodness and desirability of human life. Fincher is obviously trying to tell us something very unpleasant with this film, and yet his message is relevant and not simply intended to depress or disgust. The evil in the world is crushing when we stop ignoring it and is quite irreparable, there is no way to take back one act of malice or one atrocity, and therefore we cannot see the world as necessarily 'good'. Although he goes a little overboard with the rain and sometimes lapses into pretentiousness, most of it is subtle, masterfully done, darkly humorous at times, and chillingly believable. If you think you can't take the unrelentingly bleak atmosphere of it, wait until you see the ending, which is undoubtedly one of the most disturbing and horrific finales I've ever seen in a motion picture. This is not just a 'shocker' or an 'MTV movie', and is probably one of the best movies of the 90's. If you're a hypersensitive or depressive person, however, I would not recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B350OHYHQTGX.html">A1B350OHYHQTGX</a><br/><p>The movie is so E V I L and B R I L L I A N T.<p>Both director David Fincher and author Richard Dyer are to be put in Jail..!

That his character is erudite is reason enough to rent this movie, regardless of whether or not you like thriller-type flicks.<p>Brad Pitt is excellent as Freeman's ignoramous partner, David Mills.  The plot has the two of them attempting to apprehend a felon who is every bit as learned as  detective Somerset.  Due to this, the movie is able to do what few other movies have ever done;  it delves into the morose Dantesque overtones of sin and punishment.

It is a brilliant film, well directed, acted and photographed.  The ending is one of the most frightening and disturbing pieces of film-making in recent thriller history.  <p>When watching this film, though, take in some of the other amazing things:  the performance of the always-dependable Morgan Freeman.  Freeman has been overlooked numerous times by the Oscar folk, and sadly so.  He is outstanding in this role, and commands most of the movie away from his stellar cast-mates.<p>Look at the performance of Brad Pitt, the &quot;hunk&quot; who can really act, when given the opportunity to do so.  Relish in the superior acting of two future Oscar winners--Gwyneth Paltrow and the amazing Kevin Spacey.  Neither is given much screen time, but they both are incredible in their brief appearances.  Spacey is out and out terrifying as the serial killer.  Paltrow has a very beautiful scene with Freeman in which she laments her new life in the city.  This movie firmly convinces me that New York City is not the place for anyone in their right mind to live. Few directors have captured the seamy side of NYC as well as David Flincher.<p>This is a stunning film, and ranks up there with the best of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is the attempt to show the deep-running debate within the police about the profiling technique of the FBI. The old black detective goes along that line and tries to understand the religious and cultural  motivations of the killer and finds them in Chaucer, Dante, Milton, and the  killer's references to the Seven Deadly Sins. The young white detective  follows his instinct and feeling in front of facts and crime-scene  elements. That helps him find the essential clue that will bring the film  to its end. But, not understanding the motivation of the killer, he will  neglect some simple security measures concerning his wife, and will not  understand how the killer is trapping him little by little in the seventh  deadly sin, wrath. So he will fall in the trap. This film is entirely  symbolical, every detail having a deeper meaning if it is read in the line  of the religious and cultural references. The killer is a preacher who is  trying to preach to the world the necessary crusade to be undertaken  urgently if the world is to be saved. We have here a motivation that  associates religion, the desire to punish, the ambition to be God, and the  most reactionary ideology that considers that freedom in our world produces  sin and decay. The man is a fundamentalist who tries to go back to the  Middle Ages, when religion was fundamentalistic. He forgets one thing : the  books he quotes had a double meaning. They reflected this fundamentalistic  religion of the time, and they spoke with the authors' tongues in their  cheeks, becoming hence a subtle denunciation of that fundamentalism and a  call for a liberation of man's pirit and soul from this total alienation to  a belief that is nothing but a superstition. We must also understand that,  in the world, there are people who do think like that, and in some  countries which have such a fundamentalistic approach of religion they  commit all the crimes that go along with it, and of course all the  limitations of freedom and private life.

Also included are featurettes, deleted scenes, two alternate endings, and plenty of other features.<br /><br />David Fincher has impressed me with his directing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXB8">Alien 3 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVZCQ">Panic Room (3-Disc Special Edition)</a> were just as wonderful.<br /><br />This is a definite Must Have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An outstanding film, Seven, brings to the screen the story an about-to-retire detective and his replacement as they tackle a particularly nasty serial killer.  Could they be biting more than they can chew...<br /><br />There are hints of The Bone Collector and The Silence of the Lambs, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Seven is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>This is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />David Fincher's dark style really shines in this film.  The characters are excellently developed, and one really does care about what happens to them.  The story is sort of odd for a detective movie, leaning a little on a Christian undertone, but it's never really played up too much, which is good in my opinion, because those types of things can detract from movies (End of Days).  This is probably one of Kevin Spacey's best roles, as the serial killer, John Doe.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Somerset.  Brad Pitt really shines because he plays a sort of average detective and not some wierdo or "seductive" guy.  Gweneth Paltrow's part is small, but in the scenes that she's in we get to know her character well.  The mood of the movie is really dark, and it's really apparent at the ending, which is one of the most brutally intense that there is.  Don't expect to walk away from this movie feeling cheery, but expect to walk away liking it.  The DVD features on Disc 2 (4 commentaries on Disc 1) are really worthwhile, with deleted scenes that look to be remastered, explorations of title concepts, an original opening and ending, and also some segments about the remastering for DVD.  This movie is worth it for fans of crime/thriller/horror movies, even though it's not really a horror movie, but it exibits some traits.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Please stop calling it a thriller! Sure it has some of thriller's elements but it's a straightforward drama. If you read Dostoyevsky you'd notice that "Se7en" is very much alike his works. 'Cos it's about good and evil and how fighting evil sometimes can turn you into evil yourself. It's a message about violence which can't be stopped with another violence. When violence is directed against violence it ends up with... right, violence again. Vicious circle. And someone has to stop it. Detective Mills couldn't and that's why we feel so sombre after the end. Not because of Gwyneth Paltrow (you know what I mean).<br /><br />One more time we received an evidence that our world is chaotic, that it's not going to be a nice place, that it's violent and that even good intentions won't make it a better place. Forgive me my English but I assume they say: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions".<br /><br />"Se7en" is one of the most realistic and therefore depressive films of all time, it's a serious piece of art and by calling it a "thriller" people steel much of its value. And if you always considered it just a thriller watch it one more time, try to see what's inside and you'll be amazed at what you find.<br /><br />By the way this two-disc edition is one of the best DVD-editions ever. Audio and video transfers were remastered specially for this occasion, bonus features will take some of your precious time but you won't regret it. Definately a must-buy for anybody who likes cinema and purchases DVDs once in a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>When the sins are committed from two in two you have to pay them from one in one; Rudyard Kipling was the author of this singular statement. This film became the great leap of David Fincher to the big screen. Original script that deals with a serious damaged mental  man, who bets to be God and choosing every victim according every one of those kidnapped codes. But beware the religious fanatic  can become heretics due precisely, to his own fanaticism.<br /><br />Seven capital sins: seven crimes that must be done to clean the world from the stinkers and vicious human beings. In this chrysalis and under those extreme prejudices you can not expect too much sense of the reality. And Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt will be the investigators who will be assigned to chase this lunatic and out of his mind man. Excellent shots, brutal and extremely graphic violence, but superbly fascinating.<br /><br />One of the most original and best films in these decade.<br /><br />The plot was a true circular nightmare as it was inspired by the astonishing mind of Jorge Luis Borges or perhaps a sincere homage to William Blake!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  David Fincher<br />Cast:  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, John C. McGinley, Kevin Spacey.<br />Running Time:  127 minutes.<br />Rated R for extreme violence, gore, and language.<p>One of the most gruesome, yet intriguing mystery/suspense thrillers of the past decade, "Seven" is widely considered one of the best of its kind-and rightfully so.  It is a film that will test the stomachs of all its viewers, yet even those who feel queasy throughout the entire picture stay engaged because of the impeccable acting, top-notch direction, and riveting cinematography.<p>Detective William Somerset (a stupendous, touching performance from the always admirable Morgan Freeman) is looking forward to retirement-he has had it with all the horror, stress, and dead partners that accompany his job.  His young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), is looking forward to follow in his footsteps, but realizes that his feet are in too deep as a serial killer who calls himself "John Doe" begins to parade around the city-killing each of his victims in a pattern that references to the seven deadly sins.  As both detectives uncover more of the truth about the horrific killer, they become entangled in a ghoulish scheme that will shock them.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a fine performance as Mills's distressed wife.<p>Director David Fincher creates a dark and disturbing film, using Freeman and Pitt well (both give slightly dark, somber performances) to his advantage.  The unique camera angles, explosive chase sequences, and vivid crime scenes enhance the picture, making "Seven" an inimitable thriller that is so effective, powerful, and alarming that it will scare your socks right off.  The finale is one of the most electrifying of all time, pitting Pitt (no pun intended) against the evil murderer in an emotional, unforgettable showdown.  A rare cinematic experience that will make you have nightmares for weeks-but enjoy every second of it.  The Platinum Series DVD is phenomenal, which includes many deleted scenes, alternate endings, and a DVD-rom exclusive that allows you to look into the killer's mind.  A captivating, spellbinding look at how the horrors of society can simply drive an ordinary man mad.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>like most of the films I see there are some that grab my attention and this is one of them. it's number 3 on my top 10 list. Se7en is a well made thriller with gut churning twists and turns that catapoltes you into the mind blowing end. Freeman is superb and Pitt's performance is key here with his character wanting to take this killer down. Paltrow is also good as Pitt's wife. the end with her head in the box is really a stomach twister. and who better to fit the shoes of the killer then the ever so talented Kevin Spacey who delivers again another brillant but short performance. the killings are gruesome and the knots in your stomach will stay. David Fincher creates a masterwork</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>David Fincher's &quot;Seven,&quot; according to one of the experts on one of the commentaries in this DVD edition, has become some sort of modern classic. It doesn't surprise me. &quot;Seven&quot; takes typical cop-film ideas and morphs them into a dark, creepy, memorable tale of serial murder. The violence of the film is psychological, because what's really disturbing is the things the film makes you think about, not on screen gore. Look closely and you'll see that there is not that much violence in the movie, it's the brilliant way in which Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) set up mood and atmosphere. The cinematography is dark, beautiful and shadowy, giving the impression that there are evil things lurking in the shadows or just down the hall. The characters can be believed, and we really do care about them when the final shock comes. The performances are also superb, not least Kevin Spacey's serial killer, John Doe, who seems like a cousin of Hannibal Lecter. &quot;Seven&quot; also has a mind, the details of the plot are complex because they are not just materialistic things, you really have to think, to examine the ideas and thoughts in the story. This is the film, which I think, remains David Fincher's masterpiece. His latest, &quot;Fight Club,&quot; was less intelligent or memorable. It was good, but doesn't go in league with this masterwork of the macabre. &quot;Seven&quot; raises chilling little feelings in you, disturbing thoughts and ideas, which is what great horror is supposed to do, yet it never loses intelligence. This special DVD edition will offer more material to better understand the film's structure, there's even a look at the making of John Doe's notebooks. &quot;Seven&quot; is a must for those who love a smart, creepy tale.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In 2004, the movie "Saw" vaulted to the top of many "psychological thriller" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind.  Nearly ten years earlier, "Se7en" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Se7en" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore.  Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders.  As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.<br /><br />There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...<br /><br />First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted.  Director David Fincher has proven time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different.  By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.<br /><br />Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail.  Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.<br /><br />In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances.  The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the "eager rookie", Freeman as the "grizzled vet"), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)?  To me, the real "meat" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey).  Whereas in Saw, the "Jigsaw" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, "Se7en" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film.  Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Se7en" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like "Saw".  It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground.  Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman star in this 1995 thriller.<br />Two detectives pursue a killer who uses the 7 deadly<br />sins to murder his victims.

Get this terrific thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>David Fincher is one of most respected film directors thanks to his works in the suspense genre, the noir and dark chills of THE GAME and the mysterious, scary, and atmospheric scares found in SEVEN, which happens to boast great performances, scary moments that will take the breath right out of you, and creepy visuals that only help to enhance the film's overall dark feel. The setting is used to great effect as well, as you'll find out for yourself while you're watching this movie.<br /><br />The movie stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives from two different paths who happen to unite on a very chilling case. It begins with the death of a fat man who has ingested so much spaghetti that his killer hasn't necessarily done the deed, but has helped to create a morbid masterpiece of death that even boggles detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). The two seem to form a mutual respect and a unique bond as a result of eventually working on the cast together, and as the murders pile up, so does the suspense and the chills. The scariest moment of the film involves the discovery of a body in an apartment complex that looks like a corpse that, according to the evidence they find, has been there for over a year. When the body moves and wriggles around, you'll jump five feet out of your seat. They chase the killer down alleyways, cutting corners and getting hurt in the process. Again, the setting is incredibly strong, adding to the air of suspense present throughout the feature. As Somerset and Mills continue to compile evidence and theories to solve the mystery of the killer's "seven deadly sins" motive, he unwittingly shows up at the precinct and gives himself up...ah, but he's got a motive.<br /><br />While on the car ride out to the open to find the last of the killer's victims, they unwittingly end up in a game that leads one of them to a fatal flaw: the last two deadly sins. Mills doesn't realize that his wife was murdered by the killer, and he decided to take a prize with him: her head. The tension and suspense builds to such tight levels at this point near the close of the film, you'll be biting your nails and waiting for the rope to snap. Indeed, the ending proves to be quite powerful, and after the credits are rolling, you'll be asking yourself many questions and be praising the movie's tight weave of suspense and dark comedy.<br /><br />Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Leland Orser all make good impressions in this film, but without a doubt, Kevin Spacey nearly steals the show as the infamous killer who takes his work seriously and is so subdued and calm about his demeanor, you'll start to wonder whether the people you're around in your real life could be like him. Freeman and Pitt, again, are stellar in the lead roles, making you feel every bit of anguish, every laugh, every tear, every scare, every breath. You even start to feel the sweat and  the wounds like you've inherited them. The movie's cinematography is excellent, and the photography elements are perfectly set. No doubt this was Fincher's little masterpiece, and following it up with THE GAME only proved his importance in this genre.<br /><br />So while their are some genuine chills to be had, the atmosphere and smart script keep you on your toes. Working from a premise of such style and uniqueness, SEVEN is one of the best thrillers committed to film and should be viewed at least once in your lifetime. Don't let this pass you up...it could be your one and only sin.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I didn't watch Se7en until sometime last year. After watching it, I was amazed by it. I've never seen anything like it. A very disturbing thriller. I didn't have any clue as to how the movie would end. The whole time I was watching it, I didn't even leave my chair. My heart was just pounding. It just freaked me out. Not a lotta movie would do that. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow give great performances. And the 'John Doe' killer... I won't say who plays him for some of those who haven't seen this movie, but, like his other movies, he gives one helluva great performance. Overall, this is definately a classic. And it's not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Kevin Spacey has reached the top of the spooky scale with &quot;Seven&quot;. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play two detectives on the trail of a maniacal killer who is leaving bodies throughout the city, each with messages of the seven deadly sins of the bible. As the movie progresses, the race to catch the killer becomes more frantic and the story becomes even more thrilling. Also gracing the screen in &quot;Seven&quot; is Gwyneth Paltrow. All the actors do a great job, and make their characters very believable. &quot;Seven&quot; is a wonderfully, suspenseful movie that will have you on the edge of your seat to the end. &quot;Seven&quot; slashes it's way to five out of five stars and to the top of the must see movie list.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>when you see a realistic movie you know it's good. i liked this movie to every extent. it's a likeable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Morgan Freeman is the seasoned homicide detective and Brad Pitt his green and eager partner, a fresh trainee who thinks rules only exist to hamper good cops in "Se7en". The title refers to the deadly sins which collectively inspire some horrible serial killer to perpetrate particularly gory murders (one man is overfed to death, another is kept in bed with his limbs and tongue removed, still another is forced to perform an act of unspeakable sexual violation). There isn't much of a story here, mostly because director David Fincher spends most of his time on the visuals - the setting is some barely identifiable city where the weather is perpetually horrible (it's always raining, like in Blade Runner), and everybody looks like they deserve some kind of divine retribution. Unfortunately, the visuals not only take attention from the story, they make it almost impossible to understand what the story really is. (Just like in Fincher's "Alien3", only that film did sustain a fair amount of suspense for the first half hour). The characters aren't well developed - with Freeman playing his worldly wise self, Pitt as the young hotwire slated to replace him, and Kevin Spacey as the object of their hunt. Besides the stars, everybody else seems to exist in some form only slightly more substantial than the fog that engulfs the city. When the killer turns himself in (you didn't think a script this thin allowed for some real detective work, did you?) the lack of character definition is clear. Who is the killer and how has his hunt been brought to end - are questions that you not only can't answer after finishing this movie, but you are sapped for any reason to even care. The film ends on a major cop out. I can't believe somebody thought that the cooler thrills of "Silence of the Lambs" were any way touched by this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I know why lots of people liked this film.  It has many upcoming stars, like Paltrow, and some established ones who are not too bad (Pitt and Freedman).  Then there are the biblical references and the planing of a chess-player style killer.  But beyond some frills, is there really anything all that original or interesting?  Unfortunately, with the exception of some vivid images and special effects, the answer is no.  Moreover, the film is lacking in an original spirit, somethings that sets it apart on a fundamental level.  I did not see it and frankly, I hped to find it.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>A very good movie in that it pulls you in and keeps you watching; however, it is ultimately flawed in the same way as was the similar (and far inferior) 'Bone Collector' -- The psycho killer's plans absolutely hinge on the timely discovery and proper interpretation of the quite obscure "clues" he leaves behind for the detectives. The storyline fails on this point because at the beginning we are told that Sommerset (Freeman) is to retire in a few days. That he was really the only detective who could have possibly both discovered and deciphered the meaning of said "clues" left me wondering how the psycho could have banked on him -- or any one of the much lesser detectives -- to have done the job he needed them to do. Also, by the storyline itself we are told that the psycho set his plan in motion at least a year before Brad Pitt's character ever showed up on the scene, and he thus could not have known that Pitt was going to transfer in from upstate. Yet, his ultimate plan was intimately intertwined with Pitt. Huh??? I recommend Fincher's superior "Zodiac" for a real psycho-killer plot without any holes, since it is based upon actual events. (I also recommend my favorite Fincher film, "The Game" -- totally incredible and cool!).</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This movie was so original at the time of it's release, but it has been copied so many time we forget this is where it all began. A gritty ingenious taunt thriller/horror/mystery film that is just the best of it's kind! Another golden performance by Freeman and Spacey is at his chilling best! It seems that every horror film I see now has ripped this film off in some way! Forget the phonies and check this one out again and if you haven't seen it......be prepared for an unforgetable journey! The 2 disc set has a great transfer and loads of extras!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I originally watched this film a few years ago, and found it too terrifying, and vowed never to watch it again. The ending was the main part that freaked me out. I bought it on DVD for Christmas and decided to take a chance and watch it again. To my surprise, I found it less scary, more enjoyable, and I didn't remember any of it. I'd obviously blocked a lot of it out!<p>There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in this film. The old cop near retiring partnered with the young cop, with a thirst for blood; you know something's going to happen to the young couple who look into each others eyes lovingly - especially when the wife can't find the right moment to tell her husband she's pregnant - and the fact it seems to be constantly raining. It always seems to be raining in cop films, which makes the film even darker. <p>All of the actors do a great job. Morgan Freeman is his usual self, never smiling, although it was great to hear him laughing in this film - I don't think I've ever heard that before. Brad Pitt was looking rather fine in this, especially when he got rained on. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty and rather underused and there was some unusual chemistry between her and Brad - considering they were dating around this time. <p>This film isn't for the faint-hearted. I didn't find it as scary second time round, although I had a cushion handy just in case. OK, it's a story about murders based on the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath. So prepare yourself for the unexpected! Look out for the lust murder, as I found that to be the worst of the seven. Any female out there will be wincing, crossing her legs, and never wanting to let a guy near her again! Ouch to say the least. <p>This film will leave you guessing right up until the last minute - and at just two hours long, that's a lot of minutes to be guessing who the killer is! It's a good film, although I couldn't watch it more than once. Maybe again in another couple of years, and I haven't been refusing to watch it because of the ending which wasn't what I remembered/imagined it to be!</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>Maybe I am spoiled having seen the entertaining and taut "The Silence of the Lambs". Maybe serial killer thrillers will never measure up to that one. I can't dismiss "Se7en" completely, but I did find it overrated. It's been praised often and by many. Sure, it's atmospheric and gruesome, but so is most familys' junk drawer.<br /><br />Rain looks good in movies. It enhances the mood in film noir, in romance, in horror, in suspense, and in detective tales. But this is ridiculous excess. In a constantly rainy metropolis, we learn about this madman who has been inspired by the seven deadly sins. This detective yarn becomes predictable as it progresses. By the ending you can figure out what's about to go down.<br /><br />I do wish the screenplay was better; the relationship between the two main characters could have been really well defined, even witty and clever. Instead we get the 'same-old same-old' detective partners: wise one and reckless one. It's been done a bajillion times.<br /><br />Of course the production design was fairly effective-- but you expect that in a film like this anyway (and style doesn't win me over much if the story doesn't enthrall me at all). And the score by Howard Shore was good. But overall this is the sort of thriller that I see once and then have no wish to view again. It just didn't live up to the praise, for me personally.<br /><br />Bottom line: Worth a rental if you never saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I saw this movie in the theater when I was in high school, and walked out totally shocked.

While the actors are, of course, top notch (who actually dislikes Morgan Freeman?

Then, some years later my father-in-law sent the vhs to my wife and me. SEVEN started out promising enough: the heavy atmosphere of a generic urban blight region, the deliberately paced filming, etc. You're set up for a terribly complex, suspenseful thriller. But it never fulfilled that promise. The movie strives for the psychological depth of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or IN COLD BLOOD but never reaches it. I mean, the killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his model for the murders, so you think maybe he or she is a misguided religious nut? Duh. I dunno. Has it ever been done before? <p>And once you see who portrays the killer (although other reviewers have &quot;given it away&quot;), I think you'll kind of grimace and say, &quot;Jeez, he was always playing the weird bad guy back in those days.&quot; And, to me, his performance is kind of a throw-away job. He almost seems to not want to be in the picture.<p>Freeman and Pitt give good performances, however, Although the chemistry between them seemed strained (unlike the wonderful Glover and Gibson pairing in the LETHAL WEAPON films), the combination is effective, overall. I enjoyed watching them. The cinematography was engaging enough, and the direction elicited a few good scares. I guess I was expecting a really good thriller mystery--at least I was supposed to, given all the hooplah, Instead, I got a fairly-decent though brutal film. See it before you decide to buy it, or before your father-in-law sends you a copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>This is a crime story like no other. Most of these kind of, serial killer on the loose, movies don't get into such specific detail of the crimes like in SEVEN. When I saw Seven as a kid, I thought it was disgusting, but not necessarily scary, when everyone was told it was a horror before it came to theatre's. It is a horror in a way. But a different "kind" of horror. I was too young to understand everything that occured throughout the film. I had to ask mom some questions but she never gave me a blunt answer. She always sugar coated everything up. Now I'm 23, and I've seen SEVEN many times. The most disturbing scene in the movie is (I'm not sure if everyone understood) but I did.. it was when detective mills and sommerset go to that bondage shop to see a photograph of an object the store-owner made for joe doe (the killer) It doesn't really let you see the photo for that long. Only a quick glance but if you have it on DVD you can pause it and get a good look at it. First, it is a ribbed knife over 8 inches long that straps around the guys waiste like a strap on adult toy, but instead it's a knife, and in the photo a real person is not wearing it, only a dummy. Then, when he goes after his next victim, the killer goes to a whore-house, and barges in on a man who paid for the hooker. He pulls out a gun, and forces the married man to put on the weapon and told him to "F*ck her". If you can imagine how brutal that is. It is a bit crossing the line in a very disturbing way. They show the photo again, when they are questioning the tramatized man who was forced to kill the prostitute by stabbing her reproductive organs with an 8 inch knife. Once again, that's a very graphic thing to have in a movie. And the other murders were especially haneous. Over feeding the fat man to death, cutting off the beauty queen's face, forcing atrition on the lawyer to cut his own stomach open, cutting off gweneth's head, and torturing a drug dealer for a year. It ceratinly isnt a bed time story, or for the religious fanatics.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>This was my first time seeing SEVEN.I know it was a hit when it was released years ago.I know that some wonderful actors starred in it.How has it aged?<br /><br />1.There is little in SEVEN that held my interest.The story of a weary gumshoe and his hot-shot snot-nosed newbie partner is as old as the hills.One wants to retire and the other is shot-from-guns-ready to jump at anything.This story was done way before SEVEN and has continually been rehashed on every crime show that television offers.<br /><br />2.The story is slow and the film weighs in at a tiresome 127 minutes.It takes three murders and a lot of setting up of the characters and their back-stories to come to the first really tense moment resulting in a chase of any kind.We must see the tableaux of gluttony,greed and sloth before we are treated to any action.Perhaps David Flincher wanted to set us up in the manner of methodical exactness that his killer was creating,but this made for tiresome,lets-move-this-thing along-while-staring-at-the-"counter" on the vcr.A lot of material about the seven deadly sins are introduced and shot and not developed from sources such as Dante's "Divine Comedy",Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" and other ponderous volumes.I suppose this is to give the film an intellectual flavor that never lingers on the palette, but passes right on through and comes out to be flushed away and not explained.<br /><br />3.It rained everyday.<br />There were no people around in New York when the investigations were  going on.(When does that EVER happen).<br /><br />4.The clues were so in-your-face that the "gut-wrenching climax?" came as no surprise.One only needed to pay attention to the scene between Paltrow and Freeman in the cafe to know where this was going to end.<br /><br />5.I still think that Brad Pitt is no actor.I simply cannot see why this fellow gets work!Pretty faces do not an actor make!<br /><br />6.I still admire to the utmost Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow and their expert acting skills.They are far better than Pitt could ever dream!<br /><br />7.Kevin Spacey seems only to ever play the same dead-eyed vacuous maniac even if the film is not a thriller.<br /><br />SEVEN may be more appealing to some than it was to me.I honestly cannot see any value to the film for story line,rising action,editing,soundtrack ,direction or acting beyond one viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>I was in angst how to rate this film... my knee-jerk reaction was to give  it 5 stars because of the realistic portrayal of a sick serial killer and  the incredible acting by every member of the cast.  The film was finely  filmed and put together and the acting was flawless, but on the overall  star meter I have to ask myself, &quot;Would I ever recommend this film to  anybody, anywhere, under any circumstances?&quot; And the resounding answer  is &quot;No!&quot;  <p>I saw it a few years ago when so many people made  such a big deal on how good it was. And good it was indeed, but it has to  be one of the most sick, disturbing films I have ever seen. I continued to  ask myself, &quot;Why?&quot; Why would anyone feel compelled to make a  movie like this?  It offers no solutions, no social redeeming values, it  doesn't educate, it just reviles and sickens and brings out the worst in  humanity.  I've seen some sick &amp; twisted films before, but never have I  felt so covered with mind filth as when I finished watching this horrific  nightmare of a tale that is too real in light of today's violent society.  <p>Kevin Spacey is bone-chilling as he portrays the sick serial killer who  is out to dispense judgement to those who commit the seven deadly sins. His  twisted, perverted mind is very like that of a real serial killer who has  their own perception of right and wrong, not realizing how deceived they've  become.  <p>The search to find the killer keeps you on your toes, but the  ending is very predictable and the movie itself is a disgusting heap of  violence, blood, sinew and twisted sexual perversion.  I have got images  dancing around in my head since seeing this film that I can not remove. If  I had known how awful this experience would have been, I would have avoided  the film altogether.<p>Film students and horror &amp; mystery buffs may  still enjoy it (especially if they have cast iron stomachs) and fans of  Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey will not be let down by their masterful  performances -- BUT I feel compelled to warn anyone who has yet to see this  film... THINK, think very long and hard if this is a film you feel like you  can not live without seeing. Frankly, I would have been better off as a  human being had I not seen it, and I certainly could never watch this  again.  To say the least, this is not a film for kids... but in my opinion,  it's not a film for people of any age.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Each decade has a seminal detective yarn.  In the 30's and 40's wisecracking, cynical gumshoes roamed the city.  Bogart played those cunning detectives, always in control.  In the 70's and 80's Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry tired of government bureaucracy and asked criminals if they felt lucky today before he took care of business.  And he was in control. In the Clinton 90's the maniac murderers are in control.  Morgan Freeman is reluctant to barge into the killer's apartment because he doesn't have a warrant.  Brad Pitt barges in with Dirty Harry force, but by the end of the movie he has been coerced by the murderer's cunning.  It wasn't Clinton's fault he lost control in the Oval office, and it's not Brad's fault he loses it either.  Bogart and Eastwood control the crime scene and avert mayhem by killing or capturing the bad guys.  Germany and Japan had to get a belly full of lead.  I guess those pesky terrorists have us by the b###s now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I thought Morgan Freeman(Ironically a Cheater himself years later in real Life) and Brad Pitt(on a roll) did their part good,the story is unique but overall I found the movie disturbing and over the top when it came to the mayhem, on top of that you have Kevin Spacey(someone I detest and always plays the bad guy so it is fitting). My problem doesn't lay with the story but the way it carries itself in total disgust.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>The Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a high-water mark in the release of modern film classics, and puts some recent Criterion releases to shame.  This is a film that deserved a thoughtful release, and it got it.<p>Se7en is a film that works perfectly despite (or rather, because of) the formulaic set-up: rookie homicide detective Mills (Brad Pitt) is paired with a crusty old veteran, detective Sommerset (Morgan Freemen), who is in his last days before retirement.  This, of course, is exactly when a Brilliant Serial Killer With a Diabolical Plan decides to commit a series of ghastly murders.  Naturally, films in this genre need to have a &quot;hook&quot;, a conceit that gives the murders a possibly predictable pattern.  This way our intrepid detectives can engage the killer in a battle of wits, a Race Against Time to save lives before the Master Plan is completed.  In this case, the title says it all - the serial killer is patterning his crimes after the seven deadly sins.<p>But here is where Se7en veers off course, and, in the process, becomes a real masterpiece of the genre. This familiar, well-worn surface is a deception. Se7en wants you to relax, thinking you know the territory, and then pull the proverbial rug out. I won't tell you what happens or who the serial killer turns out to be (just in case you are one of the few people on Earth who doesn't know by now), but even if you figure it all out beforehand, it won't do you any good.  You will still sweat.  You will still squirm.  You will still peek through your fingers - which is a shame, since the feature on DVD #1 was transferred from the original camera negative under the supervision of director David Fincher.  In the commentary track, Fincher himself says that this is probably the best that Se7en has ever looked.<p>When you uncover your eyes again, you can then get lost for many hours in the formidable collection of supplemental material on DVD #2.  Most fascinating is a detailed look at the creation of the prop journals featured in the serial killer's lair.  It is not often that we stop to consider that someone actually has to create the stuff we see on screen, and that they often labor for weeks to get something just right - only to have it handled for a few moments by an actor and then discarded.<p>In all, the Se7en New Line Platinum Series edition is a valuable addition to any serious film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's interesting watch Seven because it's quite depressing and bleak with none of that hope at the end of the tunnel hidden away somewhere. It's gritty and realistic. David Fincher manages to make a film with those qualities but without alienating the viewer which is quite a feat. I don't know many people who would watch such a dark film without it being too much so.<br /><br />Detective Somerset is literally 7 days away from retirement. He gets paired up with a new partner, Detective Mills. Their first assignment is a really fat guy who looks like he was fed to death. Somerset realizes that criminals don't take this long to do a murder, the murder has to have a meaning.<br /><br />Mills finds a 2nd body: a lawyer who's had a pound of flesh cut from him. The word Greed is written on the floor. Somerset returns to the fat guy's apartment and finds the word "Gluttony" in grease. A-ha! The killer's using the 7 deadly sins as basis for his murders: Envy, Pride, Lusy, Wrath, Sloth, Lust and Envy. He helps Mills in following the clues so that they can hopefully stop the killer before he completes his 7.<br /><br />Even on repeated viewings, the cat and mouse game they're involved with still seems interested as the killer is always one step ahead, leaving clues that tend to be a little less obvious, such as turning a painting upside down so that the detectives are clued in that there's fingerprints behind the painting.<br /><br />The 2 actors provide a nice counterbalance: Pitt as Mills is brash, abrasive and likes to swear a lot. Freeman as Somerset is very calm, knowledgable and neat. In one of the earlier scenes, Mills wakes up with kind of wrinkly looking clothes and a messy apartment while Somerset has everything ironed, straightened out and everything.<br /><br />As for the films near infamous ending it does come out of left field and isn't the most happiest. Which is quite nice in a film where something actually terrible happens instead of the cop who walks away with just a bullet in his leg while the rest of him emotionally and physically he's fine. The 2 main characters both walk away from this film feeling very affected by what happened.<br /><br />As for parents who are concerned over kiddies watching? Definately do not let them see this. The murders; while never seeing what happened they just show the aftermath of it, are quite violent and brutal. To detail an example: one victim is raped forcibly with a strap-on only the object in the end is quite sharp and knife-like. You don't see anything, you just see a picture, which makes your mind go into overdrive about how painful it must've been, which is a nice touch by Fincher. A lot of times our mind creates the worst imaginable if we can't know what exactly it was.<br /><br />It's a really great film if you're old enough. It's got action and a bit of humor and it's a film that likes to last with you whether you want it to or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.<p>However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do - even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>There are only a handful of films that are good enough for me to benchmark the experience of seeing them in the theater.  Se7en is one of those movies.  I saw the film for the first time with a group of friends on a college trip.  We went into the film laughing and joking, and when we emerged, we were all totally silent for at least fifteen minutes.  We were still recovering from the shock of this film, the benchmark by which I have since judged all suspense thrillers. <p>The film is exceptionally well-written, merging classical elements of the ars praedicandi (the ancient teaching texts to which Freeman's character refers in the film), with Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost with a serial murder investigation in a modern metro area.  While the exact location is nondescript, the location is simultaneously nowhere and everywhere, thus making this "everycity" that much more disturbing.<p>Freeman is brilliantly cast as the aging, jaded Detective Somerset, ready to retire, while Brad Pitt makes the perfect brash foil to Freeman's Somerset.  A character study in contrast, Pitt's impulsive irreverence keeps the viewer engaged and entertained, while Freeman's brooding Somerset provides necessary exposition and grounds the story with his shrewd, patient omniscience.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's John Doe is one of the most frightening villans to have ever graced the screen, not merely because of the horrible murders the character commits, but because of the character's cool amorality regarding his own actions.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Leland Orser also make appearances in gut-wrenching supporting roles.<p>Not intended for those who are pregnant or nursing or for those who have heart or kidney conditions, this film will grab your viscera and twist them until you want to beg for mercy, then make you want to come back for more.  This is more than just another genre film.  It redefines the suspense/thriller genre, and its brutal ending becomes only marginally less upsetting on subsequent viewings.  <p>The Platinum Edition DVD is a must in this case.  With digitally enhanced negative transfer, digitally remastered surround sound, and loads of special features, the film finally looks and sounds like the masterpiece it is.  If you only saw this movie in the theater, you have not seen this film the way Fincher intended it to be seen. <p>Fincher's commentary track is, like the commentary on Fight Club, thoroughly entertaining and enlightening, and he has gone into the vault to provide us with an alternate opening sequence, as well as a coda-less ending, and a vastly different storyboarded ending that was never filmed.  Only special feature that could have easily been omitted is Morgan Freeman's whiny, self-absorbed commentary track.  I respect Freeman immensely as an actor, but he's rather annoying when allowed to ramble on unscripted.  <p>Another one of the best films of the 1990s, the Platinum Series version of Se7en is a must for any DVD collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I would never dream of comparing anyone to Alfred Hitchcock.  But, David Fincher, comes damn close.  They have a lot of similarities, but the biggest one that I see is the desire to be precise and perfect.  <p>Seven is Fincher's second movie!  His first being an underrated Alien 3.  In his second effort, Fincher crafted, what I think, to be the best suspense/thriller in thirty-years.  Unique.  Gut churning.  Awesomely acted.  Every shot compliments the next.  Every shot is perfect.  The sound track was perfectly thought out.  Like Hitchcock... the script was well-fleshed out, everything was perfect BEFORE HAND, and everything was perfect afterward.<p>In a sess-pool of cookie-cutter &quot;yes&quot; men that are succeeding in the movie business, Fincher emerged and did it his way.  Thankfully, he continues to do it his way.  Following &quot;Seven&quot;, he continued to do masterful work with well-written movies like &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  &quot;The Panic Room&quot; is coming out soon and I can't wait.<p>It isn't quantity that counts... it's quality.  Fincher takes his time and makes sure it's done RIGHT.  <p>SEVEN.... I think, was and is one the most underrated movies ever.  It will be a classic and is one the best movies ever made.</p></br></body></html>

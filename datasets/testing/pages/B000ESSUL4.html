All are present here in abundance, and your appreciation of the film will depend greatly on your acceptance and enjoyment of his technique and themes, or not.<br /><br />Frankly, I waver back and forth on Mallick's film-making style.  I argued vociferously with friends over the merits of The Thin Red Line.  And yet, I could understand their impatience with the intermitten "poetic" fancies.  And there is a certain underlying naivete to his views of nature being paradisical and the notion of the "noble savage" the pure innocence of "primitive" man in nature that sometime smacks of Philosophy 101.  Likewise, his romanticism and poetic flights can be simplistic and mythic.<br /><br />But I always find his films interesting and beautiful to watch.  He is usually greatly helped by the fine actors that always want to work with him, and never more so than here with Christopher Plummer, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale.  And a master-stroke of casting and good luck was his find of the young Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, who is the heart and soul of the film.  She is graceful, lovely and simply luminous, and makes the story of her life and the men who loved her absolutely believable.<br /><br />Amidst his romanticism, Mallick has always been able to find the harsh realities as well.  The spree killings in Badlands, the  betrayal and murder in Days of Heaven , combat in The Thin Red Line.  Here it is the harshness and disintegration of Jamestown, depicted vividly and memorably.<br /><br />Also, whatever I thought I knew about the Pocahontas story was sadly lacking, and I found much information here, if correct, with which I was unfamiliar.  And it is a fascinating story.<br /><br />So, this is a film that will not appeal to a broad audience.  Mallick's technique is a real turn-off to many viewers.  Even though I admire much of the film, at times I get impatient with it as well.  I find, for me, the incredible sense of "this is what it must have been like" to encounter this "New World" of pristine forest and river and marsh worth indulging the rest.  "This is the forest primeval" indeed, and the people and land have never been depicted more forcefully.  It envelops you.<br /><br />Finally, there is a love story (or actually two) told here that, in the end, is worth seeing.  So, my recommendation is for those with the patience to let a film unfold in its own way, and for those not off-put by fragmented, sometimes enigmatic, voice-over musings as narration.  The film can be trying, but it has its own rewards.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's DVD movie was "The New World," the story of John Smith and Pocahontas and the settlements in the New World. I discovered the DVD on our DVD shelves. Evidently my wife must have purchased it and put it there for future viewing. It figures. It's the type of story she'd enjoy.<br /><br />Well, to me the movie seemed ultra-long and really dragged out. Maybe I'm just more used to action movies but this one really had a glacial pace. Some of the sets were rather good and it gave the feeling of a wild frontier in a strange new land. The photography was quite good. The acting was of the slow moving school where little is happening. The savages were, well, savages. I really can't remember seeing such a dreary depiction of American Natives. The fight scenes looked like really primitive brawls, which they might well have been. The storied love match between Smith and Pocahontas seemed to lack any kind of zest. All in all, the movie just ground along at it's ultra-slow pace and I grew somewhat weary of watching it. Maybe I was just not in the right mood. Maybe it was just not all that good of a movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Terrence Malick is a director who really does want to be anonymous...

It's one man's vision and he sees it with visuals and with sounds of nature... Smith and the little Indian teenager were very in love with each other and Malick show it very gently and beautifully in his film...<br /><br />Colin Farrell embodied the character of Smith, his age, his right spirit... He is an adventurer with energetic power...He gives a solid, believable performance playing Captain John Smith, the mutinous explorer whose mastery of experience and his inability to stay in one place, increases his desire to look ahead and explore new horizons, always wondering where he will be next...<br /><br />Q'Orianka Kilcher stands as Mataoka or Pocahontas, the incredibly strong young woman, obviously incredibly smart and lightning... She is her father's favor, very innocent, very playful, in touch with everything, in touch with the earth, with the sun, with the sky, worshipping the beauty of the nature... Smith was vividly drawn to her because of her ability to represent the beauty that's he never experienced before...<br /><br />Pocahontas was really looking for bringing two totally different worlds together and collaborating for peace... She was a big dreamer with wildly unrealistic expectations... Malick taught her how to act through silence, and she conveys what she was saying in words through her silence...<br /><br />Malick is an interesting director, and a great philosopher...

It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third.<br /><br />Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I expected a film with a little more dialog and action, so I was a bit disappointed with the film.  It is a beautifully shot and acted film with some minor historical faults.  Some people were dragged into the quiet story, but I was a little bored and found that the movie didn't really flow well for me.  I love films that showcase Native Americans in a positive and accurate light such as Dances With Wolves or A Man Called Horse, but this film just wasn't as captivating as those films were for me.  If you do like this film(rent it first) there is a longer (15 minutes) British version you might want to pick up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I can see where some would think this an outstanding film, others a dreary, drawn out disaster. It is not what we expect from  a "settling in America" love story. It is  beautifully photographed and, often, well acted. It tells a story fundamental to the myths of America  and tells it well. Yet, it makes no concession to the rhythms of American film-making, the expectations  of an American audience. It is slow, even when events are dramatic, the film is not; better, it is dramatic in a measured way with the drama implicit in the scenery, the walk, the glance. Frankly, I watched it over a period of three days, able to enjoy it only in a series of segments, one at a time. So, judge what kind of viewer you are before ordering this for an evenings  pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>When the native Algonquin tribe looks out over their unspoiled Eden and sees two British navel ships, their reaction is a mixture of interest and astonishment. Who are these strange men who have landed on their shore, with their white faces, lank hair and strange smells? Yet their thunderstruck reaction to the Englishmen who are slowly infiltrating their land is laced with concern that has yet to blossom into worry.<br /><br />The English convey that lands in Virginia in 1607 - scored to a gorgeously striking flourish of horns - will spell doom for the native Indians; and over time their way of life, their culture will gradually disintegrate. The Jamestown colonists, led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) eventually lands his men, intent for them to eke out a life in this strange and lush world.<br /><br />For Jamestown - named after King James 1 - will be the new, enlightened, and egalitarian society, free from the suffocating social strictures of merry old England. When Newport promptly vanishes back to England for reinforcements, the settlement's security is placed in the hands of the formerly disgraced Captain John Smith (a very good Colin Farrell).<br /><br />However, things aren't going well for this fledgling colony - the landscape proves to be harsh, food becomes scarce, with these inexperienced European outcasts beginning to wonder of they will ever be able to survive in this alien world. In search of food, Smith leads an expedition up the Chickahominy River, but along the way when a Powhatan tribe attacks his group and he is taken prisoner.<br /><br />Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg) is prepared for slaughter Smith, but at the last minute Pocahontas  (Q'orianka Kilcher), intervenes and his life is spared. Powhatan agrees to let him remain and teach the princess his language, hoping that her friendship with the Captain will tell him of the visitors' intentions.<br /><br />But as Smith familiarizes himself with the ways of the tribe he considers the possibility of staying on to live among them. He's fallen in love with the princess, who passionately requites his feelings and he sees in their civilization - a lack of greed, vice and cynicism, a new way of being that is lacking in his own.<br /><br />The New World is a gorgeously evocative, sad, heart wrenching and bittersweet movie, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki capturing the epic grandeur and luminosity of the 1607 Virginia landscape in all its sensual glory. Terrance Malick's direction is languid and fluid - there's not a scene, or a camera angle wasted, as he allows this incredible cinematic experience to gradually unfurl.<br /><br />Watching this beautiful movie unfold conveys the strangeness and magnitude of human history, the weight of human endurance and the power of compassion and love. As Pocahontas is betrayed by her tribe, banished by her father and sold to the settlers as insurance - the slow transformation of her into a corseted and heeled Englishwoman, where she says good-bye to her native roots - is at once tragic and profound.<br /><br />When she eventually meets tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and he asks her to marry him, we know that the transformation of the princess is complete. Although she does not immediately love him, the scenes between them are tentative and caring. The acting is superlative with Farrell, Bale and Kilcher making the most out of their mostly non-verbal roles, providing essential voice-overs as the action progresses.<br /><br />The New World is a languid and lovely dreamscape, a movie of symphonic proportions, a work of breathtaking imagination, and an all-embracing cinematic tone poem. And the use of Mozart's 23d Piano Concerto alerts us to the fact that this is European dream, even John Smith's dream; it's also the dream of a utopian "new world," and where the hopes of a new beginning are dashed, where perhaps victory can only come in the form of a splendid and divine savagery.

The result is sort of poetic journey to the `New World' with the mesmerizing beauty of the universe it depicts. Still `The New World' remains as elusive as the story of Pocahontas and the film looks sometimes confusing and emotionally detached.<br /><br />The story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith needs no introduction. It is part of the history of America, and Terence Malick tries to present it as accurately as possible. Every scene is shot with the available light. The life in Fort Jamestown is terribly desolate, and there is nothing glorious about the battles between the immigrants and the natives. The film also avoids showing any political messages about this `New World.'<br /><br />But accuracy alone cannot make a film. To tell the story, Terence Malick uses curious method that would divide the opinions among the viewers. That is, the slow-moving film seldom uses dialogues. Instead of that, Malick employs the voiceovers of each character, which reveals his/her heart directly to the audiences, not to another character. I know the intention, and I even admire that, but the results are hardly effective. The spoken language here lacks the emotion while the film is about the emotion about a man - no, two men -- and a woman. These spoken words sound like the unrefined English translation of the old Greek poems. Or maybe that is the point.<br /><br />I don't know Colin Farrell is the first choice of Terence Malick for the role of Captain John Smith. I hear the raving reviews about the acting of him and Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, but frankly I am not sure. Their acting in the first act, especially that of Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply amazing, using the expressive body language to the full, but in the second half, in which the Captain makes a grave decision, they begin to look less convincing. Why did he do that? How did she accept that? Terence Malick leaves that part to our imagination, but gives no clue with which we can interpret the key scenes.<br /><br />Or did I miss something? I don't know. True, I was absorbed in the lush scenery, the amazingly lively portrait of Pocahontas, and the New World itself. I can still feel the beauty of it after leaving the theater. At the same time, I think the beauty of the paradise and its innocence does not need the sprawling 135 minutes and the unfocused narrative. `The New World' is like watching a great painting in museum; some can do it for hours, and even love it, but others prefer something different.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Terrence Malick is simply the greatest living American filmmaker. Only Stanley Kubrick was his equal or superior. That's not to say that Martin Scorsese nor Woody Allen have not made great films, but they've both made stinkers in their careers, and neither has had a great film in over a decade (although I've heard good things about Allen's current Match Point). Not only is Malick the best filmmaker in the nation, despite The New World being only his 4th film in the 33 years since his first, Badlands, was released, but he may be the only filmmaker in the world who truly has developed his own cinematic language- apart from a reliance on the written words of a screenplay to carry the bulk of the film's art and story. He is also the greatest American historian in the cinematic art form. It's his fort&eacute; alone.<br />  Better still, he never condescends in his films. He presents his tales sparely, with cinematography, enough dialogue to convey the scene, and occasional voiceovers that play off the visuals and imagery to leave a poetic dissonance in the viewer's mind that the mind is forced to fill in the synapse with its own meaning, thus creating narrative from symbols, visuals, and their interplay. It truly is a different and new form of screenwriting; and a great form, one wholly enmeshed in the medium that birthed it. What makes it great are not the words, but their relation to what is on the screen. Simple declarative and/or descriptive sentences, such as Smith's descriptions of Pocahontas, `She exceeded the others not only in beauty and proportion, but in wit and spirit, too,' or Rolfe's ideas about her, `When first I saw her, she was regarded as someone broken, lost,' transcend Shakespearean depth in this new medium, and in centuries hence Terrence Malick will get his due as one of the giants of the `early', first century of human cinema.<br />  The actual meat of this film is the by now almost fabular tale of John Smith (Colin Farrell) and his `love'- Pocahontas (although that name is never used in the film)- during the settling of Jamestown by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) and his charges. All the familiar facts are presented- he is captured by her tribe, her father, Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg), releases him when she saves him from death. He grows to respect the Indians, returns to Jamestown, abandons her when she is outcast by her father for supposedly betraying her people by feeding the English during the winter, then giving them seeds to grow crops, and she ends up marrying John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a kind widower whose son has also died, taking the Christian name Rebecca, giving him another son, and wowing the English court.<br />  If film can achieve sheer apports with its art, then Terrence Malick is the lone levitator and magician around. The only minor negative point in this film, and it's very minor, is that as well-done as the voiceovers are the film might have been better off without them, for some of the poetic statements of Smith, Rolfe, and Pocahontas seem a bit over the heads of their 17th Century low born utterers- unlike those in his earlier films. Of all the films that are getting Oscar buzz- from worthy films like Capote and Shopgirl, to blatantly PC fodder like Brokeback Mountain, this is- easily- the best film that last year produced. Yet, it will only get some cinematography, editing, scoring, or other minor nods.<br />  There is a ritualistic feel to this film that glues one's eyes to it, from its sublime opening to its choral ending shot of New World trees reaching sunward, even to its non-standard non-black screen credits at the end. This is not a film, but an experience, and that is not me trying to sound poetic, but really defining the film. See it, then get the DVDs of his earlier films and see that real, great art still exists. Then, if you want to go back to crap after that, I'm sure Spielberg will have another clunker ready in a few months. People like him always do. Yet, it'll probably be another decade before we get a Malick masterpiece. Sigh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>I found a good deal of the plot  very difficult to understand.  For instance, why did the English initiate war on the Indians, and why didn't the Indians just wipe out the English . . . it would have been easy for them.  There was mystery surrounding the motivation of Pocahontas and her attraction to John Smith . . but it wasn't important to understand this relationship in the appreciation of this movie.<br /><br />The worth of the movie is in the depiction of the Indians and the English.  The Indians were shown as what we would only call savages today, but they knew their land, knew how to grow crops, had an intricate social structure, etc.  They also appeared to be living as they were shown for millennia, with neither a knowledge of progress, or a desire for progress once they recognized it in the behavior of the English.  The English, on the other hand, were shown as physically dirty, unable to cope with the land or to support themselves from the land, and they appeared arbitrary and severe with each other.  But they did represent progress.<br /><br />This was a worthwhile movie for the scenery and the overall impressions of the people at that time in our history.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE NEW WORLD is supposedly a film about John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe.  I say supposedly because even though the plot of the film is centered around the love triangle between the three, the film really has very little to do with them.  That's because this is a film written and directed by Terrence Malick.  Malick's movies have a style completely of their own and there is no other filmmaker who makes movies the way Malick does.  Malick's movies are like viewing a piece of continuous art that goes on for miles and miles.  Watching a Malick flick is akin to experiencing a long and peaceful dream.  The movie is filled with one beautiful image after another with very little dialogue.<br /><br />The plot of the film is taken from history.  It's the 17th Century and John Smith leads a company of men upriver from their Jamestown colony to trade with the Indians.  He's taken prisoner and falls in love with Princess Pocahontas.  Knowing that he is being depended upon, Smith returns to the colony.  The natives attack the colony.  Pocahontas is taken captive.  Smith is ordered to leave Jamestown.  John Rolfe, a rich tobacco farmer, arrives at Jamestown. Rolfe falls in love with Pocahontas.  The two are married.  Later she's reunited with Smith and has to decide whom she will spend her life with.<br /><br />Colin Farrell has a lot of screen time in the movie.  Personally I think this is one of Farrell's best performances ever.  Of course, that might have to do with the fact that he doesn't speak for over half of the film.  Q'Orianka Kilcher portrays Pocahontas and does a remarkable job.  Christian Bale portrays John Rolfe and though he's not as interesting as he is as Bruce Wayne, he's a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I usually don't like art films.  I like a movie to have a great story told well, a movie with some great characterization, or a film that includes all of that.  I saw THIN RED LINE, Malick's previous picture, when it came out and it almost put me to sleep.  It was beautifully shot, but I just couldn't get into it.  Since then I've learned a thing or two about cinematography and I respect the type of pictures that Malick makes.  Even though I didn't like THE NEW WORLD as much as a movie such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or a solid drama like SIDEWAYS, I still enjoyed the movie.  It relaxed me and after viewing the film I had a very restful night of sleep.<br /><br />There are many people who will not enjoy THE NEW WORLD.  If someone believes THE NEW WORLD is a historical epic, they will be sorely disappointed.  If someone believes THE NEW WORLD is a movie full of action sequences, they will also be disappointed.  THE NEW WORLD is like a piece of art, you can only enjoy it if you are willing to explore it from every angle and even then it might not make complete sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>I went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of Northern America. Having only really seen Pocahontas through the eyes of Disney, I felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I found the photography and the scenery to be simply stunning. Visually, the film wows the viewer. The scenes simply amaze with their beauty, the sets with their majesty and also rustic simplicity. Coupled with the musical score, this was some of the best camera work I have seen in a long time. This was, in my opinion, the sole redeeming feature of the film.<br /><br />While the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love, allegiance and so on, it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration. In one part, the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened.<br /><br />For actors of the calibre of Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, this film did not show them at their best. Certainly not the worst I have seen by any stretch, but definitely not the best I have seen from either one of these actors.<br /><br />Tread with caution on this one, and hire it before you buy it. I am glad I did not spend good money purchasing it. Quite frankly, it is a great cure for insomnia.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>One only needs to know the small body of work that Terrence Malick has created to know his intentions. Those films are unmercifully powerful; the man's vision is absolute. He abhors violence, and has put to screen 4 magnificent films that can only make one hope that the public at large will realize that violence only begets violence. He must have a following in Hollywood; when he was casting for "The Thin Red Line", his big "comeback", everyone wanted to be in it. And a great film it is. "The New World" is rife with Malick-isms, most especially with the care of his cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki, it's only Oscar nomination) to show off the beauty of the world around us. Let's enjoy it in peace... Colin Ferrell is solid in the role of John Smith, and Christoher Plummer, Christian Bale, and an especially nasty David Thewliss are also very fine. The auspicious debut of Q'orianka Kilcher is subdued, haunting and quite magnificent. No matter of detail is missed, and the art direcion is to be commended. Without blabbing away the plot, I can only say that this is another big feather in Terrence Malick's cap... One can not be in a hurry when it comes to Malick. He sees everything, and he knows his material. Relax, take it in, and love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'The New World' envelops the viewer with laguorous grandeur.  The story is familiar; we have known since our earliest days the story of Captain John Smith and his people's pilgrimage to the new world.  But the presentation in this film shakes the dust off our familiarity.  The camera shots and acting are expert for making us feel like we, too, are on that same journey with all its awe and innocense.  Refreshingly, the portrayal of natives and pilgrims is not clearly drawn as just heroes and villains for either side.  The natives presented bring an emotional spark that the history books and our own imaginations somehow lacked.  Then because of an unfortunate state of events, we are also presented with a romantic triangle with its fateful and beautiful consequences.  The realities of hardship as well as the spirit of freedom are underscored admirably throughout the film.<br /><br />If "all is fair in love and war," then this may be the fairest movie of them all.  The chemistry between John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahantas, surnamed Rebecca, (Q'orianka Kilcher) is marvelous, and the beautiful cinematography is certainly alluring.  The music too, with its simple orchestration, highlights events with primitive crescendos and nice nuances.  The way the settlers and the Native Americans are portrayed is absorbing enough to keep our interest.  Nevertheless, this movie may be of personal taste.  For what it is, it is excellent, but for some it may be a transcending voyage, for others it may only induce a nap.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>My wife says they should have called this treatment of the Jamestown story "Lolitahontas," for the camera's interest in the young amateur actress playing the leading role is extreme, always playing at her lips like a smile or at the lower crescents of her huge eyes, like tears.  Q'orianka Kilcher has a great part, a part made for a star, and she steps into it with a child's grace, while Colin Farrell and Christian Bale walk over all sorts of tightropes not to look too lustfully upon her child's body, yet still express the mad passion each feels for her at different stages of her life.<br /><br />It's clear than Captain John Smith is damaged goods from the minute you see him in a cage in the hold of the ship, trying to find a few drops of water to quench his thirst.  His first act on native shores is to stand with a noose around his neck, while Christopher Plummer very undramatically sighs and says, "Oh never mind, let's not hang him after all."  I've been reading the new Library of America edition of John Smith's collected WRITINGS and I can sense a discrepancy between the way he depicts himself in his memoirs, and the way the movie treats him.  But that's what the movies are all about, reinventing history, giving it room to breathe.  They really should have a Pocahontas movie in which she is actually the queen of the colony--not just a young girl but a passionate and regal woman with a mind of her own--or maybe they did make the movie I have in mind a long time ago and they called it COBRA WOMAN.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2005 film tells the story of Captain John Smith who came to America in the 16th Century and the curiosity and conflict between the Indians and the settlers. That's a familiar theme and this film does it well.  Colin Farrell is cast as Smith.  He's portrayed as a dashing and handsome bad boy adventurer.  Naturally he and the Indian have problems with each other and the Indians want to kill him.  It is the Chief's daughter who saves his life and she is then cast out of her tribe.  This is the legendary Pocahontas although that name is never used in the film.  This part is played by 14-year old Q'orianka Kilcher.  She is the daughter of a South American Indian father and a Caucasian Swiss mother and grew up in Germany.  She is indeed very pretty but she really doesn't look like the Native Americans we see around today.  Again, Hollywood casting wants to cast mixed race beauties because they think it will sell more films.<br /><br />Naturally there are hints of a love affair between the Indian maiden and the Captain, especially now that she is forced to live in the English settlement and learn English ways.  She has to wear a corset and tight shoes and learn to read the bible.  However, she takes it all in stride because she loves the Captain.  However, he leaves for another adventure and tells everyone to tell her he is dead.  She mourns for a long time but eventually is romanced by a young widower played by Christopher Bale.  They marry, have children and seem very happy.  Years pass.  Then this couple and their children are invited to England where it is inevitable that they meet up with Captain John Smith again.<br /><br />This is not a film for history buffs.  I just can't believe that things happened the way they were depicted in the film.  It was basically a romance with an interesting setting.  I knew that before I started to watch the film which I did just for pure entertainment.  The acting was good, especially that of the young woman.  But the film was basically a time-waster.  I gained no insights.  I felt no emotions.  And I didn't believe the history.  I therefore give "The New World" a very mild lukewarm recommendation if you discover on TV some night.  It's just not worth the effort of renting it though.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Terrence Mallick makes films in a way that no one else quite does. Mainly that's a compliment but anyone familiar with his work knows there's something slightly....critical in that statement. Mallick's most recent film, The New World, is a courageous undertaking that blends one of the prettiest scores ever composed, with shots of absolute gorgeousness. Here we get a sense of the beauty of the central Atlantic coast of North America as it must have been in pre-colonial times, with its vast, intricately-interwoven realm of forests, marshes, and meadows, all laid out under the immensity of an unpolluted sky. Mallick's pace is brave and it challenges a viewer to be equal to it. He takes his time as his camera pans slowly past what seems individual blades of grass and single leaves on majestic cathedrals of trees. So powerful is all this beauty it nearly grows overpowering to the senses, and can come off as both innocently offered, and mentally tiring. What The New World needed was more involvement from its human cast. Scarcely a hundred sentences are uttered start to finish in a lengthy running time of nearly two and a quarter hours. The tribal life of the aboriginal peoples was, one discerned, probably accurate to the smallest detail, including a shot inside a charnel house; the English colonists, their fort, houses, ship, and later in the manor in England with its formal gardens (a stark contrast to the free expression of nature in the  untamed forests of North America) these too are careful recreations that reflect what was there in this period. The problem is there is a lack of balance in The New World and the tale of Pocahontas and the two foreign men who come to win her love definitely takes a back seat to Mallick's visuals, and seems lost amid the scale of this motion picture. The New World is a beautiful visual poem, but it barely qualifies as containing any story at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>This film is Director Terrence Malik's script interpretation of the first meeting between 17th Century Virginia's Native Tribes and European colonists. It is marketed as Pocahontas's (Q'orianka Kilcher) first meeting/love affair with explorer John Smith. (Colin Farrell)<br /><br />Mr. Malik's signature film shows the love story between curious, playful Pocahontas and the conflicted explorer John Smith.  Language, age and environment barriers are shown through the eyes of Mr. Malik. The nod for Cinematography is not by chance. This beautiful looking film is deliberately lacking dialogue for historical effect that showed the true ethnic barriers. A narrative voice is utilized for effective story telling of John Smith's writtens.<br /><br />The romance and passion between two totally different ethnic people from different cultural roles are encompassed in this historical noted timeframe. The clash or initial meeting of ethnic races was just the start of things to come. The brutal reality of that era is portrayed authentic by Malik. But first and foremost this film is a love story shown through the eyes of a one-of-a-kind director Terrence Malik utilizing body movement and visualization.<br /><br />The "making of" bonus material is worth a viewing. The behind the scenes chapter tells a story of the rough conditions and preproduction detailed events of trying to give this film an authentic 17th century Virginia settlement feel. I.e. Tribal movement, dress, dialog and set construction.<br /><br />If you are looking for Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans or a Black Robe film this is not it. This is an artsy film telling a stunning visual love story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I figure if one is reading this they already know the film and are questioning whether to buy this upgraded version or not - I would have to say a resounding yes.<br /><br />Knowing how he filmed this and with what equipment I had very high expectations on clarity. I tested this thoroughly by pause checking over 50 different scenes and light levels (dark, dim, bright, motion, fine detail, etc.) and I could not find fault in anything; The running water scenes, moving pans through trees - all of it. The colors, contrasts and light level all came across beautifully. The smaller LCD panels looked wonderful, but I even scrutinized on the larger Plasmas and it still looked awesome. The sound has the TrueHD and English 5.1, and the mix maintains being able to crank up the volume above normal listening levels as to immerse in the sounds/music but still hear the dialogue adequately.<br /><br />This is the 172 minute version with the 10 part documentary series from the other releases included. I am very happy with this preservation so I hope that those who enjoy his work will appreciate this package.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Terrence Malick is not a mainstream director, his films while few in number, are incredibly rich with detail and visual language. Only a very few people can appreciate one of his films, mostly because they tend to run longer than mainstream movies and they don't follow the traditional formula. If you've seen The Thin Red Line then you know what a Terrence Malick film is. The Thin Red Line is in my opinion one of the finest cinematic accomplishmensts in the war genre. The New World is basically Malick's counterpart to The Thin Red Line. While The Thin Red Line was a look into the dark nature of mankind and how we destroy ourselves, The New World is the opposite of that. This film is about the celebration of the human spirit and the wonder of life. It is a truly poetic film that uses the story of John Smith and Pocahontas to express this commentary. The New World focuses on the clash of differences between two civilizations and how in the mess of differences two people are able to connect and see the beauty of each other. The movie moves slow though, and there are some parts where I found the editing to be a little confusing. Otherwise, I think the film is an incredible emotional journey filled with poetry and brilliant cinematic images. This film and The Thin Red Line are very similar in style. Malick even uses the same motif with birds as he does in The Thin Red Line. You also have the poetic narration of the main characters, and the narration itself can stand alone as poetry, it is truly remarkable. Beautiful landcapes captured brilliantly with the camera, long tracking shots, and many wide shots enhance the surrounding for the audience. He also uses his "sun through the trees" shot multiple times, which I personally loved in The Thin Red Line and even used it a couple times in my projects. All the shots are accompanied by James Horner's acceptable yet somewhat flawed score. In my opinion I thought the score sounded exactly like his work on The Perfect Storm. I was devestated when Hans Zimmer was detached from the project due to scheduling problems, because it was with The Thin Red Line that Zimmer composed his masterpiece. Horner does a good job in my opinion, but at times I felt like it was all too similar and sometimes lacking. The characters are all wonderfully expressed as well, and the change that Pocahontas goes through basically defines the film's central theme of change in surrounding while still retaining your individual personality. This film celebrates humanity and is his counterpart to The Thin Red Line, which basically shows the flaws of humanity. See both film if you have not already, and if you are new to Terrence Malick please have an open mind. This man is a wonderful filmmaker, I wish he wasn't so elusive and would actually do interviews as well do maybe more than 1 movie every decade. Then again, the fact that he has only directed 5 movies in his career since 1969 maybe is his greatest strength, and puts him on the list of top directors in the industry.<br /><br />ACTING: The film is almost absent of any structural dialogue. Dialogue between characters is rare and brief yet oh so meaningful, and then there is the poetic narration. The actors do a fine job with facial expressions and evoking the right emotions. Colin Farrell is great and plays a character who is in love with Pocahontas and embraces her world. Christian Bale does a fantastic job as the man who falls in love with Pocahontas yet tries to make part of English society. Then we have newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas, and does an amazing job with the role. The acting is all emotion and hardly any dialogue.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I talked to my parents after I saw the film, they said that people walked out of the movie at the showing they saw, which didn't suprise me at all. I was happy that no one walked out of the showing I went to. The Thin Red Line got the same response by movie goers that this one is getting. They walk in expecting an intense action drama and end up at a poetry reading, but you can blame decieving marketing for that. Like I said, Terrence Malick isn't for everyone, but if you see it with an open mind you will experience a truly amazing and meaningful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"It seems like a dream." So intones John Smith (an emphatic and forceful Colin Farrell) describing his time with Pocahontas (a gorgeous newcomer, Q'Orianka Kilcher) in what would come to be known as Jamestown, Virginia circa 1607.<br />And so much like a dream is Terence Malick's newest "The New World." There are long stretches of this film in which there is only action without or with minimal sound:  the Native Americans going about their day-to-day lives, working, playing, training, eating and celebrating while the King James sent Englishmen, looking for a quick way from England to the "Indies," basically go about their day scavenging for food, fighting amongst themselves and acting like savages. In fact, the Native Americans are mostly gorgeous, clean, well groomed while the supposedly civilized Englishmen are smelly, scuffy and ill-mannered. One of the funniest scenes comes at the beginning of the film when a Warrior approaches Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) and squinches his nose due to the Captain's body odor. There is no doubt that the peaceful, though wary and intelligent Natives as presented here: regal, civilized are superior to the intruders.<br />In a mesmerizing almost stuperous mist, in a land so new and fresh and rife with possibilities, where a man can begin again without the sins of his past encroaching upon and stifling him, Malick sets the scene for the beginning of "The New World." There is such wonder, giddiness and hope in Malick's mise en scene that you can't help but be taken in by it all: what a chance we had to build a better world, what a chance we had to right the wrongs of our former world.<br />The central story is the one between Princess Pocahontas ("playful one") and Captain John Smith who arrives in Jamestown in shackles and is almost hung for treason but Captain Newport thinks better of it and instead sends Smith on a journey up the river to find and pay respects to Chief Powhatan. Powhatan instructs Smith to teach Pocahontas English and from this a romance develops.<br />Malick takes his time telling this story and "The New World" is slow, quiet, often silent and elegiac: he takes the time to stop, observe and ponder what his camera is showing...no quick jump cuts here to keep us supposedly impatient viewers interested. The world of Malick's films is a world filled with innocence and wonder: but wonder and innocence tempered with the realities of the brutal and the unforgiving. We are in Paradise here, Paradise before the fall: the fall is inevitable, of course and there is no doubt on whose doorstep the fault can be laid.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>The tale of the English settlers at Jamestown gets a wonderful retelling here revealing the hunger, struggle, disease, hardship, cold, and superstition that the early settlers encountered in the new world. I actually think this film does a wonderful job of revealing the wonderful paradise that was the new world before the arrival of the Europeans. The native people here are shown as primitive aboriginals, complete with tatoos, rituals, a power hierarchy and complex societies. The views of Virginia are stunning in their beauty, what a wonderful sight Virginia must have been to these early European arrivals, and how dreadful their lives could become as they learned how to survive in a world full of plants, insects, and animals they had never encountered before. The film gets 4 stars for giving us a glimpse of what the encounters between the old and new world must have been like for all parties involved.<br /><br />The love story between John Smith and Pocahontas is dream-like, a world not unlike Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Yet the story is one of JOhn Smith's betrayal of Pocahontas and the incredible price she pays for her loyalty to him. Yet the film is also one of her recovery from this obsessive love so that she is free to accept the love of her husband, John Rolfe. Colin Farrell does a great job of playing the brash, brave, adventurer John Smith. Smith sees the time he and Pocahontas were in love in her father's village as a dream that he must leave behind. She on the other hand saw it as a reality that she wished to pursue to the end.<br /><br />Thus in some ways the film is also about obsessive first love and the strong mature love that holds relationships together for decades. Christian Bale plays Rolfe, a tobacco farmer, who loves and marries Pocahontas, and fears losing her to Smith, but is finally rewarded in the end when she realizes that Smith was an obsession that is now passing and she must cling to the true love of her life, her partner, Rolfe.<br /><br />I found the Wagner music grand, sweeping, and perfect for the grandeur that is found in North America. This is a tale told with images rather than words. It is well done and not typical.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*The New World* is definitely not one of my favorite films nor would I recommend this movie to others.  What surprised me about this movie was that there was hardly any dialogue.  It's sort of like watching a modern-day silent movie.<br /><br />I knew this would be a story about Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.  However, I just didn't realize just how slow it would be for a movie that is a little over 2 hours long.<br /><br />English men land in Virginia and immediately form a "relationship" with the Naturals.  There's an interesting contrast of these two groups.  The Naturals are at ease compared to the English.  Of course, things go wrong when the English start to take over the land little by little.<br /><br />When Newton returns to English, things go from bad to worse in Virginia.  Smith is captured by the Naturals.  However, instead of killing him, they let him live among them...with the help of Pocahontas.  Of course, against the wish of the king, Pocahontas and Smith eventually fall in love.<br /><br />From here on to the end, the story gets a little odd.  This is where you just might lose attention or fall asleep.  The dialogue becomes less frequent as well.<br /><br />This movie could have been shortened and used a bit more dialogue.  Maybe you'll love it or maybe you won't.  I just know that it was so-so for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The New World has many detractors. Most comment on the slow pace of the film, and this is undeniably so. "It's like watching grass grow" is the commonly heard clich&eacute;. I'm not here to defend the speed at which this story unfolds; it IS slow. But it's also beautifully put together.<br /><br />Try this: You're in a raft on a placidly flowing river. Trees wash by, animals nibble grasses on the shores, the sky illuminates a beautiful blue above and below while the sun warms your legs. The rapids are few and easily navigated, allowing you time to view everything around you. Sound boring? Or comfortable?<br /><br />If this sounds like death, stay away from The New World. If it sounds pleasant and enjoyable, give the film a try.<br /><br />What I enjoyed was the how the story dribbled into the viewer's lap. It roiled around you like a cool mountain stream and allowed time for everything to come into focus. This isn't Disney's Pocahontas; this is how the Jamestown Settlement came to be, in all its boringness and beauty.<br /><br />Colin Farrell stars as Captain John Smith, one of the founders of the original colonies. He and his shipmates arrive in the Americas and are soon building a fort while the leader of the group, Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer), heads back to Europe to resupply and bring more colonists.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jamestown is nearly overrun by disease, power struggles, and the native Indians. Amidst all this, Captain Smith meets up with Pocahontas, the pretty and inquisitive daughter of a local chieftain. It is her generosity that allows these first colonists to survive, and it is mainly because of her love for Smith.<br /><br />After Captain Smith leaves the colony in search of better lands up north, it is wrongly reported to Pocahontas that her love perished in a shipping accident. Thus she despairs and eventually falls for John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a tobacco farmer.<br /><br />Pocahontas is later requested by the King and Queen of England to come to Court and meet them ...and she does. Thus, we have TWO new worlds being discovered: one for the Europeans (America), and one for the Native Americans (England and Europe).<br /><br />Pocahontas later learns that Captain Smith is still alive. It is a bitter realization and she has to decide whom to stay with, Smith or Rolfe.<br /><br />It is the beautiful cinematography of The New World that really pulls the viewer in. Some have complained that it should have won Best Cinematography at the Oscars and not Memoirs of a Geisha. I disagree. The New World is extremely beautiful to watch, no doubt, but I feel Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit better on the eyes.<br /><br />The wondrous musical score was another boon for the film. Surrounding the viewer/listener in an emulsion of color and sound, the music made for some powerful moments. Terrence Malick, Director, knows how to engage an audience. But it's not going to capture all those who watch it.<br /><br />In a society where action sells better than art, this film will be lost to many. Don't get me wrong, I love action films just as much as anyone. But it's not a necessary ingredient for a movie such as this. The authenticity (as seen on the DVD's extra features) will astound many; I know it blew me away. The re-creation of the settlement, the Native American huts, the battle gear, etc, are all pulled from archaeological records and sources. Impressive.<br /><br />It's also noteworthy to mention how little dialogue there is in the film. Terrence Malick prefers to let the scenes speak for themselves rather than have actors and actresses voices spoil the moment.<br /><br />I guess what it boils down to is this: If you don't like art films that focus on nuance rather than specifics, stay away from The New World. But if you don't mind letting your mind meander through a burbling set of scenes, you'll probably delight in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>What to make of Terrence Mallick's "The New World"?  If you've seen the "The Thin Red Line,"you've seen, to some extent, the same movie.  Oh, the subject matter is completely different (WW 2 battle flick vs. Jamestown story), but with Mallick this almost seems beside the point - since what he cares about is the Human Condition and other BIG bellybutton pondering Why Are We Here kind of questions.  And Mallick does approach these questions with a poetry and style that leaves the viewer thinking.  Imagine, if you will, a Stanley Kubrick who actually cares about people, and you have Mallick.  But in a long movie -at some point, a viewer wants a story to break out.  What Mallick delivers instead is an Art Gallery.<br /><br />Precise period detail, gorgeous cinema photography, performances...?  I suppose they're pretty good, though it's hard to get much traction with the characters, since they are just part of the scenery.  The credits say John Savage was in the movie.  I must of missed him.  And Wes Studi is just used as Native Background.  (By the way, Natives and their reactions to the Jamestown settlers are first rate, and for that reason alone make the New World worth seeing.  One senses that Mallick did an enormous amount of research for this film.)  Colin Farrell is ok as John Smith, looking appropriately all moody and lank-haired, but given Mallick's structure, it's hard to penetrate that character's motivations (what was that flipping over the table thing all about?).  For example, why did he turn his back on a relationship with Pocahantas?  I'll admit the answer very well could of been right in front of me, but by that point in the movie, I was floating on a dream, and such character specifics could of slipped right on by.  But that does bring me to the performance of Q'rianka Kilcher as Pocohantas.  She is incredible, and by movie's end, she has made the story (overwhelmingly) her own.  Pocohantas's transition from nature romping Indian to the wife of an English man (an effective Christian Bale as John Rolfe) is not some sort of flat trajectory, but one filled with complexity and nuance.  To pull that off, you need a great actor - and a great director.  On that count at least, Mallick struck gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>They say that a picture is worth 1000 words and it appears as if Terrence Malick wants to show the world this in his latest film, The New World.  Terrence Malick has been in the industry for over 30 years and only has about 5 pictures under his name.  He takes time and creates the film he wants.<br /><br />The New World is not a great "movie" in the traditional sense.  There are voice overs, when there actually is dialogue it is quick and to the point.  When there's action, it is also quick, ruthless and used to give across a point, not for the actual action itself.  What Malick does well is create a portrait, a painting of that time period and what was happening.  By paring down the story of Pocahontas (though she is never called that in the movie nor is called anything until she receives the name Rebecca), Malick shows us not the highly stylized version or the romantic version as it has come to be known.  The movie is about her journey, her discovery and eventually her ending.<br /><br />The plot is very elusive.  There really isn't one in the traditional sense; the plot is hidden behind subtle pieces of dialogue, images on the screen.  Someone not paying attention might get confused as to what's going on (I say this because the people sitting behind me were giving a running commentary the entire movie "What's going on?" "What just happened?" etc).  Malick also takes into account that you know the story, at least in essence, of Pocahontas.<br /><br />But it is also about the quality of nature and Malick reminds us how beautiful the land is.  Portions of the movie stars just nature with maybe a voice over explaining their feelings, but at the same time it reflects the cinematography.  Its beautiful to watch.  For those interested in plot heavy movies, look elsewhere.  I guarantee you will not like this film.  Those looking for a minimalist tale, one that is very light on plot but heavy on subtleties and the nuance of the camera, then this is a film for you.<br /><br />Boring in spots, breathtaking in others, The New World is a mishmash of the incredible and the mundane.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It seems obvious what is meant by the title of "The New World" as soon as you find out Terrence Malick's film is about Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Smith (Colin Farrell).  But there are additional layers of meaning to the term, because Malick is trying to evoke the moment of equilibrium where two cultures met and each was confronted with the strange newness of the other.  As always, Malick's vision is poetic, relying on images and music more than dialogue in his marriage of sight and sound.  Even in terms of the spoken word, the emphasis is more on narration than on conversation.  The approach might be frustrating to some viewers, because Malick does not tell his story using the conventions of contemporary cinema.  But then we have known for some time that Malick makes movies in his own world.  He just does not not invite us for visits as often as we would like.<br /><br />Judging this film in terms of historical accuracy is difficult, given what little we know about these characters.  It is believed that Pocahontas was born around 1595, which would have made her 12 in 1607 when she supposedly rescued John Smith from death when he was captured and brought to Werowocomoco.  Whether Smith's version of the story is true, is open to debate, as is the nature of exactly what he was being rescued from, but it is the meeting between them and how the Powhatan Confederacy supported the fledgling Jamestown colony.  The actress playing Pocahontas was fourteen when Malick was filming, which would made her a couple of years too old for the initial scenes with Smith, but then Kilcher also has to play "Rebecca" when she travels to England at approximately the age of twenty-two in 1617, ten years after she first met John Smith and a year before she died in the new world she found on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.<br /><br />The character is never called Pocahontas in the film, and indeed the daughter of Powhatan (whose named was really Wahusunacock) was named Matoaka, with "Pocahontas" being a childhood nickname referring to her frolicing nature.  The idea of a romance between Pocahontas and Smith is studiously avoided, since she ends up marrying another Englishman, John Rolfe (Christian Bale).  Her assimilation is the focal point of the film and there is a sense in which Malick is telling the familiar story of the stranger in a strange land who goes native.  In other words, this is the opposite of what we saw in "A Man Called Horse" and "Dances With Wolves," because it is the Native American, the "natural," who is captivated by the alien culture.  But notice that this reversal takes place at a time when the "Indian princess" would be welcomed at the court of the king and queen of England.  The fate of the woman we know as Pocahontas is relatively unique in our cultural history, especially with the horror stories to come regarding the fates of other Native Americans.  That is why Malick's movie presents a vision of a brief moment in American history that was pretty much gone as soon as she passed away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I'm of Aboriginal descent(my mother's Cree) so wouldn't that make me more sensitive to portrayals of them in movies? Well, kinda. I don't mind but they're have been serious troubling ones but thankfully, The New World isn't one of them. It's just too bad the actual film isn't that good. It's handsomely made but not as inviting as the film makes itself out to be.<br /><br />We know the story: native american girl Pocahontas falls in love with English settle John Smith. The Englishmen see the other side as savages while the natives see the other side as barbarians who take what they want with little regard for anything. So a love story in the middle of this isn't going to help.<br /><br />The film is of course quite nice to look at: trees standing, trees in the wind, still rivers, rushing rivers etc. But there's the problem since they're seems to be too much of it. Wanting to create a certain mood, the film is littered with images that seem fit to be in wildlife documentaries. They're nice but they're not that important but sure enough we get em in droves. The film is also rather slow. Characters rarely speak and even if they do, it's rather brief at times.<br /><br />Well the visuals hold up, despite their excessiveness, so how's the acting? Well, not quite good either. Colin Farrell, who's often been labelled the next best thing, pretty much as the same expression on his face the entire time: like he's come back from a funeral, all solemn and sad looking. Q'Orianka Filcher is of course the real find and hope we see more since she has a gravitas and a youthfulness that you can't help but notice. Christian Bale would've been a good character but since he literally drops in 1/2 hour before the movie's over, they don't develop him the way they should've.<br /><br />Is it well-made? Of course. The cinematography and the art direction values are through the roof. As a film though? It's extremely disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>First off, I love the scenery (I live close to Jamestown and have visited the historical site many times) and the young Q-Orianka Kilcher is very good as Pocahontas. Colin Farrell isn't on his best game here and the great Christian Bale doesn't even enter the picture until the last half an hour. The visuals are nice, but I wish I would have waited to catch this one on DVD. Even with the 17 minutes or so cut to help with the pacing, it still seemed a bit long at times. The action was kept to a minimum and the movie seemed to be focused more in the romance department. The narration was also hard to understand at times and was used in parts that you would expect to have dialogue. The New World is a very quiet movie and doesn't rush through any of the scenes (some linger on too long), but it is nice to look at and it shows some good history of the founding of America.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The scenery is naturally lovely, and poetic. That's the greatest strength of this film. Half of the movie is about the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). The trouble is I do not sense any love between them at all. Even though the director took a lot of time to depict the  chemistry between them. It's more like reading the biography of Pocahontas.<br /><br />It's worth renting not buying.<br /><br />Ghost is still the only title on my list of Best Love Story movies of all time.<br />.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I understand and appreciate the artistry of Terrance Mallick but he can be a very flawed director.<br /><br />This could have been an amazing movie with an all too familiar story (adoption by a tribe, think "Avatar" or "Dances with Wolves") but Mallick did too much with the cinematography and not enough with narration. Mallick also gets too enchanted with having his film express a poetic effect rather than having his film express story telling.<br /><br />This is the simple story of 17th century English explorers coming to North America and clashing with the native Indians. Instead of gloriying and putting an unrealistic sheen on that era, Mallick effectively depicts that in now way/ no how was it similar to how we live today. The native Americans are apparently civilized yet also very savage. The English appear civilized, but, in reality. much more savage than the Indians. The English bring with them disease and nothing is easy about living off of the land. Great premise but some real problems with the execution.<br /><br />Mallick improperly lets the camera do too much talking when he should pay more attention to dialog and narrative. He uses weird voice overs and does not properly segue when advancing time.<br /><br />Collin Farrell is an ostrocized English explorer that falls for the Indian Pochahantas. In between there are conflicts between the two groups from where these protagonists emenated from.<br /><br />There are battle scenes that should have been fantastic but they are confusing and do not advance the story. There is a seemingly beautiful blossoming of a relationship, yet the director explores it, backs off from it and does away with it. The English may appear more adorned but a close up of them make them look more barbaric than their Indian counterparts. There should have been fascinating nautical scenes yet, they are too much bypassed.<br /><br />Eventually Pochahantas is excommunicated from her tribe, is forced to live with the colonists and moves to England. That is where this film really goes sour.  I'm neither the smartest nor the dumbest guy, but it is really hard to tell what is going on, what the director's objectives were and what the point of the movie is in the last hour of this movie. The first part of this movie is Colonists enamored with this strange land, their conflicts with the Indians and a different perspective from the Indian's point of view. That could be pretty interesting and entertaining. The second half is quite boring.<br /><br />What distinguishes Mallick from other directors, how beautiful and etheral his films look like is the same thing that detracts it. His style comes across too pretentious when there is no need. A more straightforward, organic approach would have fortified the film. I saw "The Tree of Life" and loved Mallick's approach but that had a lot to do with the subject matter. This is practically a "cowboys and indians" flick, and the arty nature is inconsistent with the subject matter.<br /><br />Artistic directorial restraint, cutting back on it's length and remembering that a movie is supposed to entertain could have made this a whole lot better of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Directed and written by Terrence Malick, the talented artist behind The Thin Red Line (1998), great anticipation surrounded the release of The New World. The project was bold and ambitious enough to peak one's interest, but unfortunately, the film could not deliver on its promise. Entire scenes drift by with nothing in particular being achieved to either advance the plot, the theme, or the premise of the film. Unfittingly, the soundtrack featured blaring snippets of concert music reminiscent of Richard Wagner, which would be great if The New World took place in 19th Century Venice instead of 17th Century America. Much more should be expected from James Horner whose brilliant work has enhanced such films as Field of Dreams, Braveheart, Legends of the Fall, and Titanic. The New World soundtrack is disaster almost on par with the latter film.<br /><br />The rest of film isn't much better. Although it vividly illustrates the limitless possibility of early Jamestown and the majesty of the unspoiled wilderness surrounding it, the visual images are offset by poor dialogue and what seems to be an overly zealous attempt to manufacture a poetic awe-inspiring masterpiece of a film. Nevertheless, The New World does manage to summon images of the first European settlers and the hardship they must have faced. From this standpoint, one can say it has some reflective value for those who appreciate human history...<br /><br />The New World begins by following the life of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). Landing in the New World with a convoy of Englishmen, he happens upon the Native American kingdom of Powhatan (August Schellenberg). Of course, most of the world knows the basic plotline. Smith's life is spared when his body is covered by Powhatan's beautiful daughter, Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). Kilcher certainly displays the requisite physical beauty to portray the princess, but the script gives her little with which to work. Although a subject of controversy among historians, the film plays up the angle of a possible love affair between Smith and Pocahontas, but it accurately records her eventual marriage to John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and the couple's celebrated trip to London. But The New World's problems don't stem from historical accuracy, but rather from the fact that the preceding paragraph is a detailed account of everything that happens in a tedious two-hour fifteen-minute snoozer. In short, it's long and boring.<br /><br />As much as the film failed to live up to expectations, this much can be said for The New World: it accurately portrays the landscape of southeastern Virginia. That alone makes it immensely superior to Disney's Pocahontas which featured non-indigenous animals and forests peppered with waterfalls. Unfortunately, an entire generation of children gathered their personal knowledge of local geography from that film. From the perspective of set design, wardrobe, historical underpinnings, and the mere beauty of its images, The New World is a film to behold. However, from the standpoint of dialogue, plot, direction, and performance, The New World is an utter flop. Unless you're a history buff, and specifically a Jamestown junkie, avoid the film at all costs...<br /><br />The DVD Report<br /><br />thedvdreport.blogspot.com</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I like historical epics generally, but this was a really poorly edited film. The story is hard to follow and some scenes seem to intrude on the story. There's very little context and the story isn't very clear. At some points, I was confused as to what was actually happening or why something did happen (for example, why was John Smith alone and captured in the first place?). It seems like the editing team had trouble producing a solid movie with the footage given, so tried to make it more abstract in some places - to the detriment of the viewer.<br /><br />At points, the characters narrate their thoughts, but rather than providing useful context this gets annoying. They simply recite their emotions, which are surprisingly bland (with John Smith calling the Native Americans perfect and in complete harmony). Such emotions would have been better explored through acting and interaction between the characters, rather than simply narrating them. And the soundtrack - very disappointing.<br /><br />The only bright spot was the acting - Q'orianka Kilcher played a decent Pocahontas. Colin Farrell wasn't bad as John Smith either, but not too inspiring.<br /><br />Hopefully the next remake of the story of Jamestown will do it right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>A dull retelling of the Pocahontas story.  The whole movie is rather strange without much really happening.  It was, however, nice to see them get away from the more stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans.  The only saving grace is the cinematography--plus, I like Colin Farrell.  Overall, a big disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>I decided to chance it one day and go see "The New World" because it had one of my most respected actors in it (Colin Farrel and Christopher Plummer) and it looked quite good, since there were very few realistic colonial-era movies of the subject.<br /><br />What I saw in the theater was not a film.<br /><br />It felt like a pretentious art student's college film trying so hard to be blas&eacute; and chic and all those fancy crazy words with obscure meanings that scream "creative" and fumbles like a giant tumbling off a cliff.<br /><br />First off, the sparse dialogue. There's hardly much dialogue in any scene minus a few lines spoken by a character off-camera or for a few shots on camera. If all the dialogue were put together and single-spaced, it'd take up at most five pages of the script. The sparse dialogue isn't even memorable or deeply moving! It's just blandly stating the obvious like "we're here in the new world." "the natives are savages" "it's been three days." So where does most of the movie go if there's virtually no dialogue? Cinematography. I rate this one star only because it looked authentic. The vast majority of the camera and film was devoted to cinematography and just filming trees and grass swaying in the wind and birds and indians frolicking like playful little things.<br /><br />The young new actress playing Pocahantas (who isn't even named in the film, we just assume she's Pocahantas) is really uneventful and unfulfilling, and a bore to look at (and her upper lip is humongous compared to her lower lip). At least Colin Farrel tries hard in his role, whereas Christopher Plummer doesn't look too anxious and seems glad to be rid of himself by the middle of the movie.<br /><br />The latter half takes place in England, where Pocahantas ends up with another colonist. It's equally silent there dialogue-wise, and very uneventful save for a silent meeting with the King and Queen and a frolic through the vast maze gardens of the palace's backyard.<br /><br />So in total, the movie consisted of Pocahantas frolicking, and some scenes with the white men and indians looking concerned and the occasional spoken word or gunfire. But mostly frolicking.<br /><br />Additions: This was the first movie where I lifted up the armrest of my theater chair, laid on my side, and nodded off several times, almost falling asleep.  Not because it's lacking gunfire and loud noises and typical "Americans only like car chases and shootouts and sex", but because it's simply BORING and totally sparse.  Hardly any music, hardly any sound, hardly any ANYTHING save moving pictures of people.<br /><br />My only relief comes in seeing that other people have rated this movie 1 star.  Means I'm not the only person who feels crazy for hating this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The story started off quite good when they arrived at the Americas. But then it just got boring. The actors were almost wooden. The lines they said were bad. If you were tired and wanted something to put you to sleep. This would do it.<br /><br />However the pictures of the country side were nice.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>For any of you out there who care about getting the facts mostly right in a historical movie, this is a film to avoid. The "Making of The New World" portion of the DVD speaks about all the great care taken to make this film authentic. Actors learn to talk and move like Algonquins. Genuine wild turkey feathers are used. They build a replica of the fort. It's shot on location in Virginia. It's too bad they got everything right except the story.<br /><br />Just like Disney, Malick invents a love story out of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Q'orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas, even looks like the human version of the Disney Pocahontas. Pocahontas was only 12-years-old when she met John Smith. She looks like an 18-year-old siren in this film. There is no evidence that John Smith and Pocahontas felt anything more than respect and friendship for each other. At most, Pocahontas may have felt a young girl crush for the commanding presence of Smith, but even that is speculation. Since half the movie is devoted to the passionate romance between the two, this is a huge blunder.<br /><br />I could say much more about the other blunders, about John Smith and the Indians, Powhatan, the capture of Pocahontas, John Rolfe. Just about the whole story, actually. And it didn't help that Colin Farrell, playing John Smith, mumbled so many of his lines that I was forced to activate captions. Both Smith and Rolfe looked like love-struck puppies in the presence of Pocahontas. Talk about Jungle Fever!<br /><br />If you want to get the lowdown on what really happened at Jamestown, read Love and Hate in Jamestown by David Price. Take my word for it, the facts are more interesting than the fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>what a waste of production budget. the director and the screenplay writer(s) should be banned from directing and writing anything related to movie industry. it's so weird to watch three persons (one woman and two guys kept blabbering as some kinda voice in the head: 'who am i? what is love?....' i simply could not believe any movie would be shot in this way with 3 voice-overs. so there's a new trend to use narrators blabbing beside the director's commentary? do we really need that? this director who directed that drive-me-nuts 'a thin red line' now did it again! wake up, man, this is not a cool way to direct a panned-out movie. so tiresome and so pretentious, man. and 'breathtakingly beautiful'? 'two thumbs up'? give me a break.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Malick is a visionary director, foregoing all real substance of a film and just giving you random scenes with no real sugnifigance and narating over them.  Thats the main fault I have with this film is that there really seems to be no reason what so ever to watch it.  No one speaks to one another, I mean I think Colin Farrell utters maybe five words in total (minus his narative scenes) and when he's spoken to he just stares at the person with this look of complete stupidity.  A breath of fresh air is newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays her role so perfectly you can't help but love her as John Smith loved her.  FOr the most part shes the only part of this film worth watching...I mean, Malick has vision, it's just not right for this film which comes off more like a documentary then a motion picture.  I worry about the people who see the 3 hour version he's planning to release.  I mean, this movie dragged on for so long with nothing to keep you interested.  I fear for Colin's career because he keeps making BAD decitions, but at least in Alexander he had speaking lines.  Christopher Plummer was in all of five minutes of the movie and Christian Bale is a BORE!  Another bone I have to pick is the musical score which is played so loudly that it pounds you head and leaves you wanting to rip your ears off.  If there were a mute button this film would be beautiful, random shots of water in a brook and spiders on a tree and Colin Farrell kissing a newborn and  Q'Orianka Kilcher running around like a deer...it's beautiful...but with the repetative narrating, Smith lamenting over how he can't be around her and Bale lamenting over how Pocahntas won't love him the way she loves Smith...it's really annoying and the ending...OH GOD DON'T GET ME STARTED!  The end of this movie is just freaking RETARDED!  It just ends, just like that, like he ran out of film, I mean, he wasted so much of it on spiders and water and crap like that that he didn't have enough time to shot a decent ending to the film.  I think this film a waste of time and it actually made me want to get up and walk out and i don't normally want to do that and I think the ONLY reason I stayed was so I could actually write this review and feel like I knew what I was talking about.  I hope you won't waste your time like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>What a big dissapointment this movie was. From it;s opening credits it was shot beautifull and I loved the way the camera moved and the scebery but that's about it, that's the only good thing about this boring, no acting film. The acting is horriable there isa ctually no acting the actors stand around and deliver there lines, but what lines there is hardley no talking in this film. The story is long and has no life to it it drags on and on and on. Overall beautifull to watch but it dosent make this movie come close to being good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Over an hour and a half into the movie, John Rolfe (Bale) drones, "Hours pass; she speaks no words," and therein lies the problem.  Like the slowly growing and mostly dying crops that did in the settlers of Jamestown, this movie dies because of malnutrition.  There's far too little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">Last of the Mohicans</a>, and far too many panoramic views of a cinematographer's concept of early American wilderness (beautifully rendered) and indigenous buttocks.  The romance between John Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) is slower than a Special Olympic hurdler, and far too many scenes pass without a spoken word or consequential sound.  Honestly, the dialogue in this film must have been amazingly easy to memorize for the cast, because most of the long stretches of speaking parts seem to be done as voiceovers off camera.  And Colin Farrell STILL managed to utter his lines like he had a mouth full of marbles.  Aggravating is not a strong enough word, and the rest of the cast - aside from Christian Bale - is filled up of ambiguous Indians and random serfs.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at an authentic recreation and the historical significance of the story, but Pocahontas, much like the makers of this movie, made multiple mistakes, like I did when I decided to watch this...but hindsight is 20/20, I guess.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a watch once kind of movie.  Add in the historical inaccuracies, and I'd rather watch corn grow than sit through another viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Terrence Malick is known for creating very a different sort of cinematic art. Like the late Stanley Kubrick, he moves away from standard Hollywood material, and creates a style of his own. What we see in his films are brief narratives by different characters, beautiful shots of natural scenery, and some moments that place no insight on sound (we just see the beauty of the surroundings, and the only sound we hear is either the breeze or distant animals). If you've seen The Thin Red Line (one of my favorite films), then you know what I'm talking about. Like his other films, this one delves into the meaning of life, love, war, hate, violence, etc. But now, in the new millennium, we have seen something different from Malick. The New World is yet another beautiful film by the master filmmaker, and like his other films, it relies on history when telling the story. Here we have the creation of Jamestown, Virginia, and the bond between John Smith and Pocahontas. While it isn't entirely historically accurate, it does borrow certain elements from popular American folklore respectively.<br /><br />It's 1607, and the English set out to found the land of North America. After setting foot on the land, Captain John Smith is captured by a tribe of Native Americans, and is about to be executed. However, one of the young women wants him alive, and he is now considered a prisoner. The woman turns out to be Pocahontas, and she and Smith fall in love. This rather complicates matters between the English and the Native Americans, and what follows is a breathtaking movement of beauty, mysticism, and new discoveries about life.<br /><br />Almost everything is what you would expect in a Malick film. Nature shots, voice-overs, philosophical implications, the works. From beginning to end, it is more of a spiritual experience rather than an entertaining one. But this probably wouldn't have fully succeeded if it weren't for the outstanding cast. Colin Farrell, Q'Orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, and Wes Studi make an interesting combination. Their performances are absolutely stunning (there is no melodrama in the way they interact with each other). Cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is really a sight to see: the dark colors really add to the mystical atmosphere that is conveyed through this film. I wish I would say something special about James Horner's music, but most of it had been cut out and replaced by classical music. I guess I could say that Mozart's Piano Concerto and Wagner's Das Rheingold were unexpected but nonetheless pleasurable additions to the soundtrack.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that this movie is not for everyone. Anyone who is looking for an exciting film might want to look elsewhere. This is a slow-moving, yet hauntingly effective motion picture which lacks nonstop action, witty dialogue, and softcore sex. I personally have come to admire it, despite the last thirty minutes of the film being a bit plodding at times. It's as great as The Thin Red Line, and I would happily recommend it to those who love to see some fine cinematic art.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />P.S.<br />People say that the extended cut is much better than the original 135-minute cut. If that's the case, then I might as well watch it and see for myself. Stay tuned.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Be prepared.<br /><br />That's the best advice I could tell anyone who is thinking of watching this film. If you know what you are going to see, in this case, you'll be better off because if you are expecting an action-packed historical adventure story, you will be bitterly disappointed.<br /><br />This is s-l-o-w moving, very slow, and fairly long at two hours and 15 minutes. If you enjoyed "The Girl With The Pearl Earring," you'll like this. Those two films are similar in beauty and pace.<br /><br />If you love good visuals, which I do, then this is a DVD you want to view. Terrence Malick has directed only four movies in 33 years and all four are beautifully filmed, the best being the second: "Days Of Heaven." I would rank this second to that film in terms of beauty.<br /><br />Cinematography-wise, there is a lot to like in The New World, especially the scenes on the water, which are magnificent. I wish there more of them. What we see is Jamestown, Va., in the year 1607, so this film is about as rural as you're ever going to see America.<br /><br />It's the story of Pocahontas (although she's never called that in the movie) and her relationship to two men: John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the Indian girl who is given the Christian name "Rebecca" later in the film and this woman is mesmerizing throughout. What an innocently-interesting face!<br /><br />Without giving it away, the ending haunted me for a few days afterward. In the end, it is a powerful story, not just scene after scene of gorgeous photography (which it also is). There is more to this movie than the camera-work, but there is no doubt the cinematography is sitll the main attraction. This is a film crying out for a Blu-Ray presentation!</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>This movie is not about action. It's the story about Pocahontas.

Bluray quality is really good.</p></br><a href="../users/A35AMPDFAB8JLT.html">A35AMPDFAB8JLT</a><br/><p>Terence Malick (Thin Red Line) directs this film about the meeting of two worlds. English explorer's land on the west coast of North America, near what today is Virginia, and build a settlement named Jamestown. They encounter the Naturals, as Captain John smith (Colin Farrell) calls the indigenous Indian population. Initially there is a uneasy period as the two cultures get acquainted. John Smith takes a small party up river to meet the Naturals. As is often the case with Malick's films nature is brought to the forefront. The inland landscape is like a confusing labyrinth that overwhelms the explorers. John Smith loses his comrades when they go off exploring in the marshes. Like a large spider's web, the natural world traps the men. This is a beautiful, but dangerous world that the Europeans have not yet tamed. The Naturals have learned to live within the landscape. Like a spider that is shown making its way over a tree trunk the Naturals have found a way to coexist with nature, but for the Europeans this is not the case as their situation deteriorates.<br /><br />John Smith is captured by the Naturals and has his life spared by Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). He lives amongst the Naturals for a time, learning their ways. A romance develops between Smith and Pocahontas, but once the Naturals realize that the Europeans intend to stay the Naturals are determined to chase them away and attack the settlers. Nothing is resolved, but many die on both sides. Eventually John Smith leaves the settlement and heads north leaving the Princess behind. The film beautifully unfolds as each new chapter reveals itself. The broken hearted Pocahontas eventually meets another European John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who she marries. Locations are then switched as Pocahontas sails to England with her European husband. She sees the Old World with its tall buildings and manicured gardens, and sheds her familiar clothing for that of the city dwellers. In this world we see nature as having been tamed by mankind. The trees are sculptured and ordered into distinct rows and patterns.<br /><br />When Pocahontas again meets up with John Smith, it is a meeting of the old memories with the new. "The New World" reflects on the notion of change. Pocahontas is the free spirit that embraces and loves the world that she lives in. She's also the one that bridges the gap between the Naturals and the Europeans. This movie is a meditation about embracing life and all that it has to offer, and we experience this love of life through the exuberance of Pocahontas. Sit back and enjoy this luxurious film that passes over one like a breeze in the forest.<br /><br />P.S. This is one of the best looking, and sounding, blu-rays I have seen. Truly beautiful!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>It's clear to me now that most anyone who watches a Terrence Malick film cannot remain bipartisan in their final assessment of his work. Simply put, people either love his films or they loathe them. For those of us who love symbolism, deeply meditative sequences of sound and imagery, or poetic cinematography, the New World will again act as an ample supply to fulfill your lust for films less ordinary.<br /><br />PLOT:<br />This is the story of Pocahontas and John Smith portrayed in a style you've never seen before. Smith arrives in 17th century Jamestown upon a ship and is sentenced to die, but his sentence is revoked when Smith's importance to the survival of the new colony is acknowledged. He isn't safe from the surrounding "naturals", however, and soon finds himself on the verge of death again until young Pocahontas saves his life.<br />The two quickly develop a platonic friendship in which they innocently teach one another words from each other's native tongue, and roam the landscape in type of otherworldly, cherubic flight of tranquility. Smith, feeding his constant wanderlust, eventually leaves Pocahontas, who at this point has been abandoned by her tribe for placing Smith above her people. She remains at the Anglo settlement and begins adopting their customs and culture. It is here that Pocahontas meets John Rolfe and eventually marries him, adopting the Anglo name of Rebecca. But the memory, and presence, of Smith are not completely evaporated and a final reunion seems imminent.<br /><br />The New World is just as much about the spiritual bond of family as it is the ideal relationship between Smith and Pocahontas. The young native woman at times questions where her dead mother has gone, and in the last hauntingly beautiful segment of the film, finally realizes that all of us live on in our children.<br /><br />There are a number of breathtaking scenes in which Malick intertwines natural beauty and a series of pensively symbolic imagery. Outside a battle scene towards the middle of the film, The New World is remarkably clean and lacks any type of romantic sensuality between Smith and Pocahontas. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has interest in the story or to anyone who enjoys well-crafted films.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer.  Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion, Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent 'naturals' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the 'savages' they may face in this new place. This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent.<br /><br />Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages: the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience, a fact that adds to the feeling of 'the other' on both sides.  And it is this separateness that makes the story credible. Upon landing Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown, which he soon leaves to return to England, leaving Captain Smith in charge.  It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies.  The magic that occurs with this meeting of 'the stranger' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery.  Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's (August Schellenberg) favored daughter Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and lives with the naturals, learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas.<br /><br />But Smith is returned to his fort, suffers misadventures among his own men, sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals, and eventually returns to England, telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned.  Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is 'assimilated' by the new arrival of English.  Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead.  The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English.  She discovers Smith is still alive, dies, and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown. No spoilers, these: this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school.<br /><br />All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over.  The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner.  Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film: the fact is there is little original music here, the use of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments.  Yes, it works, but there is not much other original music to praise.<br /><br />But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film.  It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words.  Farrell, Kilcher, Bale, Thewlis, Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary.  What, then, Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown, the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures.  And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today.  If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, May 06</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>English settlers land in what will become Virginia, meeting the "Naturals", the Indian tribe who lives in the area. Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) stops the planned hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), asking him to lead an expedition to the north, to meet the indigenous tribe's leader. Smith soon meets Pocahontas (newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher) and they are each intrigued by the strangeness of the other. Returning to the settlement, Smith finds his fellow settlers are living in squalor and almost starving. Taking charge, he manages to help them survive the winter, along with a timely delivery of game and fowl by Pocahontas. Soon, they are under attack and they decide to bring the Indian princess there to live. As Pocahontas acclimates to her new life, Smith balances his desire for her with his desire to explore the New World.<br /><br />Terrence Malick's "The New World", his first film since "The Thin Red Line" in 1998, is certainly a beautiful film to watch, perhaps the most beautiful of the year. But as I watched the painterly compositions, I realized that even though his films are beautiful, they suffer from similar problems.<br /><br />Malick is one of a handful of directors who seem to compose every single frame of film as though it is a painted canvas. Composition, color, depth of field, everything in just about every scene is visually stunning, even when the settlers are living in squalor. Some of the shots brought to mind the work of Frederick Remington and his studies of Native Americans. Given the amount of time Malick takes to make a new film, it is clear he is more interested in creating art.<br /><br />During the first hour of "World", Smith and Pocahontas fall in love. It is interesting to watch Farrell and Kilcher portray this without words, at least words the other can understand. Each stares into the other's eyes as they walk in circles in a field. Or they might be walking together, Kilcher tracing the exposed muscles in Farrell's chest, as he watches her in rapt appreciation. As this continues, there becomes a noted lack of entrance into their relationship. Yes, we get the attraction of the new, the physical attraction. But unless we understand their thoughts, what is going on in their heads, we can't become emotionally invested in their relationship.<br /><br />Malick solves this problem in two ways. The first is with voice over narration. As Smith and Pocahontas are engaged in their mating dance, Farrell and Kilcher provide voice over, presumably their character's thoughts. But their narration is fairly esoteric, much like the characters are thinking love poetry they can't express verbally to each other. This adds to the lyrical nature of the film, almost creating a visual poem. It is intriguing to watch this, for about 30 minutes, and then you begin to hope for and expect more of a dramatic arch to the story.<br /><br />The second solution to the communication problem occurs when Pocahontas begins to learn English. Soon, she is very fluent, yet we still get the narrative love poems. They never seem to stop. And they are always accompanied by people staring at one another, or walking through a beautiful field. It becomes more than a little monotonous. It is like going to a museum and viewing an overly large collection of landscapes painted in the same style. They may be pretty, but after 20 or so, it becomes difficult to tell them apart.<br /><br />"World" depicts the founding of the first settlement in Virginia, the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith and later her relationship with John Rolfe (Christian Bale), the relationship between the settlers and the Naturals, and more. Stuff happens. So why does the film feel so inert? A significant portion of screen time is devoted to characters staring at each other, as they circle one another, gazing into each other's eyes as they prance around in a stream, or their hands gliding across the other's flesh, as the voiceover attempts to explain their burgeoning love.<br /><br />"World" is based on actual events in history, but Malick makes a wrong turn in the last 45 minutes. I don't care if it actually happened or not, we don't need to see Pocahontas travel back to England with Rolfe. Again, the scenes are beautiful to watch. And I understand why Malick wanted to include this. We have seen Smith's New World, now we must see Pocahontas' New World as well. The problem is Pocahontas has become so integrated into the lives of the settlers her discovery of England doesn't have the power of Smith's. And it only makes the film that much longer.<br /><br />Farrell and Kilcher are both good. Am impressive supporting cast (Christian Bale, Christopher Plummer, David Thewlis, Wes Studi, Jonathan Pryce) clearly wanted the opportunity to work with the respected filmmaker.<br /><br />Throughout, we don't get enough of a sense of what makes John Smith tick. Why did he leave his relationship with Pocahontas? Why the teary reunion in England filled with regrets? What is the point of these scenes? Malick devotes so much attention to the visual, that he doesn't seem concerned with answering these questions. Until we can understand, the drama will falter.<br /><br />Malick's films are always beautiful to watch, but the dramatic elements receive less attention. Until Malick is able to more evenly distribute his attentions, his films will always be beautiful, but frustrating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>One can't deny the visual beauty of Terrence Malick's films.  His camera captures glorious vistas, and beautiful lighting.  I found THE NEW WORLD, however, ultimately a dull, laborious history lesson.  Too much use of visuals, stilted dialogue, long unnecessary scenes, repetitive in nature, and even the action scenes seemed lethargic and unimaginative.<br /><br />Q'oriana Kilcher's performance as Pocahontas is the strongest one in the film; she has a stunning presence and uses her silences effectively.  Colin Farrell seems lost in his role as John Smith and Christian Bales and Christopher Plummer are lost in their brief roles.<br /><br />The movie is too long and tedious, and not one of my favorite recent films at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>When you see Terrence Malick's "The New World," you feel as if you are watching an exquisite poem coming to life on the big screen.  This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies.  As with his previous films, "Badlands," Days of Heaven" and "The Thin Red Line," Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.<br /><br />"The New World" is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face.  The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown.  There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement.  Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.<br /><br />Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting.  Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects.  Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us.  Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well.  Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner ("Titanic").<br /><br />Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voiceover recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camerawork.  As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work.  15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.<br /><br />It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography).  What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss "The New World" as just Art with a capital "A," this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times.  It has the rare ability to transport you to a different world and leave you aching for more.</p></br></body></html>

His empty humdrum life begins to find a meaning as in his fantasies he sees himself belonging...But where he attaches &quot;belonging&quot; is indeed where he doesnt belong into as he pictures himself as a secret uncle of that family.<br /><br />  When he finds out that the husband of that family has turned unfaithful to his wife he decides it's time to take measures.<br />  Predictably, those measures carry the psychotic touches that have been taking over him and the results are...somewhat ugly.<p>  With such a setting (the idea is on its own scary and actually does drive the film automatically in certain points) and with Williams in very convincing form and in a role that seems to be a perfect cast &quot;One hour Photo&quot; should've been gone down as a classic in the genre.<br />  But it doesn't. It doesn't because the rest of the characters are underdeveloped at best, and the pace of the film doesn't keep you envolved enough to bother.<br />  What &quot;One hour Photo&quot; tries to be is indeed a slow paced psychologigal thriller but even as such it simply doesn't cut it.<br /><br />  Most of the time the film becomes intimidating in one's mind because you can easily picture what could happen &quot;if&quot; but in the film itself this &quot;if&quot; hardly takes a horror form.<br />  Basically the one who has failed here is the script writer who loses the reigns in pace and in engagement.<p>  Not a bad choice for a night in and a stash of DVDs to watch but dont expect this film to make scars of terror in your cerebrum...</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Robin Williams as a bad guy? Must be a joke, right? <p>No joke. Ever since I saw Robin play the angry dad, if only for a few seconds, at the end of Mrs. Doubtfire, I realized that he would make a really scary villain. And honestly, he's not even a villain in One Hour Photo (although the director really wants you to think just that). He's more of an anti-hero. <p>Williams' strength is that he's playing against type. We know he's a nut -- in a good way -- and expect him to burst out into showtunes at any moment. This just makes the bubbling cauldron of his emotions that much more compelling. <p>And oh yea, Williams supposedly playd Dungeons &amp; Dragons once or twice. Which makes me like him even more. <p>One Hour Photo's plot is simple: a photo clerk (Sy Parrish, played by Williams) at the local Wal-mart (er, Sav-Mart) sees things. Lots of things. Things he isn't always meant to see. He becomes obsessed with a family and has pictures of them all over his wall. It could happen to anyone -- it could be happening right now. Do you REALLY know what happens to your photos when you bring them in? <p>Things take a turn for the worse when Sy discovers, through his job, that not all is at it seems in said happy family. When he discovers infidelity -- that the image he clung to is in fact horribly tainted and all too real, he snaps. And as he snaps, we descend from the heavenly glow of the Sav-Mart's white lights to a dizzying kaleidoscope of hell. <p>The lensing is a primary character in this film: Greens, yellows, and reds (the color separation of photos, get it?) are all carefully lensed to give a surreal edge to Sye's rage, his madness, his sorrow. Colors are dissonant even though Sye himself is nearly invisible in his pastel clothes. His home is a stark, barren wasteland of color. The only thing that bothered me about the lensing is that the colors often seemed randomly placed -- something I have been trained by other directors to look for as a hint to further meaning in the movie (thanks to Spielberg and the red coat in Schindler's List and Shamalayan's red everything in Sixth Sense). But that's on purpose too, as there IS no meaning to Sye's world beyond the pictures he takes. <p>One Hour Photo is as much about the ideal American family that you see in department store catalogs as it is about Eleanor Rigbys of the world. For every American ideal, there is a flawed interior. For every pleasant, affable man, there is a demon waiting to be unleashed. <p>The ending is twisted and poignant, although some might feel it's a cop out. It explains Sye's history, why he so desperately needs a perfect family in his head, and why pictures hold so much affection for him. It also explains his subsequent violence and rage when said family cannot live up to his ideals. There's even a twist at the end -- something Maleficent picked up on but that I missed. <p>This is one of those movies that I didn't like nearly as much until thinking about it afterwards. It's a classic depiction of suburban hell, an intellectual horror. It reminded me a lot of Session 9, only without the insane asylum. <p>See it, but don't expect a slasher flick (despite the trailers).</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Proving that he had depths of creepiness untouched by his performance in "Insomnia," Robin Williams puts on some weight, dyes his hair blonde, and inhabits the body and less than complete life of Sy Parrish, who works at the photo lab at the local Sav*Mart (writer-director Mark Romanek talks about it being like a K-Mart or Target, but I am sure everybody who watches this immediately thinks Wal-Mart).  During all that time that he has been processing photographs, Sy has taken what can only be characterized as an unhealthy interest in the family of Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith).  Nina has a husband, Will (Michael Vartan), who works too much, but it turns out there are other more serious problems with the perfect life Sy has seen while developing her photographs all these years.  <p>Sy is a nobody, a non-entity dismissed by the rest of the world who sees everything that his life is not in the photographs he develops for the Yorkins.  He sees himself as their "Uncle Sy," a kindly Dutch Uncle.  But Sy has a dark side, which only comes out when something he cares about, such as the setting of cyan on the photo printer, goes wrong, and as Sy starts to work his way into the lives of the Yorkins away from Sav*Mart he finds a fatal flaw in their perfect lives.  After all, Sy does not just develop photographs for them; he just always prints an extra set just for himself.  <p>However, for me there is one rather giant hole in this plot and that has to do with the access that Sy has to the entire store, especially after he is given the ax.  I have to tell you that I have worked in places that have fired employees and stood there watching them empty out their desks.  Under the circumstances that leave to Sy's termination, and given the antipathy that Bill Ownes (Gary Cole) feels for him, it just stretches the limits of my credulity that what happens would be allowed to happen.  <p>However, "One Hour Photo" earns back points because at the end of the film we find out, along with Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq LaSalle), not only why Sy did what he did, but also what he did--and it all fits together.  We are not talking about a stunning, spectacular resolution, but simply something that provides the final piece of the puzzle.  Lots of films never get that far and combined with the sustained creepiness of Robin Williams's performance, that is enough to warrant checking out "One Hour Photo."</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I like Robin Williams. I really do. I've seen most of his pictures (even the bizarre ones) and know that he's not just a great comic actor, but a great dramatic actor, too. However, if Williams wants to gain more recognition for his dramatic roles, he's got to start picking movies that have better &quot;umph&quot;.<p>ONE HOUR PHOTO is a movie about a photo lab technician (Williams) who after years of developing pictures for the same family becomes obsessed with them and wants to enter their lives in a more intimate way. The concept is pretty creepy and seems promising. However, the movie never fulfills its promise. Instead, all the great acting, lighting, and scenery go to waste in a movie without any meaning or real plot. What could have been a great stalker film ends up getting lost in the art of filmmaking and the movie itself is lost in the process. So, basically, ONE HOUR PHOTO is a journey of ninety minutes to nowhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I was very surpised by this film.  Actually, I had heard various things - pro and con- and was somewhat led astray by the trailers.  This is a thriller and a very creepy one at that, but it never devolves into a violent gore-fest or a typical action thriller - that is a good thing.  Instead Robin Williams (in an amazing performance) leads us through the creepy and moving downfall of a lonely and disturbed man.  It is very effectively directed and scored.  This is the kind of film that will send the shivers down your spine while also filling you up with a good dose of empathy.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw this film with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film features a chilling performance by Robin Williams. Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Gary Cole also do good work. However, I do have one issue with this film: why is there a scene of the kid hugging his dad? personally, i think that's disgusting. View the film for Mr. Williams' performance. R(More nudity of the female would have been nice, though). Rated R.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`One Hour Photo' is not a film you will soon forget.  That isn't to say that the film itself is a masterpiece by any means, for I think that it may be a little too aware of itself to be that impressionable, but at the end of the day this is certainly a film you will remember; quite vividly even.  In fact, years after the fact there is a crisp whiteness that I don't think I'll ever forget (the cinematography itself is rather remarkable; the camera catching so much with so little).<br /><br />Robin Williams takes his usual persona and tosses it on its head rather abruptly with his astonishing turn as Seymour Parrish, a lonely and isolated one-hour photo technician who becomes disturbingly obsessed with a young couple who frequent the photo department.  His obsession helps ease his loneliness, as he mentally adopts this family as his own.  That said obsession starts to deteriorate his sanity though, and soon it drives him to acts of unwarranted insanity as he begins to interfere with their lives in ways that are not his right.<br /><br />Williams is certainly in a different zone than usual.  He is effectively creepy and really grounds this film in areas that are a little shaky.  He is wholly convincing and crawls beneath your skin, but not in a way that makes him ultimately repulsive.  In fact, despite his maniacal eventualities, there is something endearing about this crazy man.  You want him to find solace because it is apparent that his overreactions are syphoned from his desperation and internal torment.  He just wants to love, and he thought he found a purity in this young couple he took into his heart, and when realities come to his attention he feels genuinely heartbroken.  Robin Williams conveys that magnificently, and it is his performance that you will remember more than any other aspect of this film (that, and the white).<br /><br />As a whole though, `One Hour Photo' doesn't always find its footing.  I mentioned earlier that the film was a little too aware of itself, and that problem rears its head in areas that defeat the integral purpose of the film.  While Williams maintains his characters depth, the details that permeate each scene can overtake things a bit.  As I said in my review title, it's that coldness that is a double edged sword here.  It is effectively chilling, and that is necessary with this breed of film, but it is that same coldness that can make it difficult to wholly connect with the film.  It is a chilling atmosphere, but it needed a few more shades (maybe a little warmth) to feel complete.  Instead, it becomes overwhelming and comes across almost overtly serious.  It takes itself too seriously, which isn't to say that the film shouldn't feel serious (especially considering the subject matter) but it needed more emotional complexities to feel truly grounded and whole.<br /><br />Robin Williams is outstanding, but the film lacks the shading needed to truly anchor this in greatness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>It's rare to see a family in a photograph that is full of sorrow and despair. Most of the time, it's a requirement to have smiling faces in a family picture. Nobody wants to see any sort of sad expression on a face, because that's not what people would want to remember when it's revisited. It's the exact opposite of the news: we want FOND memories of life. And sometimes when we look at a smiling family in a Kodak picture, we wish we had that sort of happiness in the past (and in the present). It may seem odd to some people, but never to the main character of "One Hour Photo": Sy Parrish.<br /><br />In the film, Sy (played by Robin Williams) is one of those people that we never really notice everyday. He works at a clinic in a department store, and he seems to be nothing but air. Very few people care about him (mainly his customers).  He's neither a celebrity nor a messiah. People would pass him by and would always be oblivious of his presence, and it's only because they've got other things in mind. As a matter of fact, he would actually blend in the white and gray walls due to the dull colors of his clothing. Sy doesn't look like he acknowledges his mediocre existence, but it's clear that he cares about his work. He is fully dedicated to creating photos, but it's unfortunate that his line of work offers him nothing in return. He is not married, and he has very little friends (probably none). Whenever he heads home from work, all he does is feed his pet hamster and watch television. His life is devastatingly empty, and he just wants the world to see that he existed. Something does give him happiness, though. There is a customer named Nina Yorkin (played by Connie Nielsen) who brings in family photos, and Sy happily process them. She is his favorite customer, and therefore, her photos are the ones that he admires the most. In fact, he loves them so much that they have actually become a part of his life. The smiles and the various colorful images on these photos make him happy, because this looks like the one thing that was missing his entire life: a perfect family. He has the desire to become a part of the "supposed" picture-perfect family that's embedded on hand-sized pieces of paper, and he'll do anything to make sure that it this happiness stays within, even if it results in severe consequences.<br /><br />Director Mark Romanek has done a splendid job with "One Hour Photo." He and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer, have made the correct look of the film: the contrasts of light and color between Sy's apartment, the department store, and the Yorkins' home are very well-done. Romanek has also formed the appropriate pacing for this movie: nothing is ever too slow or too rushed. Credit should also go to Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek for the chilling yet beautiful music score. Actually, credit should go to everyone who was involved with this film.<br /><br />Robin Williams is mostly known for his comedic work. I don't admire a majority of the films that he appeared in, but I admire him for his abstract comic timings and improvisations. His dramatic work, however, has surprised millions of people because this is the exact opposite of what he has been associated with. I'm not particularly shocked by this change of pace, but I was deeply fascinated by not only his character, but also his performance in the film. Robin has that quiet, awkward personality down perfectly for his character, and his complete absorption of Sy Parrish's mannerisms and dialogue is really a mesmerizing sight to see. The supporting cast does a very good job as well. Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith were very appropriate as the Yorkins, while Gary Cole plays Bill Owens, the store manager, with very few flaws.<br /><br />"One Hour Photo" is not a feel-good film, nor is it trying to be one. It succeeds at being a psychological thriller/drama that delves into solemn real-world issues. It's depressing, but it's also powerful. It's not exactly perfect, but it's still an effective film, and it remains on my list of all-time favorites.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though the advent of digital photography may render the theme somewhat obsolete, this well-directed and acted horror film acts on the audience's fears convincingly for a majority of the film until the not-entirely successful ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is a fine film, which along with 'Insomnia' marked a sudden change in what we expect from Robin Williams. Unlike quite a few people I've always though he was a good actor. You really can't argue about his performances in 'Good Morning Vietnam' or 'The Fisher King'. However I'll concede he has made some some turkeys in his time!<br /><br />'One Hour Photo' is something completely different. Williams plays Sy, a photo technician in a large store. He's a loner who leads a pretty sad life and who gradully becomes obessed with a family who he regularly develops photos for.<br /><br />The film develops quickly and there isn't really a wasted minute. Its well scripted, and directed with some style by Mark Romanek. This is a great example to many Hollywood filmmakers of what can be acheived through character development, rather than the unneccessary use of CGI special effects.<br /><br />At only 91 minutes in length this is film that in many ways stands up to comparison with Alfred Hitchcocks work. OK its not as good as his very best, but its not far off that standard.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>This was a creepy thriller starring Robin Williams, which came out a few years ago.

Like a photo, a portrait of a repressed, egotistic, neurotic and aggressive man is revealed before our yes, leaving us with a question mark: could our life be that vulnerable?</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superlative psychological thriller and one of the best in the genre,  with a bravura performance by Robin Williams as a somewhat unhinged photo technician. Deftly directed by Mark Romanek, who has an eye for detail and an understanding that less is sometimes more, it is simply one of the best films released in 2002.<br /><br />The plot line seems simple. Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an exacting  photo technician in a large, squeaky clean and bright, well stocked,  discount mall type store. A lonely, middle-aged man, he seems to fade into the background. He is the type of person of whom others are apt to take little notice. Polite and pleasant, he is seemingly inoffensive, yet, always a beat off. He also has one little foible. He has become obsessed with the Yorkin family.<br /><br />The Yorkins are customers of his for whom he develops photographs. He has been developing their photos for years and has seen most of their cherished moments, participating in them vicariously. It is as if Nina, Will, and  their young son, Jake,  have become his family, only the Yorkins haven't a clue about Sy's secret obsession. When Sy becomes aware that the sanctity of  his secret, picture perfect family is endangered, he becomes the avenging angel, setting into motion a series of events that reveal his own deepest, darkest secret.<br /><br />Robin Williams is absolutely sensational as Sy, the photo guy. He transforms himself, as if he were a chameleon. His performance is brilliant and well nuanced. As strange as Sy may seem at times, the viewer cannot help but like and pity him, even when he is at his weirdest. Sy's palpable longing to be a part of the Yorkin family is heartbreaking. Though most of his interaction is with Connie and Jake, as they are the ones who bring in the family photos to be developed, when Will comes to the store one day, Sy immediately recognizes him from the photos. Sy introduces himself to the surprised Will,  asking after his family and complimenting Will on his home, a place in which Sy has never been a guest. It is all slightly creepy, adding to the mounting tension in the film. Robin Williams plays the role of Sy to great effect, making the most of each and every moment that he is on screen. He is the quintessential lonely man, so isolated and alienated from those around him that any of his attempts at interaction with others is always a beat off.<br /><br />Connie Nielsen is luminous as Nina Yorkin, a woman who is always pleasant to Sy and brightens his day every time she and Jake walk in the store to have photos developed. She is a woman whose beaming countenance belies the knowledge that there is something wrong with her marriage. There is a canker taking hold of her suburban home, eating away at the core of her family, only she cannot get Will to discuss it rationally with her.  She does not know what is wrong, only that there is definitely something amiss, although all will, ultimately, be made clear to her.<br /><br />Michael Vartan is excellent as Will Yorkin, the good looking, though slightly unlikable, husband. Dylan Smith gives a sweet performance as Jake Yorkin. Erin Daniels is perfectly cast as Maya, a woman for whom Sy also develops photos. Eriq La Salle is very good as the sensitive Detective Van Der Zee. Gary Cole is terrific as the high energy store manager who gets on Sy's case about a number of issues that are coming to light in connection with the seemingly placid Sy. This is a solid cast that contributes to the overall success of this interesting and quirky film.<br /><br />The sets are also used most effectively. The bright, almost bleached, starkness of the huge store set is a perfect setting for Sy, as he almost melds into the background, at times, as if he were disappearing. Only his bright blue store vest saves him from total obscurity. This is fraught with meaning, as it is his job that helps to keep Sy grounded.  The Yorkin home is filled with earth tones, giving a homey, cozy glow, enshrouding the family in a haze of warmth. Sy's own apartment is a sterile, ugly environment. There is nothing cozy about it. The only real sign that someone may actually live there are the photographs of the Yorkins that are displayed for all the world to see.<br /><br />Moreover, just when one thinks one has it all figured out, there are more surprises to come. This is simply a brilliant film on many fronts. The direction, Robin Williams' performance, the sets, the restrained, low key, tension building approach, and the twist in the ending, all contribute to making this a film to add to one's collection.

As time goes by, Sy starts to care more and more about a family he met through his job.

Still, it is a movie that is very much worth seeing.<p>I'd heard good word about One Hour Photo, but went into it knowing little beyond the observation that Robin Williams' character was creepy. That didn't surprise me. I've always felt that, beneath the machine-gun style joke slinging, there is something, well, pathological about Mr. Williams. No, I don't think he is a psychopath like his character in this movie. However, let's just say that I always felt that being creepy was part of his less well advertised repertoir. (Come on. Patch Adams was creepy. Admit it.)<p>Let me cut to the chase. This movie is about the writing; about the directing; about the cinematography; and, mostly, about a stunning, understated performance by Williams. There are some flaws here. The actors who play the suburban family on whom Williams' character obsesses turn in relatively weak performances; but, fortunately, their roles are small. Williams so dominates the screen, and does his work so well, that it isn't a distraction that the rest of the world he inhabits seems a bit two dimensional (much like all those photographs in which he lives). I should note that the actor who plays his boss at the SavMart turns in a solid performance, as well. This is critical since Williams' fate at the SavMart, at the hands of this boss, is the core, and entirely credible, linchpin around which this psychological thriller revolves.<p>The music and sound effects are generally used well, although they are a bit heavy handed at times. And the interesting shots and colors are reminiscent of artistic photography--adding a magnificent texture and appeal to the film.<p>This film is creepy, and it sits with you.

Sy is the main character in the movie One Hour Photo which is one of the greatest thrillers in this time period. <p>I recently rented One Hour Photo after months and months of waiting for it to come on video. The only flaw with this movie is that it felt like it was 96 seconds long. In reality the movie is 96 minutes long. After seeing it on video I decided that I really wanted to see it again. Therefore I bought it and watched it again today. It felt as if the movie got better the second time I saw it. Well mabey not better. The word that I should have used was &quot;still excellant.&quot; It didn't have the element of surprise when I watched it today but it was still great. <p>The thing that makes the movie what it is is the premise. It has a fantastic orignal storyline. People have stalked people and became obbessed with people from seeing them and talking to them. Nobody ever thought about the people who find out things about other people's lives through there picture. What a fantastic element of thriller Mark Romanek(the writer and director of One Hour Photo) thought up with. <p>Lighting gave the mood of the movie. The lighting was also always different with diffeent kinds of sets. When you saw the photo lab it was very white, when you saw Sy's fantasies about the family he loves it is colorful and happy. When you see the reality of the family it is a little bit colorful but also a little dark. When you saw what Sy did towards the end it was extremly dark. <p>The score was the last thing that the crew of the movie did that wowed me. The music was perfect to this type of movie. Those of you who have seen the movie might know about the music being played when Sy is running in the hotel. It was just fantastic and pretty soon I saw myself humming the theme of that music.<p>Finally the plot. I have talked about everything that has been showen in the movie except the plot. The film opens with Sy(Robin Williams) caught. I never approved of flashback stories...especially in a thriller. In this movie you know that Sy gets caught by the police in the end. That is a minor flaw that all movies that do that have. Sy starts his story with the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin(Commie Nielson) loves taking picture of her son Jake(Dylan Smith) and her husband Will(Michael Vartan). She gets them devopled at the local Savmart where Yoshi and his co worker Sy work. Sy have developed the Yorkins picture since Jake was a baby and eventually thinks that he is part of the family or &quot;Uncle Sy&quot; Nina and Jake like Sy but not as much as Sy likes them. Sy thinks that the Yorkins are the perfect family but he doesn't know that Nina and Will fight about money issues and Jake hears them fighint. Sy thinks of Jake as his nephew and gives him a free disponisble camera for his birthday which just pasts. Nina doesn't know the dedication that Sy puts into the family's photo's more then anyone eles's.But with his contact with the family in the store(at the lab and in the store's isle's when Will goes shopping there)the store's manenger Bill Owens(Gary Cole) becomes increasly concerned with Sy. Bill lays Sy off which is the first thing that gets Sy angry. The raging point of Sy is when he finds out that Will is having an affair with Maya Burson(Erin Daniels). Not to ruin anything in between that and the eventual involment with police detective James Van Der Zee(played fantasticly by Eriq La Salle)<p>Hopefully you have notices that this is a great movie by reading my plot and my reveiw. Of course you have to see the entire movie to really appriciate it.<p>ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Sy Parrish has no life,so he adopts that of a family of customers<br />who bring their photographs for developing to the store where he works.  Their seemingly happy family life is in complete contrast to his own lonely, stark existence.  His apartment is symbolically white with very little furniture or decorations other than the hundreds of photos he has taken of the Yorkin family and put up on his wall.  He gently insinuates himself into the Yorkins' life by attending the son's soccer practice and striking up a conversation with the wife at a fast food restaurant.  Things come to a head when Sy discovers that all is not well in the Yorkin home and he sets out to extract revenge from an unfaithful family member.  Robin Williams' performance is wonderful, down to the last detail and he draws the viewer into the ever-deepening abyss of his gentle madness.  The photography, imagery, music, and set design all contribute to an engrossing viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"One Hour Photo" is a clever, offbeat movie that is perhaps 2002's creepiest thriller. Its premise may be unlikely but it's still chillingly plausible. What if that nice man at the store where you have your photos developed has a dangerous obsession with your family? What if alienation and loneliness causes him to start acting out his fantasies? <p>Seymour Parrish [Robin Williams] is a quiet but pleasant middle-aged man who has worked for years in the photo department of a local discount store. He lives alone in a forlorn apartment. His social interactions seem limited to the store. This is the place where Nina and Will Yorkin, an apparently ideal couple has had family photos developed since their eight-year old son was an infant. What they don't know is that Seymour has made them his `adopted' family. He fantasizes about being a beloved relative. The Yorkins, however, turn out not to be the perfect family, and when Seymour discovers this, he goes off the deep end. <p>Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as Seymour and is even scarier than he was as the killer in "Insomnia". Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan are quite convincing as the Yorkins. The movie's set and art design are especially good, strikingly contrasting Seymour's cold, blue-white world with the warm, earthy tones of the Yorkins'. <p>"One Hour Photo" is more than a mere thriller. It is a vivid portrait of an ordinary man torn apart by the ravages of alienation. On the surface, Seymour is a monster, but underneath, he is a soul in torment - one I can not help but feel empathy for. Though it's not always easy to watch, I recommend this one highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Robin Williams was excellent as a slightly creepy loner.  You will find yourself sympathizing with Williams' character, while worrying that he's rapidly going over the edge.<p>I liked the fact that this movie was not gory, as most Hollywood thrillers tend to be.  <p>Great acting!  You've grown up, &quot;Mork&quot;.  I don't understand why I have not heard more about this movie - it's not the usual slash and burn thriller.  Loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>The first three-quarters of this movie are excellent! Robin Williams plays Sy, a pitifully lonely photo developer who just happens to be obsessed with a family who has their pictures processed by him. While we don't know much about his background, we do feel we know Sy, as we follow his miserable existence from his neat, but empty apartment to being hounded by his boss at work. The story becomes truly sinister as we see Sy wants to become part of this family, by any way he can. Up to this point, the movie is great!<p>But will someone please tell me who wrote the last 30 minutes of the film? Surely, some stranger walked in to the screenwriter's office, took the script away from him, and finished it, without reading it. The ending's style didn't match the preceeding part at all. I kept thinking, "Huh?" It completely fell apart and any tension that was built up was lost. Too bad, because it started out so well. Williams is excellent in his portrayal of a psycho, but the script let him and us down at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Given the backdrop of the local SavMart and the stunning performance of Robin Williams, this film is a deeply scary thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through; whether it's out of complete fear of what his character will do next or the embarrassment he faces for his actions.<p>This is most certainly Robin Williams scariest role to date and one in which he's least like himself as he's completely suppressed his comedic nature for the almost clinical persona of Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parish.  He certainly deserves any and all accolades he earns from this film.  Connie Nielsen performs admirably in this film as well.<p>In his feature film directing debut, Mark Romanek has written and directed a pure psychological thriller masterpiece.  From the simple concept of looking at a SavMart like store and coming up with this script, he has shown an amazing talent.  This is a director whose films are to be looked out for in the future.<p>The soundtrack for this film is also quite dead on with every sequence and adds beautifully to the suspenseful nature of the film.<p>The premise:<p>Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parish (Robin Williams) works at the local SavMart as the photo technician.  He's been working there for eleven years and in a large sense he has no life other than his job.  During his daily routine at work, he sees everybody's lives, or more succinctly, their more joyful moments, in the pictures they bring in to be developed.  Somewhere along the line he has become thoroughly infatuated with one particular family, the Yorkins.  Sy even fantasizes about being Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.<p>When Sy suddenly suffers a catastrophic event in his life, he essentially flips all the way off of the rocker and what follows from there simply has to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers that this viewer has watched in quite some time.<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre; it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library and will stand up quite well to multiple viewings.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>- Writer, Director and Actor Commentary<br />- &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; Sundance Channel Featurette<br />- &quot;Making of&quot; Featurette<br />- &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; Interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek<br />- Theatrical Trailer and TV Spots</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I am at best an indifferent Robin Williams fan when it comes to his movies. I admit I like some of his stuff, like &quot;The World According to Garp,&quot; &quot;The Dead Poets Society,&quot; and, although I will deny it if asked directly, &quot;Toys.&quot; But far too often, the frenetic comedian's films leave me feeling slightly nauseated. When a loved one wanted to watch &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; with me, I inwardly scoffed. I really haven't watched anything from Williams in some time, but I figured it would be extremely rude to ignore yet again my significant other's cinematic choice for the evening. Fortunately, she finally picked something I could get into. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; is definitely not your normal Robin William's fare. The comedian, who has been looking to break out of his comedy straitjacket for years, really delivers the goods with this creepy yarn about an obsessive retail employee stalking a young family. William's performance here is so good that you wonder why he hasn't tried something this daring before. Gone is the performer's spastic, eardrum shattering personality so often seen when he appears on a talk show or in a stand up concert. Instead, we see a subdued, angry Robin Williams capable of inducing nightmares.<p>Williams plays Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parrish, a lonely, middle-aged photo shop employee who has nothing in his life except the job. He is a one-hour photo development guy who works at one of those big chain department stores that sit on every other street corner across the country. One benefit of Sy's job is that he gets to know many of his customers on a first name basis, which for him constitutes his only interaction with other human beings. Parrish isn't married, doesn't have children or friends, and lives a rather bleak existence in a dim apartment. He doesn't have anything really except the copies of other people's pictures he clandestinely steals from the photo department. Parrish's favorite photos are from the Yorkin family: consisting of mother Nina, father Will, and son Jake. Nina and Jake have been coming into the photo lab for years to get their pictures developed, and Sy has taken quite a shine to them. Jake even refers to Parrish as &quot;Sy, the photo guy,&quot; a moniker Seymour takes as quite a compliment. Heck, after awhile he even feels like part of the family, so much so that he covers one whole wall of his apartment with stolen pictures of the Yorkins. If Sy cannot live with his adopted family, at least he can bring them into his own house and relive the family's most precious moments. The Yorkins look like the perfect little family on paper, and it isn't too long before Sy starts to step over the line. He &quot;accidentally&quot; runs into Nina Yorkin at the mall where the two engage in small talk, which, although meaning little to Nina, means the world to Sy. Then Jake &quot;accidentally&quot; runs across Parrish one day after school, when the photo guy just happens to bring the child a gift.<p>Parrish's world becomes inseparable from the Yorkin's lives, to the point that he begins following them around every chance he gets. Sy has plenty of spare time on his hands because he loses his job at the photo mart after his boss fires him for stealing pictures. The loss of the job is devastating, but even more destructive to Parrish's fragile mental state is the sudden discovery of imperfection in the &quot;perfect&quot; Yorkin household. Nina and Will have problems, specifically over Jake and the father's inability to connect with his son. One problem leads to many more when Will Yorkin decides to take a dangerous step outside of his marriage and Sy Parrish is there to teach the sort of lesson no one could ever forget. The conclusion is a shocker because it takes a different approach from the usual stalker/obsessive person film. <p>I liked &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot; Obviously, William's take on a guy who snaps psychologically is radically different from many of his other film roles. Sy Parrish is creepy and disconnected, and Williams successfully reveals to us the inner turmoil felt by this individual. Just as neat was the chain store where Sy worked. The place is so sterile, bright, and obsessively organized that I loved looking at the place whenever they showed it. Parrish's apartment with the hundreds of pictures on the wall gives you the chills when you see it, especially later when Sy goes on his rampage and the police find the pictures with Will Yorkin's face scratched out on every single snapshot. The best scene in the film was when we see Sy snooping around the Yorkin house and the family suddenly arrives home just in time to see...well, it's best that you watch the movie yourself to discover how this scene plays out. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; has some unforgettable moments.<p>The few problems with the movie have little to do with the DVD release, which boasts a Charlie Rose interview with Williams, some behind the scenes stuff, and an interesting menu screen. After watching the &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette on the disc, I realized that some of the messages the makers of &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; attempted to pass on to the viewer didn't exactly work. The scene in question involved Sy's first meeting with Will Yorkin in the department store. The director goes on and on about how the store represents a type of heaven to Parrish and how he proves his power over Yorkin by summoning help on the store intercom. I must have missed that when I watched the movie and I am not sure many viewers perceived that scene, or others, as the producers intended. Despite that, this movie is a must see for Robin Williams fans and a should see for all others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Robin Williams gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the lonely, somewhat creepy, but wholly sympathetic Sy Parrish in this haunting, compelling directorial debut by Mark Romanek.  Some have called this a scary movie, but One Hour Photo works on emotional levels much deeper than fear and disquiet.  This is an intellectual thriller that at times borders on a work of art, a carefully constructed exploration of the depths to which loneliness and bland ordinariness can drive a man.  Everyone reacts to this movie differently; by design, a sense of moral ambiguity pervades the story and its presentation.  Many may see Sy Parrish as a bad guy (though certainly not a stereotypical one); those lucky enough to never know the hopelessness and loneliness this man endures or to experience the devastation of seeing your whole world pulled out from under your feet may look down their noses at him with denigration, not truly understanding his afflictions.  Most of us, though, know what utter loneliness feels like to some degree, and I can't help but believe that most viewers will feel a connection to Sy Parrish that differs markedly from what they might anticipate going in.  If you ask me, there is a bad guy in this film, but it is not Sy Parrish.<br /><br />Sy Parrish's job means everything to him; as a photo developer at a large retail store, he develops customers' pictures with great care and professionalism.  Outside of his photo development domain, he is bland and invisible, a man truly alone.  His life could not be more different from the lives he sees day by day in the pictures he develops - in the pictures of happy families, he sees everything he wants but cannot have.  Thus, it almost seems natural that he would begin to fantasize about being a part of such a life, to have a family of his own.  His favorite family is the Yorkins, a seemingly perfect young couple with one son.  Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) is one of Sy's best customers; she's always bringing in pictures to be developed.  Having watched the Yorkin family evolve over a number of years, Sy has adopted them as his own, making his own copies of all their pictures.  He knows Nina, her husband Will (Michael Vartan), and son Jake (Dylan Smith) intimately through their photos; he knows where they live, what their house is like, and all sorts of additional personal details about them.  In his own mind, he is Uncle Sy to Jake, and he tries to insinuate himself into the Yorkins' lives at just the time his own real life is beginning to fragment.  His job is no longer secure, and it is during this troubled time that he discovers that the Yorkins are not the ideal family after all.  That discovery is just more than he can take.<br /><br />This is not the kind of role you associate with Robin Williams, but there can be no doubt that this man is among the most accomplished of actors.  All of the natural energy Williams suppresses in his transformation to the externally calm, quiet, rather forgettable Sy Parrish lends his performance a power that few other actors could bring to such a role.  Writer and director Mark Romanek gave Williams a completely different look, and the set design and cinematography reinforces that directorial vision to lend the movie a sense of hyperreality that proves as unsettling as Sy's descent into mental disconnection.  The acting is superb all the way around, but Williams clearly steals the show with one of the most impressive performances I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Topped off by a writer/director/actor commentary, a really well-made behind-the-scenes featurette, an "Anatomy of a Scene" Sundance Channel Featurette, and an extensive interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek on The Charlie Rose Show, One Hour Photo easily qualifies as a must-own DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I had expected One Hour Photo to be yet another variation on the overused Hand That Rocks the Cradle/Fatal Attraction stalker genre, and I was glad to be proven wrong.  Rather than a film about a crazed, murderous stalker, Director Mark Romanek delivers a touching portrait of a lonely man looking for a place to fit in.<p>  Robin Williams is excellent as Sy "The Photo Guy" Parrish, who uses his job in the photo departmant of SavMart to accumulate pictures of the family he so desperately wishes to be a part of. When he discovers clues that all might not be sweetness and light with his fantasy family, Sy decides to take steps to correct things. <p>  I really didn't feel too much for the Yorkin family- Apart from the sympathetic young son, the parents aren't the nicest of people, and the secret they're hiding made me like them even less. (I did understand how Sy could be drawn to the lovely Mrs. Yorkin, played by the luminous Connie Nielson.) The ending is vastly different from what I was expecting, and that's always a plus. <p>  See it for Robin Williams' strong performance, which is sure to be a contender at Oscar time.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>People at indie film company Killer Films did it again.  After making impressive films like "Boys Don't Cry" and "Hedwig and Angry Inch" (or not so impressive "Office Killer"), they produced another film with a serious theme.  But don't worry; despite its subject matter, "One Hour Photo" is not as schocking as "Taxi Driver."  No strange haircut, no handguns in the sleeve, but just Sy, loneliest guy in the world.<p>Robim Willimas, after 3 years' absence, throws away any good-guy image he gathered in the 90s, and becomes Sy Parrish, one hour photo techinician working at a counter in a huge shopping center.  He works earnestly, takes his job seriously, and, most of all, is utterly lonely.  His only (day)dream is to be 'Uncle Sy' of his customer and picture perfect family Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin (read 'Your Kin'), whose life Sy hopelessly longs for.  But soon we learn that Sy can no longer handle his fantasy, and we are going to see his illusion run amok, making him stalk around the family.  And everything rushes to the disaster when Uncle Sy knows something he should not know about the family.<p>The film owns its enormous power to Robin Williams's creepy performance as Sy, who gradually loses the control of himself.  Though you may feel he looks (or sounds) like Patch Adams at first, you soon forget that sense, thanks to his strong acting.  By accepting the role of this lonely man, he once again after the good turn in "Insomnia" shows his will to extend his faculty as an actor, and he shows it well.  In fact, he has already shown another aspect of acting in his cameo role of terrorist in "The Secret Agent" (Joseph Conrad's film version), but never fully achieved the result.  But now he did it.<p>But "One Hour Photo" is helped by other factors; supporting actors Michael Vartan (Drew's teacher in "Never Been Kissed") and Connie Nielsen ("Gladiator") are both good, but the film's strength, in my opinion, comes from its production designs, music, and photography.  They all contribute to creating the cold, detached atomosphere of the film, and their effort is effectively shown in the manufactured feeling of the shopping place, with symmetrical shots of the unnnaturally clean and  white interiors.  That comes as no surprise when you know that production designer Tom Foden's previous work was Jennifer Lopez's thriller "The Cell" and photographer Jeff Cronenweth worked for "Fight Club" (by the way, his father Jordan Cronenweth may be much more famous for his "Blade Runner").  <p>"One Hour Photo" has some minor flaws -- dream sequence that looks out of tune, and flashback structure of narrative, for instance -- but the film is fascinating as a character study of Sy, this very lonely guy.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>"One Hour Photo" does for Robin Williams what "The Shining" did for Jack Nicholson.  This intelligent, terrifying, realistic masterpiece is destined to be one of the screens best directed, edited and scripted films...period.  It will stand the test of time and Robin has shown a versatility (i.e. "Insomnia" earlier this summer) that ranks him right up there with the legends of film.  <p>This film left the audience in awe.  No one left their seats when the credits started to roll.  It is mesmerizing, haunting and compelling.  What makes it such a creepy thriller is the fact that this flick is REAL!  It can, and probably is, the story of what is going on right in our own backyards.  <p>I never write about plots or storylines.  I can only tell the potential viewer that this is a must if you like intelligent drama, thrills, believability and TERROR.  I will never be able to look into Robin Williams' eyes with the same understanding I had back in the days of "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Jumanji".<p>This film has Oscar written all over it!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>When Robin Williams utters that line, the whole audience burst into laughter. And why is that? Because there he is in his car, peering through his camera lens at an unsuspecting family--he's a stalker!<p>Got to admit, I was hesitant to see "One Hour Photo" at the local theatre because the coming attractions made it seem quite violent. There are scenes of violence eventually, but by far most of the film is very self-contained. This is appropriate because it deals with an isolated man, Williams, who works at a one hour photo lab in a shopping mall. We see his constricted world and his lonely existence; seems sad but not all that unusual. But then there's a pullback and we see that the entire wall of his apartment is covered with extra sets of photos he has made of his favorite family, the Yorkins. He's become obsessed with them and their seemingly idyllic life, and he's about to go over the edge.<p>What finally pushes him over? The discovery of trouble in Yorkin paradise, an adulterous affair. When he sees the photographic evidence of that, he is so outraged that he figures he has to take matters into his own hands, even if he has to balance a chef's knife with his camera in those hands.<p>Kudos to Williams for a remarkable chameleon-like disappearance into the character of Sy the Photo Guy. He looks years older, and acts in a surprisingly understated fashion. But since we all really know that he is larger than life, we always feel that there's going to be an explosion of energy at some point, and  we're not disappointed. Oscar should remember him next year.<p>Take care where you send your photos to be developed next time!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Mork, how you have changed!  From inane slapstick to skin-crawling revulsion, I gotta hand it to you, Mork:  you're showing some range in your golden years.  And ONE HOUR PHOTO successfully pegs the &quot;Goose Bumps&quot; meter, similar to finding a worm in your cupcake or going to church not knowing your fly is unzipped.  Shudder.<p>Photo developer Sy Parrish (Mork, er, Robin Williams) is the quintessential human ticking time bomb.  Lonely, depressed, insecure, he has no life other than his job at SavMart and his obsession with a yuppie family--an obsession that literally covers a wall of his shabby apartment with photographs of the handsome couple and their young son.  Sy wishes--initially--no harm on the family; he merely longs to be a part of their lives, to be embraced as &quot;Uncle Sy.&quot;  But his obsession, alas, cannot translate into reality, and when Sy suffers a career setback and then discovers a flaw in his beloved family, the mental choo-choo derails in a hurry.  The ending is atypical of psycho thrillers, and pushes Williams' disturbed character even more into the forefront.<p>The scrumptious Connie Nielsen is dynamite as Nina Yorkin, the unsuspecting victim of Sy's dysfunctional stalking; director Mark Romanek moves the story along with all the eery discomfort of scraping fingernails across a blackboard.  ONE HOUR PHOTO is a bona fide seat-squirmer, a scratch 'n sniff gag fest.  Mork, you've impressed me with your creepiness, but can you have this film developed by 5:00?<br />--D.

Unfortunately for Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielson), her husband (Michael Vartan) and their son Jake (Dylan Smith), Sy is not who he appears to be. As Sy's life becomes lonelier and his obsession with the family grows, he convinces himself that he's part of their seemingly picture-perfect life. What happens next will leave your spine tingling. <p>Directed by Mark Romanek, this edge-of-the-seat thriller is one of the best in recent years, refreshigly not going the Hollywood route with a conventional ending. The climax is shocking, disturbing, and extremely suspenseful and creepy. Sy Parish is a unique villian who manages to make you care for him despite the lives he successfully manages to destroy. Robin Williams is perfection in a rare film role for him. His supporting cast, which also includes Eric La Salle and Gary Cole, are also top-notch. You will never look at the One Hour Photo Shop the same way again. This is one thriller I definitely recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Robin Willams' performance carries the lackluster film. It was a very disturbing turn as Sal, a creepy photo guy from the pharmacy that takes a obession too far with a family that regularly comes in. He immerses himself into the family and calls himself Uncle Sal. the atmosphere was great and creepy and haunting. When you get done with the film, Willams' peformance will creep the hell out of you. Also, when the hotel scene comes up, be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film if you want to watch Robin Willams peform a serious role outstandingly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I HIGHLY recommend that if you haven't seen this movie, then go and rent a copy, or get it dead cheap. My mouth was open with disbelief & shock throughout most of the movie, and I was certainly getting shivers up my spine, the creeps, the works basically!!! I suggest if you haven't gone digital yet, go!!! Although, despite me having a digital camera, I get them developed online, so I can put them in a photo album. I just wouldn't go and hand in a film at somewhere local now. Believe me, once you see this movie you won't be either. Digital is great in more than ways than one, and this film will definitely make you rush out and get a digital camera!<br /><br />What also gave me the creeps was Robin Williams's excellently portrayed character, Sy, in this. Moving away from his "family-friendly" characters he's played in the past, this will have you longing for Hook or Mrs Doubtfire. Strangely enough, he plays a creepy character really, REALLY well!!! I wouldn't have expected it before seeing this. What he wears also adds to the character. And then there his hair, which is really cropped, and dyed a sandy colour. Horrible but suits the character. Because of his extremely hairy body (ugh) Robin had to shave most of his arms, upper chest and hands for this movie.<br /><br />The film focuses on a lonely photo-developing guy called "Sy, the Photo Guy". He quickly becomes obsessed with this young family, the Yorkins. Connie Nielsen plays Nina, the mum, Will is played by Michael Vartan and their kid Jake (Dylan Smith). His obsessions include practically memorising their address, buying the same book Nina is reading, visiting their house (and something even creepier happens here, which will have you wondering exactly what happened), and keeping an extra set of prints of their photos for himself. The film snowballs from here, keeping you in shock most of the movie, and almost feeling like you need to have a good, long, hard scrub in the shower afterwards.<br /><br />This movie is well written, and well shot, I can't find fault with it at all. The plot is well laid out - even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we're distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV. (The episode is Cape Fear, the second episode of season 5.) Robin Williams quite literally becomes Sy Parish, and you'll go through different feelings towards his character, but by the end, although a little confusing (and most people will NOT get it, judging by some of the reviews), will return Sy Parish to the Robin Williams we know & love. The ending is left hanging, after a nail biting finale, and it's kind of like Lost In Translation, you're not quite sure what happens. The final moments will kinda ruin things, with Sy giving a reason why he did what he did. There was no need to give a reason. Everyone feels protective of people, and that's exactly what Sy was trying to do. It wasn't so much a mistake as unnecessary to have Sy tell the police (but mainly the audience) about his childhood, "explaining" his subsequent behaviour by letting us know he was abused as a child, all too neatly adding that his father used to take photos of him doing degrading things. This was just added in for no reason, and most people will question it.<br /><br />I bet the cast & crew had great fun with this movie, with all the photos prominently displayed in the scenes. I bet they were sick of being in front of the camera after this! I also loved the little segment, which actually showed you how Sy went about developing the photos. Although probably not all true, for me, it brought back some bad memories of being locked in a tiny dark room at college, trying to break open the canister to get the negatives out, which promptly turned purple when I tried to get them developed. It looks an interesting - although could be boring after a while - job, and in preparation for his role, Robin trained for two and a half days at a photo developing training facility in Southern California on an Agfa MSC 101-D photo developing machine.<br /><br />I strongly recommend everybody sees this movie, although sit on your hands if you're a nail biter, and don't look into the ending too much - it'll just ruin the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Another outstanding performance by Mr. Williams as Sy!

There's your spoiler.  Some people you probably don't much like get humiliated, but nobody even gets physically hurt in writer-director Mark Romanek's &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot;  What happens is far worse--their faith in humanity is shattered.<p>The story is simple.  Photo finisher Seymour &quot;Sy the Photo Guy&quot; Parrish (Robin Williams) has a problem dividing reality from fantasy, and he imagines himself joining the photogenic Yorkin family, who trust him to develop their pictures.  As he drifts further and further into this imaginary world, he starts visiting young, naive Jake Yorkin (Dylan Smith) at soccer practice.  He engineers ways to run into pretty, empathic Nina Yorkin (Connie Neilsen) at the mall.  He strikes up random conversations with affluent, ambiguous Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan).  But he's so affable and unprepossessing that they all fail to notice anything out of the ordinary.<p>Then Parrish finds out the dream world he's built for himself based on their pictures isn't picture-perfect.<p>This film is a wonderful mystery, but from the beginning we know whodunnit and to whom.  What we seek to uncover is the motive, which is as elusive as a fresh, wet, slick photograph right up to the very end.  And even that end, with its powerful &quot;Lady or the Tiger&quot; lack of resolution, leaves us with more to figure out than what's been explained.<p>This movie is going to be hard for a lot of people to watch.  Its careful pace and distinct atmospherics require viewers to meet the movie on its terms.  The dense plot demands much stricter attention than audiences are accustomed to these days.  And the style of themes seem drawn more from the world of literature than typical films.<p>For lovers of literary mystery and art-house cinema, this is one of the strongest movies of recent years.  Many will balk at it, but this risky, esoteric film wasn't meant for them.  The complex, sophisticated structure rewards book-readers as much as cineastes.  And if you're both of those, this kind of movie is what you've wanted, and haven't seen, for years.</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>I originally rated this film 3 stars, so I went back and changed my  review to 2 stars.  I guess I gave it pity points, not fully realizing how stupid this movie was.  Not being a fan of Robin Williams in the first place, this film had to really sell me on it's strong points and give me a good reason to like it, and as you can see, it failed miserably. Come to think of it, I don't think I've liked a single movie Robin Williams has been in.  Wait, there's one, "Shakes The Clown".  And to further illustrate my point on how horrible this film is, I will include one sort of funny anedote bordering on the surreal.  I was at a Hollywood Video the other day and saw a clerk rounding up a huge stack of previously viewed copies of "One Hour Photo".  He brought them behind the counter and began chucking them in the trash, with much vigor.  I, being the curious video store patron asked him what was going on.  He remarked, "we've got so many, we don't know what else to do with them".  I laughed at his comment and further explained I had seen the movie and understood the unpopularity of this particular DVD.  He then scoffed a bit and asked me if I would like a free copy before he trashed the rest of the lot.  I thanked him for his offer, but declined.  Point being, they can't even give this horrilbe film away.  Strange but true.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is a lonely guy. He works as a photo-finisher at the local Sav-mart, where he takes his job VERY seriously. For ten years now, Sy has given special attention to the Yorkin family. He's developed their film in under an hour, and even made sure to get an extra set of prints for himself. Poor Sy has no life at all. Each night he gets off work, drives his boring little car home to his dull little apartment, and watches tv. Sy has only one ray of sunshine in his otherwise gray existence. It is the Yorkin family. Over the years their pictures have become Sy's obsession. They have given him a sense of belonging and a reason to live. Sy has covered an entire wall with the Yorkin clan's photos. This collage represents their history with &quot;uncle&quot; Sy. One day, Sy gets called in to see his boss at Sav-mart. He's been busted for his decade worth of making (stealing) extra sets of pictures. Sy gets fired. What else is there for a man like Sy? While finishing out his final week, Sy runs across some pictures of Will Yorkin (head of Sy's adopted family) being romantic with another woman. Sy is outraged. His dream has been destroyed and he must face a reality he's spent a lifetime supressing. There are no perfect families. There are no perfect people. There are only human beings doing messy human things. This doesn't sit well with Sy, who sets out to teach his ex-boss and Will Yorkin a lesson in humility. Yep, the glue has dissolved, Sy's come apart, and he's on a rampage! What comes next is retribution for those who have dared to betray him. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a scary movie. It achieves a thickening atmosphere of dread without any cheap shots or unnecessary violence. Every crack in Sy's mind is tiny and subtle, until these cracks join together into one huge split. I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Williams' performance, as it was one of his most gratifying. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>After building a career of "nice guys", smiling, funny and even sometimes silly characters, Robin Williams recently decided he could play the bad guy. "One hour photo" is an example, and the more recent "Insomnia" is another (I haven't watched "Death to Smoochy"). I always thought Robin Williams was a one-character actor, meaning he couldn't change his performances from one movie to another - even the psychologist in "Good Will Hunting" and the troubled husband in "What dreams may come", like all other Williams' characters have a sound resemblance to Patch Adams. Well, in "One hour photo" and in "Insomnia" I was proved wrong. Not only Williams can play a problematic and sad character, he can be very convincing (although we always feel sorry for him). <p>In "One hour photo", the Yorkes (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Dylan Smith) seem the perfect family for Sy Parrish (Robin Williams), the "photo guy" from a ... store. Sy is obsessed about the family. All the photo-sets the Yorke family get from Sy have a copy in Sy's house. When Sy gets to know the Yorkes aren't so perfect after all, he slowly but surely starts to plan his revenge. <p>Being a movie essencially about obsession and photography, "One hour photo" is full of light (there is a light bulb, or the sun, or the moonlight in EVERY scene) and colorful. It just didn't work for me, because I was supposed to be watching a thriller, and in my conception (maybe I'm too old-fashioned) thrillers don't work if they're light- and colorful. <p>Mark Romanek's script isn't innovative. His direction is confused, blending old and new technics during the movie. About the actors: Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan have been better (in "Gladiator" and "Alias", respectively), but theirs are average performances. The kid, Dylan Smith, is rather good. The best performance is by Robin Williams, different from everything I'd seen him doing. <p>In the end, the best thing in the movie was the Yorkes' house (I'm an architect).<p>I give this movie only three stars mainly because I was expecting one thing and got one totally different. <p>Grade 6.8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>It's not that this was just an unenjoyable film, it was just rather slow.

Will the real Slim Shady please sit down- and stay down!  There was a real interesting premise, the photo developer who is privy to an awful lot of personal information.  But the main family portrayed in the movie is a bit thick to not realize that Sy is not playing with a full deck.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Martin Buber taught that we should never treat anyone in an abstract and distant I-It manner. The great philosopher instead advocated I-Thou relationships between ourselves and those who interact with us even in minor ways.  Nonetheless, Buber might have changed his mind had he ever met Sy Parrish (Robin Williams).  The one hour photo technician desires far more intimacy with his customers than is psychologically healthy and normally desirable.  Sy is a loser who bewilderingly is content earning a mediocre income as a store clerk/film developer for a large discount chain store.  He looks upon this pathetic job as a serious vocation instead of one barely paying a few cents above minimum wage.  The only fault I could find in this great five star film is the portrayal of Sy as somebody able to afford a nice car, live in a fairly large apartment, and eat out on a regular basis.  This is totally absurd.  In the real world a Sy would barely be able to pay for a cramped efficiency apartment and a beat up older automobile.  <p>Sy focuses his unwanted attention onto the affluent and outwardly happy Yorkin family.  The young couple and their nine year old son have no idea that Sy's world revolves around their own lives.  We are sometimes tempted to turn our heads away from the screen while observing Sy embarrassingly making a fool of himself.  Robin Williams is uncannily brilliant as a warped human being with nothing going for himself.  And yes, Williams will almost certainly garner an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant interpretation of Sy.  Williams' recent work in Insomnia as similarly a creepy weirdo may also earn him a supporting role nomination.  Is it possible that Williams' earlier comedic roles will soon be forgotten?  Will Sy Parrish be to Williams as Norman Bates was to Tony Perkins?  Has Williams crossed a line in his career where there is no going back?</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>Robin Williams saves this movie.  Without his great character acting this would have been dull.  It does make you think about the people developing your pictures and what they are doing with them.  Williams plays Sy the photo guy at the local SaveMart.  Sy is a bit unusual but you never realize how dangerous, even as the movie progresses.  Sy is one third harmless, one third stalker, and one third physco.  The movie starts out average and escalates a bit slow but it does move along.  But it never seems to peak, it just kind of levels off.  And that is unfortunate.  There were many avenues that this movie could have walked down but it never did,l it stayed on the main road of an average movie.  And I personally was not very fond of the ending but that is an individual choice.  <p>If you are a fan of Robin Williams you will probably enjoy this movie a lot.  If you are viewing just to enjoy a good movie I feel you will be let down.  Better to wait for the video and not feel cheated.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in "One Hour Photo," a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek.  Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness.  Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.<p>Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the "nobodies" whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface.  And nobody is "grayer" than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in "The Good Girl") - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now.  The film centers around Si's growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit.  Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.<p>As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout.  We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn't go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn.  Thanks to Williams' subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick.  We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character.  Si is scary, but he is also pathetic.  He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to "fit in" to the societal "norm" of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him.  <p>Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well.  He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life.  Most people, Si confesses, record only the "special, happy" moments of their lives - birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones.  Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that "I", this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life.  To match this theme, Romanek's visual style often feels like the director's own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots - and Si's voiceover narration complements that feeling.<p>"One Hour Photo" is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem.  It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>One Hour Photo is a high caliber psychological drama starring Robin Williams in his best performance to date. Here Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Photo Guy, a friendless, familyless worker at a One Hour Photo shop whose abused childhood is about to catch up with him. He insinuates himself into the Yorkin family whom he developes film for, going so far as to read a Deepak Chopra book because he glimpses it in Nina Yorkin's (Connie Nielsen's) bag. The book quote he gives her gives a strong clue to the film's true theme, "What we fear most already happened".  Sy sees the Yorkins as the ideal family that he never had, making extra sets of their photos to put on his wall.<p>Throughout we get an ominous humming background soundtrack a la Safe as well as a violin motif borrowed from Requiem for a Dream (borrowed from Laurie Anderson). This film has been compared to Taxi Driver, but more appropriate comparison would be Midnight Cowboy.  The parallel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.  And both films are a subjective jump into the character's isolation, demons, and emotions.<p> Sy's lid on those demons is blown when he sees photo evidence of Will Yorkin's (Michael Vartan's) infidelity...and gets fired by a fascist boss (Gary Cole). Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle) serves as liaison between Sy and the audience, as he tries to grasp what we try to. One significant hint is when he says, "Well he knew that Yoshi (Paul Kim) would come to you and you would call us", i.e. Sy set up this elaborate plan to get caught (to get attention).  And finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over. Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective...in a manner that can easily go over the heads of a mainstream audience.  What sums up Sy's tortured world best is the shock registered on the expression of Maya (Erin Daniels).<p> Keep your eyes peeled for any Academy politics that would prevent deserved Oscars for Robin Williams and Mark Romanek.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Robin Williams gives an impressive and stunning performance in this chilling story of a photo developer who becomes obsessed with a woman and her seemingly perfect family through the series of pictures he develops for them. <p>"Sy" Perish, the "photo guy" seems like a nice enough man who takes extra care with the photos of the people who come to his counter.

This is one thriller I definitely recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  Even so,I subtracted a star from the otherwise perfect rating simply because something about the movie didn't work.  Not that the plot, style, characterizations and overall visual presentation of the film was not well constructed and in-sync.  It wasn't that... it was the audience.  We are just too well-primed to accept the strange as, well, almost acceptable.<br />In portraying Sy Parrish,Robin Williams takes his deranged writer role in 'Insomnia' up a notch.  At first, Sy seems the typically harmless guy with the best of intentions and one or two loose screws.  He's lonely: no friends, no family. His job seems to be all important to him,and he performs well but, in actuality the job is just a means to an end.  By perfectly processing the film rolls handed over to him at the local discount department store, Sy becomes a voyeur without ever leaving the confines of the world of his apartment and the store. In particular, he has zeroed in on the Yorkin family: Nina, Will and their young son.  To him,they have a model existence,one where Sy envisions himself as an involved "uncle", albeit to the extreme especially when he discovers that Will is having an affair with another photo client. Sy's loose screws drop out of his head as his picture of perfection is trampled and he devises a method of 'helping' the situation in a way that leaves the moviegoer's imagination stinging with bizarre possibilities that I will not disclose.<br />All this makes for an enthralling panorama of suburbian life that mesmerizes but nevertheless misses a beat somewhere in the process.  I think as 21st century film critics we have become just a little too anesthesized to strangeness as portrayed on the silver screen.  We have seen it all, haven't we?  Hannibal Lecter scared the daylights out of us with his slithering tongue and psychological slashing of Jodi Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet in 'Hannibal', a more gruesome act of eating Ray Liotta's still thinking brain had somewhat of a lesser impact. We have been 'privledged' to see multiple-personalities, child molestors, sexual deviants, serial killers and the all purpose cannibal---hey, we all love the Sopranos---so as creepy as Robin William's portrayal of Sy Parrish should be to our moral and ethical sensibilities, it is somehow diminished by our own sophistication as curried from the virtual world of films. Sy just doesn't provide the 'punch' needed to overthrow Hannibal from the current 'King Weirdo' throne. Visually, the director provides only a hint of what Sy's punishment for Will actually is---and this is the one moment of the film that lifts the hair off the back of the neck---ironically what WE DON"T SEE is more bizarre than what is shown in full technicolor.<br />Nonetheless,'One Hour Photo' is still a good film in spite of our jaded viewpoints. Connie Nielson ('Gladiator') is chic yet vulnerable as the suburban wife and mother and Michael Vartan ('Mists of Avalon')is sufficently sexy and thoroughly ashamed as the straying husband and father. While the sterile whiteness of the ubiquitously offensive suburban superstore and that of William's apartment in the film suggests Sy's toxic need for order in an otherwise unordered situation contrasts well with the picture perfect environs of the Yorkin family's phony Utopian dream.  Check it out--you'll only add to your library of the Bizarre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>"One Hour Photo" is Robin Williams' second (actually first, in the order they were filmed) foray into playing the mentally-disturbed bad guy.  Earlier, he was a writer-turned-killer in "Insomnia," and now he's Sy Parrish, or Sy the Photo Guy, a seemingly innocuous photolab worker at the local Save-Mart (or some such...knockoff).  For the last thirteen years, he has developed pictures for people in the neighborhood, which means he has access to the private lives of these people, at least insofar as their lives are reflected in the pictures they take.<p>Sy has "adopted" the Yorkin family, a nuclear household that seems to have everything.  As Sy points out, "everyone smiles in their pictures, because they are moments you want to remember."  So, of course, Sy's view of the Yorkins is highly distorted: he never sees them fight, or spank their kid, or whatever goes on behind the closed doors in suburbia.  But Sy does discover something inadvertently by developing another customer's picture: Mr. Yorkin is having an affair with a woman from his office.  His vision of the prefect family ruined, Sy embarks on a mission to "punish" Yorkin for doing this to his wife and son.<p>What Sy does not know, but the audience does, is that Mrs. Yorkin is also having an affair, so it makes his "Taxi Driver"-like psychotic binge a little less noble, because it shows the hypocrisy of people who only see part of the "picture."  (Picture, get it?)  What "One Hour Photo" has going for it is that its portrait of a very disturbed individual is very well done and complete: Sy's slide into insanity is wholly believable and fascinating to watch, but sickening, like a car wreck in front of your house.  Williams pulls this off with finesse, proving he's more than Mrs. Doubtfire in the acting department.  Not once is the audience subjected to a cutesy voice or manic mood swing.  Williams' descent is both steady and inevitable, and doesn't need to rely on such devices to be effective.<p>Where "One Hour Photo" fails is in its portrayal of suburban America and the reasons for Sy's initial instability.  The Save-Mart is a sterile, white-and-gray environment that looks more like a hospital than a store.  As another reviewer pointed out, anyone who has been in a Wal-Mart knows it is a veritable rainbow of color, trying to get consumers to buy, buy, buy.  Sy's house, and the Yorkin house, are equally sterile, and even the little boy's messy room looks like a setup.  For a movie that preaches not to examine things through a single lens, it fails in this endeavor itself, never rising above an insipid and tired view of suburbia (yeah, suburban life is hollow and hypocritical, WE GET IT ALREADY) and becoming so self-conscious that it is obvious the audience is seeing through a camera lens into a created environment.  Also, Sy's admission at the very end seems like it was tacked on to "explain" his behavior, and it robs Robin Williams of the dignity he had in creating a part where such an explanation was not necessary.  It would be like Jack Torrence at the end of The Shining saying, "but my father was an alcoholic who beat me!"  Yuck.<p>On the whole, "One Hour Photo" is worth its 90-minute running time, but for a movie with such potential, it's a shame it could not realize more of it.<p>Final Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>It has been a while since I have seen a movie that made me feel uncomfortable while watching it. Having just watched One Hour Photo I can no longer make such a claim. Director/Writer Mark Romanek has brought out the very best in Robin Williams who, in my estimation, delivers his most significant performance to date. Williams subtley brings a creepiness to the screen in a character the likes of which one would not have though him capable of playing. The film keeps viewers on edge for its entire running time and manages to deliver a few honestly funny moments. I would recommend this film to anyone in the mood for darker than normal fare.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>I am disedified that this movie is well regarded.  As storytelling, it gets an F-.  The family that Robin Williams gets a little obsessed with?  The father is some yuppie flake who's got about the same presence as a guy in a dandruff commercial.  The wife seems to have read a book that says the secret to great dramatic acting is to act like you're on downers all the time and can't bring yourself to wake up.  "Where is your son!"  The detective yells in her face, once its become clear that jeopardizing shenanigans are afoot.  She blinks and slowly shakes her head and says in a voice devoid of emotion, "He's... at a friend's house..."  The kid himself, who all the fuss is about is basically just a kid, who commands about as much interest as most kids - zero.  Robin Williams doesn't have sexual designs on the kid.  He doesn't have sexual designs on the mother, and though he does end up taking some - shall we say, artistic? - photos, he doesn't have sexual designs on the father.  So what is his angle?  Well, suffice it to say that his own family was not so hot, so he's become a trifle obsessed with what he sees as the perfect family.  Maybe its part of the whole idea that the family he does get obsessed with is nothing to write home about and in fact makes the viewer vaguely nauseous.  Maybe, as in Taxi Driver, what the misguided protagonist sees and what is really there are two different things.  Maybe you are supposed to want to puke on these people and hope that Robin Williams cuts them up real bad with his stilletto, homes.  Maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This is a very tiring overrated Suspense / Thriller .

To him, developing is an underappreciated art form. His life revolves around his job, and for good reason, he has no real life to speak of outside of his work. He was never married, has no real friends or relations, and we learn very little about his past. What we know of his present situation is bleak and depressing. But Sy has taken a special liking to a suburban family, with a successful husband, a pretty wife, and a beautiful son. Domestic bliss personified. He, in his lonely state, becomes obsessed with the family, and longs for something he can never have. This pushes him to the brink of near insanity.<p>I will not give away any more than I already have, but I will say that the ending lets down the whole movie. The movie begins as a fascinating character study, and ends as a hollywood cliche (a diet version, if you will). While the creppiness and the quality of the acting keeps "One Hour Photo" entertaining, you feel unsatasfied in the end. Similar to movies like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", the characters are more interesting before the go over the edge. <p>The movie is the perfect starring vehicle for Williams, who is proving that his move from comedy to drama in his later years is indeed a good idea. The script, while meandering at times, is smartly written and doesn't turn the movie into a Hannibal-type affair. Williams is a lonely man who seeks love and attention, and only finds it out of his reality and in the photos he develops. He nailed the character perfectly.<p>While it's not Oscar material, it is definitely worth checking out. Most people will love Robin Williams's darker side, while others will like the unique story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>This movie is probably going to manage to 'tick' enough people off: It is very eerie, and I loved the dark atmosphere. wow what a concept! BUT! you keep waiting and waiting (like a suspense movie, maybe like silence of the lambs) for something dramatic or really sick to happen, because the character robin is playing is so unstable and mentally not there, you wait, and wait....and wait...and....NOTHING!! NOTHING EVER HAPPENS, a movie that manages to grab you from beginning to end, just to deliver NOTHING! without giving away too much, what would have made or breaked this movie would have been that final scene. If it had been blood beyond belief, then I would have rated it way better.....but nothing HAPPENS!!! anyway you get the point. Rent it first, bring a pillow.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>One Hour Photo is a film about a lonely man who develops film at "SavMart".  His name is Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) and his job is really all he has.  There are social ingredients missing in Sy's mind, and as we get to closer to him we begin to put the pieces together.  He has nothing to live for outside of his job and the family that are his favorite customers.  The Yorkins; Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan), and their only child Jake are the customers Sy most enjoys producing prints for.  He sees them as the ideal family and he loves them so much that he creates copies of their prints for himself and he calls himself "uncle" Sy.  Unfortunately for Sy, the Yorkins are not aware of any of this.  Sy is awkward and socially inept.  He walks through life without the ability to relate appropriately with others and it begins to weigh in on him.  So what happens if Will Yorkin's friend Maya shows up with a roll of film of her own, and the pictures show her being intimate with Will?  What will Uncle Sy do?<br /><br />There is a genuine creepiness to Director Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo.  Romanek's ability to organize images to appropriately translate in the music video medium is evidently a solid carryover to his work as a feature filmmaker.  This movie has a remarkably unique feel to it and where most films of this genre would focus on the Yorkins as the protagonists, One Hour Photo has us staring directly at the empty and profoundly sad Sy Parrish.  Jeff Cronenweth, the film's cinematographer, also deserves immense praise for his blinding white SavMart shots and overall crisp photography.  The setting becomes Sy's element effortlessly, which is convenient because SavMart is Sy.  He has nothing to go home to.  The most praise though should land squarely upon Robin Williams.  His role is a completely unrecognizable transformation and even though he received praise and a Saturn Award, he may have received more if this performance was in a different genre.<br /><br />There is something about the way One Hour Photo unfolds that is appropriate but invariably predictable.  The ending doesn't hit as hard as the effective (and credit-less) opening scenes.  It's hard to say whether that is a criticism of the second half of One Hour Photo or a gigantic compliment to the first half.  I can't imagine a better ending that wouldn't come off as overly contrived or too psychological but all of this is very much just nitpicking.  One Hour Photo is a very good movie carried primarily by its lead performance and its original atmosphere.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) has been working in the film developing department at Sav Mart for quite awhile now.  Seymour (Sy) doesn't have much to look forward to outside of work, but there is one thing he cherishes - the Yorkin family: Nina (Connie Nielsen (I)), Will (Michael Vartan), and Jake (Dylan Smith (III)).  Sy 'the photo guy' has been developing their film since before Jake was born and has begun to feel like an uncle to Jake and a member of the family - he knows just about everything about them.  When his manager at work begins giving him a hard time, Sy immerses himself more deeply into his fantasies as a member of the Yorkin family, until he finds out that this seemingly perfect family isn't so perfect.  Taking matters into his own hands, Sy, likely using personal childhood recollections to guide him, resorts to unorthodox means to break the news to Nina about why Will is such a neglectful father.<p>My Comments:<br />This was a really well thought out and marvelously designed movie.  Robin Williams does a great job.  Almost the entire movie follows Robin Williams's character who says surprisingly little - but you are still entranced by what is going on.  The rest of the acting is pretty good as well.  <p>The special features of the DVD talk about how the SavMart has been designed to represent something of a fantasy world for Sy; I think that is something you kind of put together subconsciously, but when it is made clear what they have done it adds depth to the movie and Sy's character.  Though it seems straightforward,  there is so much going on the film that you can't really afford to miss any of it - you have to pay very close attention.  <p>The extra features on the DVD contain lots of commentary and some fun interviews - Robin Williams is hilarious in the Charlie Rose interview.  <p>Overall, I thought this was a great movie.  Excellent story, superb cinematography, and remarkable acting.  The social commentary was appropriately subtle but present in everything.  There is a bit of nudity, so if you don't care for that you may want to skip this one.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I've been a bit hesitant about comedians taking on serious roles (Jim Carrey for one) that don't really hit it off for me.  However, Robin Williams got his character down cold as one Sy Parrish.  Sy has been working at SavMart for 14 years developing film for his customers, admiring their photos, getting into their lives -- and even making copies for himself to place on his wall!<br /><br />I like stories that start at the end and work through to the end again.  We have Sy in the county slammer, looks so white and antiseptic.  All white, but for a red chair.  He explains to the detective the whys and hows of what he's done.<br /><br />Director Mark Robenek does a fascinating job with photography -- the little, lonely man is so bland and chameleon, that he blends in to every scene he plays.  The blue & white uniform blends in with the store hallways; the beige jacket blends with the cars and the walls.<br /><br />We first get a hint that the lonely man has a volcano burning inside when he gets a crack in his car's windshield: "Great, now what?"<br /><br />Several themes for this film struck me:  the photos we take are of the happy times; we rarely shoot the sad times.  The photo is a fraction of a second, frozen in time.  As the film says, it's our urge to stop time.<br /><br />Sy Parrish though lonely and afraid of reality, knows he could never accomplish what the Yorkin family has and starts stalking them.  He imagines he is one of the family, walking around in their house, admiring their TVs and large house.  He even meets their nine year old son and promises to talk to his coach for treating him roughly.<br /><br />But when he "just happens" to leave photos of infidelity into Mrs. Yorkin's photo stack, things really start coming apart for Sy.<br /><br />My only criticism of the film is that it starts off slow and stays in neutral mode for quite some time, spends too much time in exposition and not enough in action.  But it's a thriller, a mental game if you will, so the viewer may appreciate this type of film at face value.<br /><br />I'll be looking for more Robin Williams' serious side.

Mr Williams totally and entirely different from the humorous and funny man we always knew or witnessed in certain films. To be honest, the film shaked me, shocked me by throwing light on some of the dark sides of human nature. Robin Williams is extremely brilliant, very impeccable in his role. Connie Nelson does an excellent work as well, the whole cast performence is pure perfection. A very rare film you will witness on screen, a film you will never easily forget infact its likely to make you think again and again. Worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This film shows Robin Williams in a shocking and effective departure from his frequent comedic roles.  As Sy the Photo Guy, he obsesses unhealthily about one family whose photos he has developed for ten years, keeping a set of prints for himself and his collection every time.  He intrudes further into their lives, until things start to unravel as he discovers a secret about them and also loses his job.<br />In the last half hour, he tries to teach one of them a lesson, then ends up with a rather contrived scene which implies some shocking things about his own childhood and how he ended up so mentally unbalanced.<br />The photography and production design give a polished yet sterile feel to the environments in the film, showcasing Sy's lonely, pitiful existence.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>Robin Williams gives a CREEPY performance in this SCARY<br />suspense thriller.  Robin plays Sy Parrish a very lonely<br />man who wants nothing more than to be part of a perfect<br />family. ENTER THE YORKINS!  The husband and wife have<br />that perfect smile and have a son who does no wrong.<br />Sy has developed their pic. since the birth of their son.<br />11yrs. total,but when the husband cheats on his wife that<br />is when this movie kicks into SCARY gear! For Sy does not<br />like that and what Sy does not like.........<br />This is a very good movie and easily one of Robin's best<br />performances(I prefer Robin controlled in his movies like<br />this and the brilliant World According to Garp as oppose<br />to the yelling obnoxious Good Morning Vietnam roles) There<br />are very SPOOKY moments for me in this movie. And for GORE<br />hounds where else can you see Robin's eyes popping out<br />with tons of blood I'll tell ya! In this movie. One<br />Hour Photo is Scary because unlike Frankenstein and<br />the Wolf Man there are Sy's out there.  I really<br />enjoyed this movie and thought the supporting cast especially<br />the actor who plays Robin's Boss did a fine job. The most<br />SCARIEST part for me was not shown in the film. But I could<br />not help but keep asking myself during the movie WHAT HAPPENED<br />TO SY TO BE LIKE THIS?  I mean he had to have had a mother<br />what happened to her?  A father?  It is never explained<br />and I feel that is a good thing. I'm one who loves<br />guts and arteries thrown in my face.  But I can also appreciate<br />the not seeing and not knowing as well.  One Hour Photo<br />I am proud to own and have in my HAUNTING coll. of DVD'S.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Shudder-inducing thriller marks an impressive writing/directing debut for Mark Romanek, and after "Insomnia", another virtuoso, non-comedic turn by Williams. This tale of "Sy, the photo guy" hits uncomfortably close to home, evoking countless people we casually encounter every day, human beings whose apparent isolation we instinctively turn away from. This ingenious film plays out what might happen if any of us got a little too friendly with the wrong individual. "One Hour Photo" will make you grateful that someone finally invented the digital camera.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>Indeed the name "Robin Williams" connected with this film should not lead one to expect any laughs.  This is as tense a film as I've seen in some time.  The director, previously best known for rock videos, creates a sensational looking world that includes a megastore that looks very much like a "Super Target" store, a fabulous home for a financially successful young family, and the home of our main character, Sy Parrish, played by the Julliard-trained Mr. Williams.<br /><br />For almost 30 years I've felt that Williams is the funniest man alive, and that his few dramatic roles have been effective.  In this film, however, even though his presence looms large in almost every scene, he has taken it up a notch, totally and believably submerging any hint of humor.  We find Sy as an unstable control freak with no real life of his own, his entire world consisting of his TV, his subcompact car, and his job as a photo tech.  Consequently he infuses every detail of his pathetic world with a tremendous amount of importance, sweating the small stuff with such vigor that he reeks of the need to psychically rehydrate.<br /><br />One can see the moment coming when he snaps, and woe to the family in his way.<br /><br />This is not a violent film, but is phenomenally suspenseful in a Hitchcockian way.  There are two or three problems of logic with the plotting, unfortunately; one must believe, for example, that an unfaithful husband would allow his girlfriend to take a full roll of photos of them together kissing various parts of one another's upper anatomy (OK, so maybe he's just an idiot as well as a loser).  It's also a one-note film, focused in with tunnelvision on Sy and his unraveling.<br /><br />In any event, Williams carries off his role so well that ultimately the film works well, is very memorable and effective, and is certainly worth a rental at least.  Williams fans, those who love this type of film, and we who are intrigued with abnormal psychology, may well want to own a copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>My favorite robin williams movie.  Rally good atmosphere and the whole realistic creepy elements are perfect, a very re-watchable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I respect the performance Robin Williams gave here as a lonely, brittle man whose entire life is defined by his job as a photo developer in the sterile world of a suburban megamart. He was both unreachably cold and yet also pathetically needy. His eruption comes late in the film, and it is somehow....not well handled by the makers of this movie. It was just not done right and left scant satisfaction to be had. Beyond that, I felt little connection to this predictable and by-the-numbers movie, and honestly it was a chore to get through.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>So Robin Williams can also be in thrillers, I now know that for sure. He was terrifying in this highly realistic and believable thriller. But, you can sympathize also with the vilain and the crazy person. Robin Williams plays a man that develops film for a living. While doing this, the person that watches this movie realizes that the developpers can know EVERYTHING about you. This made me feel uncomftorbable at times because even though I already knew this, I just never really had thought about it. But, William's character then becomes obsessed with one family and makes copies of all of their film and puts in on his walls. When you first see this, it's very disturbing.<br /><br />But, he still loves this family and dreams of being part of the family. He's always very nice to them but when one of the members of the family is "insincere" and has a secret that only William's character knows about while developping film, he goes absolutely insane. But, even after what he does, which I won't give away, you still sympathize with his character, feeling very sorry for him. You actually at a lot of moments disslike the member of the family that has commited this "bad deed" way more than you do Robin William's character. This vilain is very different and unlike most vilains which you hate, you sympathize with him and feel very sorry for this lonely person that has been driven to insanity. William's performance is absolutely brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>An interesting story of obsession and being alone. Although oddly paced and somewhat dull at times, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; keeps you watching till the shocking conclusion. Williams plays Sy &quot;the photo guy&quot; who becomes obsessed with a family who brings their film to the photo center he works at. He's so into them, because it's like the family he never had. Williams' character turns out to be quite the sick individual, due to a bad childhood that the screenplay briefly touches on. I didn't know what I was in for when I sat down and hit play on my DVD player. I'm sure this isn't what I expected though. I don't recommend this to those that can't step outside of the Robin William's comedy box. On the other hand it's a pretty good movie for most adults. And Williams is 100% watchable in an unlikely role for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Robin Williams adroitly plays Sy Parrish, a quiet, lonely, laid back yet marginally sociopathic photo film developer in the smoldering thriller One Hour Photo.  Williams is obsessed with a young family with Connie Nielsen playing the mother, who are frequent customers in his Savemart store.  He is enamored with Nielsen's young son imagining himself to be part of the family.  We learn that this is in response to Williams own wretched childhood.<p>When Williams developes a roll of film belonging to an attractive young lady he detects the family's father played by Michael Vartan, having an affair with the gal.  Williams though devastated decides to take matters into his own hands.<p>One Hour Photo plays like a symphony, starting slowly and building to a crescendo which is quite disturbing.  Williams was excellent in his role.</p></br></body></html>

The first movie was quite clever and the game and puzzles made sense. I even told friends and family it wasn't that gory, and it really wasn't. It was a true thriller. This movie on the other hand was more like all the other gorefest schlock. Afterall we start with not two people playing the game but no less than eight. Okay to get the ball rolling we first got to see a snitch have his head spiked by a mask before we find our group of victims in their cell.  Then right off without any delay or game drama we get to see one shot in the eye and his brains blown out. Not much longer we see another get burned up.<br /><br />All-in-all a bit of a disappointment from the first movie. Granted I never expected it to be as good as the first one, I just hoped it would follow the line of suspense over gore. It didn't. It joined the countless number of hack and slash movies with little story and lots of blood. Oh golly we get to see "Jigsaw" pass the sawblade to another. Such a thrill. NOT! Why did I give it three stars? It still has reasonably good acting, and some semblance of a story. So if you can stomach substancially more gore than the first movie, by all means rent it. I don't recommend this one for a purchase unless you are heavy into slasher movies. If you want a bit of gore with a little more story and suspense, try "Mindhunters" or "Hannibal Rising".</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>If you liked Saw, I'm willing to bet that you'll like Saw 2 as well. Jigsaw's back, and some questions are answered, while new ones emerge. I think that the premise is very unrealistic compared than the first one, though. 2 guys chained in the bathroom, and people killed one by one in "tests?" Okay, I bought it. A whole bunch of people on a moniter is much harder to believe. But once you get into, it's pretty good. It sets you up for Saw 3, which is a better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I was a bit disappointed in this sequel to the blockbuster Saw.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than the vast majority of movies in the horror genre, but I was not blown away by it as I expected, I figured out the twist early in the movie.  Wahlberg is very good as is Tobin Bell, honestly, if you get even descent acting in movies like this, it needs to be appreciated, verdad?  The ways Jigsaw comes up with to torture his victims is inspired is suppose, but i really didnt like the setting, it looked like a tacky stage set, I just kept thinking, wow the producers must make so much money of these films because they spend a buck fifty on the sets and all the no name, mostly very bad actors, I especially disliked the female cop, she was awful and the dumb Morequa that played the narcotics dealer, I mean where the F do they find these people?..overall, NOT as good as the first, but still recommended if you are into this sort of thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Though definetely not as good as the first, it still kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see the outcome. The acting was pretty OK. And I actually did like the ending, alot. Aside from a couple stupid moments, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>The blood games continue in "Saw II", as a SWAT team has finally tracked down the Jigsaw killer and raids his hideaway, but an obstacle remains to carting the killer off to jail: a new game is in progress, and from his warehouse base-of-operations, Jigsaw holds the keys to the fates of not two but eight new victims caught in a new deathtrap that occupies an entire re-inforced, inescapable house.<br /><br />  The 'participants' in this latest game are a more disparate, and often highly hostile, group as compared to previous captives, and it appears that the more sympathetic characters are going to have threats other than the ones Jigsaw's assembled to deal with.  And complicating matters for the police who have to try and navigate this unexpected development without getting anyone killed is this: one of the eight is the teenage son of the detective in charge.  The challenges are ghastly, the secrets behind all this sinister, and the complexity of the whole saga really begins getting driven up here.  Another universally great job by the movie's actors and actresses, including Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Jigsaw's first 'return victim', who survives her ordeal in the original 'Saw' only to be captured again.  A great chapter in an essential horror series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Aside from the unimportant innacuracy in the synopsis provided with the DVD (Matthews did not actually begin a full investigation, he merely tagged along on the raid), I have no gripes with Saw II.<br /><br />I will try to avoid being too impressed with the death and torture devices used in the movie for fear of sounding too morbid (especially since I can be so squeemish). What I will shoot for, instead, is showing my admiration with how well they were used within the script. And while I am on the subject, I thought Saw II was very well written.<br /><br />Neither the acting, nor the dialogue was the focus of the movie. Our attention is directed at the "game." We needn't focus on feelings of "Hey that guy was in Showgirls" or "Hey that kid reminds me way too much of Malcolm in the Middle." We are free to enjoy the plot without reservation. What will happen next? What is around that corner? What is on the other side of that door? How will it all end?!<br /><br />Saw II was not the horror film that Saw was. The sequel would be better described as a (relatively) gory suspense movie. Nothing from part 2 made me apprehensive about my own daily routine as part 1 was able to do. And that is a sign of a good scary movie: one from which you are changed, for even a moment. Even if it is a few days later and you are getting into your car at night and you have a sudden panic that just maybe there is someone laying down, hidden in your back seat, THAT was a good scary movie. Saw I had that, Saw II did not. I did not love either movie. I liked them both, just for different reasons.<br /><br />You don't HAVE to see Saw first to enjoy Saw II, though I recommend it. And if you like what you read above, I recommend you see them both.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>The financial rewards reaped by the low-budget original "Saw" guaranteed a sequel. Fortunately, it also meant that the perpetrators of the first movie were given a little more money and time to hone their movie's rough edges. The resulting "Saw II" is a superior movie, and my favorite of the first three.<br /><br />Jigsaw's master plan to teach his victims their life lesson is to trap a group of interconnected people in a booby trap laden house. In the opposite end of town, he is apprehended by an angry, bitter, Donnie ("I'm Not Mark") Whalberg. But then the trick of the Saw movies comes into play. Whalberg's son is in the house of horrors and all the other victims have a connection to the crooked cop that sent them to jail. All Whalberg has to do is just stay where he is, Jigsaw cooly (and superbly played by Tobin Bell) instructs him, and the son will be given back to him. (Along with the movie's catch phrase "Oh yes, there will be blood.")<br /><br />Of course, the house where all the others are trapped is tricked out with multiple killing games and the police at Jigsaw's hideout are reduced to watching as, one by one, they meet their gory demises. This is another point where "Saw II" betters its origin. I found it increasingly hard to care what happened to the to protagonists in the first film, and got to the point where - except for the final twist - I was finding the movie to be almost laughable. In "Saw II," there are so many people in so much trouble that it turns into a game of ten little Indians; who is going to get picked off next, and how? Can Whalberg control his rage at Jigsaw and get his safely returned son as reward? Add to the mix the movie's relentless pacing, and "Saw II" became both a horror/gore fest and a suspense movie.<br /><br />There is also a tight twist at the end to set up "Saw 3" (even if I believe this to be the superior movie), and all sorts of loose ends that can appear in the plans for two more in the franchise. As horror movies go, "Saw II" gets two bloody slashed-off thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>This is a brilliantly put together film not with relatively known actors as i feel having big actors in horror movies ruins the whole movie. Jigsaw is back again and he is out to prove peoples will to survive no matter what the odds.<br /><br />In this film we get to see Jigsaw for the first time and we learn why he started his sick survival games.<br /><br />This is a captivating movie that instead of just one persons will to live it is a team of 6 or 7 people who must all work together to work their way out.<br /><br />This like the first movie has an incredible twist at the end which not only leaves a window open for a cliffhanger but also leaves you sitting there in amazement at how you where fooled by the whole film.<br /><br />I strongly suggest this film as it is truly amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Saw II with Donnie Wahlberg is a great and intriguing follow-up. Just as good as the orginial. At first, I had no interest in seeing the sequel but I am glad I did see it, the movie is only 90 minutes long and it goes by pretty darn fast, this movie keeps you on your toes to the end. Saw II has a great and surprise ending like the first one (didn't see it coming.)Defintely worth viewing, I tend to hate sequels but this one actually is amazing. I think Donnie Wahlberg is a better actor than his brother, who would of thought?</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>After escaping after the 1st Saw, Jigsaw returns to play a new game. After the sucess of Saw, a sequel was bound to be made. Leigh Whannell returns to write the sequel, that's what made this sequel so good.<br /><br />Detective Eric Matthews (Whalberg) and Detective Kerry (Meyer) have finally found John aka Jigsaw (Bell). They were about to aresst him, but Jigsaw is holding Eric's son Daniel (Knudsen) and others in a abandoned house. Each victim is exposed to a deadly poisoness gas that will kill them in hours. Now, they all have to work together to find the antidode.<br /><br />Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda, now she has to replay Jigsaw's game in order to survive.<br /><br />To me, this sequel is better than the 1st film, and another cool ending this film has.

Check it out before Saw 3 comes out this October.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>So... the Journey continues as from the get go the dimented, cancerous filled villain "Jigsaw" is up to his same ole' same ole' as the story begins with a quick and horrible death within the first 2-3 minutes and not to worry it continues thru-out...<br /><br />The thing that some what upset me from the first "Saw" to this one is that their are to many charactors, and Jigsaw is no where near them ... the scar factor from the first one to this one , is drastically different (smaller) and somewhat jumbled, though the plot jumbles around a bit to much "Saw 2" doesnt lack the fun and excitment from the first and for a sequel does very well, "SAW" fans will not be dissapointed...<br /><br />P.S Just to let you people know there will be a "SAW 3" that will be relese in October of this year but beware the producer of the first to films (The brain of the SAW operations) passed away so they are gonna have to come up with someone who can think up something fast... beware "SAW 3" could be a major dissapoinment without him thinking up the unique ideas...<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Not in the same suspense league as its predecessor, but this one is fun in the "how many gross ways can you kill someone" vein.  Overall stupidity of the characters is a huge drawback, but it has enough scenes that make you groan or look away that it is an alright pick for a dumb grossout film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>I loved 'Saw'. Above everything else, I apprciated the originality and the flair with which it was made.<br /><br />I didn't love 'Saw II'. Not to suggest that it's a bad movie, because it's not. But it's not half as good as its prequel.<br /><br />This time round, bent cop Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) must find a way to help his wayward son Daniel out of serial killer Jigsaw's booby-trapped house of horrors, along with eight other victims, before they inhale too much toxic nerve gas. The catch? Eric must do this remotely, as Jigsaw's not feeling very helpful, and the only link between father and son is a video feed of the victim's progress. It's 'Big Brother' meets 'Silence of the Lambs', although not in a very original way.<br /><br />Put simply, 'Saw II' is a more mainstream and much less satisfying movie than the original. Think of the differences between 'Blair Witch' and 'Book of Shadows' and you'll know what I mean - even if 'Saw II' is infinitely superior to the Blair Witch sequel. Instead of two men caught in a claustrophobic web of hoplessness, we now have nine stereotypical criminals with broadly-drawn personalities (the hooker, the tough guy, the flake, the crazy, the wise one, the kid... and so forth...) running afoul of an increasingly more elaborate and blatantly obvious series of booby traps. There's no real sense of tension to this, and the obvious voyeurism with which director Darren Lynn Bousman shows the various deaths serves only to annoy fans of the careful atmosphere of the original, and bore everyone else - we've seen it all before. Okay, so there's a time limit on how long the kidnap victims can survive with the gas - so what? We already know most of them will die, anyway, so what's the use in getting excited about it?<br /><br />But still, 'Saw II' does have some good points. The overall standard of acting is much, much higher than in the original, with Donnie Wahlberg turning in a convincing and fluid performance as Eric. Tobin Bell as Jigsaw gets a much meatier role in this movie than in the first, and plays it well enough. And while the direction is not at all as successful as the original movie, it's still decent enough, and does lack the superfluous 'fluffing' of the prequel.<br /><br />The dialogue is still awful, mind you, and this is not a movie you need to own. The first twist in the tale can be seen coming from a hundred miles away (although there is a nice link between the first and second movies, here), but the ultimate twist is a satisfying one.<br /><br />A very average horror movie, and one to rent, not to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>The story picks up were it left off.

Now, Mason must play Jigsaw's game or else watch a new batch of victims get murdered. Includuing, his own son.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I want to play a game. That's the first line in this movie.

Jigsaw is awesome.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>That mischievous scamp Jigsaw's back, continuing on with his own, twisted version of `You Bet Your Life' by putting people of his choosing through the grinder, forcing them to choose between life or death, the former always seeming to require some form of bodily mutilation, either to one's self or to another, while the latter generally involves a spectacularly gristly demises, guaranteeing a good time for viewers no matter which way it goes.  Co-written by Leigh Whannell (Saw) and Darren Lynn Bousman, the latter also directing here, Saw II (2005) features once New Kid on the Block singer Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense, Dreamcatcher), Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, Saw) and Shawnee Smith (Summer School, Who's Harry Crumb?), the last two actors both reprising their roles from the original film.  Also appearing is Franky G (Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (Showgirls, The Substitute), Dina Meyer (Dragonheart, Starship Troopers), Emmanuelle Vaugier (40 Days and 40 Nights), Erik Knudsen (Tribulation), and Beverley Mitchell ("7th Heaven").<br /><br />After a killer opening sequence involving a half-nekkid man fitted with a particularly nasty piece of headgear, we meet police detective Eric Mathews (Wahlberg).  Seems Eric's life isn't going all that great...he's separated from his wife, his son Daniel (Knudsen) despises him, and his career has taken something akin to a nosedive straight into the porcelain (he now rides a desk)...and things are about to go from bad to worse, as the serial killer known as Jigsaw has taken a personal interest in Eric, so much so he engages Eric in a game, one that involves his son being trapped in a dilapidated house in an undisclosed location with a bunch of social miscreants (including Amanda, from the first film, played by Ms. Smith), slowly being poisoned by some type nerve gas, while all of their activities are being fed through surveillance cameras connected to monitors within Jigsaw's lair.  In order to counteract the poison, those in the house must participate in certain challenges, as successful completion allows access to an antidote, but if you've seen the first film, you'll know said challenges most definitely involve great sacrifice (usually of one's own body part).  As Eric and Jigsaw go back and forth (a good deal of Jigsaw's past is revealed), those in the house learn that they all have something in common, that is when they aren't getting something severed off in a devious trap or puking up blood due to prolonged exposure to the nerve gas.  As time runs out, the situation within the house takes a turn for the worse (one of the group decides it's a `only the strongest survive' type situation), and things aren't looking good for Eric's son, forcing Eric to use some `old school' information extraction methods on Jigsaw to find the location of the house.  Eric finally gets Jigsaw to come clean (sort of), but then again, given his penchant for elaborately planned scenarios, it could just all be a part of the game...<br /><br />First off let me just say this is one filthy, nasty, mean spirited horror film, loaded with disturbing imagery (that's about the dirtiest bathroom I've ever seen this side of the gas station down the street) and lots of blood and pain (and blood).  Is it the nastiest piece of work I've seen?  Not by a long shot, but it definitely holds it own.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was an excellent example of what a sequel should be for this type of film, one that not only expands on the original, but also reveals a good deal of information with regards to the main, connecting character, that being Jigsaw, played most excellently by Tobin Bell.  We learn his name, his past, and the motivation behind why he does what he does...and I have to say, in listening to him, his reasoning doesn't seem all that far-fetched, as many people do take that which is most precious to them, their lives, for granted, not fully appreciating what they have until they're forced to face their own mortality (having your head stuck in a bear trap set to a timer will certainly go far in helping you reevaluate your life choices).  But then again, it is our unalienable right to disregard our gifts and live a life of slovenly leisure should we choose to do so...but I digress.  As far as the performances go, I thought most did well enough (I found Eric's son to be an annoying little prat) considering there wasn't really enough time to spend on any one character given the number of them running around combined with the film's seemingly short running time (it says 93 minutes, but it felt more like about an hour and twenty minutes).  The real fun here is the various traps, as Jigsaw continues his grand, social experimentation, `testing the fabric of human nature'...the opening sequence, featuring a vicious head trap (slightly different than the one featured in the first film), is worth it alone for seeing this film, as it's about the most tense five minutes I've spent with a movie in a while.  If'n you're squeamish about needles, you've got a real treat in store for you here...also, that suspended hand trapping device was particularly nasty, although I have to say, the person who fell for it was none to bright.  Seemed to me a normal person would have figured out the danger after putting one hand in, and would have opted against inserting the second, but, when you're doped up silly on nerve gas, who's to say what one might do?  As far as the direction of the film, Darren Lynn Bousman doesn't seem to have the overall smooth finesse of James Wan (who directed the first film), but he definitely knows what he's doing, and he does it very well (what's really impressive is this was his first, big feature).  Bousman keeps things moving along at a frantic pace, barely allowing for one to catch one's breath.  My only real misgiving about this film was at the end...there's a decent revelation that comes about, followed by an overly lengthy recap sequence where we get to rewatch all the stinking clues dropped throughout the film, perhaps in an effort to strengthen (or help explain) the revelation itself.  This isn't an uncommon device, one that I feel sort of suggests the filmmaker feels their audiences are none too bright.  Problem is here (for me, at least), it wasn't really necessary, was way too long, and served only to eat up screen time.  All in all, if you liked the first one, then you'll most likely dig this follow up.<br /><br />The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1), looks excellent, and the audio, available in both Dolby 2.0 Surround and 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Plus comes through perfectly.  As far as extras, there's a audio commentary track with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actors Donnie Wahlberg and Beverley Mitchell, three featurettes titled `Bits and Pieces - The Props of Jigsaw' (4:35), `Jigsaw's Game' (2:58), and `The Traps of Saw II', which is made up of four parts, each discussing a particular trap.  Also included are storyboards and a conceptual art gallery, English and Spanish subtitles, a theatrical trailer for the film, along with advertisements/trailers for other Lion's Gate DVD releases like the special edition Saw 2 DVD set, Three... Extremes (2004), Audition (1999), Ultimate Avengers (2006), and Tamara (2005).<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, seems Darren Lynn Bousman is busy working on Saw III, scheduled for a 2006 release, probably around Halloween, if production goes well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Thoroughly entertaining. Suspenseful. Overall a pretty decent sequel, but not quite as entertaining or well-put-together as the first.<br /><br />The title of this film (just like the original) gives the impression that you might be in for a gratuitous gore fest. While there are some graphic scenes, this movie, like its predecessor, is much more of a CSI/Law and Order crime thriller than a go-for-the-grossout flick.<br /><br />It's a seeSAW story that flips back and forth between a group of kidnapped hoodlums being held in a gloomy, booby-trap filled house and the detective (plus team) trying to find them. There are good twists and turns in the story: Why has the group been kidnapped? What do they all have in common? What do they have in common with the cops that are looking for them? Will any of the kidnapped crew escape? Is there a definitive tie-in with the first movie? All ultimately revealed in this B-actor filled second edition of the Jigsaw killer chronicles.<br /><br />The B-actors selectively put in some pretty good performances. Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Mathews), Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are great. Franky G (Xavier) is fairly believable at best and the other kidnapees are standard B appearances.<br /><br />There are also some police-work plot holes/believability issues that take some of the realistic desperation away from Saw II. I'd elaborate, but the explanations would take away some of the surprises.<br /><br />So, all in all, I'd say....See Saw. It's certainly worth renting, but not worthy of the original release's collector status.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>Saw was and still is an amazing movie, and to me there is no movie killer more genius than Jigsaw, with the exception of Hannibal, of course. His unique traps and his twisted altruism just attracts you to his character. It's virtually impossible to hate this man, especially after the twist in the last movie. Not only that, but he's capable of fulfilling that old saying "Fool me once..." blah blah. Saw II is the "fool me twice" part of that saying.<br /><br />Though since Saw ended by revealing the identity of the killer known as Jigsaw, Saw II obviously had to go in another direction. And surprisingly, the twists in this one are as convincing as they were in the last one. It's just difficult to talk about them in the review without spoiling the movie. So I'll say this straight off: If you loved Saw then there is absolutely no reason why you can't love this. And if you hated Saw, perhaps because of the gore, then obviously stay away. Saw II did everything good (depending on your interpretation of "good") that the first movie did and adds some.<br /><br />Since good horror films are so sparse (is this even a horror film, or a suspense/thriller), I can't recommend this movie enough. Saw II achieves what only the best horror movies are able to achieve. It gets into your skin. You'll jump, you'll turn your head, you may even gag once or twice, but either way you feel the effects of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>As a fan of the first Saw movie, I couldn't wait to see Saw II. This movie did not disappoint! From the opening scene when Michael finds himself one of Jigsaw's new victims and finds his head in a trap and forced to find the key to his head trap which we find out has been implanted behind his right eye, to the end of the movie when we find out who Jigsaw's accomplance is, it is a edge of your seat movie. Centered around a cop ( played by Donnie Wahlberg) who Jigsaw has targeted and is the common link between the people Jigsaw ( John ) has locked up in a room in an abandoned house, the movie delivers alot more than the original. The fact that Jigsaw has several more victims in this movie makes it much more interesting. We see Jigsaw who is dying of cancer and very bitter, still wanting to teach people the meaning and value of life. This movie like the first, forces people to see exactly what they would do to save their own life. With each victim's dying scene, it makes you wonder what WE would actually do to save our life. There was good acting in this movie and alot more action. Of course, with a surprise ending, it looks like there will be a Saw III in the works. If you are a fan of the first Saw, there is no doubt you will enjoy this one even more. It is definetly worth buying and owning. This is a sequel which is better than the first!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Visceral.  Sadistic.  Incredible.  Effectively horrifying.  These all apply to this bloody remake to the popular SAW.  Only Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Dina Meyer as the detective return from the original, but the bloodletting continues and the game seems to have the same rules.  Perhaps another actor than Donnie Wahlberg would have been more convincing, but even he manages to pull his role off.  The premise of the eight people being held hostage in an abandoned house, all doomed to die unless they succeed in playing Jigsaw's game, is nothing new; it all started similarly with TEN LITTLE INDIANS and has continued on since.<br /><br />The movie has its shocking moments, some scenes almost too painful to really watch.  The acting is effective, but no real standouts.  Franky G is playing the same role he always plays and Glenn Plummer does his requisite bad boyz persona.  Bell is lethally chilling as Jigsaw, and since we know SAW III is coming out later this year, you won't be too surprised at the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>Most fans of Saw one will admit that the sequel wasn't as good as the first but most horror fans will also admit that it is one of the better sequels to come out for a horror film than most we have seen.<br /><br />Saw 2 finds actually a very clever way to connect both part one and two together by bringing back a woman from part one who survived. She is supposed to be there to help the rest who are new to the twisted game of Jigsaw's. There is ending scene as well in the movie that connects one and two in another way that I won't spoil but will answer all your questions you had for the two unfortunates in the first film.<br /><br />So yes the writing is in ways strong and keep you there in front of the screen. It does keep you caring about what will happen and you pray the main character's son that is one of the new players of Jigsaw's game survives. Also what makes this movie worth watching is the fact that you finally get to know the mysterious Jigsaw a lot better than you ever did know and he becomes less ominous- feeling than he was in the first and just...a sick (both mentally and physically) person that hasn't been caught yet.<br /><br />The characters are strong-ish. There are just too many characters I feel in this movie, so there isn't enough time for any of them to be too strong. The only ones that truly stood out was the boy, mainly because the main character is his father and trying to save him, and the survivor of the first movie who knows a little too much- I felt. Then of course Jigsaw. The film was sort of messy though because there shouldn't have been that many characters.<br /><br />Part one I felt was stronger in this case because there were less characters so thus they had a chance to grow into stronger personalities as the movie rolled on. And also Jigsaw having an ominous feel just made part one a lot more creepy than the second. The writing in the first was also more stronger just cause again less characters. But in both endings, I was surprised. I have to admit that. Both endings I didn't even think about till they were played.<br /><br />So overall this was a good follow- up to the Saw part one, but it doesn't match up to the strength of part one either. I highly recommend part one and also this one just because in part two they add a little more to the story everyone who liked Saw 1 should know.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Saw II', directed and co-authored by Darren Lynn Boosman probably surprised many by being very successful in the theatre last year, although the original movie in this series was both critically and commercially a bit more successful than the average low budget horror flick, even without a big name such as George Romero or Wes Craven behind the writing and the camera.<br /><br />I was moderately impressed with the original and I believe this second installment succeeds in being as modestly good as the original, while being just original enough to be interesting in its own right.<br /><br />The most facinating thing about this story and the way it plays out is that it gives a new look at how emotional, bordering on sheer stupidity, people can be when they are faced with a horrific situation. The classic example of this blindness of rationality is when Jamie Lee Curtis retreats into a basement as she is running away from Michael Myers in Halloween (I). Reason would tell one to not let yourself be backed into a corner. The situation in Saw II is a bit different in that the victims, like the crew of the Nostromo in `Alien' are already trapped in a seemingly inescapable enclosure. The problem is not physical escape, but in solving a puzzle which requires the cooperation of the seven prisoners.<br /><br />Business trainers hammer constantly on the importance of teamwork in accomplishing things. We are not born with this intuition and if we never played a team sport, we may never have encountered this principle in either our mathematics or Shakespeare or French classes in college. The seven prisoners presented with this puzzle don't need management training to tell them they need to cooperate. Their captor, `Jigsaw', tells them straight away that the solution for their escape depends on cooperation in the two hours they have before the poison gas to which they are exposed does its worst. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, most of the seven die off largely through stupidity fuelled by terror plus selfishness. The failure of the imprisoned principles to have reason overcome fear and greed is one of the two most interesting aspects of the movie. The second, similar theme is the stupidity of the police, primarily of the principle character played by Donnie Wahlberg, to pay attention to what the perp is saying in order to solve his puzzles.<br /><br />Much credit has to be given to the several horrific traps and tortures to which the perp puts his victims. Compared to some of these perils, Jason's ax and Michael Myers' chef's knife are not much more than deadly kitty toys. Aside from the ingenious conceptions by the writers, there is the excellent realization of these deadly devices in safe Hollywood simulacra. There is not a single clue that what looks like the inevitable mayhem created by the meeting of sharp stainless steel with unprotected flesh is actually done with plastic and cosmetic appliances. While the director's commentary makes it clear that this movie was done on a relatively small budget, it seems like the writers, the director, and the editor, put too much effort into whiz-bang collages with rapidly shifting camera angles rather than dwelling on careful closeups showing the realization of peril on faces rather than spending time on screams and blood.<br /><br />While the puzzles, the perils, the booby traps, and the threat of time running out are the movie's strong points, along with the audience's frustration with the blindness of reason shown by the vics, the greatest weakness is that the perp's motives are never resolved or even fully explained. Although the principle character is a despicable person, there is no reason why the perp takes it upon himself to rain vengence down on his shoulders, especially by putting the lead character's (relatively) innocent son at risk.<br /><br />Overall, the story line in this sequel is richer and psychologically more interesting than the first, but both are a bit weak on story.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, you will certainly like this one. Most of the extras are relatively ordinary, with the most interesting being the revelations of how the special effects teams made plastic and foam and fiber optic cable look like hardwood and iron and stainless steel. My favorite extra, the director's commentary almost totally ignores the psychologically interesting aspects of the story and spends all its time dwelling on the problems of shooting and the skill of the actors in certain situations.<br /><br />More interesting than the average bloodfest, with grounds for looking forward to `Saw III'.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Saw 2 isn't the gory gross out movie that a lot have made it out to be, I think the first movie had more of that, but it still has it's moments of cringing scenes that are hard to watch. But what is Saw if it didn't have any of that in the film?<br /><br />What makes this movie so great is that this gives a story to who the Jigsaw Killer really is. In the first film, he is rarely seen and portrayed as some kind of monster. In this film, he is on almost the entire time giving his story and it makes him more human and actually a little sympathetic. That's the basic idea of the film, people trying to escape Jigsaw's game is only a minor side story and not a major plot like in the original. This story is really made just to tell you a little bit about who Jigsaw really is.<br /><br />Those people who had to solve a puzzle to live had an easy one to solve to the viewing audience. I figured out the answer fifteen mintues into the film, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film. It's one of those things that if you don't figure it out by the end, you slap your forehead for not knowing how obvious it was saying "Of course!"<br /><br />The actors do a great job. Tobin Bell really shines in the film since he finally has a lot of speaking parts in the film. He makes the character very convincing, intellegent and like I said before, actually sympethetic to the point you kind of feel sorry for him.<br /><br />So overall, if you liked the first film, you will also like this one. Knowing Jigsaw more and seeing his human side is worth it alone, it puts a face on the character. But, I don't feel it is better than the first movie. Some of the things in this film were typical and not really original or rarely seen like what was in the first movie. I do recommend this film to fans, Saw 3 is right now being made and will be released this year and I welcome it</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Saw II is that rare movie that stays intriguing and believable the entire way through, while maintaining a cohesive storyline and gore to spare. The acting is solid, the scares are real, and the viewer is trying just as hard as Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Matthews to solve the mystery. What's most amazing is that all the clues really are right before your eyes.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Jigsaw has committed another grisly murder, and left his calling card for Detective Matthews to track him down. Matthews reluctantly takes the case and quickly locates Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) in his warehouse lair. But this is only the beginning of another one of Jigsaw's intricate games.<br /><br />Now eight people, including Matthews' son, are trapped in a house where deadly nerve gas is seeping through the walls and into their bodies. As the police try to locate the house and figure out a way to rescue the prisoners, they are also trying to figure their own way out together, while fighting amongst themselves to find out what connects them all.<br /><br />The suspense in this film is palpable and Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is one of the best horror franchise "bad guys" in years. His twisted sense of morality: "Those that don't appreciate life do not deserve it" is the kind of terrible explanation that makes a psychopath real and frightening.<br /><br />The twists that this film takes are surprising and show the kind of intelligence that the majority of horror schlock coming out these days is severely lacking.<br /><br />The DVD extras are truly spectacular. The viewer gets a look at how the set designers laid out every one of the various traps in the film, from the needle pit to the furnace trap. All the props are also examined (the bat with nails in it, etc.). Overall, this is the kind of horror film that is watchable over and over again and the kind of film that makes a great addition to any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I really liked this sequel. I normally like sequels of movies that I liked and this one is exceptional. It holds alot more suspense than the first one because there is a more complicated trap for people to get out of.

I also found the house where the victims were held not creepy enough, whereas in the first film, the old industrial toilet was intensely creepy.<br /><br />SAW 2 failed also because I did not care about the characters.

The group must come together to overcome & survive their stay. Whats worse, is they only have two hours to escape since their is a toxic nerve agent slowly being pumped into the house that, without a cure, will turn them into a bloody soup (the cure is, supposedly locked in a huge safe. Get the combination to the safe, will get you the cure.)<br /><br />"Oh yes, their will be blood."<br /><br />Adding insult to injury the detective's son is among the group, & it's just a matter of time before the felons find out why he is among them. If the detective plays Jigsaw's game, his son will live, but, with a very short temper it's just a matter of time before the detective snaps.<br /><br />"Saw II" was immediately green lit after the first successful weekend of the original in October of '04.<br /><br />The film was put into rush mode since it had just under a year for completion & release.<br /><br />"Saw II" has no real thrills to it. The characters are cardboard & a lot of what went on the house could have been handled differently, or avoided altogether. The film is way to predictable.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg's character is probably one of the worst detectives in film history. If he kept his cool the film would have been better for it. Shawnee Smith's character was just lame & the ending was total bulls**t.<br /><br />The only time "Saw II" comes alive is when Tobin Bell is onscreen & thats only, roughly ten to fifteen minutes of screentime. It was a bit interesting to see the origin of Jigsaw. Bell gives a creepy vibe to the character.<br /><br />I was expecting a bit more from "Saw II", but, I should have known better.<br /><br />This game, is most definitely, over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Saw 2 is a fairly good sequel, a serial killer called "jigsaw" kidnaps people an forces them to take a deadly test - usually involving cutting off a body part to survive.<br /><br />This time around jiggy kidnaps a bunch of people, including a police detective's son, and imprisons them in a death-trap rigged house. The detective tracks down jigsaw only to find out that, well , I won't spoil it. There are some good surprises in this movie, one that is very obvious, others that are pretty clever.<br /><br />One of the better horror films to come out in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Considering the very short pre-production period, and the enormous pressure that the filmmakers must have been feeling after the surprise hit of `Saw', it must be said that `Saw II' did a very good job. The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.<br /><br />[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.<br /><br />The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.<br /><br />But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.<br /><br />However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.<br /><br />The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The acting went from below average in SAW to pretty decent in SAW II.

Jigsaw attacks once again and this time it's Matthew's son who's in the torture chamber with a group of convicts that Matthews put away.<br /><br />Unlike the original, the script for Saw II seems like it wasn't revised enough. The characters aren't given much background study even though Jigsaw is finally introduced as an old man dying of cancer, but the torture scenes, especially the one at the beginning of the film, are horrific.<br /><br />Fans of the original and horror films in general might find Saw II quite entertaining.

Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw TWO begins with EIGHT people trapped in an abandoned NERVE GAS HOUSE.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, XAVIER CHAVEZ (Frankie G.), GUS COLYARD (Tony Nappo), and OBI TATE (Tim Burd), among others, have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. ERIC MATTHEWS (Donnie Wahlberg) are investigating as a team, but ERIC MATTHEWS may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that OBI may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several murderous contraptions like the MAGNUM EYE HOLE (for a MONEY LAUNDERER), the FURNACE TRAP (for a CONMAN), and the NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK (for a DRUG DEALER who tosses in a JUNKIE) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene VENUS FLY TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S ACCOMPLICES, and on to Saw III.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>Saw 2 is not quite as good as the first one but it still does a pretty good job of pulling its own weight.

Well, it's a bit of a step down in the series for a couple of reasons. First, half of Jigsaw's victims are just plain annoying. You've got your typical dumb and whiny chicks, and your typical arrogant jerk. You even got a young teenager, who is probably the most annoying one out of all of them. And he doesn't even talk that much! Second, this film also has your standard detective plot thread. Jigsaw is typically found and interrogated (like you've never seen THAT before in the detective genre), and the detectives themselves look like obvious cardboard cutouts. The good news is those are the only flaws I can find in this film, I think. The traps are far more inventive than the ones in the original, and while they didn't freak me out, they are still disturbing to look at. We get to know a little more about Jigsaw and why he makes his victims play his little "games." He's probably one of the creepiest villains in the horror genre.<br /><br />If you loved the first Saw, then you would probably love this one as well if you don't mind the flaws. I enjoyed watching it myself, and it was enough for me to have interest in the next sequel.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>When the first one ended, I was positive the series was gonna be good. Plus the back story on Jigsaw was a nice touch. Seeing someone learning to help him with his work was a nice one too. Other than that I don't have much else to say about this one, mostly good things if I did though.<br /><br />August 8, 2010) I recently watched/purchased the two disc special edition-I wish they would've stuck with the clear case/dust cover with these first two films of the 2-disc. The storyline is pretty good-Donnie Wahlberg is a cop and father to a son who no longer understand each other. But when his son is thrust into a Jigsaw game-he is forced to change his tone. In the process he meets Jigsaw/Tobin Bell-you get a glimpse of his past and how he became so demented-the further chapters elaborate on this perfectly as well.<br />The 2-disc is better than the one disc because of the special features-making of featurettes, commentaries, and a few other odds and ends. The first trap in this one made me cringe-what the subject had to do was freaky. The twist at the end was wild just like the first SAW. Which edition do I recommend? Personally, if you like the Saw series like I do, you'll want to get both the clear case and 2-disc of both the first two films, at least. The uncut edition didn't change much here either, except a couple very subtle, and I do mean subtle changes when the swat team infiltrates Jigsaw's lair, that scene was slightly changed, other than that, I didn't see much different.<br />If I could grade this film, I'd give it an A-</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>When it comes to filming sequels there's a strong tendency to proceed with the philosophy "more is better".

Well the film 'Saw II' did just that, more of everything. But you know what? It worked beautifully!<br /><br />'Saw II' was successful in taking all the successful elements from the first film; expanding the cast, improving the effects, intensifying the psychological angst and physical gore while maintaining a strong narrative continuity with the original movie. Even more impressive was the manner in which they were able to have so many new things going on and still add psychological depth and breath to an already great protagonist (Jigsaw played by Tobin Bell).<br /><br />There are a lot of clever and unexpected twists and turns in this one that really leave an already strong storyline up to many more sequels to come!<br /><br />Almost forgot, I loved Shawnee Smith in the role of Amanda.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) continues his reign of terror through more tests of mind and body.

(Well, so far, we've got Hostel, at least.) As Leigh Whanell stuck around to write the script for Saw II, once again co-writing it with the film's director, there seemed a reasonable amount of promise that the sequel would, if not measure up to the original, at least hold its own and be better than the average sequel. And, well, guilty on all counts.<br /><br />This could have actually been entitled Cube, Leigh Whannell-style. It's certainly head and shoulders above either of Cube's painfully anemic sequels. But while Cube is the movie's obvious spiritual daddy, there are certainly a lot more references to old (and more recent) horror films here to choose from; given Whannell's love of intricacy, it's pretty obvious these are conscious, which makes it loads of fun to play spot-the-influence. (The opening scene is a direct homage to one of my favorite recent indie horror films; I knew from the first five minutes that no matter how bad this movie turned out to be, I'd have a soft spot in my heart for it, if only for that.) Technically, it's just as good as the original, which surprised me; the film's major failing lies in... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Eric Matthews (The Sixth Sense's Donnie Wahlberg), a former beat cop gone to seed while driving a desk, is called out to the site of the latest Jigsaw killing-- one of his informants. Jigsaw has painted a message on the room's wall that names Matthews, but despite this, he's too occupied not only with his other cases, but his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen, recently of The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio), who's turning into a juvenile delinquent. Matthews, however, notices the one thing at the crime scene that will blow the case open; it does, but as Matthews finds out, Jigsaw does have a habit of making sure everything, down to the final detail, is planned-- Matthews and his team are forced to solve Jigsaw's next puzzle, which involves eight people stuck in a trapped house-- one of whom is Daniel.<br /><br />The mystery angle of the film, like that of its predecessor, is immaculately done. Everything falls into place (with one odd exception that makes me wonder if there's a deleted scene that contains it) perfectly, and it's a pleasure to watch, even if it wears thin in places; there was at least one aspect of the big picture I figured out at least ten minutes before I should have. The film's main characters are relatively well drawn, though, with the larger cast of this film, that translates to the minor characters getting rather short shrift, especially Laura (Seventh Heaven's Beverley Mitchell, though it's possible there's another deleted scene or two floating about that fills in some unanswered questions we end up with about her). That said, everyone acts the parts they get, and acts them well. Not the actors' fault if the parts are sometimes threadbare. They do the best with what they get, and Whannell and Bousman have come up with a solid cast of underrated Hollywood young-and-beautifuls here; Wahlberg shows that his star turn in The Sixth Sense, as small as it was, was not a fluke, Glenn Plummer (Strange Days) does a fascinating Mos Def impersonation, and Dina Meyer, well, proves that she can, in fact, act her way out of a paper bag.<br /><br />Where Whannell goes horribly, horribly wrong is in letting one of the homages cross the line from homage to "just downright stupid." This is something it would be possible to laugh off, of course, except that it concerns the entire climax of the film. Can't say any more than that, but let's just say the set for the final scenes should never have resurfaced.<br /><br />Once again, I find myself reviewing a Hollywood horror film-- for the third time in a month-- that had the potential to be a fantastic piece of work, and blew it in the final minutes. Unlike the others, though, Saw II stays good for a much longer portion of its length than do the others. Not great, but good. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This was one of the best sequals I have ever seen to a movie especially in this movie category horror/thriller<br /><br />Saw 2 delevirs I did not see this in the theaters I just waited till it came out to buy then I just flat out bought it and I do not regret the purchase it was well worth the money<br /><br />This movie gives some great twists and interacts a little with the first movie I wont spoil anything with details<br /><br />I give this 4.5 stars because at the end their is a little bit of a corny twist to the movie other than that the movie is great the story is pretty good and the acting is not bad at all this is defenitly recommended to people who saw saw 1</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>I'm anxiously awaiting the DVD release of Saw II.

I don't want to give away too much information, but seriously, if you truly enjoyed Saw, then Saw II will not disappoint! See Saw II!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back! this time he traps a helpless group of several people people (Shawnee Smith, Erik Knudsen, Tim Burd, Franky G, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Glenn Plummer, Tony Nappo) in a booby-trapped filled house conducted by Jigsaw and his sick twisted ideas. Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) discovers Jigsaw himself for he must play the game if his son and the other victims can survive.<br /><br />Enjoyable and fairly grisly sequel to the suprise instant new horror classic "Saw" has writer-and-director James Wan as executive producer. The acting is good in some places but there is some more memorable moments of torture and gore such as the now infamous cringe-inducing "Pit of Syringes" and the gunblast to the eyeball boobie trap, though nowhere as great as the original this is still a fairly watchable and violent sequel.<br /><br />This unrated uncut 2-Disc DVD set contains the alternate unrated cut not shown in theaters with excellent extras like two audio commentaries, theatrical trailer, a fun "Play Me" set top navigation game much like the one on the "Nightmare on Elm Street" boxset, The making of "Saw II" multi-featurette, "Zombie" a short student film from the director of this movie, and "The story behind the story" multi-featurette.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Jigsaw is at it again in this sequel to the do-you-appreciate-your-life saga.  Five people are trapped in a house with no way out.  There is toxic fumes coming out of the vents, and these fumes are slowly killing the victims.  The antidote is around the house somewhere.  Like in the first movie, we find out a little something about each person there.  Meanwhile, a detective is looking for his son, who is in the house with the other four.<br /><br />This is bloodier than the first.  Is it better?  Maybe.  The ending will shock you as it did me.  From the sounds of it, there's going to be a Saw 3.<br /><br />Watch Saw 2 and judge for yourself.  I, personally, thought it was just ok.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Darren Lynn Bousman<br /><br />Cast:  Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Erik Knudsen.<br /><br />Running Time:  93 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content.<br /><br />Sequels, with a few exceptions, have a tendency to be very bad. In the wake of all this being let down by them, many critics were initially unimpressed with the idea of a clever little horror film like "Saw" to have a sequel. It seemed like too much of a way to cash in a successful revenue and good reception of the original and while this one isn't as good it is a formidable continuation.  "Saw II" does everything wrong that the first film did right. First of all, this film tells the story of a group of eight random people inside one of Jigsaw's "Fun houses", if you will, with a dangerous nerve gas slowly creeping into their systems. They only have 3 hours to find a way out, or they all die. Now, what made the first film great is that it built tension and suspense on the fact that everything was a mystery. The two men locked inside of a bathroom had no more of an idea of what was going on than the people watching the film. As the film went on, there was a little more information leaked, a little more progression with each minute that ticked by. And the fact that there were only two people instead of eight made it easier to know the characters, know why they were doing what they were doing, etc. Instead, "Saw II" is just basically a glorified theatrical version of "Survivor" with blood, guts, and gore.<br /><br />The first film also didn't reveal much of the surrounding environments outside of the bathroom. That's what made it scary; you didn't know who or what was watching them, why they were in there, or even if there was any hope that they would get out. In Saw II, a police team actually captures jigsaw (Tobin Bell), and throughout the film, there are cuts to detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who must investigate the crime scene in order to save his own son, who happens to be trapped with the several others at the unknown location, about to be killed by the deathly gas.  Everything is just so silly when compared to the first film. It's like Leigh Whannel completely let his film go the way of "quick cash-in", and if he had a little more input on this film, I think it could have been much better.  Saw II does do some things right, such as the way people die and nailing the violence factor right on the head. There is plenty of gore in this film, and some of the twisted things the people have to do are pretty insane (seeing a girl crawl around in a pool of syringes is terrifying). But, the violence isn't handled well. Violence isn't something that is supposed to be there just to be there. It should have a purpose (such as scaring audiences!).  What director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who wrote the first "Saw") attempt to do is create a scenario similar to the excellent "The Cube" and create a villain as menacing as Jon Doe in "Seven"; however, they fail to do either and "Saw II", despite its redeeming qualities, becomes an overly grisly, horrifically gory tale that isn't all that surprising or entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>After watching the epic called SAW, I was a bit over enthusiastic because of how immensely interesting the film is. Jigsaw soon became one of my favourite & most interesting villains of all time. I like the masks and characters used to define the startling fear of Jigsaw used in SAW. I expected something more than what I got from SAW2.<br /><br />Saw 2 is better than your average film and I would rate it four stars had I not seen Saw. I expected more from this film than a film full of commercial intent. Yes,friends, there is a lot of blood in this film but what the film lacks is that fear Saw got out of me(viewer). Saw2 is mostly loud yet unpenetrating. It's like a freakshow where a lot of characters are put into one sequence. It is sad to observe that the director couldnt overcome the FAILING SEQUEL SYNDROME the film industry is blessed with.<br /><br />Although I'm terrible at pinpointing flaws and guessing the suspense, Saw II is predictable enough for me to have guessed the twist in the end. A review on imdb.com said the twist in the end is even more ingenious than Saw. I strongly disagree.<br /><br />Saw2 is a mixed bag because of how confused the direction seems. The pace of the story is slow from the start especially since many unknown characters are pooled in. I suggest you give the film a watch for yourself to understand how aimless the direction gets an hour into the movie.<br /><br />Please See, If you think Final Destination2 is a better film than its prequel , you will like Saw2.In 18 months time, Saw III will be released and I will make sure I watch it. The policeman(father) in the film played a rather lousy role but I blame the direction rather than the actor for it.<br /><br />Want to watch a violent film that will shake your faith? Watch  OLDBOY to see what flabbergasting suspense is all about.<br /><br />Luck.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I'm going to name 3 movies: Rosemary's Baby, the Shining, the Exorcist. What did they have in common? They scared the living hell out of everyone that watched it(some less so but oh well). What about films like Scream or Urban Legend or that Summer one? It was cool seeing WB stars getting chopped up. And now we have the latest batch of horror movies: out and out full-on gore movies. This film and it's prequel, Wolf Creek and Hostel were films with really quick editing and brutal gore. But personally that's not scary, it's just gross. Saw 2 doesn't change this, even though it's admittedly good concept is intact.<br /><br />The Jigsaw Killer is hard to describe as a murderer since he doesn't actually do it, his victims do. Being someone who "saves people's lives", he devises ways where people have to do something painful in order to escape. Most of them don't escape and that's where the gore comes in. It's a neat idea, although Seven used this in a way, it's just the filmmakers are a little frustrating in making a genuinely good horror movie.<br /><br />A detective finds out his son is locked in a room along with a couple others and their game is this: a nerve gas is in the house they're in and they have to find the antidote in 2 hours or they'll die. So we jump between 2 stories: the detective trying to solve it on his end and the unfortunate victims who might face their grisly ends.<br /><br />The film's central line is "oh yes, there will be blood" and it's a pretty spot-on tagline: gore is very rampant here, probably moreso than the original which you will always expect. "Carnage candy" as a kid in Scream 2 puts it but after awhile it kind of gets old, it's not as shocking anymore when the 4th one gets taken down in a grisly fashion and you don't feel disgusted anymore, at least I didn't. Sure it's gory but when we don't care about anyone living or dying, having someone die in a gory way is like "ooh, that hurt" rather than just being horrified.<br /><br />It is a film concept that can be so much more but unfortunately these films are just a way to kill people in grisly fashions and call it a horror movie. Rent at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I guess I'm just weird cause I really think this movie is a major step down from the original.  Sure, I'd anticipate that the foolish masses to think that this was equal to or better thant he original; they might think anything.  But there are plenty of people out there whose opinions I respect who think that this film was pretty much a lateral move, and I don't quite get that.  So again, maybe I'm just strange.  And I'm not as in love with the original as some people are, mind you; I like it a helluva lot, and actually appreciate a lot more after seeing the sequel, but it's certainly got some flaws.  People always accuse sequels of being pale imitations of the original, and nowhere is that more true than here.  It's watchable enough, for sure, but it lacks the sorta novelty of the original, and the clever, interesting plot.  I'm not gonna tell ya that the plot for the original was terribly plausible, but it was very compelling, I felt, and just had a sort of continuity to it that 'Saw II' lacks.  That and it just contained a kinda central mystery as to just what the hell is going on, but here we already know the basics, and the connection between the characters in the room here proves to be fairly mundane and obvious.  Here we're just basically waiting for them to get on with it.  In 'Saw II' they basically stuff 8 or so people in a room and have them bicker and kill themselves in the traps while Donnie Wahlberg yells and yells and yells across town.  To be perfectly blunt, this is just too much for me to take it entirely seriously no matter how well it might be done.  First of all, Wahlberg tends to be way, way over the top.  People complained about the acting in the original, but he's a bigger problem here then anyone was there.  Also, this time around Jigsaw has just got a rather enormous funhouse of death, and it's all a bit too elaborate and comes across a bit silly much of the time.  There's just so much there, so many wacky traps and whatnot.  Some of these individual scenarios are pretty damn neat, I'll admit, though they occasionally feel like parody and just generally aren't as interesting as the ones in the original. (And certainly none of them can match the jaw trap from the original film.)  The one chick, Amanda, being dumped in the pile of discarded hypodermic needles is definitely the best.  Ouch.<br /><br />Furthermore, the new director just doesn't the sort of handle on the material that Wan had.  Darren Lynn Bousman seems like he's trying to hard to just imitate the style of the original, and most of the flashy, music-video style stuff just comes off as silly and overwrought.  (This happened some in the original as well, actually, but it was more contained and effective in general.)  The style of the original was derivative, but you get the idea that they were making it that way because that's how they wanted it to be.  Ya get the feeling that Bousman made the film this way because that's how it was supposed to be, and it just doesn't generate the same atmosphere.<br /><br />The film hinges on a final plot twist which I must admit is fairly clever.  Again, it's not terribly likely, but whaddya expect in this kinda movie.  It was amusing enough.  That goes for the film as a whole, but don't be expecting something too cohesive.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I reviewed the first Saw movie, and unearthed it for what it was an amalgam of several other movies but it was not the perfect blend of all of them, more like a serious rip off. This sequel had to happen, because Twisted Pictures and the powers that be in Hollywood had a Bloody cash cow on their hands with all the minions of teenagers who wouldn't know original material if it reached out and snatched the Abercrombie hoodie off their backs. Again, thanks to the power of free DVDs at the library I grabbed SAW deuce and watched it with an open mind and lots of coffee of course. I actually love Donnie Walberg, I have since he took the one side of his manly overalls and let them hang while dancing with New Kids on the Block, so he was a good surprise. The story line is a basic one gruesome murder, similar to the first movies MO, a detective, and more victims but instead of individual attention they are all stuck in one house and slowly being poisoned, they have to find keys to doors, and search for antidotes, and figure out why they are all there. The SECOND I saw friggin Lucy from 7th Heaven I giggled with glee because the thought of seeing that pie faced whiner get offed in some gory way was like an early birthday present unfortunately she just slowly expired from the poison. The first Saw, had a twist that I didn't see coming, this one, not so much. Bringing a previous victim in (Amanda), especially one who professed to be "helped" by Jigsaw in the first was its biggest mistake. I knew she was in on the whole thing the second she woke up. The tests for the victims were lame, and we only get to see 3 of them really: the oven, the needles and the clear box, none of them made me want to look away, which is the telltale sign your scaring me or grossing me out. By the end I seriously cared more about Amanda surviving knowing she was one of the bad guys, more than the kid and the detective, mainly because Donnie Walberg was such a sucky parent and a crooked cop, and the kid because he was really the innocent I knew wouldn't die, Jiggy doesn't work that way he is such a moral man. So Saw 3 is coming out soon, and we all know that Amanda is now the puppet master, what I want to see is her lock up one by one Paris and Lindsay and Nicole and Ashley and Jessica and Brittney, take away all their phones, miniature dogs, fake tans, hair bleach, plastic surgery and make them choose between 15 minutes more of fame or their looks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Saw was good, because it was creating a new genre and it was original and on a league of it's own. Saw 2 is not as good in my opinion. It's very disturbing at times, because it's so graphic and violent and so much blood and gore that by the end of it I was repulsed by it. Why was this low-budget horror film so bloody successful?! They are already making Saw 3 now. The cast had very little appeal to me in this film. Yes, it is shot in Toronto and I did recognized my friend Ho"Oyster" who played the cop and he just had two lines. I guess I am not really into this kind of nasty gore feast. I prefer horror films that have more intricate storyline and not "cutting up body parts kind of stuff". It's got a niche market and it works for that target audiences. I am not looking forward to see another Saw.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>In the original Saw, The Jigsaw Killer locked Dr. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell and chained there feet up in a murky bathroom with a dead guy in the middle of the room and the only way the can get out is to saw threw their feet..well, Elwes sawed threw his leg and the dead guy in the center just so happened to be the Jigsaw Killer. Now, in Saw 2, Det. Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher, Ransom) is on the case of the Jigsaw Man with Det. Dina Meyer (Stranger Than Fiction, Starship Troopers) and the swat team at his side as they finally capture the Jigsaw Killer, played by Tobin Bell (The Firm. Malice) who is dying of cancer. Wahlberg finds out that there are several people in a room locked up with no way out and they are breathing in a deadly nerve agent that destroys your insides and if they dont make it in time, solve the puzzles, then their all going to die. Once they escape the room, they go on a frantic spree around the house looking for ways to get out and Donnie Wahlberg is trying to get Jigsaw Killer to tell him where the people are because one of those people is his son. A perfect companion movie to the original Saw meshes well with it, notably towards the end. Wahlberg gets some credit for delivering a good performance and Tobin Bell is wonderfully creepy as The Jigsaw Killer. Fans of the first or really major horror buff fans will love the new traps that are set in the movie...with bloody effect...they love their blood those horror junkies. Some energy gets drained here and there but what keeps it alive is the ending. Also starring Franky G (The Italian Job, Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (South Central, Speed), Beverly Mitchell (Tv's 7th Heaven), Shawnee Smith (Tv's Becker), Eric Knudsen (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio), Tony Nappo (Land of the Dead, Four Brothers), Tim Burd (Resident EvilApocalypse) and Emmanuelle Vaugier (Cerberus).

The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed.  The ending of the movie was a complete joke.  Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her?  She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up.  Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them.  Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out.  Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote.  Nothing like that is explained.  I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl.  Finally give us some satisfaction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>In this sequel, we get to see more creatively twisted scenarios created by Jigsaw.  This time Jigsaw, played wonderfully by Tobin Bell, gets the cops by the balls when they come to capture him.  He is no longer able to flee and he has set up one of his finest and most brilliant "scenarios" elsewhere.<br /><br />We get to see much more of Jigsaw this time around, allowing us to get a true feel for what he is doing, and why.  We are granted insight into his personal situation and his frame of mind.  Jigsaw uses peoples' "dirty laundry" to entrap them and fuel their desire to live, as he did in the first.  He believes, given his experiences, that those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life.<br /><br />The movie is interesting, twisted and creative - and it follows up on the first movie very well.  You even get to briefly revisit the scene from the first movie, which was a great added touch.  The twist near the end of the movie is unexpected and clever.  I doubt that I would be as interested to see a third installment into the series, but this one was certainly solid.<br /><br />The bonus features are also quite interesting.  You get to see how Jigsaw's traps were created and put into action for the film.  There is also a cool featurette highlighting the props used in the movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended for horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Great sequel<br />I saw this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it!

I really enjoyed the first `Saw' film and just had the highest of hopes for the sequel.  I think that's why in the end it proved to be such a disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, when I walked out of the theater I was in heaven.  I loved what I had just seen.  It was gruesome, disturbing and to an extent quite scary.  After a second watch through though I realized that this film is so far below the original it's ridiculous.  The concept for this film is just too simple when compared to the original film.  The only similarity between the two is the villain and even that takes an unwarranted twist.  Yes, the final sequence was a head-scratcher but it couldn't hold a candle to the mastery that was the original `Saw' conclusion.<br /><br />The film centers again around mastermind Jigsaw as he sets up yet another elaborate trap, this time collecting a group of ex-convicts in an abandoned house filled with deadly gas with antidotes spread throughout the house.  In order for them to get these antidotes they must do some horrific things.  One of the victims is young Daniel Matthews whose father, Police Detective Eric Matthews, has captured Jigsaw and is trying desperately (and quite uncivilly) to force into giving up the houses location.<br /><br />Sadly `Saw II' becomes a showcase for gruesome deaths and disturbing sights over mental breakdown and mind bending horror.  I say `sadly' for a reason.  The original `Saw' was not all that gory.  Sure there were some bloody sequences and some disturbing events but for the most part `Saw' was a mental game, a mind tease if you will.  `Saw II' feels like a cop out almost.  It feels like any other slasher film and that is a disappointment since I expected so much more.<br /><br />There are some good things about this film, Tobin Bell for one who expands upon his original role as Jigsaw with some exceptional results, but story wise `Saw II' fails.  As far as the death scenes are concerned, sure they make you squirm and that's a plus right, and that pit of syringes still gets to me when I think about it, but all of this can't make up for the lack or originality.  It's dark, it's disturbing, it's gory and it's very uninspired.  I have yet to see the third and fourth `Saw' offerings mainly because this was such a let down.  I'm sure I'll get to the rest of the series to form my own opinions; hopefully they will be an improvement.<br /><br />The acting here is an improvement upon the original, well, at least some of it is.  Donnie Wahlberg (who could be brother Mark's twin I swear) has a much better grasp on his character than Cary Elwes did.  Shawnee Smith does decently here as does Erik Knudsen and of course Tobin Bell.  The rest of the cast is decent at best.  Franky G is horrific, Beverley Mitchell (from `Seventh Heaven'...what's she doing here?) is annoying as all get out and Tim Burd is just plain non-effective.  Emmanuelle Vaugier does little else but be really hot and Tony Nappo is gone too quickly to make much of an impact so that leaves Glenn Plummer to pick up the pieces and he does a decent but not too impressive a job.  Still, the acting is an improvement if you will.<br /><br />In the end I can't say much else then this was a major disappointment when compared to what it could have been but when you place it in the perspective of `most' (I say `most' because there are a select few horror films that truly are brilliant) horror films of late then this fits in the with pack as disturbing, gruesome and brainless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I viewed Saw II (I now refuse to say "saw" in connection with this series) immediately after watching Saw thanks to my buddy Matt, who bought both DVDs and then let me borrow them. With the first movie fresh in my mind, I slid the disc into my DVD player and held my breath.<br /><br />If Saw was a homage of Se7en, Saw II is a rip-off of Cube.  If you haven't seen Cube, here's the premise: total strangers wake up in a room.  The room is part of a larger structure that is really just an excuse to off the victims one by one with innovative death traps. Cube is one of my favorite movies, because the cube had its own internal logic.  It was an interesting, horrifying existential take on the best and worst of the human condition.<br /><br />Just like Cube, Saw II has the usual cast of characters: the slinky femme fatale (Addison, played by the gorgeous Emmanuelle Vaugier), the stressed out freak (Obi, played by Tim Burd), the neurotic schlub (always the first to die, who cares who plays him), the sweet-as-pie innocent (Laura, played by Beverley Mitchell), the young punk (Daniel, played by Erik Knudsen), the mole (Shawnee Smith reprising her role as Amanda), the leader (Jonas, played by Glenn Plummer) and last but not least the most important character of all: the psychopath (Xavier, played with hulking brutality by Franky G)!  That's right ladies and gentlemen, it's not just enough to put complete strangers in a room full of traps, it helps if you mix it up a bit by adding a slavering nutjob who isn't afraid to get through the traps by throwing other people into them.<br /><br />If Saw II sounds like a completely different film from the first, you're right.  According to IMDB, this WAS another film that was retooled as a sequel to Saw.  It shows.<br /><br />Interspersed between shots of the wacky Funhouse of Death is a psychological standoff between Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Daniel's father Eric, played by... Donnie Wahlberg! Curse you Wahlberg, was it not enough that you were a muttering bald man in Dreamcatcher?  Is there no end to the spread of your evil?<br /><br />Ahem.  Anyway, Wahlberg spits venom, knocks stuff over, and utterly fails to be convincing as a concerned father, a tough cop, or an actual menace to Jigsaw.  By the end of the movie, I felt pretty bad for `ole Jigsaw.  I mean, all the guy is trying to do is make an entertaining film by killing off a bunch of crooks.  Is that so bad?<br /><br />This film's traps are considerably more elaborate and the gore factor is definitely upped; enough that I was given pause while eating pizza (Will I never learn?  CURSE YOU WAHLBERG!).  The clever riddles that Jigsaw gives Detective Wahlberg are lost in the whip-snap camera shots, rendering the second plot more of a distraction than anything else.  The final twist is more of a cheat, but the real payoff is in knowing what happened to the characters from the first movie.<br /><br />In the end, this sequel can't possibly duplicate the taut thrills of Saw because it's actually two films awkwardly mashed together. And it has Wahlberg. Given the conclusion, perhaps we have finally seen the end of my arch nemesis.<br /><br />But I doubt it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>There are no surprises in this second Saw movie anymore. Again Jigsaw the Great has created a mysterious sadistic masterplan to have his victims appreciate their lives a bit more.

The movie pretty much follows the pattern of the first as people are kidnapped by the evil Jigsaw, in which he attempts to teach them not to take life for granted, albeit performed in a most inhumane and distorted way. There is blood, gore, yelling, screaming, and many plot twists that make "Saw 2" a worthy film to watch if your in the mood to be scared. In this movie a police officer's son is kidnapped by Jigsaw and it is heartbreaking to see the lengths in which a parent will go to save their son.<br /> Other sequels follwed "Saw 2" and most were huge boxoffice, but this and the original are the best in the "Saw" franchise. It seems that after the first two the plots became mundane and repetitive and 2009's version of "Saw", the last so far in the "Saw" films, was a boxoffice flop signalling perhaps the audience is tiring of Jigsaw and his demented actions.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This was a really good sequel! I like the S.W.A.T team scenes and the traps and twists! After bailing his son out, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is. If you love horror, Saw, and twists, you'll love SAW 2!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Saw 2 is a sequal that worked for the most part in my opinion.  It stays true to the Saw theme by still asking if you are grateful to be alive, and asking how much blood you are willing to shed to stay alive once you are in a life or death situation (or game, as Jigsaw calls it).  The games (or traps some may like to call them too) are more played out in this sequal, where as we only got to see glimpses in the first Saw.  The main scenario is on a larger scale, played out in an old house with a group of people, as compared to the two men in a large bathroom in the first movie.  A nice connection is made with the first movie (in addition to story elements) which brings some of the people into the same bathroom once again near the movie's end.  There is also that unexpected surprise to the story that made probably the biggest impact (in my opinion) with the first Saw.  Again, you couldn't quite see this one coming either, but it didn't have quite the satisfying and felt impact as the first Saw.<br /><br />Tobin Bell is Jigsaw, and gets a lot more screen time in Saw 2, we even actually see his face quite a bit.  More light is shed about who he is, where he's come from, and why he does what he does with these sick little games.  The man has a point, but the scenarios he creates are so brutal its nearly impossible to see it as fear and panic take over.  This is the case with detective Mathews (Donnie Whalberg) who is the main character in Saw 2, and whom the main game's focus is around.  You got a house full of young men and woman (including Mathews son) trying to stay alive, playing one brutal game after another, but the bigger picture is Mathews and the game he is playing right in front of Jigsaw.  The rules are laid out for Mathews, but they are so wrapped up in the fear and panic that it is impossible for him to see and that's when things begin to unfold and the surprise ending is told.<br /><br />While disturbing and difficult to watch at times, Saw 2 doesn't have quite the impact as the original.  There is plenty of blood, gore and violence, and one of the guys named Xavier (Franky G) becomes the scariest guy in the movie when he is driven to do whatever he feels he must to stay alive in that house.  There are more traps and possible the most frightening was the very first of the movie, even before things get rolling we see a man who has had the key to unlocking his trap surgically inserted under his eye.  He has 60 seconds to dig it out with a little knife.  Not a very bloody scene at all, but just the thought of what must be done to survive is gut wrenching enough.  On a good note, things move along in Saw 2, going from one trap/test to the next, while the first Saw was a bit more laid back, with the two men in the bathroom talking things out in grave details and referring to flashbacks to piece the puzzle together, however I believe it was those moments that created more tension and fright when the bloodshed and panic occured, resulting in more of a felt impact in regard to those in Saw 2.<br /><br />Saw 2 works for what it is, by carrying on the Saw theme, expanding on the scenarios (and some gore if that's your thing) and exploring Jigsaw's background a little more.  I don't think it's quite as sharp as the original, but it improves in various areas and falls in others.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Horror/Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>What makes saw scarier and a better film than what's being released today is that it threatens more than your body; it threatens your mind too. What seems to scare people more than fake scary movies or make believe characters are people that are real and stories that feel even realer. In Saw it feels more possible for this to be done and this creates more fear and more thinking than you would get from a traditional scary movie. If you ask me Saw 2 is just as good as the first with the same intelligent but sadistic games. It's so good that you even start to get the message that trying to be passed by Jigsaw. In this one some of your questions are answered like what happened to the guys left in the room at the end of the last film and what will happen when Jigsaw's time is up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>The evil "jigsaw" is back for another round of mayhem and torture in this fine sequel to the first "Saw"  Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is investigating a recent homicide when he discovers that the victim has a jigsaw shaped piece of skin removed.  That left no question in his mind who was behind the killings: Jigsaw himself.  At first, Matthews is reluctant to get involved in the jigsaw case, but with a little prodding from his partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) and a sudden realization on his part, Eric finds out where Jigsaw is hiding out and moves in for the capture.<br /><br />However, unknown to Eric and Kerry, capture was part of Jigsaw's plan.  He has captured eight more unsuspecting hostages and locked them in a house which is slowly being contaminated by poison gas.  To make matters worse, one of the intended victims is Eric's own son Daniel (Erik Knudsen).  All of the hostages have one thing in common; they were all set up by Detective Matthews in order for him to gain a conviction.<br /><br />Jigsaw has supposedly hid vials of antedote throughout the house which will counter-act the effects of the poison, but there are other clues as well.  Each person has a number drawn on the back of their necks.  These numbers form a combination to a safe which contains the antedote.  It soon becomes apparent that the only way the hostages will survive is to work together, but that idea soon goes out the window, and everyone is looking out for themselves and not worrying about anyone else.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jigsaw and Detective Matthews have begun an interesting interaction of their own.  Jigsaw practically tells Matthews the location of his son at the beginning of their conversation, but Matthews, in his rage, misses the clues.  Soon, Matthews loses all of his patience and unleashes his own attack on Jigsaw.  Will Detective Matthews find his son before its too late?<br /><br />I thought the first movie was good, but this one is even better.  The plot of this movie is excellent, and the high point of the film is its surprise ending.  It will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is very good, and the twists and turns will keep you glued to the screen.  This movie is a must for horror movie fans and people who saw the first film.  Watch this great sequel; you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Darren Lynn Bousman's 'SAW II' is without a doubt one of the best sequel's in horror movie history! You can officially add 'SAW II' to the short line of excellent horror movie sequel's such as 'Halloween 2''Friday the 13th part 2''Evil Dead 2''Aliens' & ofcourse the more recent 'The Devil's Rejects' While not quite the masterpiece that part 1 is,it's pretty damn close & yes there is plenty of blood. The very beginning of this flick is disturbingly great!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>"Saw II" slaps us on the torture rack, then tightens the screws until every last gasp, shiver and shriek has been squeezed right out of us.<br /><br />Just when we think we've endured enough cruel and unusual punishment, director and co-writer Darren Lynn Bousman takes it up a notch with the zeal of a modern-day Marquis de Sade.<br /><br />That this first-time director performs this evisceration of our nerves, and does it so well, will likely touch off even more concerns about the extreme violence in today's movies. As it should, really.<br /><br />But, for the tough-as-Leatherface horror crowd who want to be bruised and battered by their entertainment, "Saw II" represents a cut above in the genre.<br /><br />The sequel to last year's sleeper Halloween hit wastes no time reintroducing us to the grisly handiwork of Jigsaw, a terminally ill serial killer hell-bent on testing people who have made messes of their lives.<br /><br />In the first "Saw," Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell played two unlucky guys who wake up to find themselves chained in a dirty subterranean room, with a saw as their only means of escape. The scrappy first film had an estimated budget of $1.2 million, and went on to make more than $55 million during its theatrical run. It's been reviled, praised and rabidly discussed on the Internet.<br /><br />"Saw" had a shocker of an ending, an original villain and a delightful scream-queen performance from used-to-be golden boy Elwes ("The Princess Bride").<br /><br />In the sequel, conceived right after the first struck a box-office jugular, the cheap thrills remain, but the surprises are mostly gone. There are a few good twists in "Saw II," but none that rivals the pop-up corpse shocker from the original.<br /><br />As in the original, Jigsaw uses a puppet as an alter ego to let the cops know why he's punishing sinners unappreciative of what life has given them. A warped medieval mentality runs homicidally through "Saw II" as "screw-ups" are flambeed, thrown into a pit of hypodermic needles and clubbed on the head with a spiked bat.<br /><br />For the sequel, Bousman and co-writer Whannell up the body count, stranding eight victims in a booby-trapped house that looks like Freddy Krueger was its interior decorator. The eight must figure out how to get at an antidote before poison gas pumped into the vents does them in. Among those trapped inside is the son of a burnt-out detective, Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg of the defunct "Boomtown" TV show).<br /><br />Of the new victims, the quick-fused Franky G. gives the meanest and most capable performance. Others seem to be standard horror bait.<br /><br />"Saw II" is a tighter, more focused film than its predecessor. But even though this sequel is well-made, it lacks the over-the-top campiness of the first movie.<br /><br />What "Saw II" needs is a wailing and moaning Elwes to make us snicker when the bloodletting is just too much to handle. In "Saw II," everyone is deadly serious about the carnage, which makes the film effective, but also unshakably disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>In 2004 actor-writer Leigh Whannel and firsttime director James Wan released a low-budget horror-thriller called Saw. The film made decent box-office and soon a sequel was greenlighted to take advantage of the new franchise while horror movies were hot. This time around Whannel has a different newcomer to direct Saw II. Darren Lynn Bousman was tapped to make sense of Leigh Whannel's script for the sequel. Once again, Whannel's talent in writing credible and non-cheesy dialogue is average at best and pretty so-so most of the time. The acting was serviceable and pretty decent for a horror flick. Most of the time acting's usually not the highest of priorities in such films. As long as the actors show a decent amount of talent on the screen then everything else they do is gravy.<br /><br />Once more the film takes the premise of a sort of demented gamemaster calling himself Jigsaw (again Tobin Bell plays the role with relish and aplomb) who takes individuals he's deemed as not worthy of the lives their leading and puts them in complex and demented games where there's only two options: live or die and the choice is up always up to the contestant. This time around Jigsaw has chosen eight people who at first has nothing in common with each other but as the story moves forward one thing ties them all together. A slow-acting nerve gas has been seeping into their boarded up room and they have two hours to solve puzzles that will give them acess to the antidote needed to counteract the nerve-agent. The twist this time around is that each puzzle also has a trap attached to it and sometimes solving the puzzle means having to shed blood. Blood that is either the participants or a bystander's. The gruesome traps range from hidden blades in glass boxes, an industrial furnace, a pit of used needles, etc... The pit of needles still give chills whenever I think about it.<br /><br />To add to this maze of traps and puzzles, Jigsaw also involves an outside character played by Donnie Wahlberg. Wahlberg's character is a burnt-out cop who has everything to lose if he doesn't play Jigsaw's game and his choice on how to play the game results in a twist at the end that wasn't easily seen and predicted. The twist in the end of Saw II was cleverly pulled off and added more to the demented genius that the Jigsaw character gives off. This character is fast joining the classic ranks of horror villains like Hannibal Lecter, Freddie, Michael Myers and Jason. I actually think he's one-upped the character of John Doe from Fincher's Seven. It helps that Tobin Bell has again put in another chilling performance as Jigsaw.<br /><br />Saw II delivers on everything that the first film had and improves on it with better pacing and tighter direction from Darren Lynn Bousman. With a bigger budget and more space to work with (an entire two story house instead of a single showerroom), Saw II added more action in addition to ramping up the disturbing scens of gore and deaths. Each death doesn't have the carnival glee that the Final Destination films have. Instead each death is meant to disturb and induce cringes and winces from its audience. The clever ending leaves for a second sequel to be made and I for one wouldn't mind visiting with Jigsaw and company one more time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>As true to the horror genre as the first 'SAW', 'SAW II' brings us back to the bloody depths of Jigsaw's intriguing games and puzzles, where blood is the price you pay for not playing by the rules.  I am as pleased with this sequel as I was with the original, bringing blood and horror back to horror where it belongs.  Hopefully, 'SAW III' will rise from the ashes of this grisly phoenix to entertain horror aficionados again.<br /><br />Detective Eric Matthews has cornered and caught John (Tobin Bell) the jigsaw killer.  Or has he?  When John tells Matthews another game is in progress, and shows Matthews footage that his son has been recruited for the game, Matthews is forced into Jigsaw's nightmare of trying to unravel the clues.<br /><br />The trap?  Several people are locked inside a dilapidated old house.  (The atmosphere of the house is sinister and disturbing, but not as filthy as the bathroom in the original.)  The doors to the house will open in three hours, but the players are already breathing in a poison gas that will kill them within two hours.  The players include Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudson) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who previously escaped one of Jigsaw's traps and is forced to play again.  John's tape informs them that there are antidotes hidden throughout the house, one of which is in the safe in the middle of the room they are in.  He tells them they all possess the combination to the safe; that the numbers are in the back of their mind.  Once they figure out what they all have in common, they will know why they are there.  X marks the spot (again).  Let the game begin.<br /><br />Amanda tries to warn her fellow players that she has dealt with Jigsaw's traps before, and that they must follow the rules, but the fear of death and the clash of personalities have the players all running for their own lives.  Needless to say, the house has many lovely traps awaiting our game-players.  We get to observe not only the players desperate struggle to survive, but witness Detective Matthews degeneration into his own madness as he struggles with John's mental games in order to save his son's life.<br /><br />Without the 'whodunit' value of the original 'SAW', the surprise in 'SAW II' comes strictly from the clues of the game, not a 'whodunit' but 'what was the most important clue'?  It is still a puzzle for the viewer to solve, and I will go no further on revealing any hints.  Suffice to say, pay attention, and get ready to be shocked, stunned, grossed out, and gagging with exquisite horror and delight as the blood begins to flow.  Watch for the peek at the original bathroom.<br /><br />I must add, I have never felt so drawn to a psychopathic killer in my life as I am to John.  I would kiss Jigsaw's cancer-withered lips and toes if I could find him.  I just hope he doesn't find me first.<br /><br />One more quick note.  When I saw Donnie Wahlberg in 'The Sixth Sense', I wondered how an awful ex-pop singer (the word singer used loosely) could turn into such a great actor.  While his performance in 'The Sixth Sense' was superior, he plays his role as Detective Matthews quite skillfully.  Kudos also to Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.<br /><br />If you loved 'SAW', you are going to love 'SAW II'.  If you love blood, guts, building terror, violent deaths, desperately selfish personalities, and cunning killers, this movie is for you.  Definitely a 'buy', 10 stars.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Although the "Saw" series is billed as horror, it's more accurately described as torture porn with at least half a brain.  There's very little in any of the movies that can be called scary, but there is a lot of screaming, a lot of blood, and a lot of clever deaths.  Obviously there are folks who like that sort of thing, and who are willing to suspend a lot of disbelief in order to enjoy it.<br /><br />The pale and pendulous Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw for this second installment with a brand-new velvet cape and a much meatier role.  He's still riddled with cancer, weaker than ever, but still capable of designing and building complex doomsday devices that appear inspired by equal parts Edward Gorey and Rube Goldberg.  Also, the man seems to have some serious connections in both real estate (how many houses does this guy own?) and toxic gas.<br /><br />Said gas is lethal but takes an hour to work its deadly magic (more or less).  It is being pumped into a multiply booby-trapped house in which eight people are trapped, told via Jigsaw's ponderous voice that antidotes to the nerve agent can be found by enduring a series of tests.  Meanwhile, Jigsaw plays a more personal game with a cop (Donnie Wahlberg), whose son, Daniel, is one of the prisoners in the Mansion O' Macabre.<br /><br />Tobin shows enough restraint to make Jigsaw a sympathetically evil man, but the other actors don't fare quite as well.  This is in keeping with the first film, which cared less about proper acting than it did about its harsh, flourescent stage.  The people in the house scream and fight and utter silly dialogue.  Donnie Wahlberg moans and emotes for his son.  Jigsaw parcels out his trademark bon mots about life, and preciousness, and how much better water tastes when you're about to die.<br /><br />I'm not going to test his theory.  I suspect it might be true, but that's not really the point of the movie, no matter how much Jigsaw tries to cram it down our throats.  The point is, obviously, the games that Jigsaw sets up.  In that sense, this sequel is actually better than the original; it's no more or less frightening, but it is much smarter, and it moves with a well-oiled precision.  The "Saw" movies, with their elaborate endgames and their gritty platitudes, will never really scare viewers, but they do give the prurient and the voyeuristic something raw and meaty to chew on.  In a world where it's vastly more entertaining to watch someone lose than it is to watch them win, that means bad news for Jigsaw's victims, but good news for "Saw II."</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Fear of death has overrun society, as fear provides the primal motivating factor to keep people alive.  A notion that Saw (2004) once capitalized on through the evil contraptions that the psychopathic mastermind Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) created to muse himself over innocent people's desire to live.  Jigsaw forced his victims to a rude awakening where his victims learned how and when they would die, unless they acted without hesitation.  Many of the psychopath's devices focused on gruesome self-mutilation that had a clear connection with the victim's character and past.  For Jigsaw, it is a game where he forces his victims to take the test of survival, and if they fail - they die!<br /><br />The sequel opens in a similar fashion under the cutting light of a naked light bulb where a man awakens undressed with a brutally looking device strapped to his neck and shoulders.  It is clear that the victim is not completely without sin, as he is a police informant.  In order to survive the contraption's bear trap consequence he must obtain a key behind his own eye.  There is an obvious presence of sadistic cruelty, as the man feebly attempts to find a solution to the problem before him.  The resolve of the situation assures the audience that more gruesomeness and terrorizing horror will emerge within the next hour and a half, as the viewer is to experience a fear-inducing sequel with more of Jigsaw's ruthless games.<br /><br />Unlike the films predecessor, Saw II does not attempt to hide Jigsaw's identity.  Instead, he seems to intentionally seek the law enforcement to apprehend him.  In particular Detective Matthews' (Donnie Walhberg) whom Jigsaw singles out through the message "Look closer Detective Matthews."  Quickly, Det. Matthews understands the clues, which leads them to an abandon factory where Jigsaw awaits.  Together with Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) who leads the investigation, Matthews enters the factory with a S.W.A.T. team and after some blood-spattered predicament finds Jigsaw calmly inhaling oxygen through his oxygen mask.<br /><br />At first, one must sense that it is a trap, and it is, as Jigsaw has kidnapped Matthews's son along with eight other shady characters.  These nine individuals are locked up in a house of unknown location where they have been breathing a highly toxic nerve agent that will begin to dissolve their bodies into bleeding mess of flesh.  In a time when the American people fear terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction the concept will undoubtedly enhance the suspense.  However, if additional thought is placed on the concept of the nerve gas, it also provides a huge plot hole. It is not like people can buy nerve gas at the street corner, and it makes it a little amusing that Jigsaw is able to find it.  In addition, nerve gas does not, as far as I know, produce symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.  But, if the audience is willing to see beyond this slightly distorted reality, then Saw II will bring a terrorizing experience.  All Matthews can do is watch his son and the others slowly being decimated by Jigsaw's little games within the game.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jigsaw insists to talk with Matthews, as he enlightens Matthews that he must play by his rules if he wants his son alive.  It is with a great deal of irony that Jigsaw has planned this meeting with Matthews, as the detective often plays by his own rules when he arrests suspects.  Besides planning his own capture, Jigsaw has one final triumph up his sleeve, which he plays with brutal refinement when time runs short.<br /><br />The film possesses disturbing imagery of torture, murder, and other unsettling themes that are presented through Jigsaw's meticulous planning.  The cinematography helps to enhance the dark and agonizing atmosphere through the green camera filter.  In addition, the lighting of the scenes provides additional atmospheric elements that heighten the terror.  Special effects also provide a large bulk of the gruesomeness within the story.  Together with the fundamental concept stemming from the fear of death these visual aspects succeeds in bring forth a traumatic experience.  One of the negative aspects of the film rests within the characters that are portrayed in a too stereotypical perspective and they lack a complex psychology.  The film could also exploit the possibilities of a more profound meaning of why people fear death, which might have augmented the element of horror within the film.  Yet, the overall cinematic experience brings the audience into a disturbing world where horror and terror work very well and leave the audience truly frightened.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Running Time: 92 mins.<br /> You should see the first film, SAW (2004), first to understand this second film, however, SAW II (2005) is a great movie to start with too.<br /> Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer return.<br /> This sequel is an excellent companion piece to the first movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLC">Saw [Blu-ray</a>] (2004), and I will not reveal any of the twists and surprises in this movie, but it is another mind blower. In my opinion, SAW II is the best in the film series.<br />  At the opening of the Twisted Pictures production, we see Michael (Noam Jenkins) wearing an opened iron face mask contraption and he must obey the order of the Jigsaw Killer.  He has only a small amount of time to find the key that will set him free and alive. If he doesn't "retrieve" the key, the iron mask will close on his face and kill him.<br />  Cop, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) must bail out his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from jail. He is tired of dealing with his son's behavior and is so stressed out, he wants him to live somewhere else. Matthews must answer to a call of a homicide. The Jigsaw Killer has struck again. He comes face to face with the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) and Matthews and his team find themselves under timed pressure.<br />  Eight people (Shawnee Smith, Franky G., Erik Knudsen, Emmanuell Vaugier, Beverley Mitchell, Glenn Plummer, Timothy Burd, Tony Nappo) are locked in a room somewhere in town. They must find them because Matthew's son is also trapped in that room and time is running out.<br /><br />  That is just the start of this film. Memorable, shocking scenes you will never forget.<br /> Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G. really are interesting in this film.  They both give strong performances.<br /><br /> I wonder if this role by Donnie Wahlberg helped him get noticed for the role of "Danny Reagan" in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UD7JC6">Blue Bloods: The First Season</a> tv series.<br /><br /> Producer, Gregg Hoffman died December 4, 2005.

I accepted the challenge, failed to get the twist but loved the film. Since then I have avoided watching any other films in the series, the feedback from others not being the most positive and I didn't want to taint the positive experience of the original. However, courtesy of my line manager I was given the box set of Saw 1-4 to tackle and decided it was time to be brave and see how good the sequels are.<br /><br />Saw 2 sees the return of the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) whose latest headquarters are infiltrated by the police led by Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). Detective Matthews finds himself caught in one of Jigsaw's games when the police find TV screens monitoring a house where eight people, including Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) are trapped. Jigsaw informs Detective Matthews that he will see his son safe but only if the two are allowed to talk for a while. In the house the group of eight are given instructions from Jigsaw that the exit will open in 3 hours but poison gas is entering the house which will kill them in 2 hours unless they can obtain antidotes, the rewards for successfully completing Jigsaw's cruel games which can be found in many of the rooms. The film veers between Detective Matthews and Jigsaw and the people trapped in the house as the time ticks away leaving us to wonder who will survive and what the masterful Jigsaw has got up his sleeve.<br /><br />Saw 2 begins brutally with a police informant in the midst of one of Jigsaw's games. He finds a contraption attacked to his neck, akin to a Venus flytrap which Jigsaw insists will snap shut with the spikes causing instant death unless the victim can unlock the device with a key. As with all Jigsaw's games nothing is straightforward and our victim realises the key has been placed behind one of his eyes and he will need to remove it in order to get the key and escape the game. Hesitation proves deadly as the device quickly snaps shut on the victim's head! This is just the first of the many games we are shown devised by Jigsaw. The brutality and gore in the film supersede the original which although unpleasant in places still managed to leave some elements to the imagination. A violent film doesn't alienate me if the plot is good but I often find suspense is much better than trying to be as gory as possible and the implication of something horrible can be more effective than actually seeing it. Among the other games Jigsaw has prepared are retrieving antidotes from a furnace and from a pit filled with hypodermic needles! Nice.<br /><br />I did find the plot to Saw 2 quite intriguing. Having enjoyed the way Jigsaw was one step ahead of everyone in the first film I didn't believe for one minute that he had been caught unawares when the police gatecrash his home at the start. His victims are generally ones who are something of a disgrace to society and as the plot unfolds we learn that Detective Matthews is not opposed to corruption and that the group of people in the house, save Daniel, are all criminals framed and imprisoned by the Detective. A clue waits in the house that will explain to the group how they are all connected and that amongst them is the son of the Detective that wrongly sent them to prison. A further complication is the presence of Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) the only victim to ever survive one of Jigsaw's games, as seen in the first film, but now finds herself at his mercy once again. While Detective Matthews appeases Jigsaw by engaging him in conversation, the police desperately try to find the source of the live feed leading to the house and hope the eight trapped people are still alive when they have discovered their location.<br /><br />Sadly, my fears about sequels in this series were realised as I did find some issues with Saw 2. Though the plot was intriguing it couldn't really match up to the excellence of the first film. The original Saw did have many characters in it but the focus was largely between Dr Gordon and Adam who developed as characters throughout. While Saw 2 has Detective Matthews and Jigsaw engaged in some in-depth conversations, there are simply too many characters in the house for such a short film to really get to grips with. They became mere numbers to me with only Daniel and Amanda being worth any focus. A smaller group would have been more engaging and I found myself wanting their numbers to be whittled down quickly so we could get to the inevitable twist at the end. Thankfully, this is worth waiting for but again it was always going to be nigh on impossible to top the original so I can't really criticise on this point. Jigsaw's games seemed designed to push the boundaries of goriness far beyond the cruel games of the first film but I found myself longing for some of the simplicity found in the original.<br /><br />Saw 2 falls short of the highs of the first film in the series despite a plot that is intriguing at times. Too many characters hindered the storyline in the house but the twist at the end is worth what is a short wait. With too much focus on gore I think the ingredients that made the first film so good have sadly been lost here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I like this one more than the original, cause unlike saw where after you watch out the first time it loses its suspense, this one after you watch it, you can watch it again and  again even though you know what's going to happen and it will still make you cringe. The needle pit it the one that really got to me. If you are a fan of horror movies you have to check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I was highly skeptical going into this film, but the tight plot, excellent writing and taut suspense completely won me over. If you liked the first Saw, or enjoy crime thrillers with a horror twist... you will like this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Saw II started life with a number of disadvantages. The originality of Saw pretty much guarantees that Saw II will be a letdown, if only because the most interesting twists have already been run. We know why Jigsaw does what he does. Even the twist ending isn't much of a twist, given the first one. Working out the connections between the players in his game is easier and less surprising because we're expecting connections.<br /><br />The connections are many, and new ones abound. Almost all of the players (with the exception of the detective father of one of the hostages) have been placed in a sealed house. They must solve a series of puzzles to survive, each one highlighting the sins of one or another of the victims. A room filled with dirty syringes faces an addict who spends her days shooting up with similar paraphenalia. The hot-head control freak must learn to resist the obvious red herrings.<br /><br />As hard as it would be to follow Saw, the fault lies with the filmmakers, too (their first mistake being trying to make a sequel, one that the director of the first movie, James Wan, didn't make). The puzzles are more interesting than the characters, and solving them is more the focus than the horrors they reveal. The first Saw forced us closer and closer to the characters, each secret revealed making our own sins more and more apparent. We were voyeurs looking in the mirror, to paraphrase Jigsaw. But here we are distanced from the victims; they're easy to dislike and dismiss--which would put us directly in Jigsaw's sights, but we don't really care because we really don't feel that they are us.<br /><br />It was a mistake, too, to give Jigsaw so much camera time. The more we see, the less mysterious and menacing he becomes. In the original, Jigsaw was a god-like enigma; in Saw II, he comes off as more sadistic and petty than profound and powerful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 7:56 Mins<br /><br /></span></p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>Following where the original started, "Saw 2" is an excellent follow-up to the smash hit that started the franchise. And like the original, this movie manages to blend its police-story crime elements with the suspense of a thriller and the tension and graphic content of horror.<br />By now, Jigsaw is taken into custody and being interviewed by the police, all while a new group of his victims are locked in a house and must find a way out before time runs out and they meet their death. Sounds interesting, right? Well if it sounds good, seeing it will take it to another level entirely, as the dirty fingers and chipped nails on the front cover suggest.<br />In comparison to the first "Saw", this movie is more graphic, gory and twisted. The small fire chamber, the needle pit and the wrist-cutting puzzle box all make up some gruesome scenes that really show you what a great horror movie can do. I'm sure at least one of those scenes, or others, will have you squirming! For me personally, it was the fire chamber scene that left me shuddering.<br />Also, while the original "Saw" had a great, dirty look to it, especially something in the use of the camerawork, this one takes it up again! While the original did have a gritty, raw feel to it, as opposed to polished camerawork of say, a foreign horror film, "Saw 2" gives the original a run for its money in that field.<br />In "Saw 2", the camerawork gets even rawer and grittier, giving it the shaky feel you may see when you're in a nightmare. There are some moments where, dare I say, it almost has a psuedo-snuff feel to it, much like the underground film series "August Underground". Dear Lord, I'll save that for another day!<br />But anyway, "Saw 2" is still able to find a genius balance between a smart police story and a gritty torture-thriller display. I really give the writers of this film credit, because not too many films can have that dual-personality medium and pull it off so well.<br />Well, that about wraps up this review. If you wanna watch "Saw 2", I might recommend you watch the original "Saw" before, just so you can understand what's going on. Hey, make it a double feature! Anyway, if you liked the original, or want to watch a "Saw" film, you'll love this! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a good piece of horror with some great & gruesome traps in it. There are a quite a few very effective setpieces and some really twisted games involving some truly unpleasant characters. It's a worthy sequel and worth watching for any horror fan.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After amassing an excellent box office return with the smash horror hit "Saw" in 2004, Lionsgate Films released the inevitable sequel "Saw 2" just one year later in hopes of maximizing their returns by riding the coattails of the first film's success. With a mostly new cast consisting of fairly talented, yet not so well known actors, such as, Donnie Wahlberg ("Ransom"), Emmanuelle Vaugier (TV's "Smallville"), and Beverly Mitchell (TV's "7th Heaven") acting alongside returning members from the first film, Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, I for one was unsure whether this would be a horror sequel worthy of being watched or yet another inferior sequel in a line that is far too long to begin with.<br /><br />"Saw 2" picks up shortly after the events of the first film, as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the madman from the first movie has returned with a new set of games to play and traps to set. When Jigsaw's newest victim is purposely left in the open to be discovered by the police, lead detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) traces the crime back to its perpetrator with relative ease. With Jigsaw being caught, what would seem to most people to be a massive set back to his plans, is merely just another aspect of the game that he has carefully set into motion. As the detectives desperately try to break Jigsaw, eight new victims are trapped and fighting for their very lives. With time running out the choice faced by all involved can easily be summed up by Jigsaw's cryptic motto, "Live or die, make your choice."<br /><br />Here's the thing with "Saw 2", it's kind of a mixed bag in terms of my take on the movie. On one hand I thought it was a very solid, and in some ways surprising follow up film to one of the most original horror films I had ever seen. On the other hand, certain aspects to the film felt somewhat standard and by the book, and featured characters that were not nearly as interesting as those in the first film.<br /><br />I thought that as far as the story for this installment goes it was just as interesting, and even a little more in depth than the first one. This chapter in the 'Saw' saga gave viewers more of an insight into what pushes Jigsaw to do what he does and how he rationalizes it all. This element of the story was surprising because I expected it to make me feel somewhat sorry for him, which I would not have liked at all, but instead it makes you realize just how extremely disturbed he truly is, because his reasons are purely insane. This approach was a surprise for me, and one that I appreciated from the writers (Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman) because they opted not to attempt to gain sympathy from the audience towards Jigsaw, but instead chose to show him as a normal human being at one point in his life, who snaps and begins this insane quest to teach others to appreciate life. What a novel concept for a writer to try, for once lets try to keep the villain despicable throughout the series, rather than make him a likable guy who is just misunderstood or has been led astray.<br /><br />The cast, as I stated earlier, is not as well known as the first film's, but is still decent all the same. Donnie Wahlberg is a better lead than Cary Elwes, and his character was far more interesting due to his somewhat corrupt nature, and his link to the eight victims trapped by Jigsaw made for interesting drama as the plot unfolded. The various members of the cast that comprised the eight trapped characters were adequate; some of them gave solid, believable performances, while others just gave audiences typical horror movie throwaway characters that the audience could care less about. Tobin Bell was featured much more heavily in this film than he had in the previous, and he is allowed to give more depth to Jigsaw this time around, and he does a wonderful job of portraying the two time periods of the character's life that are depicted in the film. In the flashbacks we see him when he was known simply as John, a normal man who is given horrible news, the fact that he has cancer. This news shakes him to his very core, and serves as the catalyst to his downward spiral into insanity. Then we see him throughout the rest of the movie as the evil, manipulative Jigsaw; the way Tobin plays the two sides of the same person so drastically different is a great showcase of his acting talent.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with "Saw 2" was the fact that some of the characters featured in this movie were just flat-out unlikable, and yet these were the ones we should have been rooting for to survive to the end of the film. However, for many of them I didn't really care if they succumbed to Jigsaw's maniacal plans. Now, I'm well aware that some of the eight soon-to-be victims were designed to be as unlikable as possible, but to me for a horror movie to truly work, each and every character that is being pursued by the killer should have at least some redeeming qualities so the audience can feel some sense of loss when they are killed by the killer, this isn't the case with "Saw 2". At least half of the eight people trapped are some form of despicable criminal, who I felt deserved punishment, maybe not the kind as severe as Jigsaw had set, but I still didn't feel too bad when their time came. What made the first film work somewhat better than this one was that the characters, though flawed, were still likable and people the audience could root for to survive through to the end. If "Saw 2" would have taken this approach a little more then the movie would have been just as good as the first.<br /><br />The traps, which are the focus of this series of films, are just as innovative and original as the first one. But, some of the setups for the traps relied heavily on the characters being stupid enough to fall for them, which of course they did. Where the first one had the traps being forced upon the victims, this one seemed like each trap being sprung was purely coincidence, that there wasn't as much planning on Jigsaw's part to force the character's to fall prey to his deadly machinations. "Saw 2" also used the traps to focus more on bloodshed and gore than the first film did, where the director of the original movie, James Wan (who opted not to return for some reason), didn't rely on as much gore to scare the audience, the new director Darren Lynn Bousman (who also co-wrote the film) went for less of an eerie atmosphere and more for blood and gore, which is the more typical horror movie route, and also served to bring this installment down some by not being as original.<br /><br />"Saw 2" is an effective sequel to one of the most original horror movies of all time. However, a little too much reliance on convenience in places, along with too many unlikable characters denied this movie from meeting the standards set forth by the first film. Even though I have more gripes with this installment than I did the first one, it is still a superior horror movie compared to most horror sequels or just horror films in general that are released these days.<br /><br />"Saw 2" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I  have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the 3 (I haven't seen 4 yet).<br /><br />Traps include: death mask aka venus head trap; needle pit;wrist slasher;body oven, peep hole eye pistol.<br /><br />Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the "the traps of Jigsaw" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary.<br /><br />There is a "making of". You'll be better off renting this one. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.<br /><br />This one is more psychological and the torture traps/rigs are awesome. The SFX team a cool job. Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened. saw2 has a cool ending. I won't say more than that. This movie brings together a group of ppl caught in a house. 2 leads the movie into 3. Its almost 2 episodes. 3 can't be seen without seeing 2 first else you will get totally confused. Same with 2. If you haven't seen 1 don't see this one. The set from saw 1 is back: the famous toilet set with the infamous ankle piece has been left over (cut in saw1 to escape from the leg chain) features here. "Ohh yes there will be blood" he said. And you know what, he delivers on his promise.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br></body></html>

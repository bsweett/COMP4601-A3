Bullock films tend to be either a hit or miss, more often miss, so it's understandable to be stunned when one catches you by surprise.  For the longest time, I kept hearing people question how they owned the same dog and to those I say "pay attention to the movie"-it explains Alex leaving the dog with Morgan and Morgan then giving the dog to his then girlfriend, Kate.  Reeves, a mediocre actor who has either the best agent in the world or a keen sense for winning scripts, gives a performance reminisant of "A Walk in the Cloud" and the results are just as sweet.  I was confused to how the bus incident could happen and upon second viewing, I realize that she couldn't save him until 2008 so then it all made sense and it's a definite winner in my book.  Highly, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>"The Lake House" pairs up Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since "Speed" in what turns out to be a very watchable but unconventional romance.<br /><br />Bullock plays Doctor Kay Forster, who is departing a unique glass cottage on a lake to return to Chicago.  She leaves a note for the next tenant, architect and builder Alex Wyler, played by Reeves.  The two fall into an exchange of letters and it soon becomes apparent, with several humorous touches, that Alex is in the cottage in 2004, while somehow Kay is living in 2006.  The singularity of a time-traveling mailbox outside the cottage is never explained; viewers are advised to accept it as a necessary plot contrivance.  Alex and Kay discover the time difference in an hilarious scene in which the two stand in the same place two years apart, reading and writing a series of notes that are essentially being passed back and forth through the mailbox.<br /><br />The correspondence across time brings two lonely but compatible people together.  Their slowly blossoming romance is complicated in a interesting way by the time difference.  Alex actually has a couple of contacts with the 2004 Kay, who knows nothing yet of Alex or the Lake House and is involved with an obnoxious and disposable boyfriend.  A scene in which the 2006 Kay asks Alex to retrieve a book she lost in 2004 is nicely done; Alex's ultimately successful effort to return the book helps cement their relationship.<br /><br />The desire of the 2004 Alex and the 2006 Kay to meet face to face begins to drive the story.  A date with Kay arranged two years in advance by Alex fails, heartbreakingly, when Alex fails to appear.  At this point, a fatal accident that Kay witnessed at the start of her medical residency in 2004 begins to overshadow the story.  Kay must use her knowledge of the future to somehow change the past.  The dramatic ending of the movie makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />The Glass House on the lake is a fascinating structure in and of itself; unfortunately, we never get a really good look at it.  Christopher Plummer has an outstanding cameo as Alex's father, a famous architect who built the Glass House before essentially abandoning his family.  Shohreh Aghdashloo is outstanding as Kay's medical mentor, who in one of several loop-backs in the movie also treats Alex's dying father.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to viewers looking for a romantic movie featuring two leads with real onscreen chemistry; those who obsess over the time-traveling wrinkles of the plot are likely to miss the best of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>Of course the movie is well written. It'd be disappointing if a Pulitzer winning writer couldn't pen a decent film. The written word is brought to life by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, two people who have a quiet and mesmerizing way of delivering their lines. You feel like you're part of something truly magical (to not sound completely corny!) because the premise of the movie is itself shrouded in mysticism. How is it that the little flag of the mailbox moves up and down by itself? Or that the two main characters have the same dog? And with the lakehouse as the backdrop, well, you can't beat that.<br /><br />Bullock plays Kate, a woman living in 2006, who has just begun a new job and moved out of the lakehouse into an apartment. She leaves a letter at the lakehouse for the new tennant. But who should receive this letter other than Alex, a man who is living in the lakehouse in 2004. They begin a letter-writing courtship, questioning the possibilities of how something so strange and wonderful can be happening and whether or not they can manipulate time in order for them to one day be together. While it seems easy enough (all she has to do is tell him to meet her in two years at so and so location), time and circumstances are not always on their side.<br /><br />The big question is will they or won't they, and of course, I cannot reveal this. What kind of reviewer would I be?! All I can say is that lovers of romantic comedies should not miss out, nor should fans of the written word. It's important to forget the space/time paradoxes and simply enjoy the movie, which is certainly not hard to do at all. Bullock and Reeves make that extremely easy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>why does a film like this that almost makes no sense at all get such good reviews? I guess  that part is not factored in or people have not seen enough films. Well, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again worked well together and did a great job in this film. So she's in 2006 and he's in 2004 and they keep trying to meet. Thought what they do keep impacting each others lifes and they send letters to each other through the mailbox at the lakehouse which he is living in at the moment. It's confusing but if you do what others do and just pretend to not notice it and just deem it cute, then you will enjoy it no doubt. I liked the film in general but the plot is confusing. I even wonder if Sandra and Keanu knew what was going on half the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie, for reasons that it surely delivered me a sense of love and romanticism, where especially nowadays many people are seeking, or lack of. This movie  will leave you with a deep impression.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>The chemistry between Reeves, and Bullock is amazing in this film. The story is a bit too convoluted, but on the whole, has a lot of heart. Bullock shines as Kate, and brings out the best in Reeves.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>story that lures you on a journey about the transcendency of love. It is a simple story yet it holds some level of intricacy which arouses the interest of the viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>When I first saw the previews for the Lake House I thought the plot was completely implausible and that there was no way I could possibly enjoy such a far-fetched romance. I was wrong. Sandra Bullock plays an overworked doctor at a busy Chicago hospital who finds solace on her time off by visiting her lake house. Keanu Reeves plays an architect whose father build the lakehouse, and who lives in it at the same time as Bullock, though two years earlier. The two correspond through letters placed in the mailbox and develop an affection for each other that transcends time. After awhile they begin to make plans to meet each other in Reeves' future and Bullock's present, but their plans just keep falling through. They begin to wonder if time is a barrier that they can't overcome.<br /><br />So while the two-year time difference may seem like it would make the love story hard to follow, it completely makes sense within the context of this film. These two people are living completely different lives and the only thing they have in common is this house, which for both of them is a source of solace and peace in their otherwise hectic lives. The way they fall in love is completely believable and I couldn't help but hope that they would be able to overcome the distance that time placed between them and find a way to be together in the present. Even if you don't typically like love stories, I'd suggest giving the Lake House a try. I was skeptical, but I'm glad that I gave it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves play two people who occupied a lake house at two separate times.  Somehow they are able to communicate by letters put in the lake house mailbox, despite the fact that she is living two years in the future from his life.  The movie shows scenes of their separate lives, hers as a doctor and his as an architect.  Their paths cross in unexpected ways, some planned and some by accident.  The premise sounds ridiculous, but somehow these actors make it work and they create an aura that pulls in the audience.  This is recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>While the concept of lovers from different eras is hardly new (Bing Crosby's love of Arthurian-era Rhonda Fleming in "A Connecticut Yankee", Tyrone Power falling for Ann Blyth in Revolutionary War England in "I'll Never Forget You", and Christopher Reeve's bittersweet affair with Gilded Age beauty Jane Seymour in "Somewhere in Time", are just a few examples), the novelty of 'fated' lovers separated by two years, bonding through letters in a magical mailbox, gives "The Lake House" a unique poignancy all it's own.<br /><br />Certainly, there are leaps of logic to contend with (Sandra Bullock could have easily have tracked down Keanu Reeves at any point, without protracting their rendezvous an additional two years, her relationship with her boyfriend is never resolved, nor is the fate of Jack, the dog, who simply disappears), but taken on it's own terms, the film is a very satisfying and romantic odyssey. Reeves and Bullock, who had a wonderful, goofy chemistry in "Speed", prove than they can handle a deeper, more mature screen relationship very well, with Reeves giving one of his best performances, and Bullock, whose career had stalled after "Miss Congeniality", proving again that she is underrated as a dramatic actress.<br /><br />Based on the 2000 Korean film, "Il Mare", screenwriter David Auburn has given the production a 'Classic Hollywood' luster, with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's "Notorious" playing on TV, and an ill-fated rendezvous reminiscent of "An Affair to Remember"; the presence of veteran star Christopher Plummer as Reeves' father enhances the 'feel'. While some may find this approach 'old-fashioned', Argentine director Alejandro Agresti recognized that a classic romance needed a classic approach, and, in my opinion, it succeeds quite well!<br /><br />"The Lake House" certainly deserves a look!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Okay, this was really a nice film. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock haven't lost their on chemistry, yet. Reeves plays an architect who is having some hard times with his father. While Bullock plays a doctor, who is just moving on with her life. But, their lives seem to be connected with this glass lake house. Reeves is just moving into it, while Bullock just moved out from it. Somehow, the two of them manage to fine one another through some letters and began a correspondance.(Done by this magical mailbox). Which blooms into a romance of sorts. However, there is one problem. They are living two years apart. Reeves is in 2004 and Bullock in 2006. The romance somehow begins to really shape thier lives and in the process, which will lead them. To have a chance encounter, which will change their lives either for the good or the bad.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>While the movie may have its flaws, it succeeds well as a time-twisting tale of star-crossed lovers. While the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys was more powerful and dramatic in the way it explored temporal paradoxes, The Lake House still manages to achieve the same spine-tingly feel at all of its peak moments.<br /><br />To me, the story is allegorical, in that we are all star-crossed lovers, and that we are constantly at the effect of time and destiny, of missed opportunities and beautiful moments of convergence.<br /><br />While the mailbox acts as a time portal for their communications, our subconscious minds, our collective sixth sense, can act the same way, if we could just be still and learn to listen to our hearts.<br /><br />A sweet movie, and a very intelligent 'love will find a way' feel-good movie. Not too many of those around.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>In an interesting bit of counter-programming and offering some relief from the glut of big, dumb summer action movies, The Lake House is a romantic movie for adults and is a reunion for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock who, ironically, starred in the blockbuster action film, Speed. Obviously, the powers that be hoped that lightning would strike twice as they had such genuine chemistry in that movie.<br /><br />Logically, this movie is a mess but it is a testimony to the chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that this matters little towards the overall enjoyment of watching their romance play out.<br /><br />Bullock has been spinning her wheels, career-wise, in the past few years with flawed dramas (Murder By Numbers) and forgettable comedies (did we really need a Miss Congeniality 2?) but has finally found the right material and the ideal role that showcases the same kind of attractive vulnerability that made the world fall in love with her in the first place. She has an enchanting smile that is beautiful to see. This enhances her character's appealing personality and makes you care about her.<br /><br />Reeves has definitely improved as an actor with age, delivering his most relaxed performance to date. He's always come across as stiff in many of his roles with his best efforts when he plays a more reactive character (i.e. My Own Private Idaho). However, with Something's Gotta Give he showed a capacity for light comedy in a much-needed break from the action and science fiction genres. The Lake House suits him well as he slips comfortably into his character.<br /><br />Credit must also go to director Alejandro Agresti who utilizes a warm and inviting colour scheme of earth tones that is perfect for this movie as it envelopes you and draws you in. He also adopts a leisurely pace, gradually immersing us in this engaging world and taking its time in getting to know these characters.<br /><br />In this day and age with email and instant messaging, it is refreshing to see a film that champions correspondence the old fashioned way - through handwritten letters. There is something more personal, more tangible than impersonal emails. Alex and Kate are lonely souls and in no time flat you want to see them together. This is a large part of the appeal of The Lake House. This is a romantic movie for our times with two busy professionals who are isolated in modern society and find each other through a bit of magic realism.<br /><br />The key to any romantic movie is the chemistry between the two leads and Bullock and Reeves have it, recreating the same spark that they had together in Speed only now they are a little older and wiser. Both have matured as actors and are a perfect for this movie. So, ignore the daft logic that The Lake House struggles to maintain - it is merely a device for which to establish a connection between the two lead actors. Once this happens nothing else matters but the relationship that develops between these two intriguing characters.<br /><br />"Additional Scenes and Outtakes" features more footage of Alex and Mona's disintegrating relationship, including its inevitable demise. There are a few other bits that were rightly cut as they would have distracted from the main story.<br /><br />Also included is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Lake House starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is one of the most sensual movies of 2006. This movie still confuses me a bit but the writing, acting, and plot is top-notch in every way.  The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock is explosive, you truly believe they are in love, too bad they never fell for each other behind the scenes. The premise of the film is Kate (Bullock) lives in the year 2006 and Alex (Reeves) lives in the year 2004 and they develop a deep and powerful relationship but they are living two years apart so how can they be destine to be together, well you just have to see this one to find out. And keep your ears open to the beautiful ballad Kate and Alex slowdance to, This Never Happened Before by Sir Paul McCartney, it's magical.

Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) leaves her lake house in 2006, and leaves a note for the next tenant. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) finds the note when he moves in in 2004. Oooops! We never get a good explanation about how they got a bit turned around in time, but it seems they can correspond using the mailbox at the lake house. It doesn't take long to realize that they have the same dog -- a female named Jack -- and that Jack is living in her own time. She seems perfectly capable of accepting and living in the anomalous situation.<br /><br />After they've exchanged correspondence for awhile, they try to work out a way to meet in person. But it's not as easy as it sounds. Do they eventually make it? How?<br /><br />Ain't gonna tell you. It's sweet. Really.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>"The Lake House" is a rare gem, the kind of film that Hollywood hasn't made for decades, and has more in common with the b&w classics and some foreign films (like the Korean "Il Mare" this one was based on) than any contemporary "date film." It is the well written script, and the mature and sensitive performances by its 2 leads that set it apart, as well as the many memorable, magical moments: The tree, the dance, the spray-painted inscription on the wall, to name a few. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are superb as Alex and Kate, who try to conquer time and space with their love.<br /><br />I have no problem with time warps, other dimensions, the presence of angels, and that the world just might be a cosmic soup of whirling particles. Seeing is not believing, because we see through a glass darkly, and anything might be possible, even the premise of this plot, implausible as it might be. Director Alejandro Agresti deftly manages to make the complexities of the story flow, and the supporting cast is excellent, including Christopher Plummer (as Alex's famed architect father), Ebon Moss-Bacharach (Alex's brother), Willele von Ammelrooy (Kate's mother) and Shohreh Aghdashloo (Kate's workplace friend). And then there is Jack, a lovable mutt that is shared between time spaces.<br /><br />I cannot think of a living actor that has had a more diverse filmography than Keanu Reeves, and "The Lake House" is by far his finest performance, in its depth, and naturalness. This is a man who looks so comfortable in his skin, in being who he is, that he adds a dimension of reality to the character of Alex. Sandra Bullock is also excellent as Kate, and both actors exude super star wattage power, and have marvelous screen chemistry with each other.<br /><br />Watch this film with an open mind and a soft heart, and it will delight you. I wept through much of it, enjoyed every minute, and it is a film I will never tire of seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>A dozen years after "Speed" ... Reeves and Bullock reunite as two destined single professionals who meet through a lake house they both lived at. Turns out both are living in the same place but two years apart and exchange letters through a magical mailbox. An American adaptation of the South Korean film "Ill Mare" from 1999, the Lake House follows the mysterious events that bring a lonely female doctor (Kate) in Chicago with a frustrated architect (Alex)in the country.<br /><br />THEME: NEVER SETTLE! Only marry your true love because time is irrelevant when your twin soul is out there and you know it! The truth is ... you can physically leave your twin soul ... but they will always be a part of you.<br /><br />The story begins when Kate leaves a letter in the mailbox for the new tenant to her former lake house home before departing for Chicago. When she receives a reply from Alex he claims that no one has lived in the Lake House for years. The two begin corresponding only to discover that they are living two years apart, Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006. The movie progresses and the two eventually decide to meet but its two weeks for Kate and two years for Alex. It's a heartbreaker because if time is not on your side it is not on your side.<br /><br />A series of coincidences bring keep bringing Kate and Alex together. The trick is that Kate wasn't always so open and had many missed moments with Alex. Over time they begin to share more about one another and decide to meet. Alex fails to show up at Ill Mare in Chicago and Kate forbids him to write to her again. That is until she almost marries her nice but not well suited match Morgan... and rushes to save her romance with Alex. The signs were all there... they even shared the same dog two years apart! Near misses, close encounters, and signposts to one another ... in the end it's worth the wait! It's a very Happy Valentine's Day. Unless you know that you could give your whole heart to that person despite another more suitable man or woman nearby ... don't sell out! Stay available for the one who truly makes you happy.<br /><br />One to watch ... and best with the "two of you" for all the couples who are together and happy and need a reminder of what they have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"The Lake House" is a romance in letters which is "kind of a long distance relationship" between two people that live it the parallel worlds separated by a span of two years and somehow connected by a time-traveling mailbox. If anything, this movie connected once again Sandra Bullock as a physician who moves out of her lakeside house to live and work in Chicago and Keanu Reeves, an architect, who lives in the house right now (the concept of "right now" plays an important role in the movie). Two begin to communicate via letters left in the mailbox and suddenly realize that they are as far away from each other as 2004 and 2006 are. If you watch the movie in the right mood with the right person, you could think of it as a sweet, moving picture about longing, about getting close to someone whom you may never see but not be able to get them out of your mind, and who become to you more real than anything you've ever known. You will see the gentle and intimate site of Chicago that you did not know even existed. You will be moved and entertained...If you are not in the right mood, you'd begin looking for the logical faults and plentiful holes in the plot and you would say scornfully, "another chick flick with Keanu as a romantic hero" - so, it is up to you.<br /><br />6.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that requires one to accept a certain set of premises; if you can do that, you're in, if you can't, you're out.

Together they create a compelling chemistry which held our attention completely; it created a concern for them and the awkward situation in which they found themselves.<br /><br />This is a good family movie that brings excitement and suspense to the viewer with the bonus of a happy ending.<br /><br />I recommend it highly!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>Ladies, if you have a hard time getting your boyfriend/husband to sit with you and enjoy a romantic movie, this gem may just do the trick.<br /><br />This story starts out simple enough, but before long you start to realise that the Lake House has a time-looped mailed box. The time loop is about 2 years. But understanding how the mail box works will be the key to them ultimately meeting and enjoying a long term relationship.<br /><br />The film carries a melancoly feel to it, where, their relationship continues to be just beyond their grasp all the time. Eventually when all seems to be lost, the mail box must be used in a last ditch effort to save the relationship.

The story begins as Sandra and dog are leaving the Lake House, a gorgeous all-glass house that is located on and over a piece of a lake, near the shore. Separated from land by a tiny bridge cross, she hesitates at her mailbox to place a letter in it, then drives away in what looks like my first car, a 1968 gold Mustang (except mine had a white convertible top). We next see Keanu pull up to the Lake House in a 1968 ? pickup truck.  Bits of snow are on the ground.<br /><br />Back in Chicago, Sandra reports to her new assignment as Dr. (Kate) Forster at Chicago City Hospital.  At a construction site, architect Keanu (Alex) tells us that he has bought the Lake House.  As Alex moves in, he checks the mail box, finding a letter from Kate, as the former tenant, providing her new address and asking the "new owner" to forward her mail if he receives any of it. A scraggy dog soon shows up and runs into the Lake House.  We soon see the same scruffy dog with Kate.  (What is going on here?)<br /><br />Kate is back at the Lake House, retrieves a letter from Alex to her, from the mailbox.  He tells her the Lake House was empty for years and asks if she meant her letter for someone else.  She writes back, placing another letter for Alex in the Lake House mailbox and she just happens to mention that it is 2006.  Alex shows up at the address Kate gave him to hand-deliver a letter, but there is an empty lot, with luxury apartments scheduled to be built.  He returns home (to the Lake House) and drops the letter in the mailbox, telling her it is 2004.  She replies with a dated photo, telling him of a freak snowstorm from April 3, 2004 when everyone got sick.<br /><br />When the snow storm appears on that date, Alex's interest is obviously peaked.  They begin to correspond regularly, by dropping letters in the Lake House mailbox, although both do not understand how it is possible.  The dog's name is Jack, and both of Alex and Kate seem to share Jack.  It is very interesting to see the play of how things work around time in the movie as Alex and Kate fall in love from a distance.  A sub-plot is Alex and his brother's relationship with their grouchy, cold, unaffectionate father, played by veteran actor Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />Is this romance just an impossible fantasy?  Can time be bent, somehow, to cross the paths of two people who are two years apart?  Is there hope?  Is anything REALLY impossible; or is it just highly improbable (as my brother used to say)?<br /><br />Personally, I think ALL things are possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Nice romantic film with great cast and interesting story line that captures & keeps your attention from the get go!<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays a lonely doctor, Kate Forster, looking for love and Keanu Reeves plays an architect looking for more to life than meets the eye named Alex Wyler.<br /><br />Each of them use to live at the same lake house, but at different time periods.

I love the Sandra and Keanu combination.

It's a great and cute story that is probably more of a chick flick than anything else.  I thought the special effects were good (especially when they were both in the park) and while at first you might be confused and frustrated by not understanding where it is going - be patient because when it all comes together, you'll realise that it was worth the ride.

This time it's a romance with a time travel-ish twist: the couple fall in love through correspondence only, and they then realize that they are offset from each other in time by two years. It's the first film in a little while that's made me want to read Jane Austen: Persuasion, in this case. Both characters carry the film well, and they continue to have great chemistry together. The storyline could have fumbled under the weight of its Macguffin, but didn't. Of course, I have a weakness for time-travel type stories, but this film was definitely enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've only been going on about this film since I originally heard about it, probably before they started filming, when it was announced, and was called "Il Mare". I loved both actors in Speed, and have since been a fan of both of them, although they can be forgiven for some of their film choices (hello, Two Weeks Notice!) They had such great chemistry in Speed, but I was actually doubtful about the renamed Lake House, as from the plot, it didn't sound like they spent much time together in the film. In fact, it sounded quite similar to Sleepless In Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised, as though the storyline keeps them apart for a fair chunk of the film, they do end up talking.<br /><br />The whole storyline is somehow, Keanu's character Alex, and Sandra's character Kate, both lived in the same house, but at different times. Alex is in 2004, Kate is in 2006. Yet they manage to correspond, each disbelieving at first that they live two years apart. Then through various letters, somehow, they fall in love. (Or lust, whatever, bearing in mind they haven't physically seen each other.) They try and figure out a way to be together, they work out a date they're going to meet each other on, but Alex doesn't turn up. (You need to pay attention to the beginning of the film to understand why he doesn't turn up.) Then they both realise they've met in the past and various other incidents - Kate left a book at the train station, and she tells Alex to go and get it, and when she forgets it, she sees him picking up her forgotten book.<br /><br />The plot can sometimes be a bit far fetched, I'm still not sure about the ending. Not only was it a bit too Hollywood - although I think I would have cried if it had been any other way and that would have been embarrassing - but I think by the end it was actually set in 2008! But then it would have meant Kate's character was in 2010 - oh I'm confused!<br /><br />The only thing that really bugged me about this film was Sandra's hair. What possessed her to get her hair cut that short?! Dear God. But thankfully, now she seems to be putting on a little weight, marriage must be suiting her. She's still skinny, she always will be, but she's looking better.<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief is a really wonderful thing. It's quite good that's it's used in a romantic film. The plot is about connecting with your soulmate, the one that is right for you, especially when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt they've waited too long to find the perfect someone, or felt alone at a crowded party.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim "bad acting" - shut up. There's always gonna be someone out there who slags off Keanu for his acting skills, but why are you watching it if you're just gonna write a review and slate his acting?<br /><br />See this film with someone you love. It'll open your eyes to what could possibly happen, what would happen if you never met them, and will make you look at them differently. It's an excellent, magical film, and I will be definitely preordering it when it comes out on DVD. And it's good to see Keanu & Sandra lighting up the big screen again. They make a good team.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Not since Jeannot Szwarc's gooey "Somewhere in Time" (1980) have I seen a movie so willing to suspend credibility and logic for the sake of conveying an idealistic romance, but Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti (in his American film bow) and screenwriter David Auburn somehow manage to keep their convoluted fable afloat despite the layers of fantasy-driven contrivance. Underneath it all, the 2006 movie is really an old-fashioned 1950's-style woman's picture, and one wonders what Douglas Sirk could have done with the material in a lavish Ross Hunter production. Instead, we are given a precocious, time-jumping tale detailing the improbable romance between Alex Wyler, an angst-driven architect who has become a condo developer, and Kate Forster, a lonely doctor. Their common thread is the unique glass house designed by Alex's father that sits literally on a lake near Chicago, where both have lived at different times. They correspond through handwritten letters, but the twist is that they are existing two years apart and have only a magical mailbox to transcend the time difference.<br /><br />The fantastical premise sounds silly, and to some degree it is, but in a surprisingly effective manner, the filmmakers and cast take it all quite seriously. It's all about execution and the emotional subtleties in the script. Luckily, Auburn dances around the credibility issues with a swooning sense of romance. The externals capture the feeling as well - Alar Kivilo's crisp, autumnal-to-wintry cinematography and Meg Everist's set decorations both capture Chicago at its most cinematic; and Rachel Portman's evocative score filled with music from baby boomer icons like Carole King and Paul McCartney. There is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in Sandra Bullock's Kate since the actress has played variations of the same lonely girl over the years, though she has gratefully dropped her perky demeanor for a more resonant performance. Keanu Reeves is sincere as Alex, though a bit too overtly new-age-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability. Still, aside from Bullock's sharply vituperative turn in Paul Haggis' "Crash", this is probably the best work either has done in a while.<br /><br />Individually, Reeves and Bullock convey the solitude of their characters with a minimum of fuss, and when they do connect, they generate real chemistry in rather creative ways. That's what really matters with a movie like this. The supporting cast consists mostly of unsurprising stock characters, in particular, Dylan Walsh as Kate's insecure intended, Morgan, and Lynn Collins as Alex's anxious co-worker, Mona. There are three international veterans who inhabit their roles with more verve and individuality - Shohreh Aghdashloo worldly wise as Kate's workaholic colleague; Christopher Plummer (who coincidentally co-starred in "Somewhere in Time") hammy as Alex's irascible father; and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy (of "Antonia's Line") full of romanticism as Kate's widowed mother. As contrived as it is (and if you have seen Brad Anderson's "Happy Accidents", you will notice plot similarities), the ending does satisfy in a way loyal to its genre. The movie is definitely a wallow but a well-done one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>It's been a rough summer for movie going.  Normally I attend one or two films a week, but nothing in this summer's fare has really held my interest.  The exception is this film, "The Lake House".  Having seen trailers, I was puzzled by the plot, which needs to evolve over time.  It's complex to describe.  And when you are playing with "the past is the past, and the future is now...."  Well, you have to see the film.  Possibly, a mailbox plays a more central role in this film than it ever will in any other.<br /><br />The art direction, the low key acting, the total romance of "The Lake House" have made the film memorable to me, always in instant recall, just like "The Notebook".  Notwithstanding that I am not a Keanu Reeves fan, I believe that the coupling of Reeves with Bullock in this film was more than just a casting stunt.  I believe they have an immediate chemistry on film together that Reeves doesn't get with anyone else, and Sandra doesn't quite achieve with other partners.  With other leading men, notably Hugh Grant and Bill Pullman (her partner in one of the all time great romances, "While You Were Sleeping"), Bullock reverts to romantic comedy.  Here, the romance is in earnest, her feelings more real than sparkly;  the message is about relationships, and the humanity involved in maintaining them.<br /><br />An excellent, quiet film...not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`the lake house', directed by Alejandro Agresti, reunites Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in the lead roles, for the first time since they appeared in the action movie `Speed'. And, in a strange way, this movie is as unusual as a romantic comedy as `Speed' was as an action movie, since both movies are based on unusual premises.<br /><br />The assumption, no surprise to anyone who has seen the trailer, is that the Bullock (Kate Foster, a doctor fresh out of residency) and Reeves (Alex Wyler, a building contract supervisor) characters both occupy the same house set upon stilts just off the shore of a small lake somewhere within easy driving distance of Chicago, except that Wyler occupies it in 2004 and Forster occupies it in 2006. The two communicate across this span of two years by leaving letters in the lake house's mailbox. And, the characters realize this little temporal anomaly quickly, about 20 minutes into the movie. What the trailer doesn't reveal (but which does not do much to give things away) is the fact that this lake house was originally built by Wyler's father, a famous architect, played by Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />The story is so simple and the characters are so few, I am hard pressed to find interesting things about the film without giving away a major part of the plot. One thing I can say is that the time travel aspect of the time shift premise is so subdued, one gets absolutely no sense this is remotely like any `science fiction' or even `Twilight Zone' type of story. It is far more like some Cary Grant romantic story from the 1940s or 1930s, where two characters are supposed to meet at the top of the Empire State Building, but one of the two characters never shows up.<br /><br />One thing the time travel premise does do is eliminate any sense that this is a `romantic comedy'. There are some light-hearted moments, but it is not really much more amusing than `Love Story' or `The Paper Chase'. It is certainly not in the same comedy class as `The Wedding Crashers' or `The Breakup'. Another thing the time travel scenario does is make your head hurt when you try to work out the classic time travel paradoxes, when the two characters do meet in circumstances where the later character, Forster (Bullock) encounters the earlier character, Wyler (Reeves) and Forster is not aware of the cross-temporal communication, since it hasn't happened (for her) yet. Again, fortunately, the time travel hypothesis is well downplayed you hardly notice the anomalies.<br /><br />One thing for sure is that this movie `works' as a romantic story. By the time we are halfway through the flick, we really want them to get together and are frustrated when they can't seem to figure out the obvious solution to the problem and actually get together. When they do set a plan in motion, we are genuinely distressed when it doesn't work out. Even more distressing is the suspicion of why the meeting did not work out.<br /><br />The side stories involving Wyler's father and brother and Forster's job and boyfriend are lightly done, just enough to distract us for a bit from the main story line without taking on too much substance and stealing from the romance.<br /><br />One of the more interesting little conceits is the fact that the two main characters end up adopting the same stray dog, who then succeeds in occupying scenes in both 2004 and 2006. The curious thing is that said dog doesn't appear in the final scene... I guess that would have been stretching the old space-time continuum just a bit too far! I'm also just a tad disappointed that there is no hint of explanation for why these two people should find themselves in this situation at these particular times, but then we would start getting into `Twilight Zone' territory, and there is really no need to go there. It contributes nothing to the love story.<br /><br />So, it would have been nice to have a director's or writer's voice-over commentary to give us some of this stuff, but there is none, reducing somewhat the rewatchability of the flick. But, if you need a good date movie, this one is a winner.<br /><br />Note that I strongly suspect the widescreen version is highly recommended here. I saw the 'full screen' version, and definitely sensed I was missing some things.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I love the concept of a love unfolding through letters. Sandra Bullock plays a single doctor who has a void in her life and an unsure path for her future. Suddenly, a mysterious pen pal leaves her letters in the mailbox of her rental lake house. She finds herself falling for a man that she's never met and living two years apart! What she doesn't realize is that she has met him in her past and they are linked in a way she hasn't figured out until it's nearly too late.

McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>It was so nice to watch a film starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that doesn't have a speeding bus as part of the plot.  These two actors have great chemistry, which was shown in the movie Speed, and it was nice seeing them in a romantic film.  This is the story of Kate and Alex, two people who are perfect for each other.  There's one significant problem though -- they're in a long distance relationship.  Alex is in the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006.  They meet by way of the lake house, where Kate moves out of to work as a doctor in Chicago.  Alex owns the lake house, and his letter exchange with Kate begins after the former tenant (Kate) leaves a welcome letter to the new tenant (Alex)... except that Alex lives two years behind Kate.  Will they ever get to meet?<br /><br />The time anomalies make the film confusing at times, but the story of two star-crossed lovers who transcend time is wonderful.  Bullock and Reeves make film magic in their scenes together and when they write each other letters.  My favorite scene is the one where they slow dance during Kate's birthday party.  The song they play during that scene is great.  It's difficult to write a review without giving details away (though I'm sure some people have done that already), but all I can say is that this is a great romantic film, one of the best I've seen this year along with The Notebook and The Phantom of the Opera.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>I really liked this, didn't see it at the theater due to all the bad reviews.

In the Lake House they have more chemistry than ever, but surely they could have found better material than this as their vehicle. The Lake Houses is so full of plot holes, so full of cheesy dialogue, and the characters are so underwritten and insipid that the film ends up a weird, flaggingly paced caricature of itself.<br /><br />You really have to suspend disbelief as Alex an architect (Keanu Reeves) and Kate a doctor (Sandra Bullock) actually meet. Both live in a contemporary glass walled house on the picaresque shore of Lake Michigan - he in 2004 and she in 2006 when they begin exchanging correspondence via the house's mailbox. The fact that their letters are traveling through time doesn't seem to bother them.<br /><br />Eventually, they realize that they're meant to be together, but alas what are they to do? They're both stranded in their respective time periods. Alex attempts to seek out Kate's 2004 counterpart when she's tied to a dutiful beau (Dylan Walsh). Mostly, however their liaison relies on split-screen wizardry and fluent editing (by Alejandro Brodersohn and Lynzee Klingman). For her part, Kate waits patiently for Alex to "catch up" to her.<br /><br />Admittedly, The Lake House is beautiful to look at and Sandra and Keanu are absolutely lovely, the spark that ignited between them in Speed still burns, but there's not much edge to their relationship - it's all rather sweet and adorable rather than sexy or passionate. But the major problem with The Lake House is that there's a plot turn in the first act that most savvy viewers will see coming that ruins any suspense for the rest of the story.<br /><br />As Alex and Kate Bullock and Reeves phone in carefully muted performances, in fact they're so subdued that they seem to drift through the story in a daze, as if they don't really care what happens. Even their few scenes together are extremely soft, slow and shamelessly sentimental. Despite the fluid cinematography, editing and music, these short scenes prevent the film from flowing.<br /><br />There's also several nagging plot points - including a superfluous subplot involving Alex's dying father (Christopher Plummer) - that make it almost impossible to suspend disbelief. And how can the lake house supposedly built with pillars and glass have an enclosed attic?  Never mind; trying to find logic in this film will drive you crazy along with a script that jumps around in time so much that you're never quite sure when you're in 2004 or 2006.<br /><br />On the plus side, Agresti's direction is lyrical and textured; giving the film a warm rhythm that just about makes up for its lack of pacing. The movie also highlights the urban beauty of Chicago, making the best of the city's surrounds. And I guess it's nice, after all this time, to see Reeves and Bullock together again, and even though they ground The Lake House and allowing us to overlook many of its contrivances, I'm still not sure why they chose this kind of movie to star in.

But like everyone else, I respond viscerally to any movie that pairs Keanu Reeves with Sandra Bullock.  The two of them should star in all movies, in any year--2004, 2006, or now.  Think of how many films would have been much improved if only Reeves and Bullock had been available to take the title parts.  I'm thinking of MULHOLLAND DR, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, THE ICE AGE, even something like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN could have used Sandra Bullock playing the part Anne Hathaway did and tempting Keanu Reeves with her knowledge of rodeo driving.<br /><br />But my questions were more about, what is with the strange brother of Keanu Reeves, Henry, and his leonine hairline which looks as though hair grows out of his head backwards and gets crimped there?  Where did they find this actor, or the woman who plays Sandra's mother?  For her part, the producers might have been turned down by Marsha Mason so they decided to get the "foreign" Marsha Mason, with her odd Dutch or Malaysian accent but all of Marsha Mason's botox plumping out her face like a pin cushion.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD.)<br /><br />It made me uncomfortable all the time she was around, even discounting the fact that I believe the mother (played by Willeke van Ammelrooy) made that bus run over Keanu Reeves as she sat with her daughter at Dealey Plaza and realized, when she lifted her gaze and saw Alex Wyler begin to approach, that this was the man who would once and for all take Sandra away from her at last.  Did anyone else get this, or am I just reading into things?  Notice that once Keane and Sandra get together, you never see the mother again.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS.)<br /><br />I believe that the movie calls out for a sequel in which Keanu's character, Alex Wyler, and his architect brother, Henry (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.  As for the misery Sandra Bullock's character causes Dylan Walsh from NIP/TUCK, if I were Dylan Walsh I would try to get another agent after making a fool out of me in THE LAKE HOUSE, period.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Suspension of disbelief is an essential element of film enjoyment - and you better have yours turbocharged for The Lake House.  What's nice about this movie is that it makes no attempt to explain the plot lunacies - it simply invites you to join in the fun.  If you do, you'll love it, it's a good natured, charming romance with a sweet - and certainly symbolic - twist.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is a consistently excellent actress, able to express a great deal of emotion with the smallest glance.  Keanu Reeves, by contrast, could be out-acted by a jar of olives - he has work to do before he could be described as wooden.  Listen to how he reads in the scenes where he is not on screen - simply awful.<br /><br />For contrast, listen to Shoreh Aghdashloo - Kate's co-worker and friend.  That, my friends, is a voice.  Ms. Aghdashloo could read quarterly crop reports and make them sound like 120 Days At Sodom.  Back story of emotionally inaccessible dad really not necessary.  Ignore the flotsam and jetsam and cheer for these ambitious lovers trying to conquer time - as if holding a normal relationship together isn't hard enough!</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>Warning: SLIGHT Spoilers Ahead!!!<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the very end of it. For once, Sandra's character, who was a doctor at a local hospital is actually happy, and her and Keanu's character's souls are together! But does it only last 2 years and then he's killed? I was confused about that as well as a few other aspects of the movie.<br /><br />The movie itself was alright. I liked how two strangers wrote each other, taking their time to get to know each other, and ultimately feeling emotionally attached to each other by the end. I loved the emotional parts where Keanu's character pretty much lost it. Before that, he even admitted to his friend that she was, "The realest thing I know."<br /><br />About 20 minutes or so afterwards, you see Sandra's character in tears because Keanu's brother informs him that he is dead. She rushes out of the office, down the steps and out into the city to find him. She eventually does (how, I don't know) and eventually, they are together. FINALLY.<br /><br />Would I re-watch this? Probably not. It wasn't exciting enough. But I did however like the part where Keanu and Sandra's characters met for the second time, and they were talking and stuff and ended up having to cover up a kiss they had when some girl who's into Keanu's character and Sandra's mate come back into the picture. Sandra makes up a lie something like, "He was telling me about the lake house..."<br /><br />LOL.

Though it is not normally the type of movie I would like, I did enjoy this picture.  Heavy on the love story with moments of light humor flavor this story.  The other reviews sum up the story already, so you already know that two people that lived in the same Lake House somehow manage to communicate with each other through letters in the mailbox even though one lives in 2006 and the other in 2004.  The story basically revolves around them falling in love through the letters and the possibilities of them meeting.  Sometimes Reeves seems a little stiff, but he is charming enough.  Bullock is great as always.  The magic of the mailbox is never explained, nor is the improbabilities of him changing things in the past that somehow work out perfectly in the future.  Still it was a nice story, and Reeves and Bullock certainly have charisma together.  I would give this one a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I can't understand why Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock haven't made more movies together, because their chemistry is excellent. It worked in "Speed" and it works here in "The Lake House." Very different genres of movies but chemistry is chemistry. You either have it or you don't. And what's more, Reeves and Bullock pull it off even while spending the majority of the movie apart and only talking (well, writing) to each other.<br /><br />I found "The Lake House" to be a refreshing, unconventional (in a good way) and enjoyable film despite its implausible premise. But the focused script and good directing carry it through. Sandra Bullock is great as usual, enough said. Keanu Reeves (ghasp!) actually manages a good performance too, yes, showing *emotion*. Who would have thought he had it in him after all. I've always been a fan of his anyway, but I can say objectively this is by far his best performance (with "My Own Private Idaho" coming in second-another film to watch if you want to see Keanu Reeves demonstrate what he's capable of).<br /><br />I do have a couple of issues with "The Lake House," as much as I liked it. One, the premise is just too far-fetched, no matter how much I wanted to just "go along with it." The holes in the plot are simply too obvious to be overlooked, and this isn't necessarily the fault of anyone; it's only inevitable with this type of story. And two, I found the ending way too feel-good "Hollywood" for my taste. So for these reasons I must lower my review to 4 stars.<br /><br />Still, I would highly recommend this film. It's certainly loads better than the usual for-the-masses-factory-assembly-line crap out there. Despite its flaws, "The Lake House" has a charm that works. And for you heartless folks out there who won't like it, you'll at least appreciate Keanu Reeves' ingenious way of keeping his beer cold!

The plot is slow and methodical, just like some very good books. My only grief with the story was the part that was obvious too soon. Other than that, I felt it was a fulfilling movie well worth the watching. While, we have become used to romance genre films being more or less comedic, this one is not, or tragic, like "Somewhere in Time", the logical comparison film, "Lake House" is not that either, it is a melancholy story were the end is happy.<br />This is a story that requires you to both suspend disbelief and think.

A divine intervention allows them to correspond with each other through U.S. mail. Both are completely in disbelief at first but, when certain things become clear they realize that the impossible is in fact taking place. Eventually they plan to meet in person, while Bullock shows.. for some unknown reason Reeves does not. Bullock decides to forget about him not understanding why he didnt show up. Later we discover why he wasnt there and the story unfolds when we realize she will be the one that has to change events that have already happened in Reeves time but, could be altered in Bullock's present time.

Though the filmmakers have changed many settings, the basic plot line remains the same, which is about a mystical exchange of letters between a man and a woman. The point is, the man, Alex (Keanu Reeves) lives in the year 2004 while the woman, Kate (Sandra Bullock), lives in 2006.<br /><br />This is a love story, and a very romantic one. The communication between Alex and Kate, which gradually develops into rapport, or something more, is carried out through a time-traveling mail-box standing before the curious glass house by the lake. Like `Somewhere in Time' or `Frequency' you need suspension of disbelief to enjoy the story, which looks less plausible in a modernized city of Chicago than in a seaside house in Korea.<br /><br />The script is skillfully written so as not to make us realize the implausibility of the film's situations, and though some (or many) would notice where the story is going at the earlier stage, the film all in all succeeds in keeping us guessing: `Can they meet each other?' The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is a genuine one even though we know their `conversation' is physically impossible and there is one romantic scene that is accompanied with an equally romantic Paul McCartney song. And the reference to one Jane Austen novel is clever and intelligent.<br /><br />`The Lake House' is a wildly romantic film and is impressive as such. Still, the sub-plot about the shaky relations between Alex and his father (Christopher Plummer) fails to interest us. Actually no supporting actors, even Shohreh Aghdashlook, are memorable, but you know this film is made for Keanu and Sandra. And I referred to the `implausible' plot, but implausibility didn't bother me. Still I'm afraid the idea of moving the location to Chicago is not a good one because the two-year lapse does not seem a big difficulty to overcome with this background.

It will not be any kind of classic, but it will leave most viewers with a pleasant "aftertaste".  Keanu Reeves is a builder/architect who mysteriously begins a "cross-time" correspondence with Sandra Bullock, a new doctor.  Interestingly, it's not the Lake House (a house on stilts designed and built by Reeve's father) that is at the nexus of these two lives; it is the mailbox.  The mailbox is the mechanism for allowing messages to pass from Reeves (in 2004) to Bullock (in 2006).  Once they realize that they live in two different times, they demonstrate a surprising lack of interest in how or why this is happening, a bit unrealistic for two professionals (and their friends).  And apparently anything can pass in the mailbox (they pass a book and letters); what a great opportunity to pass a newspaper, flowers, jewelry... whatever!<br /><br />BUT... this is a love story, with a couple separated not by space, but by time.  There is a touching scene when they make a date to meet.  For him, it is a date two years in the future.  For her, it is tomorrow.  Note the resemblance to An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant.<br /><br />I thought Keanu Reeves was well cast for this movie.  Sandra Bullock was perhaps too "relaxed" for the physician... everything was too matter-of-fact.  All's well that ends well, and this plot ends well.<br /><br />I'd like to be the first to announce that the dog, Jack, was really an alien with time-warping abilities.  She (yes, Jack was a she) hid it well, and there was probably a huge alien complex hidden in the water under the Lake House causing these distortions in time.  But that's another story.  This one was a tale of love!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Alex (Reeves) and Kate (Bullock) are two lonely people.  They each live in a fancy glass house on the shore of Lake Michigan.  The same house, in fact.  He lives there in 2004, she lives there in 2006.  The house's mailbox begins delivering letters through time, and the two are able to communicate, and eventually fall in love.  They just have to figure out how to meet.<br /><br />If you can get over the time traveling mailbox, "The Lake House" is an enjoyable movie.  Reeves and Bullock are together again for the first time since "Speed", and one wonders why they have not teamed up again sooner.  They have a chemistry that is believable, and you root for the characters to get together in the end.  I recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Chick flicks give me headaches to begin with; if there's a romance there better be either a violent, destructive car chase or an AK-47 gunfight interjected or I lose interest pronto.  But you throw in a space/time continuum component in a chick flick and I'm scratching my head and getting lost faster than a fourth grader in a quantum physics course.  Alas, such is the case with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and THE LAKE HOUSE.  I watched this flick twice, and my head still hurts.  For instance:<br /><br />1.  If we accept the premise there are parallel universes (allowing Keanu and Sandra to correspond simultaneously, even though they are two years apart), how can the two actually interact in Keanu's universe?  If I remember my "Star Trek" factoids, don't people like implode when they occupy two universes at once?<br /><br />2.  (Spoiler Alert!)  And if Keanu dies on Valentine's Day 2006 (but then later on gets a heads up from Sandra not to cross that busy street) and then asks his brother what day it is (and his brother says, "It's Valentine's Day 2006") and thereby avoids his date with destiny, then at the end of the movie the two lovers finally meet and Sandra says, "You waited two years," doesn't that mean it is now Valentine's Day 2008?  So this movie takes place in the future?<br /><br />3.  What's with the mailbox?  Keanu and Sandra both wait patiently at the Lake House, watching the mailbox. . .and then the flag mysteriously rises, indicating a letter will appear inside.  If the flag rises wouldn't that mean the parallel universes have again intertwined, whereby the two could interact (see Point 1 above)?<br /><br />4.  Poor Morgan (Dylan Walsh).  He really has the hots for Sandra, but she never gets more than lukewarm for him.  Yet he hangs on in the relationship.  Dumb Morgan.<br /><br />I could go on and on (and on).  Oh, and Keanu is as wooden as the desk I'm typing on, and Sandra is one ultra-depressed chick.  And Christopher Plummer is ageless.  That's it:  Plumber jumps from universe to universe; that's how he stays young.  Pass the aspirin.  2.5 stars.<br />--D. Mikels, beleaguered author, WALK-ON</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>As many people from cities by The Great Lakes know, the lake effect can change with variable winds and bring snow squalls and rains unexpectedly.  The winds of change are presented in a relationship that straddles a time barrier, a time warp that is bridged by a magic mailbox where messages are transported back and forth between two residents of a specially designed "lake house".  One resident is a Chicago architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), whose father was the architect of the stunning, but idiosyncratic glass "lake house" on "stilts".  He lives there in 2004.  Kate Forster, a resident doctor, lives at the residence in 2006.  She moves out, but leaves a message in the mailbox for the new owner to forward her mail to her new address.  He intercepts the note two years earlier and leaves her a note that her new address is under construction, and her reference to animal tracks left on the residence aren't apparent.  Both are curious by the discrepancies of the other's notes.  His letters have the heading 2004; her letters have the heading 2006.  Then a mysterious but lively exchange of letters takes place.  They address these concerns, and the movie makes us take some leaps to bridge the incredulity gap.  (Wouldn't most people dismiss the other as wacko with some sort of anomoly?)  Fortunately, even though there is enough effort by the audience to suspend disbelief, there is no magic Post Office actually delivering the mail.  Somehow they believe one another and fall in love.<br /><br />There are some connections made besides the mailbox over the two year communication gap:  One is the same resident dog who is present for both owners; the other is a copy of Kate's favorite book, Jane Austin's 'Persuasion'.  The former never forgets an owner, so his straying provides a meeting between the two during a time she wouldn't know the context of the letters in 2004.  It is her birthday, and her trusting, live-in boyfriend invites the stranger neatly enough when his dog runs to the new residence they share.  The event turns into a date that becomes awkward upon her boyfriend's discovery.  An emotional connection is made, even though Kate thinks of him as a newcomer in her life.  The book provides a tangible presence and a fine allusion to another story about an old-fashioned courtship where the protagonists wait for a romance tested over time.<br /><br />Alex has two barriers to straddle.  He struggles with a hard-to-please architect mentor father who in Alex's own words, "...knew how to make a house, but not a home."  The emotional baggage is telling between himself and his father, especially when his dad's health heads south.  (And all of this is presented well with the friendly sibling rivalry with his brother, Henry.)  But the biggest barrier is trying to schedule a date with the future Kate.  He goes to Chicago's best restaurant to make a date two years in advance with her and shares his plan in a letter.  He does his best to keep the engagement, yet she is stood up, and from there she abandons hope of them ever connecting.  That is until she discovers the reason for his failure, and this leads to a chance... a chance that one can alter events and change the future.<br /><br />'The Lake House' is a pleasing and manipulative romantic movie.  It plays upon all of our buttons.  Relying on narrated letters, the movie draws upon films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' and its follow-up, 'You've Got Mail'.  Romance mainly emanates from the longing presented, and the narration of the correspondence crossing the two-year distance for both would-be lovers.  As languid as some of the scenes linger on, the resolution is strong enough to recommend this stylish and heartwarming flick about love that is meant to bridge the gap of space and time.  Just like "the lake effect," 'The Lake House' sneaks up on one and provides powerful changes that neatly blow away the debris and provide a clearer day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>There is an interesting relationship at the heart of "The Lake House", with a good performance from Sandra Bullock, but ultimately the film cheats, unravels and lets the audience down.<br /><br />Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), a new doctor, leaves the Lake House, where she lived during part of medical school. Now that she is starting her residency in Chicago, she needs to live closer to the hospital. She leaves a letter for the new tenant requesting they forward her mail. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a condominium developer, moves into the Lake House and reads Kate's letter. But he finds that she has referred to things that aren't there. Confused, he writes her back. After a bad day at the hospital, Kate drives out to the Lake House and checks the mailbox, finding the letter from Alex. She responds and puts another letter in the mailbox. Alex sees the flag on the mailbox raise and reaches in to find Kate's letter. They soon realize something strange is happening and ask each other the date. Alex is in 2004 and Kate is in 2006. They begin a correspondence and eventually agree to meet at a trendy restaurant in 2006. At the same time, Kate has to deal with a former boyfriend who left her after he saw her kissing a guy at a party. And Alex has to deal with his office assistant, a young woman who longs to be Mrs. Wyler, or at least Mrs. Right Now. Will they ever meet in person? Can this relationship be possible?<br /><br />Surprisingly, given the outlandish nature of the story, "The Lake House", directed by Alejandro Agresti, written by David Auburn (the Pulitzer prize winning play "Proof", which later became a film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins) and based on a Korean film, manages to make the relationship between Alex and Kate believable, to an extent. This is remarkable because they are almost never in the same frame of film or even the same time period. Their relationship consists of many conversations, through letters. After a while, the director and writer put them in the same locations, but for different reasons and two years apart. For instance, when Alex is visiting his father (Christopher Plummer) in the hospital, he writes a letter to Kate, who is taking a break in the same hospital cafeteria as she responds. It gives them the illusion of being in the same scene together, even though, of course, they aren't.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is very good as Kate. She manages to convey the loneliness and fatigue the young doctor experiences as she begins her residency and deals with the problems of such a job. Then, when she first begins corresponding with Alex, her amusement at the idea of such a relationship is clear. She can't quite believe it, but she continues. But as she begins to reveal more to him, and vice versa, we understand why she would become involved. All of these elements add up and make her character believable. When she confides in her supervisor (Shohreh Aghdashloo, "House of Sand and Fog", "American Dreamz", TV's "24"), we get the sense she has also had some sort of unconventional relationship, that she understands, she has sympathy. As Kate works through the various difficulties of such a relationship, her actions are believable because she is lonely, busy and unable to make a real connection with someone else.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is good, but this is not the type of film he should be making. Reeves is better in science fiction and action films which require him to say little and emote even less. Neo in "The Matrix" trilogy is the perfect role for him. When I first heard about this film, the trailers made a point of mentioning that writer David Auburn was a Pulitzer Prize winner. When I heard this, I immediately thought `playwright' and after doing some research, I confirmed this. Often when a playwright writes a film, their dialogue still retains the feel of a play. They are two very different mediums and require different things. In a play, you need to be succinct, to capture the essence quickly. In a film, the dialogue and story need to seem more natural, allowing a little more time. I was happy to see that much of "House" doesn't have this problem. Reeves delivery doesn't lend itself well to this type of writing. At one point, as Alex is showing his brother the Lake House, he says "It's beautiful. Seductive even." Who speaks like this? On the few occasions when the writer does veer into theatrical stage territory, the actors are able to handle it and incorporate their lines into normal speech patterns. Everyone except for Reeves. When he says this line, it sounds like a teenager practicing his role in the school's production of "Our Town".<br /><br />As the film progresses, the writer and director come up with interesting ways to get Bullock and Reeves in the same scenes, in the same timeframe, but this ultimately points to a large hole in the plot. Of course, since we are talking about a story involving time travel, maybe holes in the plot are required. That said, Alex and Kate do meet a couple of times between 2004 and 2006, yet later in the film Kate doesn't seem to know who Alex is. This might be understandable if they were casual encounters, but they share a significant conversation, meet on another occasion, and more. Later, when a significant event happens, she doesn't seem to realize it was Alex. It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />At one point, Alex creates a walking tour of Chicago's architecture for Kate. This is a nice scene, giving them a sort of virtual date. It also shows off the charms of the city. He marks sights on a map and follows along with her, showing off the best buildings in Chicago, the buildings which caused his interest in a career in architecture.<br /><br />In the end, the film uses a cop out, which I can't really discuss as it would reveal the ending. Basically, the film betrays its own story and takes a complete turn in the wrong direction.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it. I cry when a Hallmark commercial plays on television. Yet, somehow, I wasn't moved by the relationship between the two leads. I was interested in their correspondence, but I never felt for them as a couple. Bullock was good and I believed she was Kate, but she is only half of the equation. Part of the problem is that they spend most of the film conversing from afar, sharing little screen time together. It makes it difficult to see them as a couple. I guess I didn't understand why Reeves would go to such great lengths to find Kate. He has women throwing themselves at him, yet he wants to carry on a written correspondence for over two years? His assistant is practically ready to jump on top of him, yet he wants to hold out for a woman he has only met a few times? I understand why Kate would be willing to pursue this relationship; as mentioned, she is lonely and extremely busy. But Alex doesn't seem to have the same problem. When they finally do get together, this should trigger waterworks and I didn't even have a moist eye.<br /><br />For these reasons, what starts out as a promising romantic drama falls apart.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>A few years back a little film called `Frequency' was released.  That said film has pretty much the same synopsis or idea behind it as `The Lake House' with one major difference; `Frequency' actually takes the time to explain what is going on.  I waited the entire length of the movie for some kind of explanation, some kind of reason for the `strange' occurrences but they gave me nothing.  That's not to say that deep down `The Lake House' isn't a sweet little film, for it does have its moments but in the end it's nothing spectacular and definitely not the brilliant film some would have you think it is.  The one thing that this movie does have going for it is its two main stars.  I'm not a fan of Keanu in the least, I feel he's wooden and stiff and uninteresting as an actor, but here he comes alive when paired with Bullock, who just dominates this film.  It's as if Sandra brings out the actor in Reeves.<br /><br />The film follows Kate Forster; former tenant to a beautiful lake house, as she starts to correspond with its next tenant only to find out that it's not the `next' tenant she's writing to.  Kate leaves a note in the mail box as she leaves welcoming the next tenant to their new home and asking that her mail be forwarded to her new address if it happens to show up.  Alex Wyler is the man who receives the letter, but he's living two years in the past.  The two of them start writing to one another and eventually fall in love and want to meet but of course there have to be some obstacles to overcome first.<br /><br />I have a couple petty issues with this film aside from my big complaint about the lack of explaining the goings on.  I enjoyed the chemistry between both Sandra and Keanu but the writer of the script seemed to forget that they are writing letters, not talking on the telephone, and so I couldn't help but become irritated with the conversations they had with one another which, according to the plot, could have only happened if they were standing in front of the mailbox writing short sentences one at a time.  I know it's petty but it was just annoying to me.  The outcome is very predictable as well.  I knew the minute Kate was stood up at the restaurant what was going on (or what happened) but I guess that is petty as well since most movies nowadays are pretty predictable.  I felt that a lot of the dialog was cheesy to the point of cringing, but I get the feeling that's what they were going for, at least I hope it was intentional since it would be pretty sad if the writers actually thought it was good.<br /><br />Surprisingly, like I mentioned, Keanu Reeves is far from bad here.  He actually was enjoyable to watch.  Sandra Bullock is almost always a doll to me and so I really enjoyed her performance, although it was far from a favorite of mine.  Christopher Plummer is good as Alex's domineering father but the very talented Shohreh Aghdashloo is all but wasted here as Kate's fellow doctor Anna.  Other supporting players like Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Willeke van Ammelrooy and Dylan Walsh (Sandra is making her way through the `Nip/Tuck' men huh) are decent but not outstanding given their little screen time.<br /><br />In the end I don't know if I can really recommend `The Lake House' with a straight face.  It's not that I feel it was a horrible film; it just wasn't that great of a film either.  The script was interesting but leaves the audience hanging at the end, waiting for that climactic explanation that just never comes.  If you're a fan of Bullock's or (god forbid) a fan of Reeves then by all means see this movie, but if your looking for a really good movie then there are plenty of better choices ahead of you.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Dear Sandra and Keanu,<br /><br />I'm writing to you from the year 2008. As you're reading this in 2004, I know that probably sounds stupid. Two hours ago I didn't realize quite how stupid, but then I saw a movie called "The Lake House" in which you star. I hope that title means nothing to you yet, and that's how I'd like to keep it. That's why I'm writing to you tonight.<br /><br />Some time in 2005, representatives of Warner Bros, or perhaps even the great Argentine director Alejandro Agresti himself, will approach you with the script. Adapted from a successful Korean film called "Siworae", it will have been penned by Tony-winning writer David Auburn. But don't let that fool you. Don't be drawn in by the romance - it will be squandered on the screen. Suppress the desire for World Cinema credibility - it will not be attained. Sandra, you will be given a nice haircut, but will be forced to mope around endlessly talking to yourself and will have to confess to loving the smell of a dog's feet. Keanu, you will be given poorly-written scenes of familial angst, made to wear turtlenecks, and shot to look doughy and white.<br /><br />Say NO! I'm begging you! Let this material find its true cast and natural form. Say no, and set it free. Let the script float around Hollywood for a few more years. Let Carrie Fisher doctor it into a comedy. Let Warners hire Penny Marshall to direct Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Greg Kinnear, while you guys go off and do what you do best - dramedies and speculative action/sci-fi - and wait for that serious, surprising film to come along that might finally take you to the Oscar podium. Because this certainly isn't it. Call the Coen brothers. Call Scorsese. At the very least, call Soderbergh or Clooney and see what Section Eight has on the slate - they always need quality ensembles and enjoy risky, against-type casting.<br /><br />I know this letter probably makes little sense. How can I change the past? Surely if I'm writing this, I saw the movie, which means you made it - heedless of my advice. But I'm hoping the idiotic time-shifting logic of the movie, in which actions in the future can change the bad things about the past without affecting any of the nice things in the present, will somehow hold. If I'm right, I'll be able to logon to Amazon tomorrow and find no trace of the DVD.<br /><br />Please take my advice. Please say no. Just let us all remember you together in "Speed", when you were both young and pretty and knew how to kiss.<br /><br />Fingers crossed,<br />Steve</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>This had the potential to be a very good movie.  Both Bullock and Reeves do a good job.  If you can suspend disbelief enough to accept the whole communication between time thing, then the plot is interesting (although a touch slow in development).  The problem is: they completely bombed on the ending.  I can't say too much because people will whine that I'm a spoiler but . . .  The movie had set up a great (but tragic) ending but, instead, they opted for the contrived happy-ever-after ending.  In one moment it went from a compelling story to sentimentalist fluff.  They did such a good job building up the conflict and they resolve it like this?  How disappointing.<br /><br />I would have given this 4 stars but for the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>most of this was just boring. There were a few good scenes but mainly my attention was in and out of the movie. I could spend 15min thinking about something else and come back and find out I hadn't missed anything.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>My mother recommended this movie to me with a big, sappy grin on her face. I shrugged and took it home to watch her copy, and the entire time I was watching it, I was thinking "Why did she buy this movie?" I won't be mean about this rating (although I laughed HARD at the one-star rating reviews--those folks should be poetry comedians with their metaphors for this film), but I will be honest. The movie is about two single people who currently have someone in their lives, but really don't want them to be there. Alex pretty much blows off the potential woman in his life, and Kate does just about the same in a harsher manner. They both end up living at a lake house two years apart and find out that both of them are traveling through time, one is going backwards and the other forward. There is a serious issue as to why they can't meet, but they can write each other. Will they eventually meet? Can they stop the serious issue?<br /><br />Pros: I thought the idea of writing a person you're interested in back and forth to get to know them nonphysically was such a great idea. If you can fall in love with a person's personality, chances are that it might be that much easier to fall in love with their looks (or at least accept them). From watching "Speed," I already wanted them to be together (in real life too) because I think they are a very attractive couple and have great chemistry onscreen.<br /><br />Cons: As soon as the birthday party happened, this movie lost me altogether. Who in their right mind goes to a party, sits outside with a stranger, slow dances out of nowhere, and then starts kissing with their boyfriend not even a few feet away? The restaurant issue made me go "So what?" I was frustrated because I couldn't understand a word that Kate's mother was saying because her accent was incredibly heavy. I could've cared less about Kate's boyfriend because his character was stoic.  To top it off, the movie was extremely predictable.<br /><br />MidPoint: I gave this movie two stars instead of one (even though I didn't care for it) because the casting directors picked the right two people to do this movie. No matter how much I didn't like the plot, I still like both of these actors and their relationship on camera. I also very much enjoyed the tree symbolism and the lakehouse was beautiful (although insane to have in Chicago weather). I wouldn't dare watch the movie again, but I can see why my mother would love something like this. People who like really sappy romance movies will probably enjoy this one. Dog lovers may like it too because this movie once again made me remember why I'm mad at my real estate company for not allowing me to have a big dog.  The dog in this movie was so cute! Five stars for the dog!</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>I finally turned it off.  It was one of the most boring films I've ever seen.

Though I don't mind fantasy films, this one was a real loser.  No ups and downs, just milk-toast plain all the way through.  The plot was thin and pretty silly, the characters didn't make sense, and neither did the romance.  But that foxy dog.  Him, I liked!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>THE LAKE HOUSE fails on so many levels that it's tough to pin down one thing viewers will dislike the most. Be it the multiple unexplained fantasy elements, or the lame acting, or the dumb-downed plot, this film will most likely make you shoot popcorn out of your nose, not in laughter, but because of incredulity.<br /><br />A time-traveling mailbox (and, apparently, canine) bind two lonely souls together at a lake house. The place was built by Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer, INSIDE MAN) for his now deceased wife. Being a successful architect, his sons fall into the family business too. One of these is Alex (Keanu Reeves, THE MATRIX), who purchases the house in 2004. Trouble is, though, the house is already owned ...in 2006. Not usually a problem, but apparently these two years in time are connected somehow. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock, CRASH) is the 2006 year owner and has just sold the place. She leaves a note for the new owner to send all mail to her forwarded address. But the mail gets picked up in 2004 by Alex, who's confused about the date she put on her message. When he sticks his reply in the mailbox, Kate picks it up ...in 2006, two years later. The two form an "across-time" romance, trying to meet up in Kate's year but failing. They do bump into one another in 2004 but neither realizes the importance of it.<br /><br />Okay, let's start with the basic problems: Why these two and why a mailbox? The two individuals chosen for this event may be overlooked as mere coincidence. But the mailbox? Please!<br /><br />Kate and Alex are separated by two years in time but brought together by the mailbox. The big issue here is that neither of them find this even remotely disturbing or incredible. They just accept it. The assumption must be that the script and director wanted to move on to the "more interesting" love story surrounding the two protagonists. The problem here, though, is that the romance is anything but interesting. It's distant (like the years that separate them), and rushed, and poorly acted. Bullock and Reeves had more chemistry in SPEED (that ought to tell you a lot!).<br /><br />Time travel movies are tough to pull off to begin with, and the challenge for most of them is avoiding the paradox they create. The Lake House doesn't even TRY to address this problem and simply plows ahead without considering the intelligence of its audience. For instance, at one point Kate (in 2006) goes to an architects office and discovers some disturbing news. She rushes out to try and prevent it from happening by sending Alex a letter. And they do avoid the disastrous event. The trouble is, though, is that if it's avoided, then there never was an event to begin with because Alex avoided it in 2004, thus, in 2006, there wouldn't have been this problem for Kate to worry about. Some may not be bothered by this, but many scientists must be pretty ticked-off that the film doesn't address this issue.<br /><br />And the final tragedy is the acting. Both Reeves and Bullock CAN act. We've seen them do it. But here they are bland, boring, and completely unsympathetic. Even Christopher Plummer's character seemed forced and poorly thought out.<br /><br />Need a sleep aid?

If you want to enjoy it, you must forget about logic, and be ready to overlook quite a few inconsistencies in the plot. Provided that you do exactly that, you will enjoy an engaging and thoroughly delightful romantic movie that will leave a smile on your face.<br /><br />From my point of view, the main theme of "The lake house" is the existence of a soulmate for everybody, and whether we are ready (and able) to wait in order to meet the person that completes us. Kate (Sandra Bullock), who along with Alex is one of the two main characters of this movie, asks herself the question everybody has asked himself at least once, "What if you live your life and no one is waiting?". I suppose the only valid answer is to have hope, and go on searching.<br /><br />But I digress... I would like to point out that for Kate and Alex (Keanu Reeves), the problem of meeting their other half is even more complicated than for us. You don't believe me? You can't conceive of someone with more problems than you in your search of the "right" person? Well, you should take into account  that Alex Wyler and Kate Forster have our same problems, but also need to struggle with the fact that they live at the same place, in different years. And yes, you read that well, but please remember you need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this film, if you want to enjoy it.<br /><br />The way in which Alex and Kate get in contact with each other, and fall in love, is strange, and whimsical. It doesn't make sense, but... when did logic become an obligation? "The lake house" is a magical movie that entertains, and can completely charm the right spectator. Are you that person? Are you interested in their story, and on whether they will overcome the obstacles before them in order to be together? If that is the case, just rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />All in all, I can say I really liked "The lake house", and I highly recommend it to those that like romantic films, and don't feel uncomfortable when fiction doesn't follow reality closely. This movie is not for everybody, but if you know what you are getting into and still decide to go ahead and watch, you will love it.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An extraordinary movie, The Lake House, brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who somehow manage to communicate through letters (and fall in love with each other) even though they are two... years apart!<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Lake House is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory.  Based on a Korean film 'Siworae' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn, Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him.  The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely, if a bit too uninvolving.<br /><br />Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital.  Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) currently lives in the lake house (we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate.  The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times, but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet, the riddles are unexplained, they fall in love over the distance of time, etc.  There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story.  A family discourse among Reeves, Plummer, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Henry, the other brother) never gels.  The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do.  In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful, thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography, and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine.  It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script, but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content.  Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine.

Time is no obstacle to love.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ---------- most excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>An American adaptation of Hyun-Seung Lee's film "Siworae," "The Lake House" charms its audience with a fairly innovative concept: sci-fi romance. (Yes, "Somewhere in Time," starring Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour, also toyed with this idea in 1980 . . . but few have done so since). Now, there are some very familiar strains heard in this film (both American and Korean). NONETHELESS, the "heart" of this movie triumphs over whatever cliches you might find.<br /><br />Moreover, I have read some complaints that the film is either A.) difficult to follow OR B.) inaccurate. Neither are true. Initially, you have to puzzle through "who is where" . . . but we are SHARING the characters' own confusion (it is meant to bond us to the film). Soon, the film clarifies (as the characters situations become clear to THEM) and we can enjoy the love-story:) And, yes, the writing makes perfect sense. If you have ever unraveled the physics of Kelly's "Donnie Darko" . . . or simply delighted in a time-travel film . . . you will understand HOW this all works out:) And, even if you have not done either of these things, I'm willing to bet that you will not get lost or frustrated with this film.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock portray their characters tenderly and convincingly. (They both just keep getting better-looking . . . which gives us thirty-somethingers hope for the future!!) Moreover, there is just enough tension in the film to keep the audience "guessing" . . . trust me. Ohhh, and did I mention the adorable canine who obviously has some pact with cupid?!!<br /><br />No, this film isn't perfect, but that hardly matters. Put your "intellect" on hold for an hour and a half, and just enjoy this film for what it is.  (Hide it from your girlfriend if you are too embarrassed to watch with her the first time through . . . and then share it with her later . . . don't forget the tissues!!)<br /><br />Frequently, I advise to see the original (especially after a cavalcade of bad Asian adaptations) but this one succeeds in its intended goal!! Kudos.<br /><br />If what you want is a genuinely romantic film (without pretense), then see this one:)</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' VERSION ***<br /><br />PRINT/EXTRAS:<br />1080p High Definition Print in 16 x 9 - 2.4:1 Aspect Ratio (will fill your screen without too much stretching)<br />There's "Additional Scenes And Outtakes" as a bonus and a "Theatrical Trailer"<br /><br />AUDIO:<br />Dolby Digital English 5.1, French 5.1, German 5.1 and English 2.0 Audio Descriptive Service<br /><br />SUBTITLES:<br />English, French and German<br /><br />I had "The Lake House" on the now defunct HD-DVD format to have Alejandro Agresti's gently persuasive film in High Definition - and it looked beautiful.<br />This Blu Ray is the exactly the same - right down to how the menus are laid out - and there's a superbly clear print also.<br /><br />Some people have said Keanu can't act for snitz (he plays frustrated architect and suburban home-builder Alex Wyler), but I don't know if that actually matters here, because his quite effortless charm carries it off very nicely indeed. Sandra Bullock is beautifully measured as Kate Forster, the caring, intelligent, but lonely doctor who is new in town and a bit out of sorts with the world (there is a believable chemistry between them).<br /><br />The support roles are nicely fleshed out too - the ever-accomplished Christopher Plummer is superb as Keanu's distant and overly-precise architect dad (who built "The Lake House") and the deeply beautiful Iranian actress Shoreh Aghdashloo plays Anna the head of ward in Kate's hospital. The boss/doctor relationship between them is deftly handled - both in the work scenes, in the lunch-breaks and in the bars after work...<br /><br />People have also poo-pooed the 'letters across time' storyline of Kate in 2006 and Alex in 2004, but I found it refreshing and a very clever angle in a romantic film that takes its time - and savours the lovely moments rather than squander them.<br /><br />"The Lake House" is a nice watch - and the Blu Ray print adds hugely to the cityscapes of downtown Chicago and the out-of-state location shots too. It may be a little too pat in places and even sedate for some - but I liked it - and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.<br /><br />And not a black leather suit, bug coming out of your navel or bendy bullet in sight...<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>The movie "The Lake House" is certainly a movie that challenges you to suspend your disbelief but it seems a majority of people seem incapable of doing so for this movie, yet are able to believe that a mystical force controls all things in the Universe (Star Wars), that a man can fly (Superman) or, gasp, that a truck can turn into a robot (Transformers).<br />For me this movie is pure fantasy and I have no problem taking it for what it is - namely a romantic movie with a supernatural element. I don't sit there and try and figure out how or why the mailbox works the way it does just like I don't sit there and wonder how the Enterprise reaches warp speed (Star Trek) or the man outraces the Sun (Mummy Returns).<br />The plot is basically a love story and rather than two people falling in love over the internet and e-mail they instead do it the old fashioned way and fall in love through snail mail. However the device of the time difference means that the two cannot simply meet face-to-face in a traditional date. The plot reminded me of a similar plot device in a TV movie I saw where two lovers corresponded the same way across centuries with the letters magically appearing in an old cabinet.<br />Take the movie for what it is and pick up this enjoyable, charming romantic movie on Blu-ray for under $10 (as of Nov. 13, 2009). The audio and video quality are far from steller, but they are better than on an upconverted DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The Lake House is a science fiction romance of two people separated by two years in time, but communicate with letters.  The letters are left in a mailbox at the Lake House where they both reside at different times.  The mailbox is the worm hole to both the past and future.  The first letter is from Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) to the new occupant Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) asking him to forward her mail if any is missed by the post office and the paw prints at the front door were there when she moved in.  She loved the house as she felt relief from stress there.  Alex also feels deeply about the house as his father (Christopher Plummer) designed and built it.<br /><br />Alex noted a stray dog left paw prints, but after the note from Dr. Forster.  He puts a letter in the mailbox asking how she could have known about this.  That is how the communication connects even though they are separated in time by two years.  Alex dates his letters 2004 and Kate dates hers 2006.<br /><br />The movie whipsaws you between time and also confusion on how the movie finally ends.  The threads of the premise do not make sense and this is obvious in the ending scenes.<br /><br />If the viewer can take the leap of faith on time travel and changing destiny you will have a good time watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>While I do enjoy my chick flicks and romances, I tend to be rather picky about them.  This was the type of movie I should have mocked, with star-crossed lovers spouting poetic descriptions without ever really telling all that much about themselves and the roll-your-eyes plot twists.<br /><br />And yet... there is just something about that ugly glass house on the lake and two people dwelling in it two years apart. I'm sure all hopeless romantics will agree.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock have great chemistry, even despite their lack of touching in this movie.  I still say that what keeps this movie going is the sheer concept. It's a neat idea, and I guess I appreciate them dwelling on the relationship rather than the mechanics. Indeed, there are a few loose ends and I think they made me like the movie all the more.<br /><br />The film has a rather quiet, rainy day feel to it that adds to the sleepily romantic mood and I found the score quite lovely.<br /><br />To put it simply, if you don't like chick flicks and sappy romances, you will hate this movie. If you're a hopeless romantic that loves the aforementioned, you'll probably enjoy this.  I know I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>The Lake House is a touching, moving and original story about `star-crossed-lovers', two strangers caught in an unexplained time rift, forced to communicate to each other only by written letters, whose relationship soon develops into true love, obsession and a battle against `fate'.<br /><br />The notion of changing historical events through time anomalies and accomplishing those changes has been explored in literature and film for many years.<br /><br />One of the most famous and currently almost forgotten tales of time-travel-love is H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. The entire purpose of the protagonist in the novel is to travel back in time to prevent the accidental death of his one and true love. Once creating his time machine, he travels back to the moment of his beloved's death only to come against `fate'; she was meant to die, and no matter what he does, the girl comes to her death despite the inventor's best efforts...fighting fate will always be a losing battle.<br /><br />In The lake House, this particular theme is a little less dramatic, however, is a modern love story about loneliness, falling in love with someone you have never actually met, the utter persistence of those in love to meet and finally be with them and the view that love, in its purest form, will overcome anything, including opposition, distance, and the passage of time.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock, though not sharing many scenes together, (mostly the dialogue between them in the form of their letters) managed to convey a certain emotional realism.<br /><br />In this film at least, Reeves appears to have matured as an actor: there is nothing forced or uncomfortable about this performance, he has grown in the craft and truly carried the character with believability and apparent ease.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock has shown time and time again that she is an "all rounder" in the profession. Her comedic roles are funny, sometimes hilarious, and her `serious' roles can and do stand up against the best actresses currently in vogue in Hollywood. There is an undefinable charm about Sandra Bullock, which, really, came through loud and clear in this film.<br /><br />The Lake House is entertaining for a `romance', as it places love against unusual circumstances, written, directed and edited with a simple idea in mind, and executed with skill and vision.<br /><br />4.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I give this 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />I rented this from my local On-Line DVD rental company, the one that lets you trade back your on-line rental for a free in-store rental, you know, the one that doesn't start with "Net."<br /><br />What a treat!  My wife requested this one as we walked through the New Release aisles.  I really love Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and was glad to see them reunited once again, as lovers.  The story was a tiny bit confusing, but that is okay, and I thought the cinematography was stunning.  I watched this on a very good computer monitor, up close, and thought the picturesque scenes were still wonderful (I normally watch it on my 55 inch HD screen.)<br /><br />I wish they had better character development of some of the side characters, but I think this was the director's intention.  I enjoyed seeing that one dude from Nip Tuck.  I'd like to see him in more big movies.<br /><br />I give this a rousing 5 stars, but round up form 4.5.<br /><br />MC White said:  Very good!</p></br></body></html>

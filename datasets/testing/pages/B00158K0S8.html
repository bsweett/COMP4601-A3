It`s so convincing that it glued me to the chair from the beginning till the end. It touches me deeply because Patton was revealed as a human being with both strength and weaknesses. From what I learnt from history books, the movie contains many facts too.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies that leaves a long lasting impression on me. No wonder, it won 7 Oscars in 1970 including the best picture.<br /><br />In short, it`s one the best that my money can get in terms of biography movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This is one of the very, very few great Hollywood movies about historical events and personalities in which hardly any liberties or revisionist history attempts have been made and yet the unadulterated "true" story is still so dramatic and exciting.  This movie is fully deserving of all 8 of the Oscars that it won and is not only among the top 5 war movies that I've ever seen but is also among the top 5 biopics that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Patton is shown, warts and all, with little attempt made at trying to sugar coat his colourful personality although this movie gives us a chance to see the other side of the story that we get of the man from the sensationalist press of the time.  Having served in the military myself, I actually fully appreciated what he did to the cowardly soldier and I know I wouldn't have apologised if it was me but Patton saw the bigger picture and knew that he was needed to continue achieving greater things and so did what he had to which really impressed me.  Although the film is almost 3 hours in length, I didn't feel it as that movie is just that good.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality is just excellent.  The THX Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option makes the sound quality very good and I couldn't easily find any imperfections with the picture quality making me thoroughly satisfied with this dvd version.  Although there are no special features worth mentioning, the picture and sound quality more than make up for this.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version of this film will be given that it is already so good on this standard version.  I also appreciated the Anamorphic widescreen effect which ensured that only about a fifth of my widescreen was blacked out unlike the pure letterbox format which means I'd have to squint as only half my screen is utilised.  I understand that different people have different opinions about the various formats but for me anamorphic works well enough.<br /><br />This is a great movie and the dvd is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Updated 6 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to append this here:  the blu-ray version of this great film is certainly worth the double-dip.  As good as the picture quality was on the dvd I reviewed above, 1080p actually improves upon it on this version.  The sound quality in DTS HD 5.1 surround is excellent too and is also an improvement over the dvd.  The special features aren't much to shout about and is not an improvement over that of the dvd but the combined improvement of both the picture and sound qualities makes this a worthy upgrade.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>It's to the much-deserved credit of the underrated George C. Scott--simply brilliant here--and director Franklin Schaffner that the celebrated general of "Patton's" title comes across more the tragic hero and less the right-wing nutjob, especially considering that the film debuted in 1970.  "Patton" is worth a look for that bit of storytelling finesse alone, but the film offers much more, effectively examining both the highs and lows of the headstrong general's World War II days.  Though it lacks the poetic grandeur of epics like "Lawrence of Arabia" or "How the West Was Won," "Patton" nonetheless operates on a big scale, and Scott's larger-than-life portrayal is never obscured by the production's legions of soldiers or frequent changes of scenery.  The script, co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, stays focused on the professional aspects of Patton's life--his devotion to duty, command, and career--and wisely avoids bogging down with diversions into romance or family life.  Some might find such an approach imbalanced, but most viewers will likely enjoy the "purity" of what is, for lack of a better term, a satisfying "guy's story."  Look for Karl Malden in a great supporting role as Omar Bradley, and enjoy Jerry Goldsmith's bombastic score, rivaled only by John Williams' Indiana Jones overtures.  Still, "Patton" is not without faults.  Military buffs may bemoan some technical inaccuracies, such as using tanks that don't fit the historical period; at times, the characterizations devolve into caricature, especially that of British General Montgomery; and some of Patton's borderline psychotic behavior--his various rages and obsessions with dreams and reincarnation--seem too easily dismissed as colorful idiosyncracies.  The DVD itself is rather bare for a film that received many Oscars, perhaps the biggest flaw of all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>~Patton~ played at our local movie theatre for more than six months. It was an immensely popular film upon its release, (1970) and continues to be one of the best biographical films of all time. There wasn't much to do in our small town on the weekends, so we just went to the movies. I must have seen this film over ten times during its long run, and I never grew tired of it. Years later, watching it again on video, reminded me how adept Franklin Schaffner was at making the Epic, which seemed to be the fashionable genre during the 60's and 70's. The list of his achievements includes, "The Boy's from Brazil", "Papillon" and "Nicholas and Alexandra". All great pictures, all great stories, which have that particular Schaffner style: epic-like, professional, and memorable with a lot of class. <p>It is common knowledge that George C. Scott won the Oscar that year for best actor and declined the accolade for political and artistic reasons. This proved to be a significant turning point in his career; in fact his career seemed to go down hill after that, and he never fully recovered. This was unfortunate because Scott's performance in Patton is a work of pure genius, and he deserved to go on to do more high profile parts. For a lot of us, when we think of the historical character, General George Patton, we think of the actor, George C. Scott. The film and Scott's performance have become our historical reference point for the time and the man. When I think of the Seventh and Third armies during WW2, I visualize the actor in the Schaffner film standing in his jeep barking orders and inspiring his men to carry on against impossible odds. And that's the beauty of this film; it is accurate both historically and biographically. Of course, artistic license is taken occasionally, but for the most part, according to most WW2 historians, the film is true to the mark. <p>This is not so much a war film but a story about a leader whom despite insurmountable obstacles, inspired men to great heights, achieving the near unattainable. Patton was an educated man from a distinguished military family, who viewed the world from an historical perspective - `old blood and guts' believed he was part of world history, an immortal soul that fought against the Romans, and later, was part of Napoleon's army that forged into Moscow in the early 19th century. Patton was a believer in reincarnation- the theory that knowledge can be `remembered', because the soul or mind has passed through a previous series of bodied and disembodied states. Whether this notion is true or not, Patton believed he had the accumulative knowledge from past lives and used this knowledge during his command in WW2. At the end of the film, one of the German characters comments that Patton was an anachronism, the romantic warrior of times passed, whom without a war to fight, would perish. This was certainly true. George Patton knew his purpose and destiny, and that was to lead men into battle. <p>Everything about this film is first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Patton was the best war movie of the 70's.  This film deals with Patton's career during WWII.  It begins with his Africa campaign and takes it through Italy and ends in Germany at the conclusion of the WWII.<br /><br />This film shows both Patton's brilliance as a general and his flaws of as a man.  Patton's was a man of passion and was more interested in what was most effective than what was politically correct (as in office politics not social politics).  His career is shown against his good friend Omar Bradley's career.  Bradley followed the rules and advanced quickly and surpassed the maverick Patton.<br /><br />George C Scott was a leading actor on stage but until Patton he was only a featured performer in movies.  This raw performance made Scott the first choice for these types of roles in the future (but he was better at comedy!)<br /><br />Karl Malden was already a star and Oscar winner but his performance of the by the books general lead him to a successful TV sereies.<br /><br />This is a well made film and for many involved was their finest hour.  One thing most people who are into film music unanimously agree is that Jerry Goldsmith's score was one of the greatest film scores ever.<br /><br />This is a well balanced film and well made.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Audio Essay on the Life of George Patton</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Patton is one of the most inspirational and interesting biographies ever produced on the big screen. Cast in the title role, George C. Scott won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but refused to accept the award because he didn't consider himself in competition with other actors. With brilliant direction, cinematography, visual effects, and an original musical score (by Jerry Goldsmith) - themselves all nominated for Academy Awards - Patton stacks up as one of the best films of all time from any genre...<br /><br />Patton follows the life of George S. Patton (George C. Scott), famous Allied tank commander from World War II. Beginning with his exploits in North Africa, Patton follows the career of this bombastic general through the D-Day invasion (in which he would act as a decoy), the Battle of the Bulge, and the liberation of Germany. Throughout the process, viewers are privy to the ongoing behind-the-scenes actions of a man famous for his temper and infamous among his peers for his insubordination.<br /><br />Along the way, Patton must learn to deal with his contemporaries, men such as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Michael Bates). Despite his display of military genius in the field of battle (garnering the fear of his German enemies), Patton is relieved from his post as Occupation Commander of Germany because of the many faults he exhibits. A military historian who believed he was destined for greatness throughout the ages, Patton loved war. In fact, once the war ended, he died within a few months when he was killed in a car accident...<br /><br />George C. Scott turns in a memorable performance as the large-than-life Patton. With an overpowering personality and a domineering will, George Patton led his men to victory in one of the most pivotal wars for freedom the world has ever witnessed. Politically-incorrect by every standard of today's measure, the real Patton wouldn't last a minute in today's military. Ironic, because that same military would acknowledge him as one of the greatest generals of its hallowed past! Nevertheless, Patton's legacy endures through our memories and through this film, and the lessons of his life continue to inspire people to this day (people who hopefully use a bit more tact and subtlety in asserting their desires)...<br /><br />Overall, Patton is a blockbuster film even by today's standards. Despite vast improvements in the realm of filmmaking, Patton (released in 1970) remains unrivaled in its portrayal of one of America's greatest heroes. The battle scenes are especially realistic, and decades before Saving Private Ryan, they vividly illustrated the serious horrors of war. One of the greatest films of the 20th Century, written about one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century, Patton is a definite must-see film for any serious aficionado of movies...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>PAtton was a man built for war, he was superintelligent and a man of honor. He was also ruthless and pushed his men to the extreme but he was up there with them. One of the best generals of the last few centuries by any reconing.  This film could have been a disaster but instead it was a masterpiece. From it's starting speech to it's final moments as the great warrior waits for more battles. This movie is even more remarkable in that it came out in 1970 when the military was hated by hollywood and they did smear jobs about it. Not that it's perfect mind you or that war is really glorious in reality. But that's how patton saw it and it's a good thing he did too. This movie looks great on blu ray and the print is free of dirt, the natural film grain is there but that's ok. Patton is a war hero and this film which one an oscar for the great late george c scott. (and it made him a movie star instead of just a character actor) is worth every penny . Unlike many other titles out there from this era they cleaned this one up for blu ray and it's worth upgrading to.  It's not going to be as sharp as movies made in the last 15 years but the blu ray looks great really. unlike the sad releases that I have seen such as 'rio lobo' or 'the horse soldiers' movies that have dirt all over the prints, even 'little big man' is a bad print on blu ray. THis one is NOT a bad print and a plus for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is one of the great all-time classics!!! And it's now on Blu Ray!!! The PQ and sound are incredible!

This is a 2 disc set with the film on Blu Ray on disc one and lots of special features on standard DVD on disc two.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I've been watching Patton about every other year since I was a child and have to say that the movie never gets old. As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel. The German General Staff scenes are speculative but unquestionably entertaining. I find Patton to be a fun and noble flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>To say it in few words: Patton is the most genuine state of epic spirit you feel since the first shots. The supeb visual impact you receive when Patton gives his speech with the american flag behind him still remain in our memory.<br /><br />What can we add underlying the superb performing of George C. Scott? . More than an actor, Scott was a model. You feel Patton and forget half an hour after to Scott, because he melts with the character and disappears before us, in a mesmerizing way that you could compare without any effort to Marlon Brando.<br />Franklin Schaffner was a talented director. Imagine the caleidoscopic twist that means going from The planet of the apes to Patton and ending with Nicholas and Alexandra.<br /><br />The camera' s handling , the brilliant sequences of the desert{s battle, the insights of the General are described and supported by a genial script.<br /><br />There's a worthy point which deserves to mention: the reflections of Patton when he's in the battlefield remembering that somehow he was there, reminding the echoes of the Greeks who fought centuries ago. It's a powerful metaphor but told with such kind of force that you remind to Alejandro Magno and Achilles with making use of the emotive memories.<br /><br />What has it happened then after this movie?<br /><br />Patton is an emblematic personality the hero' s essence encarnated in the middle of the XX Century.<br /><br />The epic sense reachs his goals through the great triumphs, the innovative strategies, that only you can establish another brilliant soldier who was Mc Arthur in the other side of the world.<br /><br />I' m sure that Moshe Dayan understood the essence of this General since his student days. I haven't seen any interview in this sense but somehow in my mind and in my spirit tells me that I'm right.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>General George S. Patton Jr. (1885-1945) was one of America's most outstanding generals and strategists during World War II, but his tendency to speak very candidly and crassly often got him into trouble with the public and higher ranking officers.  Labeled by newspapers as "Blood & Guts", Patton demanded discipline from every soldier under his command.  He loved to study about ancient battles and saw himself as one of many reincarnations of various warriors who had fought battles throughout 2000 years.  He loved war and knew nothing else.  Beginning in 1942, General Patton commanded forces in North Africa fighting against the occupying German forces under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.  Following victory in North Africa, he commanded the Seventh Army during the joint invasion of Sicily.  British forces that also invaded Sicily were under the command of the revered Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery.  Following the allied invasion of France in 1944, General Patton was given command of the Third Army and swept across France at record pace.  His juggernaut was also successful in relieving the beleaguered American troops trapped in the city of Bastogne, France.  He was also one of the first American commanders to discover the horrors of Nazi concentration camps.  Considered by many to be a prima donna, he had no tolerance for any soldier suffering from "shell shock" or "battle fatigue"; instead he labeled such as a coward.  He wrote a book entitled "War As I Knew It" that was first published in 1947, two years after his death from a car accident.<p>Based upon the two books "Patton: Ordeal and Triumph" by Ladislas Farago and "A Soldier's Story" by General Oman N. Bradley, director Franklin J. Schaffner created the film "Patton" in 1970 starring George C. Scott as the outspoken General Patton, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  (Scott refused to accept the Oscar on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be in competition with other actors.)  The film begins with Patton standing before a giant American flag and giving a speech to troops that have been placed under his command.  Following the speech, the film documents Patton's life between 1942 (when he begins fighting Germans in North Africa) and 1945 (shortly after the defeat of Germany).  <p>Aspects of the film that well depict General Patton were the competition that he felt with Field Marshall Montgomery (Michael Bates) and personality conflicts with General Bradley (Karl Malden). Of course, since the actual General Bradley consulted directly on the film, the portrayal of Patton could be regarded as being slightly biased.  Also depicted were Patton's slapping of a frightened soldier (Tim Considine) whom he also accused of being a coward, as well as candid comments made in Knutsford, England, that made Patton a public relations liability for the Allied Command.  Sadly, not shown in the film was the liberation of the concentration camp at Buchenwald by the Third Army.  There, General Patton was the first American commander to order nearby German civilians to tour a liberated concentrated camp: a precedent adopted by other American field commanders.<p>Franklin J. Schaffner received the Oscar for Best Director for "Patton" and the film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing.  It also received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Visual Effects.  At 170 minutes, the film does not seem too long.  Instead, the various battles were done very well and George C. Scott's excellent portrayal of General Patton is completely engaging.  Overall, I rank "Patton" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone.  General Patton was instrumental in the Allies' decisive victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This is one of the better movies that you will ever see.

This was a well done movie that won several Oscars because of it's quality. George C. Scott never played a better role in his whole career. Watch this movie and you will keep on watching it.

George C. Scott gives his greatest performance, and is backed by Karl Malden (best known to TV audiences as starring in "The Streets Of San Francisco"). Despite a number of historical errors (Patton & General Bradley are portrayed as best friends whereas in real life, didn't care much for each other & Patton's best friend was General Eisenhower, etc) and the toning-down of Patton's actual phrases, this movie is nevertheless a stirring account of Patton in World War II. He had guts and a lot of balls. Rated PG.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;Patton&quot; offers one of the great marriages of actor and role with George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of the notorious American tank commander.  As a film biography &quot;Patton&quot; forgoes the rise of the celebrated general and merely hints at his ironic death because of injuries suffered in a traffic accident, focuses entirely on his military career commanding troops in North Africa, Sicily and France during World War II.  The strength of the script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as of Scott's performance, is that the paradoxes of Patton are completely embraced.  Not even Patton's loyal cadre of staff officers can keep him from shooting off his mouth every time there are reporters around, but then neither German Field Marshall Rommel or English Field Marshall Montgomery can beat him on the battlefield.  Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley is just as solid as Scott's, presenting a man whose personality is the complete antithesis of Patton.  Viewers find themselves identifying with the German captain who is the intelligence expert on Patton and arguably the only person in the film who really understands or respects the American general.  But the more I watch &quot;Patton,&quot; the more I am very impressed with the battle sequences of director Franklin J. Schaffner (&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Pappillon&quot;), which were staged live and full-scale without special effects of miniatures.  Schaffner provides not just the large spectacle of a desert tank battle, but smaller and equally memorable moments, such as a soldier falling dead in the snow.  &quot;Patton&quot; deserved its Oscars.<p>In terms of extra features on this DVD, the second disc features the 1997 50-minute retrospective documentary, &quot;The Making of Patton: A Tribute to Franklin J. Schaffner.&quot;  Recent interviews with the cinematographer, composer, etc., are blended with audio interviews of Schaffner and Scott from 1970, newsreel footage of Patton, along with clips and publicity stills from the film make a fitting tribute to the late director.  The audio commentary on the first disc is really more of a lecture on Patton by Charles M. Province, the author of the book &quot;The Unknown Patton&quot; and founder/president of the General George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society.  Province more than adequately fills in what the movie leaves out about Patton's life.  On the second disc Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated musical score is presented in stereo, including alternate takes and a series of radio spots.  You certainly have to appreciate what Fox has put together here: This is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD priced as a regular DVD, a real treat for those of us who remember being mesmerized by George C. Scott giving that profanity laced opening speech standing in front of that giant American flag.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>When this movie was released, it was almost immediately recognized as one of the finest, most accurate and most sensational biographies ever filmed. The unique integration in "Patton" of such fine acting, such a wonderful  script, and the filming itself combined to make this a gorgeous film to  watch, be entertained with, and also learn from in terms of its historical  value as an absolutely superb depiction of a most controversial man and his  times. All that said, this is a movie best enjoyed with the kind of visual  clarity, terrific cinematography, and matchless Technicolor it offers by  way of DVD technology. <p>George C. Scott gives the performance of a  lifetime as the ego-drive, brilliant, and iconoclastic Patton, marvel of  the U.S Army, a man the Germans are convinced is far and away the single  best General the Allies have, and they watch him convinced he is the only  logical centerpiece for American plans for the impending invasion of  Europe.  Of course, they didn't understand the politics of the day, or the  degree to which Patton was his own worst enemy. Yet the progress of the  story on the screen convinces the viewer of the accuracy of the German  command's judgments of him; he is at once bold, brilliant, and innovative,  willing to improvise as he goes along to seize the opportunity of a given  moment, attempting to grab hold of the ever-present chaos of the situation  to transform it into an asset he can employ to gain advantage and win the  engagement. <p>Such men as Patton (and MacArthur and others) are uniquely  suited for war; they do not ordinarily fare well or survive with much  public acclaim during less extreme and bloodcurdling times. The fact that  Eisenhower, for example, succeeded so well as President is probably due  more to the fact that he was less a battlefield commander and leader of  "desperate men in combat" like Patton than he was a superb organizer and a  natural politician. The movie &quot;Patton&quot; is an investment in both  great entertainment and a colorful, dramatic, and educational video you can  share with your sons and daughters to help them understand better the  chaos, contradictions, and cruelties of war. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>George C.

Schaffner's control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...<br /><br />George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a 'character actor' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...<br /><br />Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...<br /><br />Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H.

He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...<br /><br />Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...<br /><br />The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans...

But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals...<br /><br />Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton's abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...<br /><br />Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it's officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...<br /><br />The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton's superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton's dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley's careful planning...<br /><br />With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel's 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis of Rommel's published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: "Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...<br /><br />Karl Malden has the film's only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...<br /><br />Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton's remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...<br /><br />Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a 'yellow,' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton's views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn't hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it's easy to overlook Patton's own final words in the film, "All glory is fleeting."<br /><br />Franklin J. Schaffner's motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about 'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,' who loved war...<br /><br />The Academy Awards saluted 'Patton' capturing eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor (Scott declined his well deserved Oscar), best screenplay, best editing, and best production design...</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>Anyone interested in the military history of the second world war or the life of George Patton will enjoy this work. It does a fair job in historical accuracy of the events that surrounded his contraversial career and demonstrates the character, flaws and all, that made him so. Though Mr. George C. Scott's voice matches the General's character more than his actual voice, the casting choice was otherwise a perfect match. A fantastic biographical work of the scrappy general.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>I've seen this movie more than once. In my opinion is one of the best war films focused on an historical character.<br /><br />Based on Ladislas Farago's biography, having General Omar Bradley as consultant and Francis Ford Coppola coauthoring the screenplay the film has a very solid base.<br />George C. Scott characterization is absolutely anthological. He earned the Oscar for this work. It is amazing, knowing the personal beliefs of the actor, how he was capable to flesh so vividly and accurately Patton's personality. Without overacting, he puts enough fire and at the same time deep sensibility to this contradictory warrior.<br /><br />The film opens with a speech given by Patton to his troops and follows the General from Africa to Germany, snap shooting him in almost every critical moment; reflecting his fears (to be hit by a bullet in the nose), his rages (with the soldier he repute as coward), his visions of the past (conducting the jeep to an ancient battleground), his sensibility (in front of his wounded soldiers), his indiscretions (giving an inconvenient speech in England). Recapitulating: all the complex mixture that compounded his career is present.<br /><br />Minor flaws of the movie: a very mild picturing of General Bradley (may be due to his counseling work), an exaggerated Monty's competition with Patton (it is more likely Patton feeling the itch) and last but not least inaccurate tanks showing up. The sum of all of them, casts a very small shadow onto this monumental film.<br /><br />If you are interested in WWII history or war movies you can't miss this one!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>What you have here is one of the better movies ever made, and certainly one of George C. Scott's greatest (though his greatest is still Dr. Strangelove). It is a well written, well shot, well directed (this is the man who made Planet of the Apes) film that won a great many awards. There are some great action sequences and some fine acting moments. <p>The dvd is a little weak. There are a few trailers: Tora Tora Tora and The Longest Day, which are good choices and and audio essay, but it never played on my dvd. I don't know if that is just my copy or a flaw in them all. And that's it. No featurettes, documentaries, nothing else. A film this great deserves a little more care in packaging the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>I knew that George C. Scott was a good actor, but you will never realize exactly how great he is until you see this film.  After seeing pictures of General Patton, it is hard to image the general without thinking of the actor.<p>There is some German and French in the movie, but there are subtitles or someone translating for you.  There is not enough to detract from the movie, but there is enough to keep the movie authentic.<p>This was not a war movie meant to build up the general as larger than life.  Here, you see not only the fire of Patton, but the pathos of a man trying to succeed in a world that he wasn't born for.  In the movie, they point out that he seemed to be ready for the sixteenth century.  He also mentions that he was at many of the historical battles.  With his extensive reading, I do not doubt it.  Although he tries to play politics, he really isn't ready for it.  His forte is battle and seeing him held from it hurts the viewer as well as Patton.<p>I did like the ending of him walking his dog, but I was expecting the rest of the movie.  I do not know why it was omitted.<p>I would strongly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a long but interesting character study of a real-life person: General George S. Patton, probably the most famous military men of World War II.  Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!<br /><br />How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.<br /><br />Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.  As for special-effects, the explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now approaching 40 years old.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you enjoy character studies, this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6-minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That, and the rest of his performance and this movie in general, is one you won't forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>PATTON opens with George C Scott's famed six minute monologue as  General George S Patton addressing troops. This segment alone is enough to convince viewers that Scott deserved his Oscar- even if he himself didn't want it. He gives a superlative performance as the hard-assed and fearless General who is the only US General truly feared by the Nazis: Ironic considering Patton  had his nose shot off by the Germans. The man thinks nothing of shooting fatigued pack horses and dumping them into a river because they no longer serve their purpose to him. But although he is referred to by his men as "old blood-and-guts" ("Our blood, his guts") Patton still manages to hide an almost fatherly love towards them (the scene where Patton tends a wounded soldier in hospital and then reverts to his hard-nose self and begins beating up on the poor guy for being a coward. And later in fearless mode to one of his superiors "I shaved very close this morning, in preparation of getting smacked by you".<br />The battle sequences are well staged. In fact not a single frame of PATTON's 2 1/2 hours that doesn't detract the viewer's interest. If high school history had been this interesting, maybe I would have passed.<br />My only complaints with the movie: What's with the stupid intermission two-thirds of the way through the film? And second, it seems Jerry Goldsmith later recycled a portion of his score for the POLICE ACADEMY movies. Now if that isn't an insult to cinema history, then what is?</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>I've watched Patton several times before however it was mostly on the Pan And Scan video versions.  I was just amazed at what I was missing when I finally got the widescreen version of this movie.  They did an excellent job of bringing this film to DVD.  The sound is fantastic and the picture clarity is top notch. This movie is certainly one of the best movies out there.  As for people who say this movie slams the British and is historically inaccurate they're wrong.  One of the main advisors for this movie was General Bradley and it was almost lifted word for word out of his book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Beautiful,Patriotic and well done. George C. Scott did A Great Service. Patton should be viewed by my generation, A Great Movie about a Great General,A Great Man. Most War Movies focus toO much on silly false pretenses and the liberal anti-war message instead of focusing on what is real and sometimes inevitable. Patton is One of If not THE BEST War Movie in my Opinion I have seen.HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Director Franklin Schaffner's 1970 film, Patton, is a film that falls just shy of overall greatness, unlike his previous film, Planet Of The Apes, even though both had excellent scripts, were unconventionally shot, had great acting performances, and were films that fundamentally altered their subgenres, biopics and science fiction. It is a film that, while it's clearly not a great film, does not offer up an obvious reason. It starts off brilliantly, with Patton's famous address to the film audience, and then, well, becomes, in many ways, a routine biopic- at least when it's not about Patton directly, for George C. Scott owns the screen like few actors ever before him had. No, it's when we see other characters, or the big battle scenes, that the film becomes pedestrian. And that 20% or so of pedestrian film lowers the rest of the film's inarguable greatness to merely near-great status.<br /><br />  Patton is not a great film, but in its flaws it delineates much of what a great film can be, and just how little of that needs to stem from the idea of a visionary or an auteur. As such, and along with Casablanca, it stands as one of the great arguments against the notion that films of quality must be wrought from the power and inspiration of a singular source. Franklin Schaffner, in fact, is proof that great art can come from people who are not gifted with innate greatness, just as the real General George S. Patton proved the opposite can also be true, and the two ideas not mutually opposing. As for the film, watch it for Scott's performance, watch it for a sense of American history (pro and con), and watch it because it's great entertainment, if not great art. Not all art need core into one's soul, sometimes pricking the flesh is enough. As such, Patton's a great prick.</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>Patton is an all time favorite of mine.  I have now owned five video incarnations of this movie, from Magnetic Video VHS to CBS/FOX VHS to widescreen laserdisc to the THX DVD 2 disc edition to this latest edition.  Here is the bottom line comparing the two DVD editions:  This new edition's color is slightly better than the previous THX edition.  This edition shows a bit more of the bottom of the frame, but a bit less of the left side.  This edition's sound is markedly better than the THX edition.  However the THX edition has a MUCH sharper video transfer...the best examples are the details visible in the closeups of Patton's right arm saluting the camera and the medals on his uniform, all at the beginning of the movie.  You can count the hairs on his hand and see many more medal details in the THX edition.  So Fox has yet to put together the definitive video transfer, which will hopefully be corrected when they finally release this in (whichever) high definition format.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Reading a lot of the reviews to this film the writers appear to be students of World War II.  I am not personally but I can attest to the excellence of this film probably because I viewed "Patton" more as a character study than as a war film per se.  For sure director Franklin J.Schaffner stages the war footage magnificently.  Where this film succeeds is twofold.  Firstly in the terrific script by a young Francis Ford Coppola and a later assist by Edmund North.  By focusing on George S. Patton and explaining the contradictions that were the man Coppola and North have crafted a portrait of a warrior whose actions would deceive you into thinking he was a warmonger.  Secondly you have an absolutely spellbinding performance by George C. Scott.  Scott has you mesmerized throughout and your eyes never leave him despite the bombast that surrounds him.  For sure Scott demonstrates the maverick side of the man but he is equally effective in the quieter pensive side of Patton.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the commentary track by Coppola.  Coppola offers insight into the genesis of the project and has the forbearance to be quiet during crucial moments in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WORLD WAR TWO MOVIES MADE.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>I've seen Patton several times and each time it has the power to move me. Here is a man who is quite complex, who certainly had his flaws but also helped the Allies win World War II with his seat-of-the-pants intelligence and bravery. He was certainly far from PC. At the same time, he had deeply seated ideas about honor and bravery.<br /><br />There are amazing moments in here which are a far cry from modern "blue screen" computer generated scenes. You can feel the heat rising off the desert, feel the mix of emotions as the starving locals strip the dead bodies of their clothing. You get the sense of the sludge and despair of troops bogged down in combat. Patton isn't just craving glory - he actually does care about the soldiers who are stuck. He doesn't preach at them from a high mountain. He jumps down into the thick of it and shoulders the burden with them.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that Patton wasn't always making the best decisions. On the other hand, the scene with the donkeys blocking the convoy stands out to me. You could feel sorry for the donkeys he shot - and you also can scream that someone should have done it long before he got there, to save the men from dying! He cuts through the red tape and does what he feels needs to be done. In most cases he's right.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants a fairly balanced view of what war can really be like. It's not just glory and power. It's also about hard decisions and getting caught up in political and press-created confusion.<br /><br />George C. Scott richly deserves all the kudos for the intense effort he put into nailing this complex character.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>A daring film enterprise at the height of the anti-war and anti-military sentiment in this country, the film seemed to satisfy those who supported the military and those opposed to it. George C. Scott embodied Patton fascinating both audiences who seemed transfixed with a fine script and superior performances of all players. Patton's genius was praised and his neuroses were exploited by those who felt he personified military immorality.<br /><br />Several viewpoints of Patton' personality and leadership are explored. His staff seem sychophantically loyal, and his soldiers appear to love him or hate Old Blood and Guts (Our blood, his guts)! Eisenhower's chief of staff Bedell Smith couldn't stand Patton, and Patton had a running competition and animosity for Bernard Law Montgomery. Karl Mauldin, plays Omar Bradley who first serves as his assistant division commander and then his superior. Bradley is portrayed as the benevolent and unassuming general who challenges the morality and military wisdom of Patton's decisions.<br /><br />The Germans seem to be unanimous in their esteem for Patton's audacity and military prowess. When Patton is relieved of his command for slapping a soldier, he is assigned to Sardinia, then Malta, then Cairo, and finally to England opposite the Pas-de-Calais where the allies set up a fictitious army around him. The Germans cannot believe that the best allied commander would actually be relieved for slapping a soldier, and they actually moved troops around the Mediterranean in anticipation of Patton attacking in Sardinia, through Greece, and at the Pas-de-Calais.<br /><br />Standing at 6'1," George C. Scott seemed better at Patton than Patton did who matched him in height but had a high-pitched voice. Scott played up Patton's lack of verbal impulse control, his iron discipline (he was famous for fines), a lack  of patience with subordinate officers, and for slapping a soldier. (Actually, he slapped two). The viewer gets the impression that Patton is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny. His performance is so effective that people will proably remember Scott as Patton rather than Patton as Patton.<br /><br />Detractors of this movie say that Patton was far more caring of his men than the script allowed. He was liberal with passes, ensured that mail arrived regularly, and that showers and hot food were provided more often than in any other command. He only relieved one general for cause as opposed to Bradley who relieved several. He was always found in front of his men rallying them from the side of the road or walking among them offering us an impression of a man whose bark was worse than his bite. There is no doubt that he instilled pride in his troops and made them believe they were invincible against any enemy.<br /><br />In spite of the movie's detractors, everything about this production is phenomenal and George C. Scott in a defiant Patton personna, refused the Oscar for best actor that Ryan O'Neil panted for in "Love Story." (Well, love is never having to say you're sorry). It has withstood the test of time as being an all-time military classic.<br /><br />The speech he gives at the beginning of the film is a compilation of many of the salty and foul-mouthed expressions he made over his career. This part is not to be missed, along with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Charge into this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I have just seen this film in the Blu-ray format and it is superb!! A previous reviewer complained about the lack of grain in the film but that's what made the transfer so great!! Also there is a brief introduction by Francis Ford Coppola before the film starts and it is very insightful about his experiences in gathering information for this classic film.  The transfer, as I stated before, is excellent and duplicates the experience of having seen it in the 70mm format (2:20) in the theatre.  Although the film borders very close to 3 hours, this is one of those films that you wish could last a little bit longer (Scott was dissatisfied with the film and refused the Oscar,later did a TV film version of Patton's last days).  So if you're already a fan of this classic, I do recommend getting this in Blu-ray --I will very shortly!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Some films, no matter how great they `were', just don't hold up over time.  I'm sure that, at the time of its release, `Patton' was a stellar film.  In fact, I know it was.  The film won seven Academy Awards (although, I know of a recent Oscar winning film that wasn't stellar upon its release, so I guess the Oscar's are not the perfect judge of quality) and has been hailed as one of the best biographical war movies of all time.<br /><br />I don't know, to me, it just felt `cheap'.<br /><br />Despite a blisteringly good performance by George C. Scott (I really love this guy as an actor, for he can really do just about anything), the film falters for me in scope and construction.  While the development of Patton himself is quite good, I found that everything going on around him felt cluttered, sloppy, confusing, rushed and, well, cheap.<br /><br />And I totally understand the detractors that call this movie boring, for at nearly three hours it does ride at a slow pace for the most part.<br /><br />While I am not a huge fan of war films to begin with, I am a very big fan of the biopic and an even bigger fan of the slow, brooding character study.  Sadly, even my patience was tested in parts.  Some films really stretched themselves and delivered something that was `ahead of its time'.  `Patton' is the type of film that feels outdated by the time the decade was over.  It feels like a poorly made `Television Movie' to me, and that is never good.<br /><br />When you consider the types of war films that came out in the late 70's you have to wonder why this particular film wasn't...better.<br /><br />Still, George C. Scott is a marvel here, and his performance does elevate the film in many areas.  As much as I wanted to end my viewing early on many occasions, it was Scott who kept me glued to the television.  `Patton' is far from a great film (as one friend once said to me, great movies are the ones that `hold up' over time) but it sports an astonishing performance and does carry with it some intriguing history.  It is a film that is worth watching at least once.  I understand good and well that entertainment and the enjoyment it brings is purely subjective, and our own personal situations, emotional crutches and whatnot all play a big part in what we find enjoyable, moving and shapes what we consider masterpieces.  So, I totally understand why so many adore this film.<br /><br />I hope that you can understand why I didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>War certainly does not take a holiday vacation. It is well to remember that one of the key battles of World War 2 (The Bulge) came during pre Christmas, 1944. It could easily have been George Patton's finest hour. This strange, enigmatic leader set two goals for himself-total victory and total self aggrandizement.Brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (who refused the Oscar), Patton seemed from the outset to do things his way, as he had in overcoming dyslexia. He came from a moneyed California family and was most certainly not accustomed to being told what to do. His learning in tank warfare helped revolutionize the corps itself. When war came, Patton was certainly ready for it. But is warfare really ever ready for the George Pattons of the world? Indeed, the Nazis respected him more than many Americans. This reviewer certainly cannot see Patton succeeding under President Truman, nor any other Europeaan chieftain except Eisenhower.In any event, "Patton" is certainly filmaking at its best, even if the subject matter may not be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Winner of 8 acdemy awards including best picture and best director for Franklin J.

Schaffner and starring George C. Scott won eight Academy Awards.  It is the story of the famous General George Patton, one of the most successful and feared generals in WW2.  He believed in the glory of war and often quoted the classics, believing that he was reincarnated from some of history's most famous military leaders.  He cursed a lot and was, at the same time, deeply religious and there is no doubt that he cared about the men under his command. Relentless in battle, he believed in discipline and hated cowardice.  The press made a big thing about how he slapped a soldier who was crying, forcing Patton to make a public apology for that incident.<p>This was George C. Scott's greatest role and it is interesting to note that he refused his Academy Award for best actor because he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors.  He was larger than life in every single scene of the 171 minute epic and came across as intended - stubborn and unlikable and a bit of a nut job.  I never could either admire or feel any empathy for him as a person although I was glad that he won the battles. However, in spite of the battle scenes as well as his frequent confrontations with authorities, I found myself bored.  Maybe this was because I knew that he would win the battles and therefore found little dramatic tension.  The video was much too long and I actually fell asleep several times.  I wanted to like the film better, but unfortunately couldn't.<p>I can't help thinking about the times in which this film hit the theaters. The Vietnam War was raging and there was a huge anti-war backlash.  Patton had to be considered the epitome of what was then called a &quot;hawk&quot; who raged about the glory of war in spite of the agony of the men who had fallen in battle.  This film was not just about WW2; it was about all war.  And it dared to glorify war itself without sugar coating it as fighting for what is right and mom's apple pie.  The appeal of the film was that it made people look at their own perceptions of war, a debate that was already on everyone's agenda.  Perhaps that it what made it so popular at the time.  It must have also played better on a big screen than my tiny TV. The film is important only for fans of war films, as it is a classic in that genre.  For all others, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>It's fantastic transfer picture look shrap .. i can tell 5/5 .

He wears many rings and medals, and two ivory-handled revolvers. He gives a speech on the need for winning. "America will never lose a war." [Was this from an actual speech?] They show North Africa, the Kasserine Pass in 1943 Tunisia. People scrounge for goods among the battlefield. Major General Bradley looks over the area to check the reports. He needs a tough tank commander to do better. Patton arrives to inspect the soldiers. The American forces had inferior equipment (no mention of less experience). Patton plans on more discipline for the soldiers.<br /><br />An air attack provides drama. Where is the air cover? A message tells of a planned attack by Rommel. [The British broke the German code and could plan ahead.] The Americans dig in to await the attack. [No air cover? The battle scene is staged to minimize the number of actors.] The Americans and British win. Where will they attack next? Patton has a plan to take Palermo in a flanking attack. He offers his respects to the Cardinal (he knows politics). Patton wants another attack behind enemy lines so he can capture Messina first. Later he visits an Army hospital and slaps a patient who appears to be unwounded. [In fact that soldier was suffering from malaria.] The Allies parade through Messina. Ike orders Patton to apologize for slapping a soldier; he does so.<br /><br />In Corsica Patton pays tribute to the Free French forces under Generals De Gaulle and Le Clerc. Ike has to fight the enemy and keep the allies together. Patton will take part in a deception designed to draw German forces to the Pas de Calais. Did he insult our Russian allies? [Are there forces out to get Patton?] Patton is given command of the 3rd Army for a flanking attack. Bradley explains the strategy to Patton, the target is the rockets launched against London. Patton notices the use of carts by the Germans, their end is near. [A shortage of oil and gasoline.] The Battle of the Bulge halts their advance. Patton's forces race to Bastogne to attack the enemy. Will prayer help? Clear weather brings air cover. Patton is cool at a victory celebration. What will he say? Does he guard his tongue? Is he out of his mind? [Did somebody think he outlived his usefulness?] "All glory is fleeting."<br /><br />After four decades I note how this film is padded to fill out its three hours. This is one film that isn't as impressive as when first seen. Did this film try to improve Patton's image? George C. Scott refused to accept his award for this film. Scott later starred in a sequel that provided another view of Patton but it wasn't as successful. People like a movie with a happy ending that makes them feel good. Your opinion may vary. This film glides over Patton's reactionary politics and presents him as a colorful character. What other general ever slapped a patient in a hospital? Could he have been suffering from some disease?</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>I have probably watched the movie Patton at least twenty times, if not more.  I've seen theatrical, VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray versions.<br /><br />The original film presentation in the theater, on VHS, DVD, and my old CRT TV was muted, grainy, and diffuse.  It is the image quality I distinctly picture in my mind for the movie.  The Blu-ray transfer though was anything BUT muted, grainy, and diffuse.  Regardless how the images have been scrubbed, the movie looks as if it was shot yesterday.  The images are sharp, clear, and bright.  At times the colors on the closeups are a bit too saturated, but not so much to be distracting unless you are a film purist.  When I popped the BD in the player to show my non-purist friends the Blu-ray version, without exceptions their only word was "wow," quickly followed by "how'd they do that?"  I thoroughly enjoyed the Blu-ray version of the film and count it as one of the showpieces of my HD library.<br /><br />The DTS surround sound is acceptable, a nice rendition from a time when surround sound was not the standard.  If you are a film purist, don't buy the Blu-ray.  If you merely enjoy clear, sharp images that give a familiar favorite a newly painted look, like a restored antique, buy the Blu-ray version.  You'll feel like you're watching the movie again for the first time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>One of the great movies of the 1970's was "Patton" with an outstanding preformance by George C. Scott.  It was a bit controversial at the time because it was shown to a general public that was seriously divided over the on-going Viet Nam War.  For many, the movie represented a glorification of war while, for others, it represented the power of the individual.  It was a favorite of then-President Nixon (which was another mark against it for some).  What it was for most of us was an excellent historical biography that displayed the best that Hollywood had to offer.<br /><br />There was a lot of technical achievement in the film and it won Oscars for Art/Set Direction, Sound, and Editing while losing out to "Tora! Tora! Tora!" in the category of Special Visual Effects.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of the film was George C. Scott's title role performance.  He vividly portrays a determined, emotional, passionate man whose quick tongue and temper got him as much time in the dog house as in the spot light.  The movie portrays the dilemna of a brilliant general leading a citizen army.  No problem with the troops but they all had families and congressmen who seemed to have better ideas on how to do things.  Patton, the ultimate warrior, died shortly after WWII.  His portrayal in this movie makes one wonder if that wasn't for the best; who could imagine a peacetime Patton after what he had experienced?<br /><br />"Patton" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (a relatively obscure Franklin Schaffner), Best Writing (Francis Ford Coppola) and, as no surprize, Best Actor.  George C. Scott actually declined the award although without all the hoopola of Marlon Brando.  Karl Malden gives an excellent preformance in his supporting role as General Omar Bradley.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this movie in many years until just recently.  Frankly, something about it seemed to have lost a bit of its' luster.  However, I watched it so many times back then that I could practically say the lines along with Scott.  More likely it was because the political and military climate had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.  Oddly, maybe this was a movie that was released at just the right time.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Without question, "Patton" should be regarded as one of the great films depicting World War II, if it isn't already. Much has been written elsewhere about George C. Scott's riveting performance as U. S. Army General George S. Patton, but I shall note too that Scott's Academy Award-winning performance is one of the most memorable I've come across in biographical films. Scott successfully portrays all of Patton's contradictions, from a brash, often insubordinate, military commander to an insecure, often shy, person in private. But Scott's definitive portrayal of Patton is due too in large measure to the superb script written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and the excellent directing by Franklin Schaffner, whose other great films include "Planet of the Apes" and "Papillion". Karl Malden's no-nonsense portrayal of U. S. Army General Omar Bradley is a perfect dramatic foil to Scott's complex portrayal of Patton. And not to be missed either is the memorable Academy Award-nominated film score composed by Jerry Goldsmith, featuring his familiar signature theme for General Patton.<br /><br />Admittedly the movie doesn't closely adhere to the truth regarding some of the details behind the campaigns which Patton led his soldiers in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany, sacrificing veracity for dramatic impact and excellent cinematic storytelling. But it correctly notes his keen interest in reincarnation - he believed that he was once a great Roman general - and his insistence on absolute obediance by those serving under him, while he was all too willing to criticize his superiors and colleagues like American generals Bradley and Eisenhower and British general Field Marshal Montgomery. Towards the film's end, Scott's mesmerizing portrayal of the general shows how much Patton greatly disliked his Soviet counterparts, believing correctly that Eastern Europe was about to pass from the grips of one evil empire to yet another. From Patton's brash, foul language-laced speech which opens the film to the final scenes, "Patton" will command your attention, if not admiration, for the greatest American general of the 20th Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Don't be mistaken: this classic war movie is not so much about war as it is about a man: General George S. Patton, arguably America's greatest Second World War combat general.  Based on two books about Patton ("Patton: Ordeal and Triumph" by Ladislas Farago and "A Soldier's Story" by General Omar Bradley), the movie explores the war within his soul, and the temperament that was his undoing and yet brought him unprecedented success. Limited to his military career between early 1943 and late 1945, it's more of a character study than a biography.  But with a running time close to three hours, it's a character study with tremendous depth.<p>Several aspects of his character are highlighted.<br />1. Patton was fiercely competitive.  His race to beat British Field Marshall Montgomery to Messina and then to Berlin becomes a prime motivator for success, even if he needs to sacrifice men to achieve his personal ambitions.<br />2. Patton loved war and thrived on the heat of battle.  While his compatriot General Omar Bradley did his job because he was trained to do it, Patton did it because he loved it. "I love it, God help me, I do love it more than my life." Patton had no political ambitions, and his only fear was that the war would have no role for him: "All I want to do is command an army in combat." As his German opposites observed, "The absence of war will kill him."<br />3. Patton was a passionate military historian.  His love for military battles of the past constantly becomes evident: "Patton is a 16th century man, a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times."<br />4. Patton was intensely religious.  He believed in both God and reincarnation, and was convinced that the lines of history were in place for him to achieve great things, and that God would enable him to fulfil his destiny - "The last great opportunity of a lifetime and I'm left out of it? God will not allow it to happen."  Yet his fierce religious fervour towards God was juxtaposed by his profanity towards men.  He frequently blasphemed, one incident in particular bringing out these conflicting qualities, when in reply to a question about the regularity of his Bible reading, Patton remarks "Every God-damned day."  It's been said that the raw language typical of Patton is even toned down in the movie (he supposedly once said "You can't train a platoon without using profanity").  Yet his inclination toward profanity is not excused, but is presented as part of a larger problem he had in controlling his tongue.<br />5. Patton was inspirational.  He knew it was natural for soldiers to fear battle, and combated this with a fierce military discipline that made the soldiers fear him instead.  "They'll lose their fear of the Germans ... I hope to God they never lose their fear of me."  "I won't have cowards in my army."  The inspiring and bloodthirsty monologue that opens the movie with Patton dwarfed by the American flag is unforgettable: "No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country."<br />6. Patton himself lacked the discipline he expected of his soldiers.  His moments of lax self-control led him to say and do things that got him into serious trouble with both his superiors and allies.<p>These last aspects are especially important.  The movie almost has the aura of a convincing documentary, because it paints Patton with his virtues and vices. This is one of the movie's strengths: it portrays Patton as he was, with both strengths and weaknesses, without openly glorifying or condemning them.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner stated in 1970 "We are not defending General Patton, and we are not attacking General Patton.  We are really telling the true story of one of the most fabulous and interesting characters that I have ever observed in action."  More than anything else, it's a serious study of his complex character.  This war within the man overshadows the war outside the man.  Patton was his own worst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion. Great as he was, he was not without weaknesses, but his failings are shown without excusing them.  In fact, Patton's weaknesses were the reason Eisenhower opted to advance General Omar Bradley ahead of Patton, although Patton was always his first choice when a brash military leader on the field was needed for a particularly bold mission. Despite his weaknesses, Patton was truly inspirational to those who served beneath him and the importance of his contribution to the Allied success is undeniable. <p>At times the story goes beyond the man, with a broader focus on the war effort.  First Patton and Montgomery vie for success against Rommel in Sicily, and then again in Europe.  But the war scenes are always on a large scale, with wide angle shots of explosions, tanks and masses of infantry, rather than individual experiences of horror.  In the end, it is not the world war that is center stage, but the complex character of the man Patton, and the war between his passions.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is brilliant and one of the memorable performances in cinema.  It's not surprising that the movie went on to win seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It has that epic "Lawrence of Arabia" feel, and it serves of a lasting testament to the confusing personality of a strange yet important military leader: Patton himself. -GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>'I would be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle....anytime....anywhere'.  And with that line....Patton is personified.  The commandant of the rampaging 3rd army is a fascinating character study....a general who was fascinated by battles past and had no political ambition after the war.  He simply wanted to lead an army to glorious victory...which he did brilliantly.  George C Scott portrays the gregarious Patton and plays it to perfection.  The voice, uniform, swagger,  its all there.  He truly becomes Patton and won a well deserved Academy Award for best Actor.<br /><br />  Not to be missed,  its truly one of the greats.</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>George C. Scott's finest performance as the larger-than-life General Patton. Apart from Patton's military career, this film tries to uncover who the man really was. The genius of modern warfare? A romantic warrior from another time? Or perhaps a crackpot? Perhaps Patton was all of these and more.<p>Even in the massive scope of WWII this film keeps Patton firmly at the center. Regardless of his historical contributions to the war effort, we see him as the stuff of legend -- the kind of epic hero about whom poets like Homer used to sing.<p>As we follow his breathtaking career from the North Africa campaign to the end of the war, we see how Patton's ongoing collisions with the Nazis rivaled those against his own soldiers and superiors.Here was a man who only found purpose in warfare and who almost failed to appreciate it's painful, human element.<p>In the end, Patton triumphs, only to acknowledge that he is just playing a part in a historical drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Starring George C. Scott (Gen. George S. Patton) and Karl Malden (Gen. Omar Bradley), this impeccable war movie describes the impact that General George Patton had on the U.S. Army after 1943.  Following the disaster at Kasserine Pass, in which American armor and strategly was thoroughly outclassed by the Germans, the Americans realized that a new commander was needed to command their armored units.  Patton was chosen, and his impact was felt immediately by the Germans, and he didn't let up until he was relieved by General Eisenhower.<br /><br />From 1943 until the surrender of Germany in May, 1945, Patton and his vaunted 3rd Army group harassed the Germans from Sicily to France.  He is responsible for driving his group one hundred miles in two days to rescue the trapped 101st airborne troops who were surrounded at Bastogne, and he led his troops on a brilliant drive through France and into Germany itself.<br /><br />This film does an excellent job of portraying the flamboyant Patton.  His numerous run-ins with his rival British General Montgomery are well-portrayed, and his battles with the press and his American superiors are explained in great detail, as well.  Perhaps the defining scene of the movie is when Patton is visiting a field hospital and he encounters an American private who is suffering from battle fatigue.  Patton slaps the soldier across the face and has him removed from the hospital and sent directly back to the front.  Word of this action eventually got back to Eisenhower, and Patton was made to apologize to the soldier and his entire Army.  This event followed Patton for the rest of his career.<br /><br />George C. Scott and Karl Malden give excellent performances in their roles as Patton and Bradley.  Scott's portrayal won him an academy award for best actor, while Malden's portrayal of Bradley, the "soldier's soldier", is the perfect antithesis to Scott's fiery portrayal as Patton.  The evolution of the friendship and mutual respect that developed between Patton and Bradley is handled extremely well, also.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest war movies I've seen.  Scott's acting is impeccable, and the historical accuracy, right down to Patton's ivory-handled pistols and his intense hatred for not only the Germans, but the Russians as well, is told with a remarkable flair that will keep the viewer glued to their screen.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how one man personally changed the course of the war against the Germans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>...And I don't mean "Hollywood" as an insult.  This *is* a glossy Hollywood big budget epic.  That's not inherently bad.  But for a while there was talk of John Wayne getting the role of Patton.  Seriously, can you imagine that?  It makes me shudder.  "I want you buckeroos to know that no pilgrim ever won a war by dying for his country.  You better believe it or you're dead where you stand, son."  God help us.  Fortunately, saner heads prevailed.  Fortunately, studio executives actually decided to go with the one script (six were written) that was closest to the truth and didn't glorify or exaggerate.  Fortunately, George C. Scott existed to play the part.  Who else could have been Patton?  I don't think there was or is another actor.  He was born for the role.<p>What makes this film special is indeed how they stayed so close to the facts, starting with the masterful script, thoroughly researched and written by a young USC grad named Francis Ford Coppola.  Then they combined the great script with great care in how the people, the places, and events looked, down to the smallest details in costuming and set design.  Yes, a few ugly facts are glossed over, such as Patton's anti-semitism (actually not at all uncommon in the military then), but overall this film plays straight and fair with the facts, and you realize how dull history was the way they taught it to us in high school.  The performances are all spot-on, with Malden's Bradley the perfect warm foil for the imperious George S., and Michael Bates a dead ringer for Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.<p>The transfer to DVD is special, with beautiful color and hardly a nick or scratch.  If you've only seen this one on network TV or old videotapes, you've never really seen Patton before.  The wide-screen presentation allows us to savor the compositions of some really extraordinary shots--all the battle sequences are amazing in how they are staged.  (They used the Spanish army, because they now own all our surplus WWII combat equipment.)  <p>Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox did find a way to blow it with this DVD--sort of.  The original issue was a 2-disc set, the second DVD featuring an excellent documentary on the making of the film and the real George S. Patton, with comments by the director, producer, and George C. Scott, and others.  It also has a track of just Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score (beautifully restored in the film, btw).  My only complaint was the documentary was not long enough--a subject as fascinating as Patton, and the making of Patton, deserves two hours, not one.  Now Fox has taken the two-disc Patton out of circulation and replaced it with this version from the "Fox War Series"--only one disc, and for not many dollars less than the original double-set.  I'd advise anyone who really care about this movie and loves DVD extras to cruise eBay for copies of the 2DVD Patton, as they do pop up frequently.  That's the best way to own this film.  The single-disc is a poor substitute.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>George C. Scott gives the finest performance of his career has the fabled World War 2 general. The movie follows Patton's career from the North Africa Campaign to the end of the war. Jerry Goldsmith's excellent soundtrack really makes the film what it is. The film is also humorous. Patton always has to be criticized for something (Slapping a soldier, criticizing the Russians, e.t.c). Patton believes in reincarnation; thinking that he was a soldier in past lives. In one scene, where Patton and Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) are at an ancient Greek battlefield, when Patton describes the battle he says, "I was there".  <p>This is definitely one war movie (or any kind of movie) I would not mind watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>...you make the other poor bastard die for his country instead!" So opens the 1970 Oscar-winning film 'Patton' directed by Franklin J. Schaffner; giving the audience an early insight into the mind of one of America's greatest generals.  A well-directed film enhanced by the spectacular performance of George C. Scott who has an uncanny resemblance to the actual person.<br /><br />The film faithfully and candidly presents the life of America's most cunning WWII general as described by his fellow officer General Bradley in his memoirs and Patton's own autobiography.  The film shows how he was a commander whom even great German generals such as Erwin Rommel feared and respected.  It shows him as a controversial figure who, although an ardent Christian, believed in reincarnation.  Bellicose and foul mouthed, Patton was his own worst enemy in the Pentagon and on the political scene: foiling many opportunities for him to be assigned a command on the front.  The film also shows how he became a controversial leader with his own troops for reprimanding a shell-shocked soldier as a coward.  The film follows his exploits in Operation Torch in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily and Italy, and some of his activities in Northern Europe.  The film also shows how Patton had a pretty low opinion of Montgomery as a man and as a military commander: they were both bitter rivals throughout the war.<br /><br />This is not really a war film but strictly a dramatic biography on one whose business happened to be war.  The few combat action scenes in the film are decent and well balanced in contrast to the main character; the cinematography is also quite good.  Under good direction by Schaffner, George C. Scott delivers a winning performance to a role he was literally born to play.  A great film deserving an honored place in any war film buff's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"Patton" is an epic saga of one of the greatest generals of all time, a total American, and an imperfect but nonetheless great man.  George C. Scott as General George S. Patton is one of the greatest and best casting decisions of all time.  Scott becomes the general, and the role will forever define Scott, just as Scott's portrayal of General Patton will forever define the General in the minds of most Americans.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie about a flawed but great man.  Like many or most American generals, Patton waited the better part of his career for a terrible war to occur, which would call forth all of the years of training and preparation, but mostly waiting, that go into the career of a professional soldier who happens to serve a basically peace-loving country.  Patton believed that he was born to lead great armies in a desperate battle, and this he did.  The film's depiction of Patton when he took over the Vth Corps in North Africa shortly after it took a shellacking from Rommel at Kassarine Pass was absolutely masterful.  Patton took a despirited, green American army there, and shortly, in his words, turned them into "razors ... fanatics!"  The American Expeditionary Force in North Africa never lost another battle after the brush at Kassarine, and Patton was established in the American mind as a great war general.<br /><br />The infamous "slapping incident" was portrayed painfully but, in the end, according to most historians, accurately.  Patton here is shown to have exercised misjudgment, but even here the discerning viewer will see that this was a misguided attempt by the general to inspirit a flagging soldier.  Scott handled this particular scene perfectly, as indeed he did the entire three hour film.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Patton leads the Third Army's relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne.  The British and other allied forces were paralyzed--Patton, having anticipated the possibility of a surprise German winter attack, wheeled several divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.  The scene in this film where Scott/Patton "orders" an Army Chaplain to "pray to the Almighty for good weather...I want a good weather prayer..." is one wonderful scene, juxtaposed against horrendous scenes of combat as the Americans, tired but battle-hardened, advanced.<br /><br />Patton's difficulties with the press are well done in this film, and one wonders, with today's media the way it is, whether a great general like Patton could survive in our politicized times.  Lord help us when the day comes, as it will, when America needs another Patton.<br /><br />Scott's portrayal of Patton is one of the greatest character roles ever, and this is a great war film and character study of a great American general.<br /><br />The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic, and is one of those scores that greatly adds to the viewing experience of the film.  The DVD is an excellent reproduction of the film, and the sound is recreated/remastered into pretty good Dolby 5.1, which sounded great on my home theater system, if not quite as awesome as some modern films.  This is a great film and the DVD is a great value.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>This is one of the 1st great war movies that I had seen when I was a youngster. G.C.

Scott. Considering when this film was made (1970), it could have easily been a heavy handed indictment of things that harmed flowers and other living things. Instead we get a brilliant and innovative character study of a complicated warrior who believed in re-incarnation and the ultimate power of war and violence. Patton was a man who read his bible religiously (no pun intended) yet gloried in using the enemy's living guts to grease the wheels of his tanks. This is definitely a 'warts and all" bio-pic. The Director, Franklin Schaffner, had a knack for making serious, no-frills movies (Pappillon, Boys from Brazil) with no superfluous romance or comic relief, and he was well chosen to take on this subject. This is a lean, mean film with no filler. Take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the opening scene. Make sure your standing at attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Fox War Classic (20th Cent Fox)DVD(single disc)Edition of "Patton".....<br /><br />A film that recieved nearly as many honors as Patton himself, 8 Academy Awards(including Best Picture,1970, Best Actor and Best Director), among numerous others, Golden Globe and Directors Guild included, now gets the royal treatment from 20th Century Fox. It is a beautiful transfer of this 33 year old film that is a pleasure to watch. The picture in Anamorphic Widescreen(2.35:1), which shows off the beautiful cinematography is incredible.It is clear and sharp with vibrant colors. The choice of sound is 5.1 Dolby or Stereo Surround, and is excellent as well. The dialouge, the music, the sounds of battle all surround you wonderfully. It may be viewed with captions in English or Spanish that appear in the black bar area(although the English subtitles, when the Germans are speaking are in the picture itself).One of the special features is an audio essay that you can choose to run during the film. The speaker is Charles Provence, the President of the Gen. George S. Patton Historical Society, and he presents a total picture of Patton. He speaks about his days as a child, as a young Lt. in the Army and all Patton's amazing accomplishmnets in his lifetime.He also speaks of certain incidences in the film and exactly the way they really happened(i.e. the slapping incident) The essay runs about 1:20 and is highly captivating and informative. Not much else in the way of bonus material, but it does come with a little booklet that  gives Patton's achievements in a time line form. For me the quality of this DVD was bonus enough.<br /><br />The movie itself would be a welcome addition to any history, film or war buff. Director Franklin Schaffner has done an expert and meticulous job of filming a fascinating look at a fascinating man who is such a huge part of our history. Patton's invovlment in WWII, his genius at military tatics and his overwhelming personality are all very much a part of this film. His disdain for "cowards", his admiration of the fighting men, who feared him but proudly fought for him, his obsession for glory, his poetry, his belief in reincarnation, the battles, his adversities and triumphs all make for a captivating story.<br /><br />Geroge C. Scott plays Patton in a way that you would think it was Patton himself on the screen. Karl Malden also turns in a wonderful performance of Gen. Omar Bradley. Karl Michael Vogler(Rommel),Richard Munch(Gen Jodl) and Michael Bates(Montgomery) add their wonderful talents as well. Jerry Goldsmith's score has great feeling and is perfect for this film. The movie was based on material from books by Omar Bradley(A Soldier's Story) and Ladislas Farago(Patton: Ordeal and Triumph).<br /><br />A terrific addition to any film library...<br />Thanks and enjoy...Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PR6">A Bridge Too Far</a></p></br></body></html>

It's a slow film and the "revelation" at the end, in retrospect, doesn't seem very revelatory, but that's not the point. The point is that it's a great story, and after 60 years, it still stands up to repeated viewings. <p>Influence is admittedly a difficult thing to measure, but after your third or fourth viewing of Citizen Kane, it becomes very obvious that it was way ahead of its time. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland did things that you weren't supposed to be able to do then (e.g., deep focus, using ceilings) and made them work. Kane is really stunning visually, what with all the crosscuts, dissolves, and unusual edits, and I defy anyone to come up with a film from that period that is more of a visual feast. <p>The screenplay, whether it was written by Herman Mankiewicz solo with Welles' input, or as a collaborative effort (I don't really care), is just as much a feat. Telling the story by letting each character tell their own sides, regardless of linearity (even overlapping at some points) was not something that was particularly encouraged. Even now, people say they can't quite keep up with what is going on, and although that may turn some people off, I don't think that Citizen Kane was necessarily meant for a mass audience. After all, Orson Welles, as a genius (and you know how they are), was always more interested in expressing his artistic vision than being concerned about how the public would respond. <p>Bravery certainly comes in to play here, and courage and determination. Citizen Kane is the film that would not die. For the uninitiated, the story was (not very) loosely based on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (in fact, I did a college thesis comparing and contrasting the film to Hearst's life, but that's a whole other story). The film was so close to reality that Hearst wanted to buy the negative so he could burn it. It was almost never released. And then, once it was released, the public shunned it. It wasn't until the rights ran out and television picked it up from the public domain for broadcast that people finally were able to appreciate the film for what it was. It is almost that the film itself yearned to be seen. <p>I could go into the performances and other such things, but that would make this really long and I am of the belief that reviews should be relatively short in order to keep the readers' attention. So, I will conclude by noting that Kane's influence even runs to modern music. The White Stripes' album White Blood Cells contains a song called "The Union Forever" where composer Jack White has lifted dialogue and lyrics from Kane and turned them into a bluesy rock song, thus spreading the word of Kane to future generations. <p>Combine that with the fact that it continually top the list of greatest films ever and what you have is a phenomenon of immense proportions that shows no signs of stopping. As long as people continue to watch Citizen Kane, people will continue to appreciate it for the work of art that it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane is truly a great movie. Through it we see the life of one Charles Foster Kane analyzed: a man doomed by his own ambition, corrupted by power and with love only for himself. We see the creation of Kane's behemoth news empire and how it destructed. This is the single best character study I have ever seen, and it really defined the genre. This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and see something new every time, it is also a funny film (I laughed more than a few times), and such innovative storytelling and camerawork. The acting is excellent, and the score is perfect, not melodramatic, like many scores for older films, but entirely appropriate. In conclusion, if you like a well-made classic film that will make you think, pick up a copy today.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>The gorgeous new transfer of CITIZEN KANE on this DVD is much improved over that for the Criterion laserdisc version in 1991.  The picture is much cleaner; scratches, splices, and other blemishes have been cleaned up considerably.  Details in darker areas are much clearer.  For instance, in the scene where Charlie writes his declaration of principles while his head is in a shadow, on all previous transfers of the film that I saw, his head is in near total darkness; but on this DVD, his facial features are still clearly visible.  Another example is the scene where Charlie orders Susan to continue singing and his shadow totally engulfs her face.  On this DVD, you can distinctly see her facial expression in the shadow, while on older transfers, you cannot.  The improved details within shadows are crucial since much of Greg Toland's innovative photography makes elaborate uses of light and shadows -- shadows that are not just invisible black spaces, but with details, textures, and significance just like lit spaces.  Observant viewers will also notice on the improved DVD picture that, during the projection room scene, one of the people in the shadow is Joseph Cotten.  He is barely noticeable on old transfers, but very much so on this DVD.  (CITIZEN KANE is a rare film in which the actor who plays a main character also plays a cameo role in it!)  Also welcomed is that certain frames in the movie are displayed in &quot;windowboxed&quot; format (such as the huge headline &quot;Kane Marries 'Singer'&quot;), ensuring that they can seen in full on certain monitors.<p>The audio transfer has not been neglected.  The mono sound is clear, sharp, and smooth.  Loud sounds are bright but not harsh.  Soft sounds are always audible.  The softest sound in the movie is probably the moment when Charlie says to Bernstein, &quot;Close the door,&quot; right after Susan's opera debut.  On old transfers it is barely audible, but much more so on this DVD.<p>There are 2 audio commentaries, one by Roger Ebert, who has done many shot-by-shot analyses of CITIZEN KANE and has deep knowledge about the film, and another one by Peter Bogdanovich, who knew Orson Welles personally and has deep knowledge about Welles's life and career.  Ebert's narration is livelier and covers more grounds.  He analyzes some of the themes in the story, and explains many innovative techniques used by the filmmakers, emphasizing that KANE is largely a &quot;special-effects&quot; picture.  Bogdanovich speaks subduedly and sparingly throughout (at one point he says there are other Welles pictures he likes more than KANE), but he makes many keen observations about Welles that can only come from someone who knew him well.  He says he once asked Welles why he did things so differently from other filmmakers.  Welles replied, &quot;I was like the guy who felt sick, and the doctor asked him what he did very morning.  And he said, &quot;Every morning I get up, then vomit...&quot;.  The doctor asked, &quot;You VOMIT every morning?&quot;  And the guy said, &quot;Doesn't EVERYONE?&quot;  The guy thought what he did was normal.  And so did I.&quot;<p>Other extras on the DVD include a one-minute newsreel footage of the film's New York premiere, the wonderfully-edited original theatrical trailer, and about 100 stills from the film's storyboards, production photos, press kit, and posters.  In the &quot;Still Gallery&quot; section, Roger Ebert speaks again on an 11-minute audio track about the significance of Welles' achievements in KANE.  There are two &quot;easter eggs&quot; (undocumented features) on the DVD as well.  One is on the main menu -- select the &quot;sled&quot; symbol and you will see a 6-minute interview of Ruth Warrick, who recalls her experience working with Welles.  Another &quot;sled&quot; symbol can be found in the &quot;Production Notes -- On the Set&quot; section where Robert Wise is mentioned.  Selecting it will take you to a 3-minute interview of Wise, who recounts a few anecdotes about KANE.<p>The second disc contains the excellent 2-hour documentary THE BATTLE OVER CITIZEN KANE, from 1996.  The disc is identical in content to an earlier DVD released by WGBH Boston Video.  The documentary provides vivid portrayals of Hearst and Welles, detail accounts of their rise to power, and fascinating details about the making of KANE and, of course, Hearst's attempts to destroy it.  The makers of the documentary went on to make the equally brilliant HBO movie RKO 281.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>If the stories are to be believed, Orson Welles created CITIZEN KANE as an act of vengeance for a sleight he received from W.R.

The film was quite controversial of the time and RKO Pictures originally was not going to play it because of the pressure put to bear by William Randolph Hearst, famous newspaper magnate and philanthropist.  Even to this day, the Hearst Corporation has its fingers in every pie:  radio, television, cable, satellite broadcasting, etc.  Hearst did not like that Orson was making what amounted to an unauthorized criticism on Hearst himself.<br /><br />Similarities?  Oh yes!  Although the names were changed, the film follows Hearst's life to a Tee, with a lot of creative license being taken.<br /><br />Orson Welles, only 24 years old, who, flushed from his success on the Mercury Theater and his famous (or infamous) broadcast, War of the Worlds, he created what many consider the best film of all time and many consider the beginning of the end of Orson's career as a radio, stage and film master of entertainment.<br /><br />[For those who do not know, on Halloween night back in the 1930s, with America concerned about Hitler's advances in Europe, Welles adapted H.G. Wells War of the Worlds with realistic-sounding newscasts and had the Martians invading Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  Many people actually believed these broadcasts to be REAL and panicked!  Radio was like TV is today, with soaps, westerns, news, and so on as main entertainment and so having your shows interrupted by newscasts and bulletins was common.  This created major controversy and put Orson on the map!]<br /><br /> But back to the review:<br /><br />Charles Foster Kane, as a child,  is being taken away as the family can no longer have him.  His mother is played stoically by Agnes Moorhead, a strong character actress in her own right (well before "Bewitched!" the cheesy sitcom of the Sixties.).<br /><br />Kane gets a newspaper, expands his empire, builds a castle (in Florida rather than San Simeon (current location of Hearst Castle), collects art as well as pretty girls, runs for office, confronts scandal and finally dies, dropping a snow globe and whispers "Rosebud."<br /><br />Why Rosebud?  Well, the newspaper guys who are creating the news reel (News On The March!) want to know more about Kane and what Rosebud is.  The film then goes through a lot of flashbacks and personal interviews with fictional (and thinly disguised) friends of Kane to find out more about the man, his mission and what was Rosebud.<br /><br />Was Kane a self-seeking vampire who sucked the spirit out of everyone he came in contact with?  Or did his childhood memories still haunt him decades after the fact?<br /><br />Melodramatic to the extreme, some scenes were slow-paced.  The black & white photography was simply gorgeous.  And getting a peak at life as it might have been like in the early 20th Century was enjoyable and fascinating.<br /><br />Disc Two:  Wow, this was great.  Actual filmed interviews with Orson Welles done in the 1980s before his death.  You can see his eyes light up as he recalled the creative energy he possessed as a very young man, creating plays in Harlem with an all Black cast in creating Shakespeare for the masses.<br /><br />Touched on are the Mercury Theater broadcasts for CBS and the War of the Worlds broadcast.  The narrator said it best:  Orson accomplished it all at a young age and then was burned and never came back after Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Extensive biographical data on Welles and Hearst, both driven men, both creative geniuses in their own ways, proud and gifted and heading on a collision course with each other.<br /><br />"A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet."<br />-Orson Welles<br /><br />"Even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit."<br />Orson Welles<br /><br />"I started at the top and worked down."<br />Orson Welles<br /><br />More on Orson Welles:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140254560">Orson Welles: Volume 1: The Road to Xanadu</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140275177">Orson Welles: Volume 2: Hello Americans</a><br /><br />More on War of the Worlds Broadcast:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184933028X">War of the Worlds: Featuring Orson Welles</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAAT6M">The Orson Welles' War of the Worlds Scandal</a><br /><br />More on Willam Randolph Hearst:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0883659700">Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph Hearst</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618154469">The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane is certainly a unique film, a visual oddity of a film, with unique camera angles and surreal settings. The film just looks different from other films with its dark geometric interiors and camera shots that actually accentuate all the interior settings. It also is a unique story for it famously follows the life of William Randolph Hearst and is a commentary on that oversized powerhouse ego-maniac. The two female leads in the film, Ruth Warrick, playing first wife Emily Monroe Norton Kane, and Dorothy Comingore, playing second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, were extremely strong performances that were as different from each other as night and day. For Kane is one of those people who do not think the normal consequences of life apply to him. When he runs for public office while attacking his political opponent, he never seems to realize that the fact that he has a mistress will come to light and destroy his marriage and his political career. Kane relentlessly attacks career politician James Gettys, played by Ray Collins. But Gettys is a seasoned street fighter. He gets the goods on Kane and then carefully confronts him in a set up situation where both women are involved. Emily Kane shows tremendous grace in the face of defeat and humiliation. But then a life of hell starts for Susan Alexander Kane for she becomes the project of her husband who pushes her to sing and become an opera star. Susan Kane's speaking voice can peel paint off walls, a penetrating and grating high volume whine. When she and Charles Kane escape to his castle, the film becomes surreal, something out of Camus or Sartre, where people become each other's hell. Susan Kane's fall into alcoholism is tragic and yet totally expected. Joseph Cotton plays Jebediah Leland, Kane's best friend who sinks into alcoholism and obscurity in the shadow of his overpowering friend. Agnes Moorehead plays Mary Kane, the poor puritanical mother who gives up her son so that he might develop the sophistication to enjoy his wealth. I found the film to be very unique, highly entertaining and visually interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>Welles really pulled off a bravado act of filmmaking with this, his first film, and it's full of humor and sarcasm and, above all, brilliant flourishes of imagery throughout (the gates of Xanadu, News on the March, marriage on the rocks, opera from above, that iconic sled and ceilings).  It's one of many studies on the abuse of power and the souring of the American dream, and while it's not even Welles most shattering, it's definitely among the most refreshing; few films since have been able to dramatize events with such intelligence.  Subsequent viewings can constantly offer up new riches for movie lovers everywhere.  It's one of the few films that potently exemplifies Americana to the world.  Intellectual exploitation of the highest order; lasting proof of Welles genius, and an astounding first film by anyone, anywhere, ever!</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>What struck me most while finally seeing CITIZEN KANE (as the only person probably in filmdom who had not!) was that the story of Kane I could trace in the lives of so many other high-powered moneyed public figures even to this current day! Newspapers still can control what we think and how we perceive "reality";newspapers still intentionally slander and try to discredit in order to control public opinion (now, even certain television stations!);how rich folk attempt to  control the movements of the rest of us and make us think that they really identify with us;how public persona and private lives are often diametrically opposed;how careers can be made with the sure and certain influences of wealthy people;how political office is often something to which they aspire......but most importantly,just how much these people are scared little children in need of their mommies and daddies and their sled!!!!!!<br /><br />This film says it all.Yes this film is a marvel in cinematic technique etc,etc.etc,but for me it is the timeless message of the corruptibility of the average citizen resulting from the lack of early essential childhood needs being provided.That this story was based "loosely" on the life of mogul William Randolph Hearst almost seemed irrelevant to me as a million more "Hearsts" have come and gone and still are here in my own lifetime.<br /><br />With the upcoming elections within a year, I am glad to have CITIZEN KANE for my very first time.This film only continued to confirm what I have always believed:that ultimate power corrupts ultimately (someone else said that first!).If ever a film was made to expose people for what they are and to aid an already cynical nature, then I am glad to have made CITIZEN KANE that most agreeable choice!<br /><br />The extras on this DVD, a two hour film on how Hearst tried to destroy Wells and the film is priceless. ANY serious moviegoer needs this DVD in their collection.What you learn about the film process and corruption in the industry is worth every minute of your time.I will never view films quite the same way as I have thanks to this film.ALL REVIEWERS ON AMAZON-ATTENTION!!!!-GET THIS!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Orson Welles' film debut is nothing less than a masterstroke of pure genius. A modern "Tragicall Historie Of Dr. Faustus" (written by Christopher Marlowe; the play, NOT THE MOVIE), this deeply sentimental portrait of lost love is remarkable not only for its thematic elements, but for the camerawork (considered revolutionary in 1941; expertly shot by Gregg Toland, who had worked on the successful "Wuthering Heights" two years earlier). This film deserves to be seen not just by film students, but by everyone. What a shame that this film was not a box-office hit upon its initial release in 1941. The only movie over which Orson Welles had complete creative control (he was subjected to his films being severely re-edited and reshot, most notably "The Magnificent Ambersons,"<br /><br />"Macbeth," "Othello, Moor Of Venice" and "Touch Of Evil," among others, for the remainder of his career), this film remains his best. Not Rated.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.<br /><br />The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen onscreen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of "Rosebud" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.<br /><br />The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.<br /><br />The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, "The Battle Over Citizen Kane", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Please note that this review is for the PAL rather than the NTSC version of the film.<br /><br />Ironically, after creating this cinematic masterpiece, Welles, now the outcast boy wonder director of Hollywood at the ripe old age of 26, spent the next half century with his hand out trying to fund similarly visionary films that never got made, although he continued to be popular as an actor. Everyone praised his work as that of a great genius but no one would give him more work, after Citizen Kane was hailed as a masterpiece but still lost $150,000. And no investor was willing to put up money for a brilliant but eccentric genius no matter how gifted who couldn't pull in the receipts at the box office--essentially no different from what happens today.<br /><br />Welles's predicament reminded me of the great Spencer Tracy at the end of his career, who said the same thing. Prior to his being cast in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," no one would insure him for the movie due to his heart condition, so he and Katherine bought the insurance themselves, according to the story. He made the same comment about everyone praising his work but no one being willing to hire him.<br /><br />This film resembles more a 19th century late romantic symphony or a work of jaded Impressionism than a typical American film. It melds dramatic camera angles and cinematography, world weary, fin de siecle dialog, a brooding and almost nihilistic atmosphere, and a non-chronological timeline to create what for the time was a revolutionary film. In one scene in the film, where the enraged Welles as Hearst is trashing his study, scattering books and various objects everywhere, he said afterwords, "By God, I felt it, I really felt it." Overall, Welles's signature work of genius and one of the most influential movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>I think almost everybody is missing the point of the film. The movie certainly was technically well done, but what helped it the most was the story.  Not to excuse his behavior, but Kane tried to control everyone while trying to make them love him because he had no control when he lost his parents as a child.  The mysterious "rosebud" was the name of his sled which he repeated several times in the course of the film at times of stress. He also recalled his most happy time of life which probably occurred just prior to being sent away by his mother.  He was playing in the snow just before he was traumatized by being forced to go away with a total stranger. The scene depicted in the glass ball of a snow scene he obsessively fondled and the word "rosebud" were his last thoughts at death.  With a lifetime of adult memories as a powerful, wealthy man and the lost love of a beautiful woman, what did he think about at the moment of death?  I think it was his lost youth and family that "rosebud" represented.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I'm a 16 year old self proclaimed film buff, and I can't see how people can call this film boring and overrated. True, it was made in 1941, and it's in black and white, but it's a masterpiece nevertheless. This film is noteworthy for several reasons. This work is consistently at the top of film lists. It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student. The Rosebud symbol is still recognized even though more than a half century has passed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Can you imagine what the perception of RKO was at the time they made this decision? Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience. On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today. Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!<p>I have just described Citizen Kane. All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing. Everything is perfect. The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.<p>As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion. Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word &quot;Rosebud&quot;. A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant. So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word. In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him. We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.<p>This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone. He is unhappy and lonely. We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud. I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is). But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has made its point. What is the point? My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism. Loving &quot;stuff&quot; or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.<p>By the way, this movie almost was never seen. The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate. He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it. Fortunately he lost. The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic. It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.<p>One last thing. Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it did NOT win Best Picture in 1941. That film? &quot;How Green was my Valley&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>Believe the hype. The film is a masterpiece. Period. And one movie everyone must experience.<p>I'll comment instead on the extras, particularly Roger Ebert's incredibly informative and engaging commentary. He loves movies, loves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and it shows. He loads it with anecdotes, educational information, and not a few spoilers on the special effects and goofs. Ebert presents what amounts to an excellent Citizen Kane 101 lecture where the film, and not the lecturer, takes center stage. Nice job.<p>Unfortunatley, Peter Bogdanovich's commentary is sub-par. When he's not name-dropping (&quot;When I met Orson... I asked Orson&quot; blah blah), he suffers from the annoying tendency to recount what's on the screen. <p>And the rest of the extras are excellent too. Great DVD transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>This lengthy examination on the large-scale, take-no-prisoners lives of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles examines just how much the two personalities had in common, how their winding roads intersected, and why a high-stakes showdown was almost inevitable once the Welles parade stormed Hollywood. It's a thorough, unbiased glimpse into both men's lifestyles, triumphs, mistakes and defining moments. The documentary is a bit on the long side, but in retrospect I can't imagine which slab of material could've been sliced away. It's all integral to the big picture. Considering all that led up to it and everything that worked against it, it's something of a miracle this film ever saw the light of day.

Just the movie unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Excuse me, I was extremely sick while I was watching this movie and I couldn't pay as much attention as I usually could.<br /><br />So anyways, how do I feel it is innovative? Most people say it is for the shots, which, definably it is. For a B&W film, it's absolutely beautiful. Everything is so craft fully filmed. The moving shots going up and down, just everything is beyond words for the shooting.  It's the work on genius on it's shots, it planted the ultimate apple tree seed for the farmers of tomorrow to eat from and plant more seeds. See my symbolism?<br /><br />And that's another way I think this was extremely innovative, symbolism. This was obviously done before, some of the all time greatest and favorite films before this were King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, Werewolf of London, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosferatu, The Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre Dame (you can see I love horror movies of that time,) but all those wonderful titles of which I have not reviewed on this site all show symoblism in something of fantasy. A giant gorilla, a vampire, a zombie mummy, a werewolf, a shape shifter, a phantom, some of them were real but are outcasts, and thus were not seen very much at the time. Citizen Kane however, delivers the symbolism in a factor of the human perspective. There's also much more of it, in Frankenstein, the whole plot is one point of symbolism, however, this carries out like a book with multiple symbols in addition to that type. I haven't really explained it have I? You would haft to see it for yourself, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />The scripting is very awesome. The idea of doing something, again, so familiar to us, is pure genius. Making it work so well. They didn't just flat out go flat, like some people these days do. But, they really did put the candy on the apple. They were also aware to make sure the candy stayed on the apple and not become it's own candy but to stay with the apple. Am I still symbolic or am I just a maniac? Oh, I haven't even talked about the greatest of things. It's done between two stories, the story of Charles Foster Kane is told through stories from his friends, and a newsreel. At the same time, we try to find out what his dying words "Rosebud" mean in the time after his death. So, they tell two stories at once. You pick any masterpiece from well, anytime but especially that time, you will probably not find that innovation. And you never really find out what Rosebud means until the end of the movie, and then, it's still done extremely symbolic and discreet.<br /><br />So, this is extremely innovative. Probably one of the top 10 innovative movies of all time. I'd say, a collection of opinions would say that these movies are the top greatest not in a specific order. Citizen Kane, King Kong (1933), Transformers (1986), Jason and the Argonauts, Casablanca, Cloverfield, Alien, Godzilla (1954) and Frankenstein (1931).<br /><br />So what is the rating? As an innovative picture and part of history, it by far deserves a 6/5. However, past the innovation, to an naive view, I'd say 4/5. Take it up to 5/5 between the two. I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Well, the second disc, I didn't really care for, the story behind the making of Citizen Kane, even though I've read about it before. The actual film itself, is one of the best films ever made. Welles and company were so innovated for the times, and even now with today's standards of film making, the cinematography, lighting and editing really shine through, but it's the structure of the film that is really interesting, the way the story is told, not in linear format, the many layers of the story and seeing Welles as Kane age before our eyes, really adds to the depth of the character and story as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to `Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make  a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether `Citizen Kane' is the best  film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful  woman.  It depends on whom you ask.<p>`Citizen Kane' is not the most  entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most  important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement  for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old  Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the  contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was  made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a  world where independents abound?<p>The story is based on the life of  William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at  Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The  similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst  promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles.  The fact that this film was  released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign  to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D.  Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled.  All of Hearst's  newspapers were forbidden to mention the film.  <p>Hollywood was uniformly  against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was  snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best  screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing  $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be  having this best film debate at all.<p>The story has a simple moral; that  money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy  child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man,  and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from  him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two  minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with  cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends  in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him  subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her  newspaper.<p>What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having  influenced them.  The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not  unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much  dramatic impact.  What was unprecedented was that `Citizen Kane' was the  first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves  forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in  time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling his or her  story about Kane.  So the next time you see a flashback, remember it  started here.  <p>The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through  four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film  also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton  and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.<p>If  `Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of  them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the  equation.  People who watch this film and ask, "What's the big deal?" are  comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's  techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to  Kitty Hawk and saying, "What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few  seconds."<p>There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental  importance.  It is the consummate 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Despite all the hype and all the hoopla (which often turns me off to films), I sat on my couch after the movie ended and was struck by the force of the film, knowing that without question I had seen a cinematic treasure; the film is just as innovative, interesting, and brilliant as everyone says it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Up until recently I had never seen Citizen Kane in toto.I had seen bits of it here and there in arts classes and on TV.After watching this movie and reflecting I can only envision one man that could ever had played this part to perfection and that was Orson Welles himself.This movie is as much autobiographical as it is biographical,that is there is as much Welles in this picture as Hearst.From what little I have read on both subjects over the years it is amazing how much these two men had in common in real life in their personalities and their subsequent dealings in whatever concerns were of most importance to them at any given moment.It was almost art imitating life imitating art.<br />But in 1941 both came together in one glorious time which would never be repeated.The picture earned Welles and company I believe around 10 OSCARS(if memory serves) of which only one was issued denying Welles his just due.Hearst had won the battle but in the end Welles won the war.<br />On further reflection another thing that very much jumped out at me as I viewed this film was the cinematograpy.The camera work was phenomenal.The lighting,the angles and the placement of shots added totally to the entire feel and execution of this picture.<br />And another aspect that I noticed was the editing.Of course as Welles controlled just about every aspect of the picture this,I would assume,could also be laid at his feet.But take for example a scene which involves Kane and his first wife.It lasts about five minutes in all but it shows them sitting at either end of a large table.Through several dissolves we see Kane and his wife going from a newly happily married couple to two distant and cold individuals.Brilliantly done.<br />Technically this picture has been cleaned to perfection.It is a fine transfer.There are two discs here,one has the movie along with clips from the original trailer and opening night,a short interview with a co-star and two different commentaries.The second contains a special which(again) I only saw part of a few years back on PBS called:"The Battle for Citizen Kane",which was part of the American Experience series.You will notice that this disc alone is for sale so it is worth every penny to be included in this set.<br />All in all I highly recommend this set to everyone.I have really no complaints in any department.While I don't think this is THE greatest movie ever made,I do believe it is one of the most important and best ever done.And when you compare it to some of the best works ever to come out of any film producing nation in the world it is no small praise indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I viewed this film this past weekend and i'm ashamed to say that i had never seen it before.  The acting was the best, story telling, music, design of the movie was all wonderful.  I realize that this film is rated the "Best of Hollywood" and i can understand why.  My only fault that i see with this film, and it might just be me, but i don't think it's a film you could watch over and over again.  But don't let that stop you from really enjoying and great piece of work and i'm so glad i finally know who "Rosebud" was.  Great work of Americana!</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>I'm not going to weigh in on the silly debates over the merits of this film.  All I will say is that I've seen it several times before in theaters with decent to mediocre prints, but I just picked up a copy of the "two-disc special edition" and the transfer is stunning.  I have to say that up until I saw it on this dvd I merely "appreciated" the film as important; this time I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the compositions that look so fine on this dvd.  Whether or not you like the film, this is the edition to see it on.  A beautiful dvd package.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>I had heard about this film all of my life, but it wasn't until my Senior year in college that I actually watched it for the first time in a film class. I was literally blown away. Not only is the story extremely interesting, but the film techniques used will delight your eyes! I've always been a lover of film and how their made and put together, and "Citizen Kane" is the epitome of what a good movie is. <p>Orson Welles' direction of this film is immaculate, especially for someone who was so young when he directed it! You will immediately be drawn into all of the characters in this film. I would highly suggest "Citizen Kane" to any and everyone!!! If you want to watch a captivating and cinematically beautiful piece of filmmaking, watch this film!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VUO1LJGMSZQY.html">A3VUO1LJGMSZQY</a><br/><p>Have thoroughly enjoyed film and content of the 60th anniversary dvd set, but with the raves over the blu, decided to take the plunge and buy the 2 disc blu "book" from BB ($30). Sturdy packaging, and with same content as 60th dvd. Alas, I am going to upset folks, but perhaps some will be thankful to save some green. (Here goes:) On 50" 720p tv, I compared versions, scene by assorted scene. I believe the dvd has just as much picture clarity/detail as the blu. It is, however, a much brighter (harsher?) picture to view than the blu, which has a warmer, almost 'sepia' quality. In many scenes, the picture was 'grainier' (even light through windows) on the blu, while the dvd had a more polished or sterile look (that also adds to background clarity, like pictures on a wall). Purists likely prefer the 'grain', but is it even certain what Welles and Toland intended for their medium? Funny, but as I was 'wearing out' my tv's input button, I occasionally lost track of which version I was viewing, such is the quality of both. My recommendation (as a decidedly non-scholar): If you've never seen the film, and can afford the blu premium, than go for it! If you enjoy your "dated" dvd (that you've already paid for!), be content with that. My simple view is that I have heard nothing but "must own" RE: this blu release; my recent experience suggests otherwise. I also prefer the 60th packaging, with that great still and title graphic on cover. The 70th blu book does have a nice 48 page book of period pictures, film notes, storyboards, etc. (if retorts necessary, please be reader-friendly!)</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I wish I would have watched this movie earlier in my life.  It's so ridiculously hilarious.  I love Kane.  He reminds me of an over-the-top friend I had in college, except my friend had SOME stability.<br /><br />But if Kane had stability, where would his ambition have gone?  It would have taken a back seat to his stability.  Sort of like my desire for stability keeps me hushed up about the dream I have of promoting G-rated Shock Value.<br /><br />The message of this movie seems to be that personal ambition makes for an awesome story, but a horrible lifestyle.  No one watches this darn movie to see who or what Rosebud is.  People watch this movie to see the rise and fall of a man with an insane dream.  That's what makes the script of this movie so strong and gives it so many memorable quotes.  Kane clearly believes all the garbage he spews, even though he knows it's garbage.  Nowhere is this more clear than when he refuses to drop out of the race for governor.  For me, that's the defining moment of the film right there.<br /><br />Best movie of all time?  Eh, that's debatable.  While it's certainly up there with movies like Mary Poppins and Annie Hall, it's tough to pick which is THE best.  It should be enough to say I like everything about this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Following the death of media mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a reporter (Joseph Cotten) is tasked with investigating the significance of Kane's final word: "Rosebud."  It is impossible to merely enjoy this film because of its reputation as the greatest ever made.  I felt like I was forced to react to this exalted status.  Well, I have to conclude that it is probably impossible to single out any movie as the best, but if I had to it wouldn't be "Citizen Kane."<br /><br />This is not to say that I thought it was a bad movie at all.  However, Welles's innovative use of the camera, which causes so many to regard it so highly, was so relentless that I was frequently pulled out of the story to consider the artifice of it, making it feel rather cold and technical.  I found the story involving, even though I couldn't really connect with the characters, and would still recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>So many of the films that critics unanimously pick as the greatest of all time are overrated, confusing, ponderous, overly symbolic art pieces that leave viewers scratching their heads. The collective reaction is, &quot;What in the hell was the director smoking?&quot; Arty camera work and tons of symbolism and metaphors can never take the place of good acting, solid direction and, most importantly, a good script.<p>Much has been made of Citizen Kane's technical brilliance -- Welles' use of overlapping conversations, Gregg Toland's deep focus photography, set design that incorporates ceilings, etc. However, none of this would really mean anything if the film didn't have a great story and screenplay. Citizen Kane may be a triumph in filmmaking technique, but it is also a deeply engrossing story with characters we can relate to and sympathize with. Welles' Kane is a selfish, unhappy, overly controlling dictator who has everything and yet still manages to make himself more and more unhappy. Most of us know the feeling of not appreciating someone or something good in our lives until he/she/it is gone. We see the promise and idealism in Kane's early life, like him and believe, as Joseph Cotten's Jed Leland does, that Kane is a great man who can do so much good in society. As Kane's life progresses, however, he becomes more and more bitter, alienates everyone who cares about him and dies alone, longing for the simplicity of his early life before he became wealthy. When Kane, as an old man, loses control when his second wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) leaves him, we can't help but feel for him -- even though most or all of his unhappiness is his fault. That the audience feels such empathy for such a flawed character is Citizen Kane's greatest triumph and is the true basis for Kane's reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>This restoration of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is nothing short of miraculous, practically as dazzling an achievement as the film itself. It's pretty well known that the original 35mm print of &quot;Kane&quot; was lost long ago, so expectations of producing a superior duplicate from another duplicate were never very high. On the film's 50th anniversary, Turner Enterprises released a restored print for theatrical release, but though it was brighter, it had a somewhat white-washed, softy-focused aura that served neither Welles' purpose nor the &quot;film noir-ish&quot; properties of Welles' masterpiece adequately.<p>The DVD restoration, on the other hand, has crisp, sharply-defined images, richly complex and nuanced blacks, whites and greys, and an audio track that sounds fresh and &quot;present&quot; without over-equalization of highs and lows or gratuitous stereo simulation. <p>For some viewers, &quot;Kane&quot; ranks as the greatest film of all time because it's possible to stop the film on any single frame of its 2-hour length and produce an exegesis not only on the aesthetic and technical strengths of that individual shot but on the film as a whole, given its organic structure and the microcosmic status of each of the parts. For such viewers, this version should prove especially indispensable, affording glimpses of information--faces and other objects formerly covered by dark shadow, lap dissolves once too subtle to spot even in slow motion, competing, yet independently crucial, conversations--perhaps not accessible since the film's initial release.<p>Even without the bonuses, the single disc would be worth the price. But the inclusion of an additional DVD, &quot;The Making of Citizen Kane,&quot; along with the historical, biographical, contextual materials included on the first disc make this package a steal.  With this many riches to choose from, viewers may be excused if they pass up the Peter Bogdanovich running commentary on the film (I couldn't stay with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary &quot;play-by-play&quot; is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot. Even his commentary during the gallery of stills, in which he explains why &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is his favorite movie and why it deserves its reputation as the best ever, is not to be missed. (I now realize that the hurried, superficial quality of much of his newpaper reviewing in recent years says more about the product than the reviewer.)<p>One caution: The first disc, with &quot;Kane&quot; and all of the assorted contextual material that follows, initially behaved &quot;buggy&quot; on my iMac DV. After disabling extensions, internet connections, and practically every other program except the DVD player, I was able to run the entire disc with no further problems.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>Movie-wise, Citizen Kane is quite the classic. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written on a level that is only comparable to Shakespeare. Like all timeless classics, age has not withered its potency, and 70 years later it is as relevant as ever and absolutely just as moving as it no doubt was back in 1941.<br /><br />Blu Ray-wise, it's even better. Movies this old should not look this good. It just doesn't seem right, and yet, here it is - presented absolutely perfectly without the tiniest flicker or grain, in stunning STUNNING 1080p that gives incredible details to old coats, snow flurries, mansions, facial expressions.. and, well, every single shot. It's glossy all the way throughout. This is NOT a low budget restoration, it's a transformation like no generation has yet to experience. If you think Blu Ray can only enhance modern, color spectacles, watch this movie. You will be proven wrong. In fact, some of my all-time favorite blu rays to show off my 1080p television are Black and White. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX8Q">Casablanca [BLU-RAY</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JBI3GA">The Twilight Zone [Blu-ray</a>] are just some examples that dazzle a high definition screen. Citizen Kane is among the best, if not THE best, however, and has set the bar even higher. I'm so happy that this release was taken seriously.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you're a fan of this classic or have never seen it before, buy or rent this movie on blu ray. Relive it again as you've never experienced it before, or watch it for the first time and be prepared to be amazed. Either way, I urge you to take advantage of this new HD technology. Movies, especially old movies, will never be the same.<br /><br />~~Rosebud~~</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>There has probably been more pearls of wisdom cast at CITIZEN KANE than any other movie.  I just did a book search on the title here on Amazon and came up with 43 results.  There are `Perspectives on,'  `Focus on,' `Casebook on' and a `Making of' or two, as well as a waggish `Raising Kane.'  Tossing out the strays - Jeffrey Archer's `Kane and Abel,' for instance -- that haven't a thing to do with Orson Welles' masterpiece, you're still left with a shelf full of books on the movie.  And that doesn't even begin to count the magazine and journal articles.<br /><br />  So what's a rube to do?  Any `insight' I might offer on CITIZEN KANE has undoubtedly been gurgitated and regurgitated a dozen time.  The best I can come up with is this: The last time I saw this it was a cheap vhs tape and I remember disliking it quite a bit.  The Warners' Home Video disk is extremely clean and the movie benefits tremendously.  You've really got to watch a clean print of this one to appreciate it.  This will never be my favorite movie - or even my favorite Orson Welles movie - but I've watched it three times (the disk has a separate commentary track with Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert) and I've seen something new in it each time.  Not just because the commentators point it out, either, although the commentaries help in appreciating the nuances of Welles' direction and Gregg Toland's camera-work.<br /><br />The two-hour long `The Battle Over Citizen Kane' documentary on disk two, an episode of PBS's `American Experience,' gives a welcome and complete overview of the controversy surrounding the production and distribution of the movie.  The clutch of specials on disk one - ad campaigns, call sheets, etc. - are interesting but, unlike the `Battle' on disk two, unessential.  CITIZEN KANE, however, is essential viewing for anyone with an involved interest in movies beyond the current hits.  I didn't love it, but after watching it three times in a short span I can now appreciate why it's considered by many the greatest movie ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>There are some who do not believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made.  Some people understand that the film has some remarkable technical innovations, yet still find the film less than compelling.  I can't really explain this reaction to the film, but it exists.  Perhaps if we understood why someone doesn't like Citizen Kane we would also unravel other great film mysteries such as  who would pay full price to see Tom Greene in something like Freddy Got Fingered and who can't wait to see Bio Dome 2.<p>Not everyone is going to agree it is the greatest film ever made or the most entertaining and once you start calling anything The Greatest of them all a bit of skeptism is likely to rear its head.  One thing is certain, most will appreciate Greg Toland's beautiful use of light and shadow and photographic genius.  And the more you know about how innovative some of the shots were and what lengths it took to accomplish them, you'll appreciate the effort even more. <p>The life of the fictional Charles Foster Kane is examined in detail.  It all starts with a quest to find out the significance of the last word kane uttered as he died -- Rosebud.  And all of the film techniques used in the film still seem fresh, the symbolism all works perfectly. In fact the film is constructed not unlike some massive reality television specials that might be called... The Unauthorized Biography of Charles Foster Kane. Of course it would be those reality television specials that are poorly mimicking some of the ideas and structures of Citizen Kane and not the other way around.  In other words we're talking about a film that can enjoyed as entertainment, not something that one only appreciates without feeling an affection or warmth toward it.  You can praise the film until you are sick of praising it and still find something in the film, a shot, a camera angle, a dissolve,  an actor's look, a line of dialogue, that will take your breath away.  <p>Except for the barest hint of edge enhancement this is the cleanest, crispest and most beautiful black and white film you've ever seen on DVD.  And it doesn't look overly processed or mechanical.  In fact there are some dark scenes where for the first time I was able to see some details I've never seen before. <p>The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0.  Rather than artificially enhance and try to remix the soundtrack it was merely cleaned up and presented as clean and crisp as possible.  It might have been nice to have heard a stereo version of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score, but it would seem utterly un-natural to long time fans of the film to have an artificially enhanced stereo surround soundtrack (and the elements probably don't exist to do it anyway).<p>There's a lot of extras on the DVD's from newsreel clips to secret Easter Eggs to find and enjoy.<p>There is a generous selection of stills which are automated but can be paused if desired. One of the still galleries contains additional commentary from Roger Ebert.<p>THE POST PRODUCTION section has four subsections including Deleted Scenes which offers photos, sketches and storyboards that show scenes which did not make the final cut of the film or were abandoned even before they were shot.  <p>If you highlight the sled on the features menu you will see the 5 minute interview with Ruth Warrick who played Emily Norton Kane. She talks about working with Welles and how the film was shot under strict security so no one would know exactly what was being shot or how it was all going to be put together when it was finished.  <p>Click on the sled on the last page of the second section of the production notes for a brief 3 minute interview with director Robert Wise. Wise was the editor on Citizen Kane and he tells the story about meeting Welles for the first and one of the first screenings of the film for very nervous executives and lawyers.<p>On Disc 2  you will find the full length documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane which was originally aired on P.B.S.'s American Experience Program.  <p>It tells the backgrounds of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  How their paths crossed, how the two men clashed and how Hearst became obsessed with stopping Kane and destroying Welles' career.  Kane bombed at the box-office but was then nominated for 9 Oscars, however it won only one and afterwards RKO withdrew the film from the market and put it in it's vault for several years.  Hearst's campaign to ruin the film and Welles was pretty effective but he also hurt his own career and reputation in the process.  <p>The first of two feature length commentary tracks is from director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich's comments range from discussing the film's technical achievements and analyzing the storyline to recounting conversations he had with Welles about the film.  We learn Kane is not his favorite Welles film.<p>Roger Ebert's feature length commentary is even more interesting, informative.If you are not quite sure why the film is so highly regarded this commentary will clear it up for you. Ebert spends a lot of time talking about the innovative cinematography (deep focus photography), editing, the special optical effects used to create the imagery in the film and the lighting.  He goes into some detail about the symbolism used throughout the film and how the film was actually very low budget.  <p>Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and this DVD celebrates that by showing off the film at it's very best.  The extra's allow those who have not read several books, or seen documentaries about the film or Hearst and Welles to 'catch-up' with critics and film-buffs. <p>Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder a critically acclaimed, steamy suspense thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Even if you have this already, even if you've seen it a million times and feel the film holds no surprises, you should still get this DVD.  There's never been this much grayscale in a print of Kane.  The restoration team actually went to the best sources for each reel (the original negatives do not survive) and then digitally-removed each and every scratch from the final composite print (except in the newsreel sequence, where some of the footage is supposed to look scratched).  The sound is rich and full but has no phony exaggerated hi-fi characteristics.  Chapters are easy to access.  Packaging is first rate.  In short, there isn't anything to gripe about.<p>The first disc also has the original theatrical trailer (as original in its own way as the film itself, and a hoot), production stills, bios, newsreel footage of the 1941 premiere--in short all the stuff you'd expect.  Then it has a couple of terrific bonuses in the form of running commentary from Peter Bogdonovich, who knew Welles and wrote a bio on him, and everyone's favorite sweatered film critic, Roger Ebert.  You might think a total of four hours' of lecturing on Kane while the film plays would be tedious in the extreme, but you'd be wrong.  The second disc is a real treat: an Oscar-nominated American Masters documentary from 1995 entitled The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which parallels the life stories of Hearst and Welles as they rose to prominence and fell from influence.  I had taped this show off TV when PBS aired it, but I was thrilled to get this bonus disc of the same documentary here, razor sharp and in superb sound.  Younger folks who don't know much about Citizen Kane beyond the fact that it's considered a &quot;great film,&quot; or who don't know about Welles' many other accomplishments, or about the life of Hearst and the evolution of muckraking journalism, can watch this 2-hour documentary and then have a deeper appreciation of the movie.  The documentary makes a great companion disc and was a wise choice.<p>At the price this is a steal (essentially the second disc is free), the transfer superb, and of course Kane is great, still stunning after all these years.  (A lot of the camera tricks would be hard to pull off even today, in this age of advanced optics and computers.)  There are some really thrilling sequences, snappy dialogue (&quot;I lost a million dollars running the paper this year.  I lost a millon dollars running the paper last year.  I expect to lose a million dollars running the paper next year.  You know, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in sixty years.&quot;)  and terrific performances from everyone save Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, who in my view wasn't quite up to the complex role.  (On the other hand George Coulouris as Mr. Thatcher and Ray Collins as &quot;Boss&quot; Jim W. Gettys are terrific even though they occupy relatively short screen time.)  The cinematography and editing were literally 20 years ahead of their time.  Whether or not Kane is &quot;the greatest film of all time,&quot; it is certainly one of the most influential, and interesting in that it ultimately ended up being more about Welles than about Hearst.  (Which one of them wound up dying alone and lonely and embittered like the character of the film?)  This was the first DVD I bought and a cornerstone of any movie collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Is this Welles' greatest film? That's open to debate but it is a stunning debut that set a standard difficult to follow. At the ripe old age of 26 after a steady diet of theater, literature and performance Welles decided to turn his gaze on the one art form he really hadn't mastered. After watching John Ford's Stagecoach (and one can assume a number of Hitchcock films as well), Welles and his collaborators Herman J. Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and film editor Robert Wise created one of the enduring classics of American cinema.<br /><br />Edit: The Blu-ray edition of this film is exceptional and an improvement over the previously over processed DVD released a decade ago. Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring the film to Blu-ray providing fans with a sharp looking presentation with previously unnoticed detail (at least on home video) and a far more film-like presentation.<br /><br />Keep in mind that while Welles was in charge, Mank, Toland and Wise all played a substanial part in helping to create this classic film. All of this helps explain why Welles had a difficult time following up on Kane; he only worked with Toland and Wise once again and never with Mank. The Magnicient Ambersons is a near classic that fails primarily because of the botched version eventually released.<br /><br />This deluxe set has all the extras you could possibly ask for: the commentary tracks by Ebert and Bogdonovich are complimentary and quite different; the documentary is quite good at illuminating the infighting that went on in creating this film. This edition on Blu-ray includes "RKO 281" the docudrama about the making of the film from HBO.<br /><br />For those who appreciate Welles' film this is the ultimate edition.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>There is a reason Citizen Kane appears somewhere on just about everyone's Top 10 List of all-time great movies, and it isn't that movie reviewers and movie lovers have gone sappy &amp; sentimental or &quot;politically correct&quot; in their estimation of this film.  It is simply because it is still, over half a century later, an astonishing piece of work.  Absolutely stunning, using every trick &amp; device ever invented in movie making, and coming at them with such freshness and originality, decontructing and reconstructing them into something new &amp; unique, that the word &quot;genius&quot; was invented to describe such efforts.<p>I dislike how that word genius is bandied about so much today describing everything from gifted natural athletes to clever comedians and politicians.  I rarely use it myself.  But, if this wasn't a work of genius, I don't know what would qualify.  This is such a grown-up movie, telling an archetypal American story, but with brilliance in every frame and every line of dialogue.  Is is so mature a work, made under the strictures of the Hayes code, that it makes most of what we see today, without virtually any limits, look like the work of children.<p>AND it was made with such economy!  Really a low-budget project, through sheer brilliance a Big Story is told modestly, without a wasted shot or line of dialogue, by terrific editing and intelligent construction.  Intelligence is what you see everywhere in Citizen Kane, especially in its humor...and funny it is as well.<p>I could go on, but why bother? If you don't &quot;get it&quot; if you find it &quot;boring&quot; nothing I say will change your mind.  I will say this, if that is  your reaction, you know nothing about film-making.  Citizen Kane is an exhaustive primer in brilliant film-making.  Welles threw in the kitchen sink!  That it was a 25 year old's first movie , while not important to your enjoyment or appreciation of the film, is finally just awsome.  The continual inventiveness in scene after scene is dizzying.<p>The DVD has lots of goodies.  An excellent documentary on the background of the struggle to make and release the film and William Randolph Hearst's (somewhat understandable) effort to destroy it.  There are comments and even regrets by Welles...he was a young man tearing down an old man and there is cruelty in it.  There are 2 very different and excellent commentary tracks by Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert.  The former more a friend's recollections, the latter an intense analysis of the art of the film-making.  All in all, a very nice package.<br />The restored film is beautiful.<p>One of my oldest memories is sitting in front of a B&amp;W television mesmerized by the opening of Citizen Kane.  I must have been 10, and I don't recall if I watched it all, and certainly wouldn't have understood it all, but I was completely entranced by the sheer look of the film.  I had never seen anything like it.  It was pure Magic!  And &quot;magic&quot; it remains to film lovers the world over.  Nuff said.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is a 2-disc special edition, and I'm thinking maybe the special "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" is almost as interesting as the original movie. The point is made that this movie constituted a battle between two enormous egos, two enormously successful men: William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles. Hearst was old by that time, and Welles was young. Hearst's empire you know about. Welles had been amazingly successful in radio and producing plays in New York. He was signed to an unprecedented contract with RKO when he came to Hollywood in 1939. The script of "Kane" was leaked to Hearst, and a huge battle ensued. Interestingly, he was not nearly so upset about the film's portrayal of himself as of his second wife -- that is, Kane's second wife; I'm not sure Hearst ever married the woman he lived with who was represented by Kane's second wife. Hearst managed to have RKO stop distribution of the film, so it did not become known outside of art-film theaters and college film-making courses until much later.<br /><br />The story opens with the death of Kane, and everything from there on is about reporters attempting to follow up on the mystery behind Kane's last word: "Rosebud." So there are interviews with the people who were important in Kane's life, and then flashbacks as they tell their stories. It's an effective way to tell a story which may have been original with this film. We are talking about a film released in 1941, after all. In fact, I think many things were either original to this film or developed into now-classic movie techniques by the film. For example, Kane gazes on a picture of the "best of the best" in his rival newspaper, which then morphs into a live grouping of the same men as they are being photographed upon their coming to work for Kane. Kane (Welles was a young and quite handsome man at the time) smiles and jokes charmingly over the fact that it took him six years to get what he wanted.<br /><br />Another interesting technique is a series of identically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast. They both get older and fatter, their clothes become more expensive and elaborate, the opulent conditions in which they have their breakfast are more and more opulent, and she becomes more and more nagging and shrill. So we know it's over time, and the strong impression is that she grew increasingly bitchy and he grew increasingly tired of her. Very effective story-telling for what probably only lasts two minutes.<br /><br />There were enough differences between Hearst's life and Kane's that if he had wanted to, Welles could have fallen back on the old "it's only fiction" line in his battle with Hearst. But both were way too egotistical to allow any compromise. As the movie progresses, you can't help wondering who can be said to have won the battle in the long run.<br /><br />I'm going along with the critics who have said this is one of the best films ever made, but a bit too serious and demanding of its audience to ever be one of the most popular.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 8/04, 10/06 4/12<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />10/06: For the sake of history, reading the story behind Citizen Kane will do you justice of understanding what the picture is all about. Watching Citizen Kane alone isn't enough because it is not possible to see it of a masterpiece, and you will end up finding it an ordinary film. But knowing and understanding the background that led to Citizen Kane, it becomes more clear and understandable why it is a masterpiece. The film is very strong, powerful, and picturesque. Orson Welles did a brilliant job of portraying Charles Foster Kane, the evil magnate of immense power and wealth. The character was a villain because he never understood what it is like to be a human. When Charles failed to do that, he became a bigger and bigger monster until he fully realized that he actually hated what he had become of, and that's the brilliance behind Citizen Kane. It's not even about the sled per se but rather the huge concept behind that sled. Citizen Kane is about the loss of happiness that would never be regained. This is not as easy as it sounds, but Orson Welles did it. That was in 1941, and sixty-five years later, Citizen Kane is still a stunning picture.<br /><br />4/12: Orson Welles reaches the top on his first try, and he has never been the same since. Citizen Kane does put things into perspective. It is an important film for a numerous of reasons. Moreover, it's one of the best cinematographically shot picture. The film really says it all through its manipulation of vision to unfold a story. The controversy behind the film, most especially how the plot was constructed, is probably even bigger than the film per se, and that is what makes Citizen Kane a compelling picture to watch. All in all, Orson Welles will forever be famous for Citizen Kane, a legacy that he can never escape from.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>This videotape's editorial accurately describes it: a fine slipcase with a hinged front cover that reveals within photos and film trivia, plus a superbly clear transfer of a monumental American movie.<br /><br />If the stories are to be believed, Orson Welles created CITIZEN KANE as an act of vengeance for a sleight he received from W.R. Hearst during a dinner party at the tycoon's enormous California estate. Welles supposedly included "Rosebud" in his semi-bio of Hearst to embarrass the man. This mysterious word was the publisher's nickname for an intimate body part belonging to his mistress, Marion Davies. (BTW... watch closely in the film's early snow scene for a revealing "Rosebud" hint, when young Kane hits a visitor with his beloved sled and we see the famous flower insignia on it.)<br /><br />Is this picture, as so many claim, THE GREATEST ever made? Since all art is subjective, can there ever be a single BEST motion picture, painting, statue or song? Whether or not "Kane" is numero uno, two things are certain:<br />1.) CITIZEN KANE is *classic* film making in every sense imaginable.<br />2.) Its high regard and place in cinematic history are assured, perhaps for all time.<br /><br />"Citizen Kane" is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />The excellent HBO biopic about the creation of "Citizen Kane," RKO 281 (1999) features Liev Schreiber's remarkable portrayal of the enigmatic boy-director.

To get to the point, though, there IS a reason for all this fuss. Admittedly, Citizen Kane may not be THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME because that title really doesn't have any meaning - there are so many types of films that to compare them ALL in one category is ridiculous. <p>Nevertheless, as stated earlier, there is a reason why Citizen Kane has been ranked as it has. Although it is easy to dismiss Citizen Kane as no longer being as groundbreaking as it once was, this is a silly way to approach film. So what if it is no longer new technologically? Watched as objectively as possible, like any other film, Citizen Kane is very entertaining and has many obvious merits. For instance, the acting is top notch, as is the insightful, cynical script. Yes, the cinematography is good too. <p>Just in case there are people out there who aren't familiar with the plot of this film, it is a series of flashbacks on the life of Charles Foster Kane, a man who controlled numerous newspapers and a vast fortune. Many films dealing with tycoons have been made before and since Citizen Kane, but none have been able to deal with the topic as brilliantly as Orson Welles did in his remarkable debut. <p>Anyhow, it may be that Citizen Kane has aged some, and it is hard to identify ONE FILM as the greatest of all time. But after watching Citizen Kane with an open mind it becomes clear why people might rate it as such - from start to finish, this is a beautifully rendered, interesting, and amusing film. As far as unforgettable moments go, it's tough to beat ROSEBUD! So go see what the fuss is all about and enjoy two hours of classic entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things.  They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end.  They expect building drama and a climax.  In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.<br /><br />Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema.  In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them.  Most of the critics and the general audience "didn't get it", so to speak.  That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the "outrageous" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.<br /><br />Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't.  Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now.  Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.<br /><br />Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect.  The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with "No Trespassing".  One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end.  It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal.  Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters...  and then what is the audience supposed to do with it?<br /><br />Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach.  This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated.  It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.<br /><br />As for this DVD, it is an very good transfer and especially is required for the soundtrack.  For once we can finally hear why exactly she's a bad singer, we can hear his whispered death-word, and some more expressionist techniques are revealed.  Commentary tracks are interesting enough, I suppose, but the documentary is much more worth the time for seeing the importance of the movie without having anybody getting too nostalgic about the film proper.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>This is the greatest American film ever made, as entertaining as it is revolutionary. <p>When it was made, Orson Welles tackled a seemingly simple topic, a reflection back on a dead man's search for love and happiness in his life, and made a film that's epic in scope, gorgeous in its visual execution, brilliantly written, incredibly acted. <p>All in all, it's inspiring to filmmakers looking for a great debut film from a new director. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; also works for regular moviegoers just looking for a good drama.<p>Using interviews with all his closest friends and colleagues, Welles uses flashback to create a portrait of the life of millionaire media magnate Charles Foster Kane.

I wasn't as captivated as watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and I may not have been as entertained as watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLV6">The Rules of the Game - Criterion Collection</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FSME1A">Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> but there is something about this movie.  One that leaves you visually impressed as well as intellectually satisfied.  It's not as fast paced as the movies of this generation but it will hold your attention to the end.<br /><br />This 60th edition two disc set includes two commetaries, one from reknowned director Peter Bogdanovich, and one from reknowned critic Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert's commentary is the better of the two.  He sure knows a lot about films.  Other than a threatrical trailer there's nothing else to the first disc.  The second disc features the 1990's production "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" almost as long and entertaining as the movie itself.<br /><br />Definite Must Buy.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Love it, hate it, or be indifferent, Citizen Kane is clearly an American Classic. It holds such power in the cinema world due to the immensity of its themes - ego, the will to power, the American Dream silver trail from poverty to immense wealth, the overarching power and instability of the media, the effect of women and men on each other. It is a contender for the Great American Movie - just like the parallel battle for Great American Novel. This is something only realy done in the USA. No one speaks of the Great British Movie, or the Great European Movie - the same paradigm just doesn't seem to appear for the more varied, fragmented film industries over here. But in America you have to strive to be the best, the greatest. Orson Welles, a fledgling director and star knew he was grappling with something immense here, and he holds true course well throughout. The movie is a compelling jigsaw puzzle plot with fantastically original cinematography (for its time, though there is a big debt to early Hitchcock), that slots in place revelations about a complex, turbulent character of a paragon of the Great American Male. The rewards are immense - but the sacrificies can be ruinous. And what use are all those gilded possessions in the end when they're carted away and burned? The ego is fragile, consciousness transient, and everyone knows how even the greatest stories must end eventually.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I've seen Citizen Kane three times now, and there is no question that its arrival in Hollywood had to be greeted with the same kind of bewilderment one would expect from going back in time and giving the Incas a microwave. Its technological advancements are notable as the artistic talents of the director still us dazzle today. The choice of camera angles, the settings for the scenes, and the entire idea of a film-long treatment of a man's psychological makeup illustrates just how innovative and unique this classic is. The "rosebud" mystery holds our attention throughout. Outside of the film itself, the history of its production and release is nearly as interesting as what transpires on the screen. Frankly, I was surprised that Hearst did not sue Orson Welles for defamation, but then I read an article showcasing all the differences between the life of W. Randolph Hearst and those of Charles Foster Kane; so now I'm not sure what to think about the controversy. Anyway, it adds another level of allure to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a powerful film that deserves to be studied for another century or more. I  recommend it, but, in my opinion, it is not close to being the greatest film of all time. Although its worth is undeniable, I can only place it in my Top 30 list. It manages to be brilliant and overrated, which is as difficult and unprecedented a combination as there may be. Others from the period, like Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon outshine the Welles effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Though I would hesitate to call this the greatest film, I would certainly rate it as one of the greatest debut films in the history of cinema along with Godard's 'Breathless'. Like Breathless, Kane instigated a revolution in film style that all subsequent film releases are greatly indebted to. I prefer Welles' 'Touch of Evil' to this one - but as far as originality and breathtakeing visual talent are concerned - Kane is right at the top.  Welles was uncompromising - and thank god for that!</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Five stars aren't enough for this Tour-de-force from the prodigy of radio, stage, and the theatre, the incomparable Welles.<br />The camera innovations, story structure, and screenplay are wonderous.  A real leap of the imagination for the time, this is undoubtably the best movie ever (at least for the U.S., we won't be too presumptious)!</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>Last night I found myself in a moviehouse seeing CITIZEN KANE for the very first time. I have 2 admit it:<p>IT IS A DARN GOOD MOVIE<p>The editing/montage in the beginning is 2 my knowledle not surpassed. Orson  Welles comes through as a magnetic presence. Yet, the biggest revelation is  not the high technical standard, but that the film has characters of REAL  flesh and blood. KANE is indeed a REGULAR CITIZEN. Seeing KANE to me was  like meeting myself in the door; a person full of flaws - yes a normal  human being. The other actors are good 2 and it is a real joy 2 see  AAAAAALLL the twists the story contains. I brought with me an 18-year-old  and we saw it as a test... We were both spellbound.<p>It MUST be regarded  as a handbook for young directors, writers, photographers...  THIS IS  T  H E key film for anyone who wants 2 be a part of the medium.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Even after sixty years, CITIZEN KANE remains as one of the greatest movies of all time. Though it is true that some are bored by the movie because it's &quot;just a boring black-and-white movie with no action&quot;, those who hold that opinion are in the minority. KANE is often held as the pinnacle of filmmaking by movie buffs not just because of the advances the movie made in film production, but also because it set the standard that all filmmakers wish to reach: the total director's vision; a movie made with total control and no studio intervention. With that said, what does KANE hold for the average film-goer? The movie has an excellent script (it won an Oscar), great acting, and a haunting score. The story, though loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, is an old one: powerful man starts out promising and full of ideals, becomes consumed by greed and looses his vision, and ends up loosing it all (anyone read MacBeth or ALL THE KING'S MEN?). Overall, a deeply penetrating and thinking movie that film buffs usually love and that most everyone else will at least enjoy if they don't mind a strong drama filmed in black and white.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made.  This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.<p>To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem.  A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage.  Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal.  And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.  The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore.  They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates.  As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longers offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.<p>There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels.  Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Charles Foster Kane; welcome to Xanadu the biggest fortress ever built. That opening sequence in which we feel inmediatly the presence of the purest sense of the german expressionism, gives us one of the multiple clues who will give Orson Welles, this legend name in the cinema story.<br />Ths story is told brilliantly for Welles; the way Welles introduces to the world of Kane is through a new who informs us about the death. Warning about this point because Kane will never be telling his life in first person, but through all those knew him in a far or close distance. In this sense Welles, cleverly gives us a huige puzzle that you as viewers must arrange , and thanks to all his countless devices, at the end of the film when you finally discover what Rosebud means , you leave your seat convinced you're a private eye; but rememeber what Welles said once about Rosebud: it just was Freud for one dollar.<br />And this bitter opinion is due the fact that Rosebud means the iodea of something that never reached the complete process of growing up; a flower who never became the best of itself; I mean this point is remarkable because the sense of unfinishness is what Kane means ; nor more either less.<br />In fact Kane is a man who had everything he wanted; except just one thing; his stolen youth and the dreams contained in this unique stage of the life; the world needed just before he reached his twenty years old and made from him a man before the time comes.<br />That's why you can understand his outrageous character; and thanks to The Inquirer he can expand his biological time and in a certain way to try to live his lost years.<br />When he meets to Marian in that funny water accident; he confess her another clue; both of them are surrounded and involved by the loneliness even they are so distant in his respective social status.<br />And all his efforts walk in this direction. Remember by instance, the smart answer pronounced by Kane in a very special inflexion point of the story: &quot;I'm all what you hate&quot; .<br />Kane loves challenging the world, in every little detail; he plays with it and &quot;no matter if he losses one million dollars each year , because he would lose all his fortune in Sixty years&quot;.<br />All his life turns around the sophistication, the greatness and above all to be remembered and loved or hated but never pass away by a sense of indifference. And this is an important issue, because there's a shakesperian mood in this point of view.<br />How can you translate the shakesperian spirit of glory and trascendence into a raising democatric country and also the new raisng empire of the world.<br />That impplies all his outrageousness; the expensive parties; the employement of the deepness of field which lets you watch the secondary planes just beside the first; remeber that dramatic sequence in which Welles and Cotten walk in the newspaper room.<br />The camera works at the floor level; another clever device of Welles; I think he wants to give us the sensation of being in a theatre hall , and in many ways that resource let add much more dramatism to every take.<br />Greg Tolland made an unfirgettable work behind the camera; because this film demands of you that the images through the travellings , dollies and objective use be another actor in this play.<br />The monumentality all along his achievements is obviously a consequence of his character; that justifies the fact of trying Marian be the greates prima voice female in the Opera ; (however; in the deep of his soul and his mind he knows she'll never reach that goal; but once more he's challenging the world)<br />Remember what Oscar Wilde said once:  &quot;The difference between a caprice and a passion who remains all the time of one life; is the caprice remains for a longer time&quot; .<br />This film will be always a must for all the viewers of any age and as well as Bach , Mozart or Beethoven music or the Michelangelo works or Vermeer paintings , due his mythical essence; such its own force for transforming every time you watch them; but the question is Who really transforms: you , the work of both of two?<br />Orson Welles (1915-1985) still continues being a refernce point for many film makers , great or minors ; and to name his contributions would surpass certainly the permitted limit of this review.<br />A film is really good, when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, undoubtly a wise sentence of Orson Welles.<br />It's time for all those people who still hadn't watched this movie that literally is a must to make it.<br />A masterpiece in the widest sense of the word.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>This is the movie of a life! It's the masterpiece of Orson Wells in an awesome double DVD edition. Great documentaries, great commentaries. Too bad, Orson is not of this world anymore. I would have loved to hear his own commentary. Orson Wells was a genius, a prodigy and film this incredible movie practicing what we could call for this time, avantgarde angles, lighting. editing.... If you are interested in filmmaking and golden age of the American Cinema, pick this! UN CHEF D'OEUVRE and in my opinion the best movie ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This film was ranked highest when the American Film Institute announced its list of "America's Greatest Movies," followed by Casablanca, The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia which complete the top five. It has been 62 years since its release and yet it remains one of the most interesting, indeed compelling films ever made. It was directed by Orson Welles who also plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. William Randolph Hearst presumably served as the model for Kane. (I have no interest in getting into all that now. Others have already discussed quite thoroughly the film's historical context and have much of value to say about it. The comments which follow are limited entirely to the film itself.) Perhaps only directors and cinematographers can fully appreciate Welles' technical achievements in this film. Even 62 years later, I am still fascinated by the analysis of Kane personality, especially as it is revealed in his relationships with various associates over several decades. His intelligence is formidable, his charm almost irresistible and yet....<br /><br />Most of us have an indelible childhood memory or association. For Kane, it is "Rosebud," the last word he spoke before dying. Those who view this film accompany reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he seeks to understand the meaning of Kane's last word. We learn that  Kane  was relinquished as a child by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a substantial fortune; his conflicts with his guardian, Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impetuous decision to run a newspaper with the help of schoolmate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) because it would be "fun"; his emergence from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; then Kane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called "Xanadu."<br /><br />Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends. What does Kane make of his childhood? When was he happiest? Why embarrass and abandon Emily, a decent and devoted wife? Why did he decide to spend what remained of his life with Susan Alexander? As he lay dying, did he feel that his life (everything considered) was a success? I have thought about these and other questions a great deal and am dissatisfied with my responses to them. No doubt that explains why this film continues to attract and then frustrate me...and perhaps others. There are other questions which I would have asked of Welles, especially during his final years.<br /><br />Perhaps (just perhaps) the answers to all of the questions which could be asked of Kane and of the man who created and then portrayed him cannot be answered. And perhaps (just perhaps) that is why this film continues to attract and then frustrate efforts such as mine and others to explain it. So I guess we must cherish its art and accept its ambiguities, just as ultimately we must accept the basic ambiguity of what it means to be a complicated human being.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Every time this movie is rerun on Television, I stop the remote and see it over again to pick out some of the incredible and innovative visuals and details Wells made.  The bedroom tantrum scene was years ahead of it time.  This is the greatest movie ever made!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>This is a movie that can arguably be called the greatest movie ever made (and I lean towards the belief that it is one of the greatest movies ever made). The innovations Welles and Toland made in the cinematography and as a director were years and years ahead of their time. The makeup and art direction is Oscar Worthy. Even Robert Wise's editing was well done. Welles use lighting, the deep focus, long takes, and low angles was revolutionary. Sure, there are several plot holes and continuity goes all to hell, but you don't notice it. That's how much the movie captures you visually, and with the superb acting from Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everette Sloan, and Dorothy Comingore you don't notice until you've seen it several times. Oh, and before I forget, Hermann was the composer.<p>The DVD itself has a lot of great features, this is how a DVD should be made. It is a 2 disc set that is packaged beautifully in a slipcover case. There is commentary from Roger Ebert (who really analysis the film for you) and Peter Bogdanovitch, who was apparently a friend of Welles and has alot of great insights. You also get quick interviews with Ruth Warwick (the actress to portraits Kane's first wife) and Robert Wise (editor).<br />One major problem with the DVD is that in the storyboards, production stills, and call sheets you have no control over how fast they go. pretty much at the mercy of the DVD. <p>Disc 2 contains a 2 hour documentary on the Battle for Citizen Kane between Welles and Hearst.<p>It Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made? I don't know, but certainly in the top five.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is a masterpiece. The last tycoon of the first half of the twentieth century. A power and an influence entirely based on newspapers and a new way to practice journalism : journalism as a reality show. Kane has the tendency though to think he can mould the opinions of people as if he controlled them through his papers. The film is a sad demonstration of the impact of such journalism and at the same time its limits and its failures. Actually he is destroyed in his political career by the same papers and journalism that all the other papers immediately imitated because the circulation of Kane&#65533;s papers was menacing the others to be crushed down into oblivion. But the film also explores the personal dimension of the character, his pharaonic ambition, his cult of collecting artistic artefacts or any other collectibles, his love for his second wife and its inevitable end because she could not live up to his dream of being some kind of king or god on earth. She felt abandoned and crushed by the famous palace of Xanadu and finally decided to leave. Strangely enough the film does not emphasize the death of his son, from his first marriage, a death that must have been particularly dramatic to Kane. The film is also a masterpiece by its technique and the way the story is unveiled and developed. It tried all kinds of story-telling techniques, a film in the film, a musical in the film, a jounalistic investigation within the journalistic world of Kane, and a completely exploded plot line that follows the investigation more than chronology. Things come apparently haphazardly though in an absolutely planned way. The structure is not clear cut and onesided, but rather a multifarious and multifacetted structure that gives to the film a tremendous power and dynamism.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>This is the movie that you must see!  The drama and intrigue of this classic centers around a man - and his single dying word.  Charles Foster Kane is an incredible character of power and ultimate misery.  If you are a fan of movies at all - you have to experience Citizen Kane.  It simply is the Godfather of all dramas to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>This was the film that almost never was. Orson Welles, an accomplished radio personality was given a really extraordinary deal by RKO Studios. Basically he had complete control over his projects, final say on the final cut, whatever actors he wanted and could write, star and direct this film. However, it was too closely related to the life of a newspaper tycoon that he wanted it destroyed. And how's this for irony: the "greatest film ever made" was actually booed whenever one of it's 9 Oscar nominations were announced on stage.<br /><br />The movie starts out famously with Charles Foster Kane, an old man clutching a snow globe and muttering "Rosebud" before dying. A news reporter wants to find out what was so special about this word, could mean anything, could mean nothing. So we find a man named Thompson visiting people who knew Kane and see if he can unravel the mystery.<br /><br />While it may not look like since it's been near 60 years since the film came out, there was a lot of new camera techniques and lighting on the film. One it introduced was deep focus photography, where everything in front of the camera and everything way in the background were in focus, which was new since it was usually one's clear, one isn't.<br /><br />Also with the help of deep focus, certain scenes suggest something without saying it. There's a shot where Kane is signing away control to his fortune so he doesn't by everything in sight and in the room behind is what looks like a standard sized room with a standard sized mirror. However he walks closer to the mirror and you find out it's a big damn mirror with the top of it being close to 20 feet above his head. Another scene is in regards to a massive fireplace same concept.<br /><br />There's the infamous political rally where he just basically had a painting, punched some holes and moved lights around to simulate movement. When Kane meets his 2nd wife his face is fully lit, but when things start to go little sour, he's backlit(meaning his face is in shadow). There's many more of these(for example in the opening scene there's one window that is always in the same place every single frame despite we're getting closer to the mansion.<br /><br />All this talk of the technological feats and not a word about the film itself. To be honest, it's a good film. It's not "holy $%#@ that's the best film eva!" but it's not horrible. You watch it and it's not a moving film, it's just really well done.<br /><br />Also, check out the Ebert commentary. Say what you want about his tastes but he does know film. He's like an encyclopedia almost bringing details that you'd think "why would he know that? and how?" He also gets into the technical shots and how they were done which is quite different for a critic.<br /><br />Anyway you look at it, it is a quite well-made film, it's just it may not be everyone's cup of tea but there's a lot of people who seem to like this cup.<br /><br />P.S: The tycoon is William Randolph Hearst and for proof that this may be based on his life: Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies, had a nickname for her umm, sexual body part between her legs...."rosebud".</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Citizen Kane" has always been enigmatic to me.  There is no denying that when this film was released in 1941 it was light-years ahead of other films in regard to technique, story-telling, and enough cannot be said about the superlative cinematography by Gregg Toland.  The screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz is superb.  The ensemble acting by the Mercury Theatre troupe is outstanding. Orson Welles had to have the most chutzpah in the world to make a veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful men in the world at this time.  But is this (bold letters for effect)THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME?  In all likelihood, yes.  That said, I would not rank it as one of my favorite films but one I deeply admire.  With apologies to Roger Ebert, this film can probably be best viewed in a film course where it can be analyzed and dissected.  It may just be me, but I hold "The Godfather" in higher esteem, a film that is both art and entertains.  A film by Orson Welles that I enjoy more is "A Touch of Evil" because it has higher entertainment value(and atmosphere to die for).  Another recommendation for Welles fans is "The Third Man", a film that Welles appears in but did not direct but it sure feels like he did.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>This Fictional Account of the life of Charles Foster Cain (Really William Randolph Hearst...but I digress) is atop every critics list for a very good reason...It was duely earned!<p>This film is nothing short of a masterpiece in terms of casting (Ruth Warrick brings a powerful edge in the most subtle performance you will ever see!), lighting, camerawork, writing...you name it and it's got an element of filmmaking that is the benchmark of greatness.  <p>What's even more astounding is realizing that Welles was 25 when he made this!  How someone could convey so many tacit aspects of a larger than life character and keep him real without making him a cartoonish buffoon is an amazing feat when you think of the life experience you need to live for the kind of perspective necessary to avoid a very easy pitfall such as that.<p>This DVD should be a staple to any self-respecting DVD collector...it can't possible disappoint you.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>It can be difficult to watch a "classic" film like this because of all the baggage that comes along with it. It's a challenge to stay unbiased. Almost like when a trial has to be moved because all the potential jurors have already been influenced. Citizen Kane certainly falls in this camp. After all, it is perennially ranked #1 (AFI, Sight & Sound, etc.) and thus there is an *expectation* that it will be one of the best.<br /><br />It might well be other people's favorite film, but I cannot say the same. It was very good, and I will surely watch it again (I've already watched it twice on this nice new DVD). But I can think of several movies I like better, including Casablanca which came out a year later.<br /><br />Funny enough, I see more of a parallel between Charles Foster Kane and Orson Welles (later in life) than I do between Kane and William Randolph Hearst. In the end I think the film is a technical masterpiece and kudos to Welles, who of course also directed and produced. But in my opinion, he was better in Touch of Evil (1958).<br /><br />I think honestly this is a three-and-a-half star movie and I should probably round up because of all the great extras on this release.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)<br /><br />Gather together one hundred professional film critics. You can mix and match them in any way you like, from any country in the world and from any period of time after World War II. Ask them what the best movie ever made is. While there are very few things about which film critics agree, this is one of them: the choice by the overwhelming majority of your mix-and-match set of film critics will be Citizen Kane. (The website They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? actually does this, except with, as I write this, 1,365 critics. I don't need to tell you what the outcome is, do I?) That said, faced with actually seeing a film so widely regarded as the best ever made, the average Goat is going to have one of two reactions: either "hey, wow, they're right!" or "what's all the hype about?"<br /><br />Well, I'm your average Goat. And I have to say, I can see what all the hype is about, as long as I turn my head and squint just right. I like Pauline Kael's quote about it: "it's the most fun you'll ever have watching a great movie." Now there's a sentiment I can get behind.<br /><br />Welles' masterpiece is great not just because of the movie itself-- which Welles wrote, produced, and directed at the tender age of twenty-six (by contrast, Muranu was thirty-four when he directed Nosferatu, Romero twenty-nine at the time of Night of the Living Dead, Riefenstahl thirty-three at the time of Triumph des Willens)-- but because of the politics surrounding it. I won't even begin to attempt to get into that here; the American Experience documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane (thoughtfully included with the 2005 Warner two-disc set) is longer than the film itself. See The Battle Over Citizen Kane soon after seeing the movie itself to get some perspective.<br /><br />Note: here be spoilers. I assume the majority of those reading this, even those who haven't seen the film, already know the whole "Rosebud" shtick, but I'll warn you about spoilers anyway.<br /><br />The plot: a media tycoon, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), dies of old age. His last word: "Rosebud." A newsreel crew working on a ten-minute film of his life wants to find out what he meant, and the rest of the film is members of the crew talking to Kane's friends and intimates, trying to track down the meaning of that word. They never do. Through the omniscience of the camera, we find out that "Rosebud" was the name of the sled Kane had as a child growing up poor in Wyoming, and that no one else will ever know this; the sled itself is burned by junk dealers as the closing credits roll.<br /><br />Now, here's the thing. The legions of folks who say "it's just a sled!" missed the entire point, and that's how Welles sets the whole thing up. Everything from the early scene of Welles in Wyoming (in which, of course, Rosebud plays a minor role) to the final moment of the film is a red herring. Which leads you to one of two conclusions: either the mystery is secondary to Kane's life in Welles' vision, or Welles would go to any length to pull a fast one. (I lean towards the second hypothesis.) It's a fun red herring, to be sure; after the screening of the newsreel itself, which takes up the first ten minutes of Citizen Kane (and they are the slowest in the movie), it rollocks and bounces along making just as much fun of itself as it does of the larger-than-life Charles Foster Kane. And it does make fun of Kane; why else would they portray a media tycoon longing, on his deathbed, for his penniless existence in the middle of nowhere? But the claws are always at least covered in velvet; it's an affectionate sort of savagery, if such a thing is possible. No one the film crew talks to is overly fond of Kane, and some outright hate him; all, however, are forced to admit to at least grudging respect for the man. Now, think about that for a moment (and think about the fact that Welles himself is playing the object of all this scorn); there's a whole lot of emotional layering going on here. Solid stuff for a twenty-six-year-old kid.<br /><br />Welles had a grand vision for this movie, and, given complete freedom by the studio, he realized it. He did, in fact, make a great movie. Even with all the perspective, all the historical facts, all the mulling it over for weeks and realizing the depth of the script coupled with the incredible acting talent, pitch-perfect production, etc., though, I'm not even sure it's my favorite Welles movie. (I have a soft spot for The Stranger, the Welles that never pops up on anyone's thousand-best list, much less hundred-best.) Yes, it's a fantastic piece of work, an absolute must-see, a thoroughly enjoyable ride through the mind of one of the finest directors to ever work inside (or outside) the Hollywood machine. And it's possible that no movie ever made could live up to the hype to which this one has been subjected. It's genius, yes. But the best movie ever made? See it, and decide for yourself. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, this is the story of the rise and fall of one of the wealthiest men in the world.  It is also the story of a period of time in American history beginning in the 1890s when it seemed that all was possible.  Its innovative film techniques also raised the standard to which the world of film would forevermore have to aspire. <p>The film begins with the death of the rich man, Charles Forster Kane.  The audience sees newsreel footage about his life and so the general outline is established early.  But when a newspaper reporter now interviews all the people who knew him well, the flashbacks tell the real story.  Orson Wells plays Kane in an outstanding performance, the use of makeup as well as his voice and body language making him age before our eyes.  Joseph Cotton plays his best friend.  And Agnes Moorehead has a small role as his mother.  The rest of the cast's names are less familiar today:  Ruth Warrick is cast as his first wife; Ray Collins as a corrupt politician; Everett Sloan as his business associate; Dorothy Comingore as his second wife.  They were all young unknowns then, and it was Orson Wells' skill that brought out outstanding performances from all.<p>The Turner Classic Edition of the video I watched included a short piece about the technical aspects of creating the film, which I found fascinating.  According to Robert Wise, who did the film editing, shooting though cheesecloth filled with sand to get a grainy effect created the newsreel shots.  Some shots were done from a camera that was actually placed below floor level and aimed upwards or a ceiling camera aimed downwards. The dominant characters had camera angles aimed upwards at them; the weaker characters were shot with camera angles aimed downward. The film is shot in black and white with high contrast, often having the foreground characters completely in shadow. Often, the features of a character are indistinct and shadowy and it is the voice that carried the action.  Other times, the entire scene is in what is called "deep focus" with every bit of it absolutely clear.  It was Wells' genius that made it all work so well.<p>The film moved fast and held my interest throughout.  There was never a lull or a dull moment because of the technique of overlapping dialog, which moved the viewer from one scene to another with maximum effect.  No detail was left out to make this a perfect film, which can be watched over and over again, just to see its unique composition.  I give this video my highest recommendation.  If you've never seen it, don't miss it.  If you've seen it before, see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I hardly think this is the best film ever made.  It's too gimmicky by half.  The script isn't all that wonderful and I feel the Rosebud thing was a disappointment.  It looks and feels like a magician show.  Money can't buy you love-but if it can get you 9 out of 10 things in life-that ain't bad.  Buy a dog.  They love unconditionally.  If you curious to see what all the hype is about or if you're studying film-then it's worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film opens on a silent and dark night. An old man dies peacefully in bed, alone. It shows the vast riches of this extremely wealthy man - his monument. Charles Foster Kane was the greatest newspaper tycoon of his day. His wealth derived from a gold mine in Colorado, obtained almost by chance. His newspapers were loved by many, and hated by many. The news reels give his history. He was on track to be elected governor, but a sex scandal caused a loss. He retired to Xanadu, his lavish estate, then died as all must. The journalists will try to investigate his life to figure out his dying words (as if that could be relevant to anybody). This film continues as a search to uncover a mystery that may be unexplainable.<br /><br />Charles Foster Kane was taken from his parents at an early age because of a contract his mother signed (her investment advisor). Kane received the best education money can buy, but this is omitted. Kane's pleasure is his newspaper, he is a crusader for the masses against the Robber Barons (to deprive a third party of this cause). But in time he is forced to sell control of his 'Inquirer' to a bank. The scenes show how editorial policy is remade. [Note the gas lights, an open flame.] Kane hires away the newspaper men from a competitor to create the greatest circulation in New York, the financial capital. Kane marries the niece of a President (money talks?). Jed Leland tells his memories of Kane. The scenes show Charles' changes in his marriage (he is more arrogant and powerful). Kane runs for governor, a liberal who is the friend of the working man and decent people. [But will the ruling class support this upstart?]<br /><br />Poor Charlie doesn't realize that private investigators were shadowing him, and his private life ends his hope for a public life. [Most big city politicians were taking payoffs to support the local corporations.] Nothing is more scandalous than a reformer with hidden faults; a politician who is known to love drink and women won't be defeated for this. Susan's singing career soon ends. Perhaps they aimed too high, musical comedies rather than grand opera? Some very dramatic scenes follow and reveal more of the personalities of Charles and Susan. Poor Susan can't stand the strain and pressure. Can a publisher really create a star? Can a millionaire provide a starring role for his girlfriend today? Does great wealth and power lead to corruption and insanity? Was Kane's search for love the result of an unhappy childhood? Charlie's vandalism of his wife's bedroom suggests a sick mind. There is an inventory of Kane's property. What is it worth? Kane saved everything (like many of his generation). At the end we see a child's sled and its name.<br /><br />This film may have been novel in its day, but now seems dated. It seems like it came from a radio play. It is not really historical or satirical. There were plenty of other targets available, but this film barely recognizes the events that existed during Kane's lifetime (post Civil War to World War II). A fictionalized account closer to reality might have been better.<br /><br />Since he died alone, how did anyone learn his last word?</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane generally is considered the greatest film ever made.  It has top numerous lists (including AFI's Top 100 American Films) and is revered by practically every movie critic.  While some film has to rank number one, and Citizen Kane deserves the title as much as any film, actually watching the film is a bit of a letdown.  That is not to deny the film's greatness.  Orson Welles directed, co-wrote and stars in the film and he set the standard for the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee to command the three major components of a movie.  No one else reached the levels of greatness that Mr. Welles reached with Kane.  His acting is brilliant, the screenplay is sharp and his directing is first rate.  The fact that he only won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was a commercial bomb shows that the Academy and film going public weren't ready to accept this progressive film and how he was ahead of his time.  The actors in the film were apart of Mr. Welles' Mercury Players and they all (especially Joseph Cotton) give strong turns.  Going back to my point about the film being a bit of a letdown, I mean with all the praise and superlatives that are heaped on the Citizen Kane, the film has set such an impossible buildup, it may not meet the modern film fan's expectations.  The bonus disk is worthy of a separate release itself.  It contains the documentary, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which itself was nominated for an Oscar, that is one of the better documentaries about Hollywood that has been produced.  Orson Welles was a true movie visionary, but despite the fact that he would go on to create many first rate films, he was never able to duplicate the greatness of Citizen Kane.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>In 1941 actor/director/writer Orson Welles would release one of the most cherished films to ever hit the silver screen.  Many have cited it as the greatest film of all time, and many more agree that Citizen Kane is the quintessential American movie.  Like all great films it transcends traditional narrative to become something all its own.  The movie almost holds a surreal feel as audiences are thrust into the luxurious, yet lonely life of Charles Foster Kane.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a great looking film, no question about it.  It's obvious that the sets are fake but the movie uses that to its full advantage.  Each of these sets is so exaggerated and ornate that it allows the film to transcend generations.  It's a kind of timeless quality that is rarely seen in contemporary pieces.  What looked good in this film upon its release still looks good to this day because it is an exaggeration of the American culture, which when someone really thinks about it, hasn't changed much since the time of Citizen Kane's release.<br /><br />Even more important to Citizen Kane's set designs are the lighting mixed with expert photography.  Lighting of Kane becomes the most crucial aspect of discerning his character and foreshadowing his path.  Though the dialogue is often brilliant, Citizen Kane seems to have been made with solely the visuals in mind, because it is clear that the story of Kane's rise and fall can be told through the powerful imagery presented throughout the movie.<br /><br />From being the "voice of the people" through the use of his newspaper (The Inquirer) to giving off the ferocious political campaign speeches clearly inspired by Adolf Hitler, the scope of Citizen Kane never seems to back down in its uncompromising character-study of a man who could never back down.  As the viewer follows his path towards self-destruction they realize that this character is not unlike many who still inhabit the country to this very day.  When they look at Orson Welles as Kane they can see the type of person everyone knows all too well.  Everyone knows about someone who will do anything for love, only to discover he's done all the wrong things.  Kane fails in life because he never learns that an emotion such as love can never be bought.  Gratitude can be bought, or appreciation, but love requires something beyond the material realm of personal interaction.  All these emotional issues are brought to focus by the film's outstanding scope, which is far ahead of its time.<br /><br />What else stands out about this film?  Everyone cites the lighting, directing, and sets, but also one needs to keep in mind: Orson Welles' acting is extraordinary.  He can be funny, tragic, compelling, charismatic, and many scenes he is in make-up in order to play Kane through the decades.  Surely it is one of the greatest performances ever captured on the silver screen.<br /><br />So, is Citizen Kane the "greatest movie ever made"?  Without much hesitation the answer is yes.  Maybe it isn't at times the most entertaining film ever made, but it clearly has the merits that make it worth seeing again and again.  This film looks great, its story is full of loose-ends for the audience to solve for themselves, but most important of all is how well the film has aged.  There are not many, if any complaints to be had in regards to Orson Welles cinematic landmark.<br /><br />Citizen Kane remains the undisputed champion of American cinema...<br /><br />But how is the DVD?  Well, in short: the two-disc special edition is a great restoration of this film and includes a great deal of special features.  The best of these features is a feature length commentary by infamous film critic Roger Ebert and the other being the documentary "The Battle for Citizen Kane" which is a great overview of the conflict between Orson Welles and communications tycoon William Hearst.<br /><br />If you truly love movies you'd be a fool not to have this landmark film as a part of your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>I watched this documentary as part of the Citizen Kane DVD. It is good, telling about the power struggle between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst. I also never knew before just how much Welles and Herman J. Mankewickz borrowed from Hearst's life when they wrote the Citizen Kane screenplay. But though it was supposed to be about Citizen Kane, the documentary didn't tell that much about the film itself. It was also rather slow and repetitive. How many times do I need to know that Hearst was a powerful man or that Welles was a young genius? I wanted to learn more about the movie itself. The extras were also nil, there being only a chapter selection and ads for other documentaries...</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>It doesn't take long to realize that even the best movies have their detractors.  When "Citizen Kane" topped the list of the 100 best American movies of all time, there were a few critics of a choice that many felt did not appeal to the majority of American movie-goers.  Fair enough although "Citizen Kane" certainly has a story that is a lot easier to follow and enjoy that most of the "artistic" movies of the last century. It does seem to slow down at times but this is one of those movies that reveals more and more about itself each time you view it.<br /><br />It is as though the puzzle of the movie is also a puzzle for the movie audience.  What did Kane mean by the dying word, "Rosebud"?  Well, everyone who saw it through to the end certainly got a big clue but did that really tell everything there is or was it just a big hint to the larger story hidden in the movie itself?  As we watch the reporter trying to find the answers, we can see inside the story to the many insights hidden throughout the film.  Every time we see it again, the picture becomes clearer.  It isn't just that Kane wanted his childhood back; in many ways he was reliving his childhood as an adult with bigger toys but just as much enthusiasm.  It isn't just that he wanted love that was real; it was clear that he was unable to handle the love he received.  It is a far more complex picture that we have before us than most of us comprehend the first time or two through the reels.  Perhaps it is best to leave it at its' simpler messages but that is to miss the appreciation for the intentional complexity given it by its' creator, Orson Welles.<br /><br />There are many examples beyond just the story itself as to why "Citizen Kane" is such a classic; the camera angles and perspectives, to name one.  However, as much as I appreciate the cinematic innovations, I am fascinated by the story and the many insights to life itself that are revealed in this classic.  This is not necessarily a movie I stop at if I come across it while changing channels.  Sometimes I'm just not up for it, preferring, instead, something lighter for my tired mind.  However, when I want to appreciate just how well all the elements of a great movies can come together in near perfection, I chose to watch "Citizen Kane".  It may have a few faults (such as who the heck was there to have heard him utter the work "Rosebud"?).  However, the faults are almost embarassing to mention compared with the magnitude of its' achievements.  This is a movie everyone should see at least twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Can you imagine what the perception of RKO was at the time they made this decision?  Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience.  On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today.  Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!<p>I have just described Citizen Kane.  All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing.  Everything is perfect.  The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.<p>As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion.  Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word "Rosebud".  A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant.  So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word.  In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him.  We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.<p>This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone.  He is unhappy and lonely.  We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud.  I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is).  But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has made its point.  What is the point?  My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism.  Loving "stuff" or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.<p>By the way, this movie almost was never seen.  The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate.  He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it.  Fortunately he lost.  The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic.  It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.<p>One last thing.  Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it  did NOT win Best Picture in 1941.  That film?

Welles' mock[ing]-"biography" of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and "Kane" remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The "Kane" theme is a variation on the "Dies Irae".)<br /><br />Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When "People" magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, "Kane" was #2, behind "The Godfather". As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the "startle factor" of "Kane". Even by modern standards, "Kane"'s screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, "Kane" remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it.<br /><br />'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.<br /><br />The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, "Citizen Kane" would emerge even better than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Yes.  Count me in as one of "Them."  A Kanenite.  Orson Welles's initial motion picture effort, CITIZEN KANE, not only is Welles's best film--it's the best film ever made.  Because of the story?  Well, that's certainly interesting enough in its own right, but it's not the reason this powerful film is the best ever captured on celluloid.  Look, any film that spawns books, documentaries, commentaries, and makes countless "Best Films of All Time" lists has got something unique and magical going for it.  So what is it?  To explore this topic, I highly recommend you get this TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION of CITIZEN KANE.<br /><br />Made in 1941, when Welles was a mere twenty-five, CITIZEN KANE was light years ahead of its time in production, imagery, lighting, sets--unparalleled cinematography.  Easily one of the most creative and innovative of all films, CITIZEN KANE is a haunting presentation of moving camera shots (often through what are supposed to be inanimate objects), of rooms with low ceilings made of cloth (for lighting purposes, plus the cloth easily hid the boom mikes), of scene lighting contrasts where one character is in light, the other in total silhouette, of scenes shot entirely by a below-ground-level camera, of surreal close-ups, of a despondent Kane walking across the screen, his reflection captured in hundreds of mirrors.  All of the visual tricks and optical illusions serve to enhance and symbolize the story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon so extravagant and outrageous in his efforts to attract acceptance and love he ultimately garners neither--and loses everything, especially a connection to his childhood.  ("Rosebud.")  That Welles was making a thinly-disguised biography of mogul William Randolph Hearst was lost on no one, especially Hearst, who made so much trouble with RKO Studios the film was quickly shelved, and didn't find an appreciative audience until years later.<br /><br />While this special edition contains several extras, you must view movie critic Roger Ebert's commentary.  Ebert, an unabashed and enthusiastic student and fan of CITIZEN KANE, is a wealth of information about all the scenes and their background history, about all the tricks and gimmicks and optical illusions Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland (the real star of this movie) dreamed up to make watching this film so mesmerizing.  For supporting actors, Welles brought over his Mercury Theater radio performers, who all made their screen debuts here, including Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore (playing a very shrill and petulant second wife), Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Everett Sloane, and William Alland (a longtime Welles assistant).  On disc two you'll find the documentary "The Battle Over Citizen Kane," a 1996 PBS production; it explores the lives of Hearst, Welles, and the controversy surrounding the production of CITIZEN KANE in meticulous and fascinating detail.  The delicious irony here, in the film and in all of the extra features, is that not only is CITIZEN KANE the portrayal of William Randolph Hearst--it is also a thorough examination of the personality of Orson Welles himself.

During the scenes of Kane destroying Susan's room, Orson Welles' hand was really bleeding as his threw himself into motivation.

Make no mistake, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time, but that's not it's fault some people scrutnize it because of those biased film geeks at the American Film Institure (though it certainly has more of it's virtues than a magazine like Rolling Stone does) It is one of the most innovative films, however, and I won't deny the importance of the movie.  The good thing about all this is that the movie is still a great movie, and has a good story, and the filmmaking and artistic quality is still very good.  Here's why I think so.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think the film making in this movie is a product of it's time. While it's not as fresh as it must have been when it was first released, it's still has artistic quality and has some of the coolest shots still worth looking at years later.  The Rosebud shot, the opener, the noirish look, the scene with the mirrors, even the art direction in this movie is great.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland deserved an Oscar for his work (of course he didn't), as it's as incredible to hear about the details from the commentary from Roger Ebert (this man is a film critic, he knows a ton about film that idiots like Ben Lyons and Gene Shalit only wish they did).  The acting is great, and it's hard to believe that Welles was able to pull off both young and old Kane (the make up was responsible for the old, and that was even influential), convincing no less.  It always feels like a meticolously crafted film, and it pretty much is.  The only potential thing that could be considered dated in some eyes is the black and white and 1941 production standards, which to me don't even matter much.  Everything else looks as fresh as it did in 1941.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is basically a pastiche of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper king who apparently did not like this movie because it portrayed him in a negative light.  Regarding it's meaning, the message may be obvious for a lot of people.  And no, it doesn't rely on the symbolism.  I sort of agree with Ray Carney on the symbolism part, which is nice, but not really a profound statement.  Symbolism to me is more like a cool footnote, and if it's done tastefully, it works merely well. (that can't be said for the millions of mediocre student films that say nothing, except they are slathered with pretentious symbolism).  Citizen Kane is both of the previously mentioned.  However, I do not find the scene where he finds the globe to be symbolism.  I've seen objects before that totally transfix me and take me back to my younger days, I don't know, but it does.  The object isn't the focus, the way he reacts to the object is the focus.<br /><br />Rather, I think Citizen Kane is loss of pureness, or idealism.  Kane wanted to help other people because he's truly believed it in the beginning, but gradually became selfish, empty.  Kane is just a representation of just how many things can be reduced from their good intentions to emptiness.  Look at the concepts of free will, individualism, love, and personal fullfillment.  All of these things are pure when taken in the right mind, but all of these have been robbed and dumbed down into general fakeness (the government, marketing, music, movies, even people themselves) and used to push buttons, sell products, and trick people into believing the fakeness is actually genuine.  At a most basic level though, it shows that money indeed doesn't buy happiness, and you have to be internally motivated, and for good reasons.  There's nothing more enriching than good relationships (with the right people) and genuine care,  and if we give in to greed and fakeness, we could end up just like Kane.  That's my take on the meaning of Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?  It's definitely the most influential, and maybe it deserves the greatest title as a monument kind of stature, but it will never be among my favorite films of all time.  And that' mostly the difference here. It will never be a personal favorite to me, but Citizen Kane, for the right camp (I am in that camp), will satisfy mightily.  Please ignore everyone else and whatever anybody tells you and like it for how you like it.  There is no other way in life in figuring out what you like.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Oh how the times have changed.<br /><br />A film that was in all actuality a box-office flop; critically panned and literally booed at the 14th annual Oscars; a film that received nine Oscar nominations yet only received one statuette (for screenplay) rises from the ashes of a pummeling demise to become considered the greatest American film of all time.  All too often this is the case; a film is either critically lauded or distained only to, with time, change the minds of the American public.  `Citizen Kane' rests comfortable at the top (the number one position) of AFI's list of the top 100 films ever made, and I don't see it dropping positions anytime soon (unless `The Godfather' sneaks in).  Personally, I feel that America got this right; the second time.<br /><br />While I personally prefer Coppola's `gangster' masterpiece I feel that `Citizen Kane' is a marvelous example of perfected cinema, an entertaining and enlightening film that stands the test of time and in all actuality gets better as the years roll by.<br /><br />The film opens the fragile whisper of the word "Rosebud" before it explodes with the exclamation of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's death.  The film revolves around a news reporter trying to uncover the meaning behind Kane's last word, "Rosebud".  What that reporter finds though is that no man's life can be summed up with one word.<br /><br />I find that revelation to be supremely important and universally reaching.  The whole of `Citizen Kane' can be summed up in the realization that no man can be fully understood without fully understanding where he came from, what he strived for and ultimately what he became.  As this reporter interviews those closest to Kane, those who loved and or hated him, he (as well as we) gets a beautifully well rounded and complete picture of the man that was Charles Foster Kane.  We get an inside look at his professional life as well as his personal life; his friends, his wives, his business partners.  We get to see how Kane interacted with others, how he dealt with those close to him and even those who peered down at him with evil intent; but as the film draws to its close we realize that the one thing we never got to see is the one missing link to fully grasping `who' Charles Foster Kane really was.<br /><br />That is his `rosebud'.<br /><br />Sure, `Citizen Kane', in the process of exposing this man, delves into the politics of corruption and greed, wealth and power, but it's the underlying message that floats to the surface and becomes the true root of the film.  When one walks away from this film he is left with a reflective work of deep meaning and everlasting presence; a universal message that touches the foundations of humanity and dwells eternally in the bowels of those privileged to witness this masterpiece.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about `Citizen Kane' was its visual styling.  This is a film that feels up-to-date all the way around.  I'm fully convinced that this film could be released this year and it would hold up strongly against the world of modern cinema.  You know how some films feel dated?  `Citizen Kane' is not that film.<br /><br />Another facet of `Citizen Kane' that is stellar beyond compare is that of the acting, especially on the part of the films writer, director and star Orson Welles.  Welles is charismatic, natural and convincing.  He gives a masterfully well rounded and committed performance that stands tall as one of the finest male performances of all time.  Seriously, how he lost the acting Oscar is beyond me.  How this movie lost any of the Oscars it was snubbed for; Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Score, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction and Sound Recording; is beyond me.  At least it was honored with the Screenplay Oscar, but still, that's such a token award for such a marvelous film.<br /><br />`Citizen Kane' is lauded as one of the greatest, as the greatest even, and I have to jump on that bandwagon and let my voice be heard.  This is a revelation, an iconic piece of cinema that is sure to prove supremely entertaining and rewarding to the viewer.  The film is paced beautifully, never loses the audience's attention or appreciation and, as I mentioned, just gets better and better every time you watch it.  Orson Welles had a vision, a marvelous vision at that, and while it was not fully understood or appreciated upon its release, he can `rest in peace' now, fully aware that his vision will never be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I am 62, and "Citizen Kane" has been hyped as the world's greatest film all of my life. I finally saw it for the first time when I was about 20, and even though I was in college earning a degree in journalism, and this is a movie partly about the journalism of the early 20th century, it really did not live up to the build-up. I viewed it again around the age of 40, and appreciated it a bit more. Finally, I watched it  again last week, and totally enjoyed it...the writing, acting, directing, odd style of story-telling, crazy camera angles, and all. When I was in college, a popular book was "Citizen Hearst", a biography of William Randolph Hearst, who Orson Welles was satirizing with his Kane character. Kane and Hearst share many traits in common, but the movie is not a thinly disguised biography of the Rupert Murdoch of his era. It is a work of fiction, a study of a man whose personality was shaped when he was a heart-broken boy, and whose inherited wealth led him to glory, power, even more wealth, and finally ruin. As is mentioned in the film, "Charles Foster Kane wanted to be loved" but he didn't know how to get it except through purchase or pandering. Don't worry if it does not knock your socks off the first time you see it. It is the kind of film that a person who has lived long enough to have a few big failures, and a success or two, will appreciate more.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane is considered by many, with Casablanca, to be the best American movie in history. Although I am not an avid movie-goer or a film buff, I can't disagree with that appreciation. It is certainly the greatest movie I have ever seen.<p>Despite being in b/w, Welles' use of light and camera angles is nothing short of stunning, esp. the group scene after the first newsreel. One little problem, though : I don't know if it's because of this recording in particular, but the sound volume grows terribly loud as the movie progresses, so keep your remote in hand.<p>But the most incredible aspect of this movie is without a doubt the story. We follow the quest of a journalist as he is assigned to find out the meaning behind Charles Kane's dying word : &quot;rosebud&quot;. The journalist goes to talk to many people who knew Kane during his life, and gives rise to numerous flashbacks of their contacts with Kane.<p>Despite his never-ending wealth and ambition, Charles Foster Kane is a complex and tortured man. He runs a newspaper empire, attempts to run for governor, and erects a gargantuan castle called &quot;Xanadu&quot;, where he cannot find peace. His apparent paradoxal nature is explained when we understand that what he seeks is love, but on his own terms. He seeks what he does not have.<p>This movie is powerful and asks pointed questions about, for example, the difference between egoism and self-centeredness, and how this affects our view of the world. This is, in a good sense, a very spiritual and involving movie.</p></br></body></html>

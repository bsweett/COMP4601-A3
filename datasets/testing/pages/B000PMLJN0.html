This is a wonderfully atmospheric horror film with a laughably preposterous story, so much so that it's actually a lot of fun to watch. Anyone who says that this film is bad is absolutely right. And no wonder; it was written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan, the same men responsible for 2004's highly effective but equally preposterous "Saw." For this new film, they utilize all the best horror movie methods imaginable, from minimal lighting to unnerving close-ups to foggy, overgrown cemeteries. They've also crafted a plot without any degree of plausibility, especially when it comes to the obligatory twist ending; to say that the final revelation is overwhelmingly unrealistic would be an understatement. To say that it still succeeds in being shocking wouldn't be surprising.<br /><br />Can such a film be given any credit? Yes, but not in the way you might think; I have a strong feeling that the story was supposed to be ridiculous, if not for the sake of simplicity, then for the sake of making the disturbing visuals and pop out scares more effective. At the very least, this film actually has a story, which is more than I can say for hopeless fright fests like "The Abandoned." Made in the tradition of films like "Child's Play" and "Puppet Master," "Dead Silence" is a ghost story that takes a beloved child-friendly activity--ventriloquism--and turns it into a horrific spectacle. Dummies have never been as frightening as they are in this film, with their smooth, pale skins and their large, unhinged jaws and their big, glassy eyes that seem to stare directly into the audience.<br /><br />It begins when Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), receive a mysterious package. They open it to find a ventriloquist dummy crafted into a boy. The thing is damn creepy, to say the least, but it seems to have no effect on Lisa, who plays with it, talks to it, and even props it upright on her bed. Only when Jamie goes to pick up dinner does she discover the dummy's true nature, and by then, it's too late for her. First, a majority of the ambient noises go silent: a record player spins slower and slower until it stops; a whistling teakettle is muted, even as steam spews from the spout; a ticking clock goes quiet. All she can hear is her own breathing. That, and bizarre laughter coming from the bedroom.<br /><br />When Jamie returns, he finds his beloved wife propped up in bed, her mouth opened unnaturally wide and her tongue forcefully ripped out. Thus begins Jamie's nightmare, made worse by the fact that he's the prime suspect in his wife's murder. Assigned to his case is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), a man who, for whatever reason, compulsively uses an electric shaver. He was so condescending that I just wanted to smack him upside the head; he speaks down to Jamie, showing him the same respect a bratty child would be shown. I suppose I shouldn't complain; every horror movie of this sort requires the annoying, intrusive side character, mostly because the audience takes pleasure in seeing him or her die at some point (whether or not Lipton dies, I'll leave for you to discover).<br /><br />Against Lipton's orders, Jamie returns to his ailing hometown of Raven's Fair for Lisa's funeral. He takes the mysterious dummy with him, apparently in order to "get some answers" (which translates as, "only for the sake of plot advancement"). This is because he remembers a nursery rhyme he used to be told as a child: "Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. / She had no children, only dolls. / And if you see her in your dream, / Be sure to never, ever scream." The legend of Mary Shaw--an early twentieth century ventriloquist (Judith Roberts)--is no longer spoken of in Raven's Fair, according to Henry Walker (Michael Fairman) the town's aging mortician.<br /><br />Let's examine this legend. In the early 1940s, a local boy had gone missing. Because this boy had publicly humiliated Shaw during one of her shows ("I can see your lips moving!" he shouts), the town immediately suspected that she had something to do with his disappearance. This prompts a group of vigilantes to take justice into their own hands, first by cutting out Shaw's tongue, second by murdering her. But nothing stays buried forever (literally); over the years, many people have been savagely murdered, each victim having his or her tongue ripped out. It would seem that, through her dummies, the ghost of Mary Shaw is "silencing" the families of those who murdered her.<br /><br />But how does this all connect with Jamie? He first turns to his father, Edward (Bob Gunton), for information, but he quickly sees that it's useless. For one thing, they haven't gotten along in years. For another thing, he's now wheelchair bound from a stroke, completely dependent on the care of his third wife, the sickeningly sweet Ella (Amber Valletta). It seems that Jamie's only resource is Henry; not only did he attend one of Shaw's shows as a boy, he also had an interesting encounter with her body as she was being prepped for burial. One would expect nothing less from this kind of film, especially since her final wish was to be transformed into a dummy. Can you imagine a human head with slits on both sides of the mouth and bulgy glass eyes?<br /><br />It was also her wish that each of her hundred or so dummies be buried. But they didn't stay buried for long, as Jamie and Lipton discover during the climactic sequence in Shaw's dilapidated theater. They also discover a book of sketches, specifically instructions on constructing handmade dummies. Attached is a flap of paper with the words "How to Build the Perfect Dummy" written on it. I won't say what it's in reference to, but I will say that it paves the way for the aforementioned twist ending, a moment that was both frightening and silly. Pretty much all of "Dead Silence" can be described the same way, which I believe was intentional on the filmmaker's part. It's horrifying to see a dummy turning to gaze at someone, especially when no one is operating it. Likewise, it's funny to hear lines like, "There are things you remember, and then there are things you never forget." Now that's truly the work of a gifted screenwriter.<br /><br />Yes, "Dead Silence" is a bad movie, but like many classic horror films, it's so bad that it's good. It's everything a story about possessed dummies should be, and no more. Whether or not this makes it worth recommending is open for debate; I'm giving it four stars because I had fun watching it, and because it succeeds in creating the right horror movie atmosphere. For some of you, this will not be enough, and that's certainly understandable; you have my permission to dismiss this movie and go in search of something more meaningful.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>To be quite frank this is not a very good movie at all. Never have been a fan of haunted doll movies much less haunted puppet movies. The only decent one I have ever seen was the now quite old "Magic" featuring Anthony Hopkins...made sometime in the mid to late 1970's. Ann Margaret was also in that movie and it is old enough that she still looked pretty darned good!<br />This movie is simply poorly done. Mr. Wahlburg does a pretty good job but the movie itself simply doesn't cut it for me.....didn't like it at all. Not suspenseful, not scary....just rather poor in just about every respect.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>No, Billy the ventriloquist dummy isn't all that scary-looking. Still, I did enjoy the beginning and ending of DEAD SILENCE very much. As for the middle part, well, it got a little long and drawn out for me. I don't particularly care for Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), and he did nothing spectacular here. As I said, I liked the weird, NIGHT GALLERY-esque beginning a lot. It made me think the rest of the movie would be a nice late night treat. It was the mainly un-frightening mid-section of DS that lowered my expectations. However, that ending was a true jaw dropper, much like SAW (by the same folks) before it, I was left w/ a smile on my face. So, my advice is to watch the opening closely, do a crossword puzzle or sudoku during the middle part, and stare wide-eyed at the climax. It sort of makes the whole thing worth while...</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>I own about 40 Hd-dvds now, when they first came up I was re-buying alot, now I tend to wait for something new that I don't own or I re-purchase it if I really liked it.  I also figured prices of Hd-dvds would come down by now after the first year like dvds did but surprisingly they have not.  As for dead silence the sound and picture are always good on Hd dvd, also horror films in general have good sound, however this one does not stand out.<br />Great horror films can get us to forget what makes sense and get us to accept it.  They can also be realistic and terrifying and hone in on some hardwired fear we have.  Horror films can also purposely be so bad there good.  This really isn't any of the above.  The scares are the equivalent of me hiding and jumping out at you.  I think i guessed nearly everything that happened in the movie prior to it happening.  Other random things i found annoying, why does Donnie Wahlberg's character use a electric shaver everywhere? , why do we have to have ominous fog around a cemetery, bit cliche.  There are a lot of holes yet I don't lose myself in the movie and accept it.  As for the plot amazon provides a good enough description, no need to add to it.<br />Yes, I have seen worse horror movies, and yes this is a break from the torture porn genre however there are other picks for 2007 out there.  If you want to stay on the Hd dvd kick try The Host, again getting away from the torture porn, and one of the best reviewed films of the year getting a 92% positive rating on rottentomtoes out of 129 film critics whereas Dead silence got 17% positive out of 63 critics.  Better yet The Shining is now available to pre order on Hd dvd being released on October 23rd.  If you have a need to watch killer dolls, watch or re watch Child's Play.<br />My advice is if you like horror and you want to check out some new on dvd for 2007 just buy a cheaper version than the hd.<br /><br />Dvd features from box<br />Exclusive alternate ending and alternate opening<br />Deleted scenes<br />The making of dead silence<br />Mary Shaw's Secrets<br />Evolution of a visual fx and more</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>There's just some topics that should be left alone and people should not attempt to make them into movies.  The ventriloquist/dummy "horror" movie is one of them.  I remember seeing something similar to this movie as a kid.  I just cannot recall the title of that movie.<br /><br />Anyways, Jamie Ashen returns to his childhood hometown, Raven's Fair, after his wife was mysteriously murdered.  She was murdered almost immediately after the couple has received an anonymous mail at their doorstep, which contained a dummy.<br /><br />Jamie soon learns that the dummy, Billy, is a product of a dead ventriloquist, Mary Shaw.  Mary Shaw was murdered some years ago after the townspeople suspected her of murdering a young boy who doubted her ventriloquist talent.  Her tongue was ripped out and she was buried with her "children", all 101 of her dummies.<br /><br />However, these days, her dummies are coming back from the grave.  The question is why?  Who is behind these mysterious murders?  Mary Shaw?  Jamie and a local police detective (Wahlberg) must locate the mastermind or at least try to locate the curse and break it to stop the killings.<br /><br />It sounds like a great movie after reading the jacket of the DVD cover.  However, the story plot is forgettable.  The acting...no comment.  If you're just bored and just want anything to entertain you, then you just might like the movie.  Otherwise, you're not missing anything if you don't watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I was expecting a lot from the writer of Saw.  He does try some new things, and I have always been freaked out by scary dolls.  Anyone remember Magic with Anthony Hopkins?  The clown under the bed in Poltergeist also gave me nightmares as a kid.  I never really cared for the killer doll in "Child's Play".  Thankfully they stay away from that in this movie.  The true killer is an old woman who is murdered by towns people and buried with her 101 dolls.  Over the years the towns people have been dying, as well as their families.  Nightmare on Elm Street style.  This film is very talky, and the ending tries way too hard to be clever.  There is not a lot of gore at all.  The film mostly relies on creepy shots and sounds.  The "Dead Silence" part before something happens is very cool however.  If you are a fan of the ultra-gore films you will not like this one.  I was disappointed with the effort and I won't be purchasing this one.  Rent this one if you are a horror fan, but don't make a blind buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>"Dead Silence" is a mostly jumpless, dreary little turdfiesta of a horror flick by James Whan & Leigh Whannell (the folks who brought us "Saw"), and spends its time tediously tracking Puppets who Kill & the People who Love Them (which would be a great support group).<br /><br />There are worse ways to kill 90 minutes than seeing "Dead Silence". It's not a bad flick. It shows some creepy, ghoulish promise here and there, some flashes---just flashes---of scary brilliance, and the opening 10 minutes pack more full-throated terror into them than a score of 2006's assault of PG-13 "kiddie-friendly" fear flicks ever could.<br /><br />Indeed---from about the second the doomed Lisa Ashen (scream-queen newbie/vet Laura Regan, who looks like her dance card has just been punched one too many times)tosses a sheet over Billy the Dummy to the first few moments our hero Jamie (Ryan Kwanten, literally the man who wasn't there: as an actor, odorless, colorless, tasteless) goes spelunking into the Plot---well, for about 5 minutes I thought this thing was gonna creep & crawl.<br /><br />Alas, no luck: there's some groping about in a root cellar that conjures up giddy memories of The Haunting of Julia (far finer ghostly fare), but after that it's pretty much the standard a) big floaty skull-headed dead woman shows up, flaps & vamps around; b) victim cringes and wheedles c) victim gets tongue torn out and dies; d) Donnie Wahlberg shows up in a dubious moustache & Columbo's raincoat.<br /><br />Rinse, repeat, stretch into a feature film. There's a lot of talky talky talky, which just goes to show that movie producers still don't get it when horror fans say IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER, STUPID! We don't need backstory. This isn't "Wuthering Heights". Bring on the buckets of blood, already.<br /><br />Anyway, despite a few spooky bits, this is about as good as last year's movie about killer videogames, I forget the name. Indeed, the vibe and the effects are pretty much the same, along with the acting. But from Whannel & Wan, I expected better---and you should too. Why even have 101 Killer Puppets if you're going to do nothing with 'em?<br /><br />Things I observed while watching "Dead Silence":<br /><br />1) Puppets who Kill can get away with murder for a while, but only up to a point. After all, how hard is it to spot a 2-foot-tall assassin with a wooden jaw and a stick up his bungus?<br /><br />2) The Killer Puppets are great at slaughtering entire families with impunity & unleashing jihad on trained police detectives, but not so hot at doing basic Survival 101 moves---like hopping out of burning display cases.<br /><br />3) Donnie Wahlberg is contractually obligated to look seedier & at least 10 years older with every passing film he does.<br /><br />4) Blythe Danner has great horror chops! Blythe is in this flick as the crazy woman who spends time petting a stuffed raven (a great prop!). No kidding. Or maybe it's her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, I can't tell 'em apart nowadays. They both look like skeletons with a little layer of puffy white dough kneaded across their skullheads.<br /><br />5) If I were to bio-genetically vat-grow a woman of my own, it would turn out looking like Amber Valleta. She can work my puppet-handle any day (lucky, lucky, lucky Bob Gunton).<br /><br />6) Horror movie Scream Queens really have a short shelf life. You disagree? Consider young Laura Regan, who coulda been a contendah, but has instead bounced from one B-movie to another ("They", "Hollowman 2", and now this). She's toast. I couldn't figure out which was the scarier sight, the killer puppet Billy or Regan's slabs of pancake makeup. Yechhh.<br /><br />7) You know what I *do* think "Dead Silence" proves? It proves "Saw" was a fluke. A happy accident.<br /><br />Oh, and the last line of the movie is great: "So who's the Dummy now?"<br /><br />A truer, and more cruelly ironic, movie kiss-off line was never uttered, and the answer is clear to anyone who sits through this stinker:<br /><br />We are.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>My hubby was told about Dead Silence. We never heard about it before then. So hubby went out and bought it. We watched it that night. It wasn't bad. I expected worse. But it sure isn't the scare's movie out there. At less for me. I think the end was funny. Jamie managed to not scream threw the whole movie till the end... lol.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Dead Silence is a creaky gothic horror by the writers who introduced us to the dubious pleasures of the Saw franchise. James Wan and Leigh Whannell use those potent props the ventriloquist's puppet and an old nursery rhyme to piece together a gruesome tale of supernatural revenge. (How stupid..) Unfortunately the cast are so supernaturally dim that it's impossible to care about any of them.<br />This is admirably surreal stuff. And the sensual pleasure in watching this kind of horror movie depends entirely on your tolerance for ear-splitting jolts of shock. In the end, though, I wanted my money back.<br />BILLY WAS THE BEST ACTOR--THAT SAYS A LOT SINCE HE IS A FREAKING DOLL..</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Beware the stare of Mary Shaw<br />She had no children only dolls<br />And if you see her in your dreams<br />Be sure to never ever scream.<br /><br />One day Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) gets this package with a ventriloquist's dummy named Billy and by the time he gets back from having gone out he finds his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), is dead.  Not only is she dead, but she is missing her tongue.  If you can connect the dots between Lisa's death and the above rhyme then you can tell where "Dead Silence" is going.  Jamie brings Laura back to their hometown of Ravens Fair, even though that means seeing his father, Edward Ashen (Bob Gunton) and his latest trophy wife, Ella (Amber Valletta).  Tagging along is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), who thinks Jamie is the primary suspect in his wife's death and wants to keep an eye on him.  Meanwhile, Jamie is trying to find out more about this whole Mary Shaw think from Henry Walker (Michael Fairman), the local undertaker.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is made by director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, the same team that came up with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GA5NYW">Saw Trilogy</a>.  It came out in March of this year, although I do not remember hearing about it and doubt that it made it to this neck of the woods.  I happened to see "Dead Silence" the same day I saw a wretched rip-off of "Saw," so to see a horror film that actually looked good was quite refreshing and I was rather encouraged.  However, this is probably not the first horror story you have seen involving a ventriloquist's dummy and style can only take you so far in this genre.<br /><br />The problem is connecting to the story and I think this film starts to get off track when they try to rhyme "Shaw" with "dolls."  I mean, I have no problem with scant rhyme, but this is not even close to being in the ballpark.  After the death of his wife, Jamie is the prime suspect in the mind of Detective Lipton (a nod to Wahlberg's role in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXSS">Band of Brothers</a>"?), but in the day and age of what is called "The C.S.I. Effect," it should be obvious that Jamie did not do it.  He might have hired somebody to do it, but clearly the blood on him would have come from finding his wife dead, as he claims, and not from being there when she was being murdered.  So I was starting to disconnect from the story at that point, especially since Lipton is required to given Jamie enough rope to hang himself, which, of course, he uses instead to discover the horrible truth.<br /><br />Beyond the nice production values here, the best part of this movie is Judith Roberts as Mary Shaw when we finally get to go back to the past and see her do her act.  I am not sure if her big line is really that much better than the rhyme they come up with for Mary Shaw, but damn, Roberts knows how to deliver it for what might be the best chill in the whole movie. But by the time you get to the film's end game you just are not invested in the outcome.  This is one of those films where they do a nice job of setting up the reveal at the end, which is certainly not surprising with Wan and Whannell involved, but I find it difficult to muster much enthusiasm for it.  All things considered, "Dead Silence" does this type of horror film by the numbers, but it just does not add up to a "must see" film for fans.  I do not think that you will be bitterly disappointed if you check it out. I just think you not end up being as impressed as you think you should be.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I really do worry about the future of horror films. I grow more disappointed with every new one I rent out and Dead Silence is the same.<br /><br />Although this looks like a chilling movie it falls flat in its delivery nonetheless. It does have its creepy moments, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. Matter of fact this movie really did not hold my interest for long. It was a lazy and overall very safe horror film. 13 years olds will love it- but us older horror fans will find this yet another story that sounds promising yet in the end feel once again that we have wasted both our time and money. I do not recommend it.<br /><br />2/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>Just like House of Wax, good set but not so great of a movie.

The punchline is the movie and the disheartening enthusiasm many horror fans have for it.<br /><br />Comparing this comical and bluntly Grade B movie with that great episode of the "Twilight Zone" ("The Old Switcharoo"), "Saw" (which was good but overrated), or even "Magic" with Anthony Hopkins (which wasn't really that good at all), is to do a gross disservice to all three.<br /><br />Donnie Wahlberg can't catch a break.  Ryan Kwanten turns in such a plastic performance here that not for one moment do we believe in Jamie Ashen or Det. Jim Lipton.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is so ridiculous (a woman who owned dolls, preferring them to children, wreaked terror on a small town with the really creepy dolls that come alive and bark at people until their faces look just like the victims in "The Ring") that whatever expectations the viewer had of another "Saw" goes right out the window.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, the only one who deserves any accolades or praise is the dummy.  At least he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut and stay under blankets half the time.  Starring in this movie, he made a smart move.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>by this movie being rated r, it was very corny! a complete waste of money at the movies! please people, wait for the dvd realease!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Dead Silence" is great!

Dead Silence also marks a departure in terms of changing the pace from the torture horror sub-genre to a more typical slasher fare which we get here.  The change isn't necessarily for the better either, even though Dead Silence has more going for it than you may think it does.  For starters, it's pretty safe to say that many people think of ventriloquist dolls as being creepy by themselves, and here the film doesn't disappoint.  Besides the overly creepy atmosphere though, Dead Silence doesn't do much else right in the horror department, and isn't scary or remotely suspenseful one bit.  The gore effects aren't much to write home about either, and the film as a whole just feels lazily put together.  In the end, you've just got to feel sorry for Donnie Wahlberg (Saw II and III, Band of Brothers) who gets no help as a detective here.  All in all, Dead Silence isn't a total turkey, but there's nothing overly redeeming about it either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I saw this movie on DVD and then this movie isn't good.

I finally watched this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of creepy atmosphere it had. The dolls in this movie are freaky looking and I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up more than once while watching this classic style fright flick.<br /><br />This is a "ghost story" in every sense of the words and ventriloquist dolls are very, very scary! There are some clever plot twist and excellent camera work in this spooky thrill ride that plays like your riding through an old creepy dark ride at an amusement park or carnival. I also found that the use of 'silence'("Dead Silence")when things are about to go wrong, was ingenious and it worked like the music in 'Jaws' did, whenever it went silent you knew something bad was going to happen! This is one of the cleverest horror movies I've seen in a while and it has little or no gore.<br /><br />The unrated version has a little more visual blood(very little)and also a plot point which helps to make the story make more sense. I liked both versions of the film and I'm not sure if it matters which one you buy. I just wish that the studios would stop releasing these film on separate releases when there is so little difference.....no wonder it didn't sell well. This is a great Halloween flick to start that night with a good fright! Look quick for the "Saw Puppet" on the floor amongst the debris!

Okay, it is grimy, but it is not gory.  Despite an R rating, it's a fairly tame CREEPY supernatural story.  It feels very old school, almost like an episode of NIGHT GALLERY.<br /><br />The creepy ventriloquist's doll Billy, who actually does almost nothing in the movie...is the STAR.  Just sitting there, lovingly photographed in shadow...he'll make the hairs on your neck stand up.  We respond to him in an illogical way, but it can't be helped.  Those dummies are just a little weird.<br /><br />The story of DEAD SILENCE is not terribly original, but it does stay true to the expectations of the form.  It also has a decent surprise ending that you'll probably see coming...but only a few minutes before our "hero" does.  My wife, 14 year old daughter and I were all quite satisfied.  This is a genre film that for a change of pace, actually delivers some solid chills...unlike THE MESSENGERS, DARK WATER, etc. etc.<br /><br />It does have some problems, though.  Namely Ryan Kwantan, the lead actor in the film who is such a dreadful actor I felt actually angry at him for ruining the film.  Totally incapable of any display of convincing emotion.  Just the pits.  And Donnie Wahlberg mostly looks bored by his character...a cop who is the worst law-enforcement officer ever and apparently works for a police force that consists of just him.  The film is low-budget, but some decent CGI work saves it.  But the poor casting really shows the low-budget seams.<br /><br />It's an okay film that could have been more.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>There are some genuinely creepy moments in "Dead Silence." A wide-eyed, wooden dummy in the room is always a source of suspense. The movie gets especially interesting when its protagonist first returns to his hometown of Raven's Fair to bury his wife. Several suggestive scenes there might lead viewers to suspect a truly inventive horror. However these themes aren't developed in any coherent way. They are only explained in slapdash flashback at the end of the film. If they had been made into the concentrated heart of this film, this would have been a superior thriller.<br /><br />As it is though, this movie loses its way in a hodgepodge of ghostly special effects. Avenging spirits are superimposed on all sorts of reanimated entities. It's like "The Shining," which actually was a series of unrelated eerie plot lines paraded across the screen. But this film doesn't have any of The Shining's style or conviction. In fact, James Wan, the Director of "Dead Silence," says in one of the DVD extras that he purposely threw every sinister visual he could think of - except the kitchen sink - into the story. Then when the film was almost complete - he threw in the kitchen sink as well. He boasts about this as if it were a good thing. However in fact, he spoiled his film with a superfluity of the supernatural.<br /><br />In addition, he let too many amateurish performances crowd his scenes. The detective, for example, is very unconvincing.<br /><br />There are perhaps some elements of this film that may haunt you. It features a good warning line that the townspeople repeat - "Beware the stare of Mary Shaw..." This incantation almost rivals the old rhyme that Madam Ouspenskaya recited to Lon Chaney, Jr. to warn him of his werewolf fate. "Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night..."<br /><br />On the whole though, there are many better film opportunities to be scared by potentially homicidal ventriloquist's dummies. There is of course Anthony Hopkins' turn in "Magic." However, the most truly frightening take and twist on the theme that I've seen was the Alfred Hitchcock TV episode entitled "The Glass Eye." That episode stars Tom Conway. It first aired in October of 1957 and is available in the complete "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" series.<br /><br />Then if you want to catch a brief spoof of the genre, check out Seinfeld's "The Chicken Roaster" episode from that sitcom's 1996 season. Jerry and Kramer switch apartments and Jerry is left alone with Mr. Marbles, the dummy that Kramer acquired. He pulls the covers up to avoid facing whatever thing goes - not bump - but more ominously yet - pitta-pat, pitta-pat, pitta-pat in the night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Dead Silence (James Wan, 2007)<br /><br />The team who brought you Saw return for Wan's first trip to the director's chair since his surprise smash hit. This one came and went with very little notice. Given the performance of a number of recent, and far inferior, films of its type, that's a crime. Dead Silence is a slick little horror flick that touches all the bases, and runs over all the familiar territory, without ever seeming terribly cliched.<br /><br />Jamie Ashen (Summerland's Ryan Kwanten) receives a mysterious package on his doorstep one evening-- a ventriloquist's dummy. When he comes back from picking up dinner that night, his wife is dead. A bit too much of a coincidence for him, so, shadowed by police detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), Ashen goes back to the town where he grew up to find out what happened to his wife, and what it has to do with the doll.<br /><br />You can probably see a good bit of this coming (though I freely admit the ending totally blindsided me), but that doesn't necessarily matter. After all, ventriloquist's dummies are just plain creepy. If you're looking for a movie that will unnerve you, and you don't like ventriloquist's dummies, this one's definitely worth checking out. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>What a breath of fresh air this film was to watch!.....or should I say a breath of good old fashioned "Universal" chills? I finally watched this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of creepy atmosphere it had. The dolls in this movie are freaky looking and I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up more than once while watching this classic style fright flick.<br /><br />This is a "ghost story" in every sense of the words and ventriloquist dolls are very, very scary! There are some clever plot twist and excellent camera work in this spooky thrill ride that plays like your riding through an old creepy dark ride at an amusement park or carnival. I also found that the use of 'silence'("Dead Silence")when things are about to go wrong, was ingenious and it worked like the music in 'Jaws' did, whenever it went silent you knew something bad was going to happen! This is one of the cleverest horror movies I've seen in a while and it has little or no gore.<br /><br />The unrated version has a little more visual blood(very little)and also a plot point which helps to make the story make more sense. I liked both versions of the film and I'm not sure if it matters which one you buy. I just wish that the studios would stop releasing these film on separate releases when there is so little difference.....no wonder it didn't sell well. This is a great Halloween flick to start that night with a good fright! Look quick for the "Saw Puppet" on the floor amongst the debris! Stay up late, turn out the lights and watch this alone!......you'll see what I mean!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) received a special ventriloquist doll mysteriously and his wife has been murdered, he believes the doll belongs to a famous ventriloquist named Mary Shaw a celebrity in the town of Ravens Fair. He takes the dummy with him and joins with an investigative detective (Donnie Wahlberg) as they go to Ravens Fair to investigate the mysterious murders that have been happening especially involving dolls as he discovers that the town is haunted by the evil spirit of Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts) and her demonic dolls.<br /><br />Refreshing and different horror thriller from James Wan and Leigh Whannell the makers of "Saw" that offers actual scares rather then gore abound. It's a supernatural fable with an interesting story, decent acting, a nice twisted ending and dark atmosphere that help makes this an exciting and enjoyable ghost story, i'm sure that people that want story and supernatural scares rather then just gore will find this movie a nice change of pace.<br /><br />This DVD contains the unrated version with some violence and scenes not shown in the theatrical version with nice extras like alternate ending & opening seuqneces, deleted scenes, Behind The Scenes of "Dead Silence", "Mary Shaw's secrets" featurette, "Evolution of a visual FX" featurette and Music Video.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Shining", "Tourist Trap", "Magic", "Devil Doll (1964)", "Trilogy of Terror", "Dolls (1987)", "Puppet Master", "Child's Play Series", "Saw Trilogy", "The Others", "Making Contact (a.k.a.

The surrealistic visuals  especially the exteriors), blue-lit, soft focus foggy shots, overly-dramatic score - it all adds to the atmosphere. There are plenty of hints as to the ending and big reveal. The ending was kind of a letdown. It really seems as if the writers ran out of steam and went for the obvious.  Apart from that, this is a great movie for horror films.  It relies more on atmosphere and suspense than gory effects (apart from the occasional mutilated corpse, and even those are PG.)<br /><br />Any horror fan should see it once. You really will like it.  I usually hate "doll" or "ventriloquist dummy" flicks.  But this one really stands out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Dead Silence" is the kind of horror film you have to watch a few times before you can understand the plot and before you can say you liked it. Upon first viewing I couldn't distinguish what the heck was going on, why certain characters were doing what they were doing, and what the villin's main purpose was. After my second viewing I started to understand the plot a lot more and I became interested. I can't say "Dead Silence" is my favorite thriller or even on my Top 10 list of scary films, but it's an OK movie.<br /><br /> The plot basically deals with dolls, one in particular named Billy, who kills a guy's wife when he finds the doll outside their apartment. He eventually goes to bury his wife in a small town and brings the doll with him to understand its origins. The doll was part of a 1940's act called "Mary Shaw and Billy". Mary was a ventriloquist who collected 101 dolls and upon her death she basically became some sort of ghost that led Billy to killing people.<br /><br /> The actress playing Mary Shaw, Judith Roberts, gave me the absolute chills. A woman of at least 75 her voice is creepy and her body movements unsettling so she is a nice asset to an otherwise medicore movie.<br /><br /> "Dead Silence" was written and produced by the same team who made the "Saw" franchise, but this film was by no means a hit. Most critics and fans hated it and the movie only grossed $22,000,000 on a $20,000,000 budget.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>Although the story and characters aren't impressive, the look and style worked very nicely here. Wonderful atmosphere, as far as I'm concerned. (But that doesn't make a great horror film, as "Silent Hill" proves.)<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is virtually packed with the trappings that I really enjoy in horror movies. There's a fog-swirled cemetery, creepy dolls, a vengeful ghostie, and more. This movie had more spooky settings than ten other horror films; you've not only got the dilapidated remnants of a grand old vaudeville theater on a misty lake near an abandoned quarry ... but you've also got a cavernous Victorian estate straight out of "The Haunting of Hill House" or "Dark Shadows", as well as a dark and sinister crawlspace beneath a funeral home. Visually, this was all very pleasing to the eyes.<br /><br />I read that movie bombed at the box office, and critics were fairly merciless in pointing out its bland characters and blatant twist. The story was fair (we've seen this before), but definitely predictable in some ways-- in fact, the film ends with a cool twist that you can see coming from the first act, but it is very effective nonetheless.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" has the feel of an old fashioned horror film in the vein of Vincent Price's Poe movies, Hammer Films, or even William Castle. It wasn't terrific but it was definitely entertaining. It is not gory although it features what I'd call some gruesome imagery (which I thoroughly enjoyed).<br /><br />The movie is filmed in some sort of soft blue wash, either via filter or done in post production. This actually makes the color red, which is used carefully and prominently, all the more vivid and noticeable. Also, the ominous phantom of silver-haired ventriloquist Mary Shaw was a delightful creation to me. I've seen witchy ghosts before in movies (haven't we all, from "Darkness Falls" to a dozen other flicks), and this one was impressive and memorable. Great makeup effects, costume, and a gleeful performance by the striking actress Judith Roberts (who was cast during auditions in Manhattan after the studio just couldn't find the right type in Los Angeles).<br /><br />This is one of those movies that often gets mixed reviews from viewers. I liked it. I wasn't blown away by it. And it's such an interesting departure from "Saw", as if that movie's creators decided to go a very different road entirely, and switch gears to a more retro flavor and look and tale. I prefer supernatural horror, so this appealed to me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if a macabre and stylish movie is what you're craving, this could do the trick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>What do you do when you make a horror movie so popular that it not only starts a new horror fad (psychological gore might be a good categorization), but it also spawns three sequels? After the box-office success of Saw, James Wan passed the directorial baton on to Darren Lynn Bousman for the three Saw sequels, while still maintaining a presence in the series as writer and executive producer. Now Wan has teamed up again with writer Leigh Whannell (also from Saw) for the duo's first non-Saw film. Although more of a typical horror movie, Dead Silence isn't that far removed from the eerie tones and frightfully gory movies that their followers have come to expect.<br /><br />Following the standard plot of a horror movie, Dead Silence is based around a creepy mysterious supernatural villain who is haunting and threatening the main character of the film. About halfway in, it is unsurprisingly revealed that our lead has familial history with the killer. A history that needs to be set right before the ghost's revenge destroys him.<br /><br />The killer herself happens to be Mary Shaw, of whom much lore has been passed on over the years throughout the small town of Ravens Fair. Once an infamous ventriloquist, who lived in a gigantic theatre on a lake, she was killed in a shocking way and then buried (at her own request) with her 101 dummies. Her trademark is that she waits until you scream, and then kills you by ripping out your tongue, leaving your face a gaping terrifying mess. Now, with the arrival of an unmarked package bearing a dummy named Billy, it appears that Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife are being haunted by Mary Shaw's ghost. When his wife is brutally murdered, Jamie is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg)'s number one suspect. For an unexplained reason, Jamie feels the need to then return to his small, almost abandoned town of Ravens Fair to find some answers. In a series of schlocky meetings he finds out what he must do in order to rid himself and his town of the curse of Mary Shaw. As Jamie gets closer to the truth, Detective Lipton begins to realize that maybe there's more to his case than he originally suspected.<br /><br />What separates this film from its horror peers currently flooding the cinema, and in fact manages to make the film interesting and downright spooky is Wan's tight, focused shots,  and unexpected methods of cutting between scenes: unfolding elaborate scenes only to have them fold in on themselves. John R. Leonetti's cinematography uses a color palette that's basically limited to blue, black, grey, green, and the occasional yellow and red keeps the tone of the film decidedly dark, and never lets the audience take in a reassuring breath of relaxation til the film's final moments. What could have been a remastered Chucky tale, with 21st century visual effects and a ventriloquist dummy in place of a red-headed kid's toy, in the hands of James Wan, turns into an enjoyable and lastingly frightening horror romp.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>I am not a big fan of the malevolent doll subgenre in horror, but respecting talents of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, I gave Dead Silence (2007) a try.  While this film didn't change my feelings about dolls, puppets, or dummies, this was an entertaining and atmospheric tale, with a wicked twist at the conclusion.  Wan and Whannell, creators of the Saw series, turned that project over to others, so they could work on Dead Silence.  Characterized by some as a throwback to a gothic style of storytelling, perhaps this was not the time for resurgence in puppet horror, as the film tanked at the box office.  Despite there being no Sawesque gore, I still recommend the film to those who appreciate their PG-13 horror with a little ghostly element.<br /><br />Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife Lisa (Laura Regan) receive a strange looking ventriloquist puppet as a gift.  While Jamie is out of the house, Lisa is mysteriously killed, her tongue removed, and her body left looking like a grotesque doll.  Police Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) suspects Jamie of being involved, but has no proof.  Jamie returns to his home town of Ravens Fair, to bury his wife.  He also visits his estranged father Edward (Bob Gunton), and discovers that he has remarried, and suffered a stroke.  Now confined to a wheelchair, his needs are attended to by his wife Ella (Amber Valletta).<br /><br />Jamie eventually learns about Mary Shaw, a famous ventriloquist, who during a performance, was heckled by a small boy named Michael Ashen.  Shortly thereafter, Michael mysteriously disappeared.  The Ashen family, and others in the town, cut out Mary Shaw's tongue before killing her.  As time passed, Mary began to exact her revenge, as the people responsible began to die, their bodies found with their tongues cut out.  Now Ravens Fair has practically become a ghost town.  With Lisa's death the last in a long line of similar killings, Jamie may be the next on the list.<br /><br />The family curse is a device with a long tradition in horror, and the setup here is rather traditional, with the innocent hero poking around and then discovering its existence.  The ghostly Mary Shaw is creepy, but with her major weapon being her huge grotesque tongue, what she can do is rather limited.  Dead Silence heavily relies on darkness and a heavy atmosphere, to setup the scares, as it's a little short on action and gore.  The acting performances are generally solid.  Ryan Kwanten is understated and effective, as his character uncovers the truth in a calm and rational way.  Detective Lipton is guy who just has a lot of time on his hands, leaving his jurisdiction to pursue what is a nebulous case.  Bob Gunton, Amber Valetta, and Michael Fairman as the mortician, don't have much screen time, but are all quite effective in crucial roles.<br /><br />For their most personal projects, Leigh Whannell and James Wan and have steered away from the gory extremes that the Saw films have inspired.  Dead Silence is a creepy atmospheric ghost story that provides some thrills, while building up to a climactic finish.  The film's big twist plays out pretty well, as Mary Shaw accomplishes her goal of creating the perfect dummy.  The plot has some holes, but is generally well crafted, and effectively creates a creepy atmosphere, however a little more action might have helped perk it up a bit.  Rating 3.5 stars, this one is a bit of a tweener.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Looked forward to seeing this movie ever since we made the acquaintance of star Ryan Kwanten on TRUEBLOOD, the HBO scripted series in which he plays the heroine's dumb brother.  He's great in that, but now that I've seen him in DEAD SILENCE, I can only surmise that on TRUEBLOOD, it's his buttocks that do all his acting for him, and they should be awarded the Emmy for the superlative work he puts them through on that show.  Here they are continually hidden underneath an unsavory pair of jeans, and thus poor Ryan has literally nothing to work with.  In a way this acting theory matches the premise of DEAD SILENCE, a film that asks us to believe that an entire town, Raven's Fair, has only a few residents in it, and all of them are controlled by the vengeful spirit of Mary Shaw, an amateur ventriloquist of the early 1950s who loved both children and dolls until one snippy little rich boy spoiled her show by exclaiming loudly that he could see her lips moving.<br /><br />In consequence everything starts going wrong for both Mary Shaw and everyone she knows.<br /><br />The film suffers from an extremely low budget.  They could only afford to hire about four actors, to represent not only the populace of the godforsaken town, but also the entire population of NYC.  They could only afford three colors also, so everything is drenched in deep blue, except when Jamie gets into a red car or a horrible ghost tears out red tongues from people's mouths.  And there's black as the third color, but how cheap can you get?  But they really could have saved money, as well as improving the film about 1,000 per cent, by leaving the pants off Ryan Kwanten and his unforgettable assets.  Oh what a waste.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I wanted to see a film with "True Blood"star ,Ryan Kwantan."Dead Silence"is not bad,but I wouldn't want to watch it again.Ryan does a great job,and the ending is scary especially if you are scared of creepy dolls coming to life,and its not a happy ending for Ryan.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I saw this movie at a theatre the night it was being closed down. (I miss that theatre, I had a lot of good memories there!) The funny thing is; I was the only person in the room watching Dead Silence. It got really scary for me. I got scared enough that I literally moved to the back so no one would sneak up behind me and scare me. That part in the hotel room with that red light blinking on and off Billy's face was very creepy. Another part that creeped me out was when the Clown doll is in the rocking chair in the darkness and whispers "Come closer." Being a horror fan, I was surprised about this movie. If you love horror, suspense and creepy dolls, you'll love DEAD SILENCE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Looking back on "Dead Silence," I find it appropriate that the movie opens with the old black and white Universal Studio logo from the 1930s. This film is a throwback to when horror films were much more subtle and used silence and shadow to generate their scares. As a film-goer who has long grown tired of horror films that rely almost solely on numerous "jump scares" where loud noises crash on the soundtrack for cheap frights, I appreciated that this film played fair and generally had a couple good creepy ideas. No one will ever mistake "Dead Silence" for art, the story can sometimes be very silly, and the twist that comes during the very final minute of the film doesn't hold up very well to logic. But, I also can't deny that the film is better than a lot of the stuff that's been passing for horror these days.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that "Dead Silence" is being advertised as being "From the creators of Saw". While it is true that the films share the same director (James Wan) and screenwriter (Leigh Whannell), the two movies are as different as night and day. Gore hounds expecting a torture-filled bloodbath like the horror trilogy that made the filmmakers famous will be disappointed. This is an old fashioned-style supernatural thriller that relies almost entirely on atmosphere, mood and genuine suspense. The movie sets up some good scares by living up to the title. Instead of assaulting our ears with loud sound effects, the movie uses total silence to signal the coming of the vengeful spirit that is going on a murderous rampage. All sound around the potential victim strangely goes completely quiet, and we can only hear the rapid breathing of the person. It's an effective tool to generate suspense, and the movie uses it well. The town of Ravens Fair also has some suitably creepy locations. From dusty old performance hall theaters that hold secrets of the past to cemeteries that apparently come equipped with their own fog and smoke machines, it may all be clich&eacute;d but it's all used very well in the context of the film itself.<br /><br />Like a lot of movies of its type, "Dead Silence" loses most of its charm once the answers start coming and the mysteries start to get unraveled. Likewise, the twist that pops up literally during the last minute will certainly leave some viewers feeling either confused or just plain angry. While it's certainly unexpected, it seems forced, almost as if the filmmakers didn't want their movie to end on a high note, so they intentionally threw this last minute revelation in so that they could end the story on a more "ominous" note. Up until that point, "Dead Silence" is a mostly successful and entertaining little ghostly yarn that does what it's supposed to. It unnerves us and holds our attention just enough to make us want to see the thing to the end, no matter how silly it may sometimes seem.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is not an entirely successful venture, but it does do a lot of things right, and it at least proves that the minds behind the Saw franchise are willing to try something different and explore other forms of horror. You go to a movie like this to be entertained and creeped out, and it delivers just enough for the film to work. How you view this movie will most likely depend on the kind of horror you enjoy. I have a feeling that adults looking for a subtle and creepy tale will be more entertained than teens looking for a scream-fest to take their girlfriends to. There's certainly nothing wrong with that, though I sincerely hope the studio doesn't try to franchise the hell out of the picture like the Saw films. This works well enough as a stand-alone film, and should remain as such.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>My 11-year-old daughter, already afraid of dolls, was pleasantly terrified while watching this old-fashioned thriller with a few twists, and so was the rest of my family.<br /><br />As with many of my reviews these days, I will not get into all the plot elements and details as they've been covered already in Amazon's comments and the other "Spotlight" reviews.  Therefore, I will, as is typical of me, focus on what I specifically liked and disliked about this minor classic and I really do think it will be considered one with time.<br /><br />This very tame "R" rated film is short on gore and long on atmosphere which are the kinds of horror flicks I like.  In addition, there are no sexually graphic scene either and as a father of two, I'm always glad when we can have a good scare together as a family and this film allows for that.  The only disappointment in this film for fans of this genre is that it's promoted as another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMWIVM">Saw</a>, which it is thankfully not.  If you can get past the intentional misleading by the marketers of this film, you will be in for a very pleasant 90 minutes of chills and memorable moments.  I can at least promise you that you will never look at a doll again without thinking of this flick.<br /><br />To start, the acting is actually first-rate which is another surprise for this genre and it has a number of familiar actors in it.  Next, the photography is that washed out blue filtering technique that gives the film a haunting look and it's especially notable when the flashes of color appear, mostly red, as in such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFO0I">Silent Hill</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBGM">The Messengers</a>.  In addition, the script is clever and contains a rather terrific mystery that you really don't see coming, but it is a bit bogged down at times with some clich&eacute;-ridden and unbelievable moments like when our main character insists on driving all over the place with the evil looking dummy either in the back or front passenger seat when he could have been placed in his box or even a trash bag for that matter.  That is perhaps what held me back from giving this film 5 stars.<br /><br />The direction of the film is the heart of this film.  James Wan intentionally wanted a more atmospheric film and made an early decision to tone down the violence in favor of more memorable and creepy moments.  Even the actual murders are relatively tame, but still frightening (or I wouldn't let my 11 year-old see this).  The make-up work for the murders, corpses, and dolls are top-notch and again, not overly graphic, but very creepy and terrifying nevertheless.  In fact, haunting is the best term to use in relation to this story.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is a throwback to a bygone era of film making wherein character development, atmosphere, and story provided the essence of the film without an over reliance on gore, sex, and violence.  As I've said before in other reviews, I'm no prude and enjoy my fair share of films that have those elements, but those elements and the sole reliance on those elements do not make a quality film.  "Dead Silence" is a haunting film that stays with you long after the experience of watching it is over and that makes it a quality film.  It is not a modern classic at this point by any means, but I think over time it will be considered a minor classic and will withstand the test of time as little dates this film.  I think it will be remembered much like we remember small films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WGAA">Carnival of Souls and Horror Hotel</a>.  I like this film much like I like the recent Stephen King film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJ6PBK">1408</a>, which is another haunting tale that relies more on the story, character development, and atmospheric direction than anything else.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" and "1408" may not leave you screaming, but they will have you up at night.  Pleasant dreams . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Dead Silence, while not as good as Saw, is a great horror film in it's own right. I really think that the movie will get more popular as time goes on and is definitely something that should develope a cult following. With all of the mediocre horror movies being released recently, I really do think that this does stand out among them. It won't win any Oscars but should appeal to most horror fans. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does have it's moments when you know that something is going to happen and want to cover your ears. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie that I have seen twice and will probably see again. I recommended this to a friend and she loved it, so maybe rent it first.

Gordon's Dolls (great movie if you haven't seen it), and it will definitely have you rewatching to see how some of the scenes went down after you watch all the way to the end (you'll know what I mean).</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting much out of this movie to be totally honest.  I mean, come on, another "dolls come to life and kill innocent people" movie?  How many of those have their been?  How can this movie do what hasn't been done a thousand times already?<br /><br />Well, maybe Dead Silence didn't break any new ground in the horror genre, and the movie certainly isn't miles above other similar kinds of horror storylines, but what it succeeded in doing was scare the living heck out of me, and the best thing of all was that the dolls were VERY unpredictable in how they chose to torture and kill people.<br /><br />In other words, the dolls didn't always come to life at the moment the people turned their backs- oh sure, *sometimes* they would, but most of the time not.  That was a surprising highlight for me and added a bit of creativity to the horror genre.  You were never sure when they were going to strike.<br /><br />Of course we ALL get the creeps thinking about dolls moving their eyeballs around, and that happens here.<br /><br />The storyline is really good too, because it's half mystery/half horror.  It's about a young husband trying to figure out what or who was possessing the dolls to come to life and kill people (and his wife).  The story works, because there was tons of suspense, and you got the feeling something frightening was going to happen at any moment.<br /><br />Another thing that scared the pants straight off my legs was what happened just BEFORE the dolls would go into "killing mode".  The surroundings would gradually become quiet, and whatever was making a sound would give off this frightening dying sound (similar to playing a cassette tape in a tape player with low batteries).<br /><br />Then the people would hear nothing but silence (hence the name of the movie) and the dolls would do their cold-hearted killing spree on whoever was around.<br /><br />Very good movie worth watching over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Okay, this wasn't too bad. Infact, I have to say that this was a very orignal idea to come from the Creators of Saw. Basically, it's about a guy who returns to his hometown after his wife is murdered and fines out that his wife's murder could be linked to an old ghost story. About a murdered ventriloquist and her dolls. The acting was okay in this movie. So, check it out for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>The creators of the controversial blockbuster "Saw" have brought us a modern masterpiece of gothic horror.  In the tradition of "Darkness Falls" and "The Ring," another urban legend has been given the big screen treatment.  "Dead Silence" involves an elderly, childless ventriloquist named Mary Shaw who is accused of causing the disappearance of a boy from a wealthy family.  The townsmen cut out her tongue and murder her.  She is buried along with her massive collection of ventriloquist dummies.  Soon after, entire families are found murdered with their tongues ripped out.  Legend has it that if you see her ghost and scream, you will have your tongue ripped out.<br /><br />  Great performances, a creepy atmosphere of decay and desolation, and a good musical score make "Dead Silence" a must see for fans of gothic horror.  I promise that you will never be able to look again at a ventriloquist dummy without shivering.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Originally titled "The Doll and Mary Shaw", Dead Silence is a 2007 horror film about a ventriloquist named Mary Shaw who was murdered after a young boy heckles her & comes up missing. She takes her vengeance on the town through her dolls. Directed by James Wan & Written by Leigh Whannell(Creators of Saw); it stars Donnie Wahlberg(yes, of 'New Kids on the Block' fame), Ryan Kwantan, Amber Valletta & Judith Roberts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Dead Silence didn't do too well at the box-office making around $16.5 Million domestically at the time of its' release in theaters. DVD sales has upped that amount to over $20,861,015 Worldwide. It took an estimated $20 Million to make the film. There are rumors of a sequel being made in the near future but the chances of it seem unlikely. We'll have to wait and see... ;)<br /><br />In my opinion, Dead Silence is a great Horror movie. Definitely one of my favorites. One that I hope will see a sequel. It's a good choice for a 'Friday Night Fright'.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>James Wan, who made his name by directing the smash hit "Saw" back in 2004, comes back with another horror film. But "Dead Silence" (written by Leigh Whannell, script writer of the original "Saw" and co-writer of two sequels) looks more like homage to old horror movies. The film begins with an old black-and-white Universal logo; it doesn't rely on gores to scare, using atmospheric photography; and it certainly has no torture scenes. It looks as if James Wan really wants to distance himself from the hit franchise that gets more and more gory and violent.<br /><br />In fact "Dead Silence" has many elements that could be found in old-fashioned ghost stories: a weird "legend" in a small town, an old lady warning about the impending danger, a creepy ventriloquist's dummy delivered on the doorstep of a married couple and so on. The story is about one Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten), who must go back to his hometown and discover the truths about the dummy and its creator.<br /><br />Though "Dead Silence" offers some decent scares, its story is weak and characters boring, lacking something that really interests us. Moreover, characters including Jamie, the protagonist, go where they shouldn't go and do what they shouldn't do, missing every chance to understand what is going on. Donnie Wahlberg, as in the "Saw" sequels, again appears as a police detective who believes our hero is No. 1 murder suspect. The story mostly consists of a collection of clich&eacute;d ideas except perhaps the one at the concluding section, which may not be really necessary.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" shows the filmmakers wanted to do something different after the success of "Saw." The film is a reasonably entertaining take of traditional horror genre with several spooky sequences, but it also needs a better script with logics and rules.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>If you are looking for a silly horror diversion, this one fills the bill fine.  Some weird gore, decent sets, a couple of decent jumps, and a very silly premise.  It's improved by the actors who take it much more seriously than it deserves, but for a short horror flick it does have a few fun moments.  Harmless fun.  How old is Amber Valetta anyway?</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>You've just gotten in and a package arrives - opening it you find it has a lovely in-lay that stands about two feet tall and is normally accustomed to sitting on the knees of "performers" while doing the "Mary and Billy" act. When you see it your wife decides to start a little jingle about a woman who "had no children, only dolls" and rhymes down a little more to a climax of "pulling your tongue out if you scream." So, what to do, what to do? Well, keep it, of course, and allow it to ruin your life. Apparently that is the way of things when you come from a town where death seems second nature, and more so when you come from a town that suffers from the plague of a death woman's curse that deals with little people made of wood, 101 to be exact, and a mystery within a mystery that evolves as you go home. Adding to that is the death of your wife, apparently she didn't heed her won jingle, and is had a facelift of the Jokeresque caliber.<br /><br />While Dead Silence has had some starkly bad press, I thought it was entertaining and had some really creepy parts in it. There's something about a little doll with eyes that match up with a taxidermist's little plaything that I find bothersome, not to mention the background on the "why" in this cursed lil town. Apparently the tongue jingle - everyone seems to know it and some really seem to know it, to the point that it says a lot about the kind of force that's being dealt with. Its kind of like Cheers, where everyone knows your name, only you don't scream out "Norm" because you get your tongue removed from your mouth.<br />Personally it also sounds like a chance to pack up my bags and take a one-way trip back to "anywhere but here"ville, but in solving the death of one's beloved many things become irrational - despite the nasty pictures.<br />And the pictures; they are nasty.<br /><br />Personally, I liked the elements, the story, the acting, and even the way that this wasn't a newer edition of bad elements but more of an edition selected out of older nightmares I used to have when I was a kid. It reminded me of the Twilight Zone meets Stuart Gordon meets a field full of blood and Gene Simmon's like tongue-appeal, with nice elements of CGI to piece in some of the puzzles and nice pieces of a rather creepy woman and some rather creepy little friends edging the terror along. It didn't have a lot of what people seem to want from the horror genre these days - it was a little different and different seems to equate to boring some how. Still, I judge my movies on a old scale I developed back when Italian movies walked upright like the T-Rex's of the land and when forces like Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead were panned by critics because they didn't deliver on the canned goods. I watch the movie and my wife watches it close by, and the more she jumps and the more I become ensnared in the plot the more I like it. Critics be burned as witches - they don't give out awards to horror in the mainstream so why should horror kowtow to them?<br />And I liked it because people were always screaming - apparently Mary doesn't care if you scream because you fall down a flight of stairs or because you had some results on Jenny as long as you show those pearly white and that little apparatus hinged inside your mouth.<br /><br />I know the "makers of Saw" got many people up in arms when they watched the movie, too, and I know that people didn't expect what they saw. Still, it was what I expected from the beginning and the jingle - it was funny and it played well. Here we had a horror movie with a vengeful attitude that started with the beginning and then played out its pieces as the movie went along.<br />So, judging from the different sides of the same reviewing coin, it might be something to decide what you want to see and then weigh your options. This movie was a throw-back, a screamer flick with flinncher qualities, and it was also something that didn't involve the depraved games like "Saw" would have offered.<br />No - having your tongue removed because you scream, that's not enough.<br /><br />Dropping your expectations when you wathc horror helps, and this is a good chance to try that because it is a movie where a dead woman puppeteers dolls JUST to get a chance at the one prize she's been after - the fish that sawm upstream. So, you have a classic revenge case, a horrible butcher that has reworked the whole town, a facelift gone wrong, terribly police work, the Perfect Doll, and a range of other dolls that make me feel uncomfortable when I think about them.<br />I really enjoyed the film, not expecting much and getting a lot more in the process.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Silent Scream"<br />(A simple horror movie that unexpectedly caused a split among Our Rotten Staff, something you'd expect in a presidential election, but not at The Rotten Review.<br /><br />In any event, our Liberal Progressive Wing gets the first shot.)<br /><br />FROM THE LEFT:  Remember "The Ring", "Skeleton Key" or the first Phantasm?  How about "Blair Witch", "Darkness Falls" or "Silent Hill"?  Apparently, the makers of "Dead Silence" were hoping you'd forget - as their movie is a pastiche that borrows against those other movies, essentially using thrills available in the public domain.<br /><br />It starts out with Jamie Ashen, a young married dude with a family history.  Living away from home, life is good, until he comes home to find his expecting wife brutally murdered, her body (especially her face) mutilated.  His only clue is a menacing ventriloquist dummy mysteriously sent to him before the murder.  Linking the doll to his hometown, Jamie returns home and finds the town in the last stages of decrepitude - stores closing, people disappeared.  The only safe business is the funeral home.  Jamie finds his rich father has remarried a comely young woman named Ella, a useful device for us to learn that Jamie's father is a man who uses people and then replaces and erases them.  He will soon learn that the town, and especially his family, share a dark secret relating to Mary Shaw, a malevolent crone killed when she was suspected of having something to do with the year's past death of a boy who would have been Jamie's uncle, and that Jamie's wife shared a grisly fate suffered by many other citizens of the town.  Donnie Wahlberg plays a big-city detective who will drive the plot forward by suspecting and then assisting Jamie - it's a device that was old when used in "The Exorcist" and "The Sentinel", and those movies came out in the `70's!!<br /><br />Is it the vengeful ghost of Mary Shaw come to wreak vengeance?  Will others suffer that same fate?  Will you be forced to sit through numerous fake-scares followed immediately by the real one?  You betcha!!<br /><br />What really kills the movie is the way that it offers nothing new.  The script prepares you for Weapons of Mass Terror, and it isn't until you're knee deep in corpses that you realize how you've been bamboozled with nothing more than bits of other movies.  Good movies can scare you, but bad movies like this scare you in a way that embarrasses you - getting you to lower your expectations with no real payoff in the end.  I suppose that our staff's resident Neo-Cons will love this movie, given how cravenly they fear anything new or imaginative.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />FROM THE RIGHT: my so-called "progressive" colleagues have gotten this movie wrong.  Like any liberals, they go for instant-gratification: where's the WMT? Why did we choose this movie when we could have enjoyed that other movie?  Osama doesn't even appear in this movie?  We may be Neocons", but we know that a horror movie is more than the sum of some scary moments.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is an interesting study in horror because it contains many scary ideas - most of them admittedly dated, deliberately so.  This is the movie's most inventive idea - tricking you with some obvious plot devices and amateurishly expository dialog and, once you're defenses are down, jabbing you with genuinely effective chills.  Mary Shaw is an uncommonly seductive villainess because, unlike the ghostly evils at the heart of movies like "Darkness Falls", she's not a woman who is hiding anything - she performed her evil magic and let everybody think it was just ventriloquism.  The secret of the movie is just how much of its evil is actually in plain sight.  Best of all, "Dead Silence" does this repeatedly - making you think you're watching a parody of a horror movie, then going for your jugular with a sincere scare.  If anything, the movie is weakest when emulating more recent contemporary movies like "The Ring" and best when it channels great old TV movies like "Burnt Offerings", "Dark Night of the Scarecrow" and "Don't be afraid of the Dark".  The direction keeps things chilled with a great eye towards scene transitions and settings (besides Mary Shaw's ruined theater, we have the dying town and especially the Ashen family manor - the last of these possessed of an interior dotted with the most consistently ominous examples of portraiture.  You keep expecting the pictures to grab you).  And lest you think otherwise, the movie closes with a genuine surprise ending.<br /><br />TO SUM IT UP - we offer this assessment from our resident Whig:<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is definitely a guilty pleasure - like a candybar, your enjoyment has nothing to do with surprises.  At a shade over an hour and a half, it's a brisk story, but one that keeps you watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />With their piercing yet vacant stares, unnervingly diminutive features, and slack-jawed mouths, ventriloquist dummies have been a staple of horror stories ever since Rod Serling memorably brought a number of them to life in "The Twilight Zone" back in the 1950's and `60`s.  Probably the most famous theatrical movie on that subject has been 1975`s "Magic," with Anthony Hopkins as the puppeteer haunted by his anthropomorphized wooden sidekick.  As with clowns, these creepy ersatz-humans have become a source of dread for many people - and moviemakers have been quick to exploit that fear.<br /><br />The latest such endeavor is a movie entitled "Dead Silence," which features Ryan Kwanten as a young man who, one fateful night, finds an anonymous package, containing a ventriloquist's dummy, sitting on his doorstep.  Before one can say "Charlie McCarthy," the doll has done away with Kwanten's unsuspecting wife, with the young man himself the prime suspect in her killing.  In an attempt to prove his innocence, Kwanten heads to his hometown to investigate the legend of Mary Shaw, an old crone of a ventriloquist who met with a mysterious and untimely end a few decades earlier.<br /><br />Despite its derivative nature, "Dead Silence" has enough creepy moments to make it a passable outing for the less discriminating horror movie aficionado.  Director James Wan and his screenwriting partner, Leigh Whannell, don't do anything with the dummy we haven't seen a million times before, but, let's face it, the murdering-ventriloquist-dummy sub genre is a fairly restrictive one by its very nature, with not much room for innovation contained within its rather strict parameters.<br /><br />Kwanten makes for a bland central hero, though Donnie Wahlberg nicely fleshes out the role of the cynical and completely wrongheaded gumshoe assigned to the case.<br /><br />Considering that Wan and Whannell are the filmmaking team behind the vile "Saw" films, "Dead Silence" is surprisingly tame in the gore-and-dismemberment department, with little graphic violence to spoil the mood.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>dead silence, was anything but dead. from start to finish it just had you, and that finish you will not see coming. an evil women lives through her dolls, to kill all of those who did her wrong. and if you yell or try to scream she'll rip your tongue out quick as can be. a young man must return home after the death of his fiance, and face the father he is estranged from to find out why and who killed his love. once there, he is reminded of the story of the great puppeteer mary shaw. and discovers his familys involvement in her death, and why she seeks revenge. there he uncovers more than he's ready to face. just remember don't scream. i love these crazy living doll movies. they sometimes tend to freak you out because they look evil already, and if they really were alive we'd all be in trouble. this movie was great. from the killer dolls, to the crazy mary shaw, to the real doll in the end. fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I just rented this flick and watch it, only wants to see this flick, because of saw director, and was a ghost story.<br />I really liked the makeup, special effects, stage looks and the way they made it and cast. Real eye catching colors and style & old fashion 70 & 80s ghost story looks, such as I loved.<br />But the scrip is the stinker, almost the end, that cop never comes down with backup..Never see the police dept..And the main actor goes almost places and spooky places for long while nothing happened to him after a lots incidents!.  Just alots of  flaws here and there, make the flick some type of a joke & unbelievable..Kind of cheesy, love the cast and the old woman and dolls real good deal, just scrip was lame and screw up the whole flick & lost interest !

Generally the only methods a moviegoer has for choosing to see a specific movie is the trailer he or she watches on TV, in theaters, or over the internet. If for some reason a person doesn't see the trailer, the other marketing method used to get a moviegoer's attention would be the movie poster with a striking image and catchphrase that sums up the movie with one or two lines of copy. Regardless of what method ends up grabbing the individual's attention, the studio should feel some need to make sure that they have properly marketed the movie to the appropriate audience to maximize the number of tickets sold in order to turn a profit. For some reason though, studios sometimes have a misfire when it comes to their marketing strategy for certain movies. Whether the cause is a misleading trailer or catchphrases on the poster that lead the audience astray, it doesn't matter, if the movie doesn't deliver upon the expectations set forth by the marketing material, the studio will generally find themselves with a flop on their hands. One such misfire would be the most recent directorial effort by acclaimed director William Friedkin ("The Exorcist"), called "Bug" starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon.<br /><br />"Bug" tells the story of a down-trodden, lonely waitress named Agnes, (Ashley Judd), who is barely scraping by as she attempts to hide from her ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) while living in a rundown motel room. One day things begin to possibly look up for this lonely woman as she is introduced to a gulf war veteran, Peter, (Michael Shannon) who is interested in starting a relationship with her; however, this veteran is not without his share of issues. He believes that his time spent fighting for the United States has left him the subject of top-secret testing using bugs implanted beneath his skin. As his paranoia grows exponentially, Peter begins to drag Agnes into his dangerous delusions until she becomes fully immersed in his disturbed version of reality.<br /><br />The marketing campaign for this film, meaning the previews and the movie posters, led me and many other moviegoers to believe that this would be a horror film in the vein of "The Fly" or something similar. The catchphrases used in conjunction with this movie were ones along the lines of, `the most disturbing horror film ever made' or `the scariest movie of the year', further convincing me that this would definitely be one scary movie to see and one that would most likely not disappoint. Plus, with the added bonus of solid actors filling the roles and an acclaimed director at the helm, how could this movie possibly go wrong. Well, somehow it found a way, and let me tell you I was extremely let down.<br /><br />"Bug" is anything but a scary movie, there isn't a single moment in the entire film that could even be deemed as scary. No jump scenes, no blood or gore (a staple for today's modern horror films), or monsters/killers to fear, all this movie had was a lonely woman and a very strange man as the focus. If anything the movie was a little creepy at times, but even that wasn't too extreme. The movie was definitely not one I would consider a horror film, I would place it more in the category of psychological thriller, though using the word thriller is a bit of a stretch, the movie isn't all that thrilling and it's certainly not exciting. It strives to be one of those slow-boiling types of films where the audience senses the impending disaster that is approaching in the lives of the characters, but in the end the film doesn't deliver, and the audience is left disappointed and wishing for something more from the movie.<br /><br />Where the movie did succeed was in the actors' performances and straight-forward, nothing flashy, style of direction from William Friedkin. Friedkin made every scene feel very personable, as if you were in the room with the actors at all times, a very effective method in a movie like this, but not enough to save it. Every one of the three main actors delivered very strong, convincing performances that one would expect from such talent. But their capable acting ability was not enough to save this movie from becoming the flop it turned out to be.<br /><br />It is sad to think that a director like William Friedkin wasn't smart enough or powerful enough to steer this movie into the proper genre it belonged in; or at least assist in making the marketing applicable to the type of film it ended up as. Take it from me don't pay attention to the enticing previews or clever catchphrases for this movie; if you do you will be left severely disappointed by the results.<br /><br />"Bug" is rated R for brief violence, drug use, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is messed up. About a woman named Agnes who tries to get away from her ex-husband and ends up falling in love with a psychopath named Peter. Peter thinks there are tiny little bugs in the room and in their skin, pulling Agnes into his crazy thoughts. They begin to think it's a conspiracy against them and Peter makes Agnes think about suicide to get themselves away from the bugs. At least there is a pretty good sex scene. If you like messed up movies, you might like BUG!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**** 2006. Directed by William Friedkin. Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon shine in this adaptation of Tracy Letts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810123487">Bug: A Play</a>. This fascinating study of a mental case of paranoia is seriously worth your time if you're not looking for a horror movie. Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>ashley judd is a awesome actress and it's not her fault that this movie is so hard to like. The movie is dark and about a man's madness and not about bugs really , at least real or sci fi bugs like the interesting 70's sci fi flick 'bugs' in which bugs catch people on fire!  Instead we get a story about derangement, this type of derangement is quite common with methheads though. I knew some that thought bugs and crap were eating into them. nice, but meth is insane anyways. This guy isn't a methead and the movie is so dark and like the play it came from. It was scheduled for a blu ray release but that never happened. This movie is hard to like , it has a great director even but this was not his finest moment in the least.  You must be in the mood for this one, unlike the intriguing 'bugs' which you can  just watch and enjoy this one you have to slog through and inspite of the good performances the story about mutual madness , which does happen, why else do mothers let their men mistreat their kids after all? is just a hard watch. The picture is good though as it was a newer movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Despite its title that sounds like a B-horror film, "Bug" is not a horror movie and you won't see flesh-eating creatures attacking humans. Instead, in William Friedkin's "Bug," paranoia reigns in a run-down motel room. When Agnes White (Ashley Judd), a lonely and nervous waitress, afraid of her abusive ex-husband, meets a war veteran Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), who believes a curious theory about the "bugs," their relationship triggers something deep inside him, and her - a spiral process in which their loneliness (and delusion) is amplified. You know, this is not a film for everyone.<br /><br />"Bug" intrigued me up to a certain point. In the earlier chapters director William Friedkin suggests Agnes' fears are not totally groundless, using spooky aerial shots or showing Agnes's husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.). But about 40 minutes in, the film attempts to shift the audiences' attention from the blurred line between reality and delusion, to the mental conditions of Agnes and Peter, who start acting more and more unusual.<br /><br />Let's face it. Sometimes it is uncomfortable to watch people obsessed with something. This is what happens in "Bug," but there is more to come. What these people would do in this claustrophobic situation is largely predictable once you sense where the story is leading us. Moreover, the process of their growing delusion might be convincing, but it also alienates us from the characters emotionally. Granted, the film is a wild ride, which is amazingly intense with blood and violence, but I am afraid their intensity contains nothing beneath the surface. Or perhaps that is exactly what is intended.<br /><br />Some viewers might be drawn to the intense world Agnes and Peter represent - and two leads are good actors, I admit - but others including me would think the film is rather pretentious, and no matter how they act well, it is obvious they are acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>Like a lot of people I walked into BUG following on the heels of the marketing which sold the film as a horror about... bugs.<br /><br />People trapped in a small space, tin foiled walls, creepy blue lighting, things getting under your skin that should not be there... all wrong (well, almost).  Instead BUG is a tight, sparse, threadbare story of people holed up on their own souls being held prisoner by addiction.  I sat through three quarters of this film waiting for the monsters to arrive, only to find that I had been watching them from the start.  Human monsters, human vices, human horrors - life at the end of pipe.  Not the film I signed up for, not the film I was looking for... but, can anything be salvaged from BUG to recommend?<br /><br />Three things... first, the performances are not bad.  At times it comes across like a far gritter episode of THE L WORD with flashes of brilliance that really help to sell the idea behind the picture.  But, they don't come often, leaving the rest of the film to float along like a block of wood in water.  It's dense, often soap opera quality at best and clipped.  There are some plot surprises, and if you take the time to piece it all together (and, fair warning, it's not easy when you don't have all the pieces to the puzzle) you will get something out of it.  Finally, the direction is not bad.  It's tough to take three rooms and somehow make them into film, but Friedkin does it well enough to keep the picture moving.<br /><br />But, in the end, there is very little to BUG worth watching.  The ending comes quickly and suddenly and with some surprise, but adds nothing to to what had come before it.<br /><br />Commentary is included with the film and for the blind, this commentary will help, but for the rest of it, Friedkin's habit of telling you exactly what's happening on screen as it's actually happening wastes your time.  He does go into some background, does give us some thoughts, but for the majority of the commentary it's too literal to be worth listening to.<br /><br />BUG might have done better to actually have had some bugs in it to help move it along, but as it stands, BUG is a stalled and flawed picture on the state of paranoia and drug use.  For the brave only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I won't go over the plot here, that's been done very well by other reviewers. However... there are a number of things I did not like about this film.<br />First, the billing. The previews led you to believe this is a horror film. I recall quick scenes where they showed bugs crawling just under the skin, which didn't happen in the movie. Major points off for being misleading.<br />Second... this is not a thriller by any stretch of the imagination. This is a study in two parts.First part being how easily some people can succumb to the influence of others, especially if they are emotionally fragile for whatever reason (lonely, drug addicted, etc.). Second part being how much in need they are of attention.... whether it's good or bad attention, it's still attention. So more major points off for being misleading in script also.<br />What I will say is that the acting was excellent. Each character, sans the doctor, was believable. The doctor's character was too too out there. What would have happened in real life is not what happened in this movie. Police would have been called and involuntary warrants for admission to a psychiatric place would have been issued, especially after viewing how the interior of the home had been altered.<br />But... I firmly believe they went for some gore so they could use it for misleading billing. Bad, bad move.<br />This movie would have done better as a pure study in how insanity/paranoia can be transmitted and the decline that follows.<br />It's a shame really. The pretense is strong. Put a lonely, emotionally unstable woman together with a mentally sick man and watch what happens. And it does happen.<br />The points I took off were for misleading billing in script and in trailers. Incongruent story line, especially with the doctor and a misleading plot. Nowhere in this film do the police come into play.<br />What was good, but wasted, was the acting by all involved, again, sans the doctor. He was there for the gore factor.<br />All in all, I would have to say, don't waste your time. There's much better films about the decline into insanity. Watch 'Girl Interrupted' if you want a true, solid story line in this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Bug could have been something great. As much as I am a lover of gory horror films (not to say this isn't gory), but I also like psychological horror films like Silent Hill. This is more on the lines of a psychological horror film, but it commits the cardinal sin of cinema; IT'S BORING. When I saw this film I was even willing to forgive the director, William Friedkin. Why? To tell you the truth, I hated The Exorcist. Sure it had its creepy moments, but it was so unbelievably boring. I found Bug to be far more entertaining, but it was still weighed down by boredom. Unfortunately this film just boils down to a hidden message; Never have sexual intercourse without protection. Or the more likely message would be don't have sexual intercourse with a crazy schizophrenic man.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A woman named Agnes (What a horrible name for a woman) is a waitress living in a motel room hiding from her abusive ex-husband. Agnes is a chain-smoking, drug-using, middle-aged, wannabe lesbian woman struggling with her guilt of losing her son years ago. Then a man named Peter her female lover brings along to her motel room stays with her and they grow closer together and then make love one night and then later that night is when they start to see the "bugs." Slowly but surely Agnes begins going insane with Peter and they both become convinced that bugs are attacking them and that the military experimented on Peter and they're after him.<br />MUSIC: Rarely appears, and when it does it's not good.<br />ACTION: This film has nice gore touches and you get somewhat of idea of the couple's insanity. There is some tension to be had throughout the film, but unfortunately this film is mostly focused on boring dialogue. This film starts off slow and never picks up steam until the ending.<br />ACTING: The actors were good, but unfortunately they were given almost nothing but boring dialogue. Overall they were very professional and talented, but the very long-winded dialogue dragged this film down.<br />OVERALL: Cautionary rental. There are great ideas here that are sadly not used to their potential. You must be a person who does not get easily bored, if you're not you will hate this film.<br />THE GOOD: The gore, the ending, and the actors.<br />THE BAD: The music and horrendously long-winded dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>There's some decent buildup of dread here and the two leads' increasing paranoia is nicely captured. Harry Connick Jr.'s beefcake role is interesting, though his good-guy image isn't quite overcome by menace. Director Billy Friedkin, by his own admission, hasn't made a decent movie since "Rosemary's Baby" and "French Connection." The big fire ending here is anti-climactic. It's a film version of a play. Watch it for what it's worth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Only the career defining performance from a dynamic Ashley Judd mskes this movie worthwhile.  Director William Friedkin's translation of the play by Tracy Lettis tries to instill suspense by fueling the paranoia of Judd and co-star Michael Shannon (in a very good performance).  If you were expecting a true horror movie, you will certainly be disappointed.  I had a hard time seeing Judd's descent into the paranoid woman -- her involvement with Shannon is deep but to fall so hard into the maelstrom of Shannon's dementia isn't grounded.  Harry Connick Jr. is pretty good too as Judd's abusive ex-husband, but overall I was disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />You can go about halfway with "Bug," William Friedkin's film version of the Tracy Letts play that had its premiere in London, then made its way across the Atlantic to New York, Chicago and Washington D.C.  It is safe to say that the source material has yielded one of the oddest American movies to come our way in quite some time.  It is certainly an example of a dual-genre gear-grinder - for what starts out as an intriguing domestic drama suddenly turns into a whacked-out paranoid thriller.  The whiplash is fairly intense at times, but the quality of the performances compensates for some, though certainly not all, of the discomfort that results.<br /><br />The wonderful Ashley Judd plays Agnes White, a divorced cocktail waitress who lives by herself in a rundown motel stuck out in the middle of the windswept desert.  On the very same night in which she invites Peter (Michael Shannon), a strange young drifter, to stay over at her place, her recently paroled, abusive ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) also shows up, determined to start over with her, even if that means using strong-armed tactics to do so.  Peter, a war vet, is convinced that he has been the victim of some nefarious medical experiments at the hands of the U.S. government, experiments that involve injecting some type of bug into his bloodstream.  Soon, Agnes is sharing Peter's paranoid delusions...if they really are delusions, that is.<br /><br />There's no getting around the fact that this is one majorly schizophrenic film.  There are those who will be pulled in by the human drama of the first half but repelled by the psycho-thriller aspects that develop later on - just as there will be those who will find the earlier sections dull and talky but be intrigued by the sci-fi aspects of the second half (though I certainly don't want to discount those who'll love or hate both halves with equal fervor).  Frankly, I find myself mainly in the first camp, enjoying the movie up to the point where Peter's bug obsession completely takes over and the descent into madness begins.  In the early stages, the relationships among the various characters are complex and involving, with excellent performances from Judd, Shannon, Connick and Lynn Collins as Agnes' lesbian co-worker and friend adding to our interest.  The subtle hints of potential mental disturbance and violence (on the part of both men in her life) keep us on our guard and generate a genuine concern for Agnes' safety and well-being (emotional as well as physical).  Indeed, the quality of vulnerability that Judd brings to the role makes Agnes a very compelling character indeed.  The scenes between Judd and Shannon are particularly well-played and effective.<br /><br />Then the Big Moment arrives and the whole thing degenerates almost instantaneously into a ham-handed exercise in silliness, pretentiousness and pseudo-profundity.  Indeed, by the time the two lovers have plastered themselves into a room-sized tinfoil cocoon, you`ll probably be more than ready to check out of this particular motel for good.  It`s true that "Bug" is not quite like anything you've ever seen before, but I'm not sure that that, in and of itself, qualifies as much of a recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>In this claustrophobic tale set in a low rent motel in nowheresville, Ashley Judd's character meets a whacked-out Gulf War vet.

I am the super bug mother", "Bug", the newest film from director William Friedkin was pretty good. But after this point, the fate of the film is sealed. There is simply no way to pull off this line with any degree of believability and the film simply deteriorates.<br /><br />Agnes (Ashley Judd), a waitress at a lesbian honky tonk in Oklahoma, lives in a run down motel in the middle of nowhere. One night, the phone starts to ring and no one is on the other end of the line. She immediately assumes it is Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.), her husband who has recently been released from jail. Her only friend, RC (Lynn Collins), a lesbian waitress at the lesbian honky tonk, introduces Agnes to Peter (Michael Shannon), a drifter. Peter seems to be pretty low key, which is why Agnes agrees to let him stay with her. As they get to know each other, the drifter begins to reveal things about himself. He was once in the Army and recently escaped from a secret hospital where they did experiments on him. Now, he feels like the bugs they have implanted under his skin are starting to break through. Once they break through, they will start to feed on him. Once they start to feed on him, they will also start to feed on Agnes. Thus begins the couple's spiral down into madness.<br /><br />Directed by William Friedkin ("The Exorcist") and based on a play by Tracy Letts, "Bug" effectively builds a lot of tension for the first hour or so, but as Agnes and Peter spiral further down into their madness, the film becomes problematic and almost laughable.<br /><br />Ashley Judd is actually pretty good as Agnes. From the moment we first see her, laying on her sofa, smoking weed, trying to get her mind wrapped around the anonymous phone calls, we realize this is a woman who has suffered in her life. She now seems content, or at least complacent, to live her life in relative peace, as bad as it is. Every time Judd moves, we get a sense of the weight on Agnes' life, how bad her life has been, and how content she may be to live a relatively quiet life, no matter how bad it is.<br /><br />Judd is also fairly unattractive as this woman. Frequently, her hair looks dirty, she wears little or no make-up. She also drinks and smokes heavily, making her appear intensely fatigued.<br /><br />She finds a certain solace at her job, even though she barely makes enough money to scrape by. But she does make enough money to live in her run down motel room, eat, drink, and get high. She now lives in relative peace, which is why these anonymous phone calls are freaking her out even more. Her bank is a coin purse she stuffs under her mattress after adding her evening's tips of single $1 bills every night.<br /><br />Her life has also led her to become more than a little paranoid of strangers, so when the drifter, Peter, is introduced into her life, she is more than a little weary of him. But as she gets to know him, she lets down her defenses and they start to talk, learning a little about each other. As she learns more about him, she becomes more accepting of him. This may seem like a bit of a character development problem, but it really fits. She is so lonely and despondent that any seemingly normal visitor would eventually be welcomed into her home and her life. Simply because she needs the companionship.<br /><br />As they become friends and become involved in each other's lives, Agnes begins to hang on Peter's every word, listening to and believing in everything he has to say. This is also very believable, because Agnes is the type of misguided person who needs to have some guidance, a dominant force in her life. Once she gets this, she latches onto it, for good or bad. This is why the inclusion of the character Jerry (Connick) is so important to the overall fabric of the film. Once we meet him, realize he is an abusive, controlling jerk, we get it. She falls for this type of guy, can't really escape them.<br /><br />Michael Shannon plays Peter, the drifter who happens into Agnes' life. At first, he just seems timid and shy. And this is what draws Agnes to him. But as their relationship develops, he starts to reveal the true extent of his paranoia and Agnes starts to believe in it as well. His performance builds until he is so consumed by his fears, Agnes begins to believe them and adopt them as well. It is an interesting performance because he starts out relatively normal and for a long time, the phobias and problems seep in very slowly.<br /><br />"Bug" is based on a play, and it has a very play-like feel. Virtually the entire film takes place in Agnes' seedy motel room. Throughout, there are almost never more than two characters on screen at any one time. These two factors help to further reinforce the feeling of abandonment these characters have and help to explain how impressionable they are.<br /><br />What doesn't exactly work are the transitions in the story. As Agnes and Peter become more and more involved in each others lives, as Agnes becomes more and more convinced that what ever Peter says is correct, we see that Peter is, in a way, convincing Agnes to become more like him. But there are stages to this development. At one point, the action shifts and we return to the motel room to find all of the furniture wrapped in plastic. Later, there is another transition and we return to the motel room to find every surface covered in aluminum foil. These moments are probably necessary, but they seem to make a shift that isn't entirely convincing. It would have been more effective to figure out a way for us to watch the madness progress in real time. As it stands, each of these `breaks' make it seem like Act One is ending and then we will have a brief pause before the curtain rises on Act Two.<br /><br />Also, the inclusion of aluminum foil, to `keep out the transmissions' is a movie clich&eacute; at this point, an idea that was new in the 50s. Why are we still returning to this tired mechanism? Try to figure out something new and terrifying.<br /><br />Friedkin has directed a couple of classic films, films that have attained this status due to his ability to create suspense and tension. "The Exorcist" is a scary film, but a large part of that can be attributed to the tension he builds between the characters, and with us. "The French Connection" is an enormously suspenseful film because Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) is racing to stop a drug deal, building a lot of tension. Friedkin knows his way around these elements and brings them to bear in "Bug". The first hour or so is all about creating the characters, showing us their lives, and drawing us into their madness. Then, everything goes wrong...<br /><br />"I am the super bug mother. I am the super bug mother".<br /><br />There is no actor on the face of the Earth who could pull off this line and make it believable. Not even Merlyn Streep. And Judd, who is really good in this film, is no Meryl Streep. The line is just laughable and completely obliterates any feeling of suspense and tension previously established. It also serves to completely draw us out of the story and to make us aware of everything going on. Because I was so engrossed in the events happening to Agnes and Peter, I overlooked problems. But from this point forward, that was not possible. The problems begin to outweigh everything else.<br /><br />And the last act of the film just deteriorates. And manages to get Judd naked, so we can see her nude.<br /><br />"Bug" is an interesting and well-made exploration of the two main characters. But once things start to fall apart, we realize how tenuous the connections were to begin with. And everything falls apart. Completely.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>I have a theory... If you can think up a conspiracy, it probably already exist in some form. Bug pushes that to the extreme in detailing the popular conspiracies of the modern world. Bildebergs, Tuskegee, Tim McVeigh, Gulf War Syndrome,  AIDS etc.<br /><br />It is a psycho-drama that just gradually fades into a mental health tragedy that is more of a downer than a lesson in life.

Bug is more of an alarming psychological journey into the human mind, an intense exploration of a broken soul.  It's closer to the films Beautiful Mind and Conspiracy Theory than something like Aliens or The Fly.  Director William Freidkin opens the crazy door and dares you to step inside.<br /><br />The acting and character development in this movie is outstanding.  Ashley Judd gives the performance of her lifetime as Agnes, an emotionally battered waitress who is hanging on by a thread.  She has a trainwreck of a past, from her abusive ex-husband to her missing child.<br /><br />She meets a mysterious loner named Peter, and he might offer a hand toward gaining some mental stability.  Or he might push them both over the edge.  We quickly realize it's most likely the latter, as this romance doesn't take long to unravel.  Peter is a war veteran, and claims to be the victim of some extreme government experimentations.  His military leaders apparently planted "bugs" under his skin.  This may or may not be true, but one thing is for sure--his inner demons are about to come crawling out.<br /><br />Freidkin unleashes a totally original and riveting psychological drama.  The symptoms of this story frantically spread and feed off your mind in frightening fashion.  A psychotically sick tale that plagues you with themes of loneliness, desperation, and mental instability.  Plus it lightly touches on notions of government control and the devastating effects of war.  Such a great film, one that might come off as ridiculous to some as it blazes an unfamiliar path.  But for open-minded movie watchers ready to be challenged, this is must-see stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />Based directly on the stage play by the same name, BUG will most certainly get under your skin.

Agnes is damaged goods to begin with; a woman who's lost her only child to a kidnapping and drowns herself in liquor and cocaine. And when she meets Peter, she believes she may have found someone to connect with other than her abusive ex-husband Jerry (Harry Connick Jr., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009M9BK">The Iron Giant</a>). But Peter brings with him his own unique brand of psychological luggage. A battered U.S. veteran who possibly was exposed to torture, Peter begins showing cracks in his psyche soon after their first romantic encounter. He claims that bugs are in the room with them. Then the bugs are in him. Then in her. Then everywhere and involving everyone. The paranoia reaches a crescendo that culminates in the death of someone trying to help Peter and Agnes, and the eventual destruction of everything around them.<br /><br />First let's be clear what we're talking about here. There are no bugs. We, the audience, don't see a single flea. The bugs are internalized as demonic aphids implanted in Peter (Shannon) by military higher-ups. As Peter's paranoia builds, he brings Agnes right along with him, and it's a painful and frightening thing to watch. Initially having hopes that the two might be able to help one another, the story rapidly gives way to the psychological horrors of what happens when mentally damaged people feed off one another like ...well ...like bugs.<br /><br />Second is that the story, too, is completely internalized, both character-wise and on the set. The entire production basically takes place in one room: Agnes' rundown hotel room in the middle of nowheresville. Don't expect panoramic shots of beautiful locales.<br /><br />Third is that this story is exceptionally dark. There are no good and bad people, per se. Agnes' abusive ex is initially seen as a no good A-hole but later becomes a beacon of hope for survival. Even a psychologist who comes in to try and help Peter is damaged in that he's hooked on cocaine himself and seems only passively interested in telling the truth.<br /><br />For horror fans, this one's going to disappoint. But if you're a psych major or interested in paranoid delusions and how far down those people can sink, Bug will crawl right up your alley.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>William Friedkin returns with a vengeance in this highly disturbing tale of mental illness, self-mutilation, depravity, and isolation.<br /><br />The story is deceptively simple in that Ashley Judd, who still looks beautiful no matter how sickly she's made up, plays an isolated, abused and tortured woman who has a history for making awful decisions and eventually makes one too many when she hooks up with a paranoid stranger who is at first shy, tender, and compassionate, but quickly becomes as domineering as Judd's criminal ex-husband who is very well played by Harry Connick, Jr. As I said, this is a deceptively simple tale, because nothing is as it seems in this incredibly violent and disturbing film.<br /><br />Things very quickly spiral out of control with both Judd's character and the mysterious stranger believing that the government has arranged their relationship in order to produce some super bugs.  This, ironically, appeals to Judd's character who has been seeking, in her own way, some relevance in a world that has ignored her pain.  It oddly gives her a sense of importance and a reason to hate those around her who have either pointed a judgmental finger at her for literally losing her son (which could happen to anyone) or have done little to help her out of her miserable life (even though she created some of her own misery).<br /><br />Judd's character is both an in-depth, evolving character and a stereotype of a crack-smoking waitress with no ambition in life other than to wallow in self-pity, hang with the wrong crowd and then wonder why her life is so screwed up.  This is a tragically multi-layered character and performance.  Judd deserves an Oscar nomination as she portrays both a pathetic lost soul who has done little to improve her life and someone we feel great compassion for regardless of her shortcomings.  She has created a character that we want to hit with a 2 x 4 in the head one moment, and cradle in our arms and comfort the next.  In a year where many have complained of few good women roles, I can't help but wonder why this performance has gone relatively unnoticed.<br /><br />Shannon, as the mentally ill stranger, is very good in his role too, but he, ironically, is the less interesting of this essentially two-character film.  I found his twitches and mumblings are all too stereotypical of this kind of part.  I found very little real depth to him at all and he, sadly, evokes very little sympathy for the sick man that he is.  I wanted to feel more for him, but simply couldn't.  Perhaps that was intentionally done by the playwright as, in reality, mentally ill people, sadly, annoy us more than touch us.  It is the disability for which we can't readily assist someone; therefore, we often look the other way.  It is not the same as trying to assist someone deaf, blind, or wheelchair restricted.  We can't simply open a door for them.  Mental illness is the often ignored disability because it makes us uncomfortable to be around such individuals.  We only pay attention after the violence happens that is sometimes associated with the kind of severe mental illness depicted in this film, and only then do we cry out, "Why didn't someone help this man."<br /><br />This is a film that definitely will not appeal to the masses.  It is both character and story driven, but it's claustrophobic, violent, surreal, sad, pathetic, and just down right depressing.  I can't say that I felt the bugs like many reviewers on here have said as I never accepted them as there in the first place, but the sad life of Judd's character lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.  William (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist</a>) Friedkin continues to prove his mettle as a director with this latest nightmare vision that he has brought to the screen</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I have a feeling that I may break down in tears during this years Oscar nominations ceremony, for as much as I'd love to have faith in the Academy to `do the right thing' I strongly feel that Ashley Judd's brilliant performance is going to ultimately get the snub.  To say that she doesn't deserve the win let alone the nomination is to not have really seen this film for all that it truly is.  Ashley Judd's performance is her career best, a desperate and broken spirit that permeates the entire film and haunts the viewer more than anything else pertaining to this film.  In fact, the most disturbing thing about `Bug' is the fact that it will most likely receive little to no awards attention.  I'm getting chills just thinking about it.<br /><br />I think the first thing anyone needs to know about `Bug' is that it is not, and I mean `NOT' a horror film in the essence that it is jumpy and intense and consistently frightening but it is in it's own way jumpy and intense and consistently frightening.  `Bug' is a film about the darkest corners of the human mind and the fact that we will allow ourselves to believe anything if it completes a part of our soul.  I feel that this film suffered from misleading advertisement that painted it as this horrifically scary film when it is in most regards a slow moving physiological drama.  There are lots of scenes of pure communication as we watch these peoples minds gradually deteriorate into the hopeless paranoia they find themselves engulfed in.  In fact the bulk of the gore in the film is self inflicted, the majority taking place off screen.<br /><br />Based on the play by Tracy Letts, `Bug' follows the lonely Agnes White who is in hiding from her abusive ex-husband Jerry.  Jerry has just been released from prison and is planning on taking back up where he left off with Agnes, but she isn't having that.  Instead she's moved on to another man, the mysterious and reclusive Peter.  Agnes and Peter lock themselves away in a small motel room and it's there that they slowly go insane.  Peter, a war veteran, has already lost most of it.  He is convinced that the government is after him, that they conducted experiments on him and that they planted bugs under his skin.  Before long Agnes's own loneliness and desperation lead her to believe him and she soon begins to see the bugs that are not really there.<br /><br />The film rarely leaves the confines of the motel room and this aids in the feeling of claustrophobia.  I remember feeling this way when I watched last years `The Descent', that feeling of breathless anxiety.  Although the viewer never sees a single insect there are moments when you can swear they are everywhere.  This is thanks in large part to the commanding direction by William Friedkin who completely understands the objective of his subject and exploits it beautifully.<br /><br />To me the bugs are clearly a metaphor for the `bugs' or `kinks' in the human mind.  These two people are sick.  Their minds do not function properly.  They haven't had the `bugs' worked out so-to-speak and thus suffer from delusions and serious deficiencies that those around them cannot understand.  The scary thing about `Bug' is that this is not really an exaggeration of these issues.  These types of things happen more frequently then one would think.  The human mind is no where near as full proof as one might like to think and truly anyone is susceptible to the downward spiral of insanity.  The worst part about it all is that one never knows they are insane.<br /><br />Ashley Judd gives, for me at least, the finest performance of anyone in any category so far this year.  Her grasp of Agnes is brutally convincing and extremely sympathetic.  Like a child she defends the man she feels connected to, the only man who's given her the kind of attention's she's longed for.  Her slip into paranoia is painfully heart breaking to watch to the point that I was moved to tears especially in the final scenes.  Her facial expression as her whole world incinerates before her is enough to make my heart break into a thousand pieces.  If there is a god then Ashley Judd's name will be called proceeded by "and the Oscar goes to" come March (or whenever the Oscar's are held this coming year).<br /><br />The other performances in the film are decently entertaining, with the exception of Harry Connick Jr. who is surprisingly outstanding.  I am not a fan of Harry and I was not looking forward to him being in this film but I was floored to find myself loving his performance.  He was comical, aggressive, charismatic and believable.  I would also consider his name in the supporting actor category AMPA's, seriously.  I was less impressed with Michael Shannon who reprised his stage role as Peter Evans.  His performance was not bad but it failed to deliver any real spark.  Judd was just so impressive and Connick Jr. was just so commanding that Shannon seemed to fall to the background for me even though he was in just about every frame.  Lynn Collins was wonderful as R.C. and would have been even better had she possessed a little more screen time.  What she does with what she's given is very impressive.<br /><br />If you're looking for a film that will scare the pants off you in a general gore filled heart racing kind of way then this is not the film you want to pick up, but if you want to be slowly driven to the brink of insanity by watching the lives of two people slowly unravel then this is the movie for you.  In fact, I think it's even more horrifying to watch something this tragically real then to embrace something that is completely fictitious and ultimately unbelievable.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Agnes White (Ashley Judd) is a shattered wreck of a human being. She is a drug-addicted alcoholic w/ absolutely nothing on the horizon to interupt her slow self-annihilation. Agnes lost her 6yo son in a grocery store 10 years ago, and most of her soul appears to have disappeared with him. Now, she drifts through her half-life, waking just long enough to drain another bottle of oblivion-inducer, or fire up another bowl of extreme pain-reliever. Enter Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), a nice, quiet young man who captures Agnes' devastated heart almost immediately. It's love at first sight, or something like that. Meanwhile, Agnes' total loser of an ex-con / ex-husband, Goss (Harry Connick, jr.) begins creeping around, threatening to move in on Agnes to help her to re-live the bad old days of his violence and control. Peter represents paradise by contrast. All seems fine until soon after Agnes and Peter consumate their relationship. Peter finds a small insect in the bed. Agnes can't see it, but Peter is very convincing! This leads to a downwardly spiralling binge of paranoid conspiracy theories, delusions, self-mutilation, and murder. These are two sick people. Two disturbed minds that have found their match. Two empty souls that have gravitated toward each other's deadness in a hopeless attempt at fulfillment. This is insanity squared, as the two become one shrill voice of un-reason. This can only end one way, and... it does... BUG is a tale of terror with the most hideous psychological monsters unleashed. William Friedkin has captured schizophrenia on film. He's shown what true "demonic" possession is all about, and it ain't pretty...</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>William Friedkin's "Bug" is the kind of psychological thriller that doesn't rely on plausibility so much as it relies on solid character studies. This isn't to say that the film is implausible; truth be told, I don't think there's any way of knowing how realistic such situations are. But considering the disturbing intensity of the story and the strong dynamic between actors Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, it's difficult to embrace these technicalities. This is easily one of the most unsettling films in recent memory, forcing the audience down an unpleasant path of paranoia that spirals out of control in a relatively short period of time. The film refuses to be a clear-cut study of insanity; there's a subtle brilliance to the way Friedkin explores uncertainty and panic, as if to say that we're not meant to have all the answers.<br /><br />Nor should we. What is obvious is that, from the average person's point of view, every behavior in this film is overwhelmingly irrational. We get a small taste of this with the introduction of Agnes White (Judd), a divorcee living in a motel somewhere in the middle of Oklahoma. The first scene is of her receiving mysterious phone calls, in which the person at the other end says absolutely nothing. Already, she assumes that it's her violent, controlling ex-husband, Jerry Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), recently released from prison on parole. Indeed, it does seem likely that he's making the calls. But does she know for sure? How can she know? How can the audience know? Even when he reenters her life later on in the film, it's impossible to come to any conclusions. It could be that Agnes is allowing her fear to take hold. The fact that she's incredibly lonely only adds to her erratic emotional state.<br /><br />Then along comes Peter Evans (Shannon), an initially soft-spoken man with an underlying uneasiness that effectively makes us uncomfortable. He's a drifter with a hidden past who occasionally lets loose his expanded vocabulary (Agnes is initially confused by the word "matriarchal"). He makes it clear that he's not really interested in a sexual relationship (not at first, anyway); he merely wants to be friends. From the audience's perspective, everything about this situation is off; here are two fragile individuals looking for companionship under less than ideal circumstances. Is it any wonder that Agnes' willingness to take him in is unnerving? It doesn't help that she listens to him carefully, even when he begins spewing information about tiny bugs he thinks are infesting his bloodstream. In some sick way, it's as if he's telling her what she wants to hear.<br /><br />The rest of the film veers into territory ruled purely by paranoia, the tension building itself until it becomes unbearably thick. Peter eventually reveals that he's an AWOL military officer; he believes that a faction of the government has injected him with thousands of microscopic aphids that have the ability to transmit information. He's now on the run from Dr. Sweet (Brian F. O'Byrne), the man responsible for conducting the experiments. Not only is he able to convince Agnes of this, he also makes her believe that she has now become infested. While we don't see any bugs, they believe that they're seeing them everywhere, especially on their skin. Supposedly, they can burrow through the skin back into the bloodstream; this forces Peter and Agnes to incessantly swat, scratch, and pick at themselves. Eventually, their bodies are covered with open sores.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Agnes' room transforms into a bizarre kind of shelter; bug zappers and flypaper hang from the ceiling, while every other surface is coated in aluminum foil (it helps to block the bugs' transmissions). How they went about this doesn't matter. The plot was never interested in focusing on logistics, and rightfully so. We're now fully immersed in the delusional world of two people who were made for each other, a world in which nonsensical ramblings make perfect sense. The last ten minutes of the film have both Judd and Shannon delivering high-intensity speeches that almost come off as poetic in a twisted sort of way; their words point to an explanation only they can understand, and in turn offer a solution that only they see as appropriate. How the audience feels is of no concern, and that's exactly the way it should be. When both Peter and Agnes look into a microscope holding a drop of Peter's blood, the sense that they're seeing what they want to see allows us to emotionally detach from the characters and let them continue to unravel.<br /><br />During the end credits, I learned that "Bug" originated as a play written by Tracy Letts (who also penned the screenplay). I then left the theater wondering how this ever could have been performed on a stage, not because of the sets or the story, but because of the sheer intensity; it's difficult to imagine a live audience sitting through something so disturbing. However, if this film adaptation is any indication, then the play must have something truly unique, a fascinating work that delves into insanity with amazing precision and style. But until I actually see it, then my praise can apply only to the film. But what a film it is.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Ashley's son was kidnapped in a grocery store, her slimey ex still blames her.  She's working at a bar and one nite her and a friend give a strange man a ride.  She lets the stranger stay on her couch, she has a soft spot for him, maybe a substitute for her missing son? He's a soldier that has gone awol.  He is very intelligent, and a lot of things he says actually make sense, however, he also could be very dangerously insane.  The bugs he see's everywhere, did the military implant them in his body? She starts seeing them or maybe she just wants to please him so he won't leave her, she's pretending she see's them. It's up to the viewer, where the bugs real?  was the couple insane?  was he insane and just took her along for the ride? The performances were excellent, the two main characters played off each other well. This movie is not for the squeamish, so be warned.  Very, very intense.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Having caught "Bug" during its short theatrical run, I found it one of the strangest curiosities to have come from Hollywood in quite some time.  While you may loathe its lunacy or love its originality, there is no question the film was poorly handled by the studios.  Marketed as a horror film ("by the director of `The Exorcist'"), the advertising campaign completely misrepresented the film.  In fact, it continues to do so--just look at the DVD artwork.  At best, you could call "Bug" a psychological horror movie--but it's really a studied descent into madness.  The film was widely distributed to a mass audience instead of being cultivated on the arthouse circuit, which is another unusual choice for a film of this type.  So when average filmgoers went to "Bug" expecting a scary date movie, they got something decidedly more unpleasant (but arguably more interesting).<br /><br />So let's be honest--you will either love and respect "Bug" or you will absolutely hate it.  The film really doesn't have a middle ground.  But, to me, that's part of its appeal.  I like films to take chances--and, for all its faults, "Bug" is genuinely unsettling.  I found myself profoundly disturbed and thinking about this film for days after I'd seen it.  It elicited, from me, some of the same reactions and emotions that I had upon the initial viewing of David Cronenberg's masterpiece "Dead Ringers."  While I won't contend that "Bug" is in the same league as that film, just the comparison is a huge honor in my book.<br /><br />The story of "Bug" revolves around Ashley Judd as a small town waitress living in a desolate motel.  Remote, lonely, and contending with an abusive relationship past--Judd is an interesting blend of fragility and bravado.  When a stranger, played by Michael Shannon, enters the picture, the two form an oddly codependent existence.  At first, this unorthodox couple seems to gain strength from one another--but as Shannon's true psychosis is revealed, things head south.  The motel room becomes a cocoon against the outside world and reality starts to unravel.  We become more and more disconnected from what is real and what is delusional.  And as the film progresses, the madness accelerates in an almost operatic way.<br /><br />The film makes bold choices and not everything works--but with conventional fare always taking the "safe" route, I'm not going to fault "Bug" for its outrageousness.  Shannon is terrific and Judd commands the screen.  They delve so deeply into these twisted personalities, it's hard not to be awed by their commitment.  I credit Judd--she's a great actress--I like to see her take chances and make interesting choices.<br /><br />If you want a scary movie, don't buy "Bug."  It's that simple.  If you want to try something more adventurous, this might be for you.  "Bug" got under my skin.  It's ambitious, complicated, messy, overwrought, and intriguing in every way.  If that sounds like a compliment (which I meant it as), then give the film a look.  KGHarris, 09/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I picked up this DVD casually, not knowing anything about what a distinguished career this material had as an award-winning stage play. I just grabbed it thinking it might be a sci-fi thriller to pass a few hours with. It is labeled as a "thriller," - but it's not sci-fi, and actually, it's not a "thriller" either. That label is a misnomer. This is an intense psychological drama about obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br /><br />It's an unflinching portrayal of a couple's descent into madness. Or is it? You may not be absolutely certain, because there are a few suggestions along the way that the couple's paranoia - their conviction that bugs have been implanted in them, that Government agents are experimenting on them - may not be total hallucination. But assuming the couple is suffering from genuine delusions, their imaginings spiral them down into shocking, brutal alienation.<br /><br />Their relationship seems to start innocently enough. The drifter Ashley Judd meets seems to be the polar opposite of the abusive husband she's been trying to get out of her life. This new man is strangely gentle and literate. But then he starts to see tiny bugs infesting the dingy motel room where they now live together. And soon she sees the bugs too.<br /><br />Some psychologists such as Erich Fromm have written about how most of us end up acceding to the particular insanity of our respective societies as the inevitable price of being accepted as a group member. Here Ashley Judd is all too ready to buy into her new boyfriend's delusions because she has been lonely and his companionship is a lifeline. But what a price she pays.<br /><br />Director William Friedkin' tends to be a little droning and pretentious in his commentary. He laces his remarks with references to Proust's stream of consciousness, and to Cleckley's ideas about "the mask of sanity" that we all wear. He uses neologisms he doesn't seem to be aware aren't legitimate words. For example, he several times refers to the boyfriend's imaginings as being "insiduous," perhaps a clutch after some high-flown meaning half-way between "insidious" and "assiduous." Still, most of his comments are intelligent. He points out the many layers of meaning that the title "Bug" has here - from a sense of the literal insects the couple believes are bedeviling them - to a sense of being "bugged," spied on, kept under surveillance - to a sense of being pervasively infected.<br /><br />Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick act out all these levels of meaning brilliantly. Obsessive-compulsive disorder of this magnitude is rarely tackled on film because such inner turmoil is difficult to make cinematic. But Friedkin and the cast truly succeed in making this movie visually and emotionally arresting. The only other film that comes to mind as being comparable to it is Roman Polanski's classic "Repulsion," which you might want to check out if you still have the energy after this grueling, but fascinating, expedition to extremity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>if you like films such as OPEN WATER and HARD CANDY and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as well as smart hardcore horror films , this is probably for you . i'm certain actors relish roles like these . if the above sort of picture is not your cup of tea , you're probably going to dislike this film quite a bit i'd think . some people like much of their film veiwing to really challenge and shock them . count me in .</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>In hindsight, the viewer can tell that "Bug" is about much more than invading insects, rampant mental illness and broken lives, or government propaganda, though all three themes are crucial: it is a stern reminder of the power suggestion has over human vulnerability.<br /><br />Ashley Judd plays Agnes, a woman with an impoverished, lonely life resembling a train wreck. From the beginning of the film it's obvious that her loneliness is so intense that even a disaster would be welcome--any disaster save the one she already has to deal with, her vicious ex boyfriend Jerry played by Harry Connick Jr.  He does a very good job playing Southern scum, so much so that there are times you want to take his character by the throat.  Still, though, in the diseased house of cards that this movie comprises he may be one of the only people in Agnes' life who could have prevented the horrific, unforgettable ending.<br />Her gorgeous former lesbian lover R.C., played by Lynn Collins, departs way too quickly to make a difference.<br /><br />But to her credit, she is one who introduces Agnes to Peter, a really, really odd hitchhiker--maybe--who somehow ends up in her social circle.<br />Michael Shannon here gives the best performance as an extremely paranoid schizophrenic that I have ever seen.  At first calm, somewhat rational, mixing his self-tormenting delusions with the truth, there's not one scene with him in it that does not reek of potential danger.  His peculiar fondness for insect theory (which ends up extending to his supposed experiences in the Gulf War, which ends up extending to government experiments on veternans, which ends up extending to Agnes' smoke detector, the motel room itself, and then ultimately Agnes' lost child)  actually seem very believable when you watch the actor recite his lines.<br /><br />What takes place in the last 30 minutes of this movie is an unrelenting, Dionysian rush of psychological horror so intense that it is actually hard to watch--Peter does some dental work on himself in order to block the invasion of the "bugs" and it is one of the most brutal scenes I have ever witnessed on film (probably because it takes place so abruptly.)<br /><br />William Friedkin shows once again that he is a hungry talent to be reckoned with; his films always remind us that we can never quite know what goes on, not with absolute certitude, and that some of the most<br />momentous events leave us not with truth but with more questions.  This is a must see for anyone with a taste for great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>There are mainly three reasons to go to see a movie:  catharsis, entertainment, and enlightenment.  For William Friedkin's `Bug,' we enter mostly for fascination or shock value.  The film is unforgettable.  Mostly the characters, the actions, and atmosphere leave the audience with indelible impressions long after the movie's credits roll.<br /><br />Not a pleasant affair, the movie opens up with a helicopter zeroing in on a town in Oklahoma.  At a hotel room, a cocktail waitress, Agnes (Ashley Judd) , is drinking heavily alone while she receives incessant, unwanted phone calls from someone who won't answer.  She addresses the call to Jerry, her estranged husband who has been let out of prison after a two year sentence.  Her existence seems tight and oppressive, and the camera keeps going to the central air that kicks in periodically and a ceiling fan seen from a close, dizzying angle.  We are constantly reminded of the oppressive heat.  Shortly, we hook up at the honky tonk bar where she works with fellow waitress, R.C., whom we discover is her lover as well.  R.C. makes two company at the apartment, but she brings a guest from the panhandle of Oklahoma.  Nervous, yet friendly, Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) seems so shy and apologetic, he couldn't hurt a fly.  Somehow he has left an army hospital, but has no where to stay.  In the meantime, Jerry (Harry Connick, Jr.),  her -ex, returns to her for an unbearable homecoming and reciprocates her cold reception with hot menace.  Yet, for Jerry, Peter is the unwelcome find.  Peter, nevertheless, provides Jerry with the perfect, cowering victim.  From here Agnes finds her new guest a respite from all her indignities.  His gentleness is a counterpart for male abuse.<br /><br />Peter, on the other hand, has problems of his own.  During one bedroom scene, the lights come on, and he is fixated on a bug.  What starts as a small "aphid" becomes an obsession.  The camera zeroes in on the lighted sheets for a small bug Agnes at first can't see.  From a bed search comes a whole investigation, complete with his own blood samples examined under a microscope.  As scenes unfold we see the vulnerability of Agnes as she falls into the vortex of all the madness:  her domineering -ex and the unhinging paranoia of her new lover.<br /><br />`Bug' is unforgettable.  With excellent, intense acting we get a cross-section of madness with clinical precision.  William Friedkin (of `The Exorcist' and `The French Connection' fame) gets it right with all the disturbing details.  Working from a powerful play by Tracy Letts, we get a remarkably different cinematic offering with a resolution few will ever forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'Bug' will not appeal to everyone, but for those of you who like intense and brave acting mixed with interesting, but disturbing images, will find this film a GEM!

It's a strong film that will stay with you long after the credits roll!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>"I make people nervous," says Peter Evans.<br />"Why's that?" Aggie White asks.<br />"'Cause I pick up on things, I think. It makes people uncomfortable."<br />"Pick up on things?"<br />"Things not apparent," Peter says.<br /><br />With that, William Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, working from Letts' play, put us in the middle of an intense and controlled descent into madness. Bug may be a one-theme movie placed almost exclusively in a small, two room set, but thanks to Friedkin, Michael Shannon as Peter Evans and Ashley Judd as Agnes White, it will not only give you the creeps, it'll make you appreciate some fine movie making.<br /><br />Aggie is one of life's losers, worn, dumb, lonely and passive, with a smoker's voice, a four-letter vocabulary and an abusive ex-husband who is just out of the slammer. She has a loss-leader job as a waitress in a honky tonk lesbian bar. Aggie is attractive in a white trash way, and she looks every one of Ashley Judd's 38 years. She lives in a crappy motel in some desolate part of Oklahoma just off the highway. Peter Evans is a quiet loner who was picked up by Aggie's lesbian best friend on the way to a party. He is polite and has no place to stay. Aggie is lonely and offers her couch for him to sleep on. He doesn't want sex. There is a need in both of them that makes a terrible connection.<br /><br />Peter believes in things he knows are true...the machines...the people watching...that nothing will ever be the same. And then there are the insects he finds in the bed sheets, little ones, perhaps a bedbug, or a spider. "If there's one, do you have any reason to suspect there's more of him?" Aggie asks. "Makes sense," Peter says with complete seriousness. "You're assuming it's a him, some rogue aphid on his travels instead of some matriarchal type with a big brood somewhere...Ever watch `Big Valley'? Barbara Stanwyck? Like her." The way Michael Shannon delivers the line, it's not funny.<br /><br />Aggie is needy and lonely enough to believe. Separately, she probably would have become an over-weight, sloppy alcoholic, waiting on tables in crummy diners. Peter is a schizophrenic paranoid. Separately, he would have wound up drugged to his eyeballs in a public health facility for a week or two, then sent back out to the streets. Together, they feed on each other. Peter knows the federal government has used genetically engineered coke bugs as a component in the poison sprays used to destroy South American cocaine fields. The bugs will survive the drug processing and then attack and kill American coke uses. He can see the bugs infesting the motel room. They're microscopic and have entered his blood stream. Aggie now can see them, too. Reality and delusion have joined. The last half hour is grotesque and violent, with their two rooms sheathed in aluminum foil, scrunched and squeezed to cover every window frame, ceiling, floor and wall. The paranoia is in full, deadly blossom. The conclusion is what we've been led up to.<br /><br />All this could be ludicrous, even with Tracy Letts' fine screenplay. That it isn't is due to Friedkin, Shannon and Judd. Friedkin, within a confined space, manages to keep a sense movement going, with madness, claustrophobia and tension moving right up the scale. More than anything else, however, the movie works because of the two actors. There are only three other significant roles in the movie and they are well handled, especially by Harry Connick, Jr. as the abusive sleaze of an ex-husband. But it is Shannon and Judd who make this movie work. They each start off in a low-key, gradually letting us get to know their characters and building sympathy for them. His madness and her desire to have someone to believe in are delivered with increasing intensity that never, in my opinion, lurches into indulgent over-acting. That's a rare thing in American movies nowadays. It was particularly fine to see this in Ashley Judd. She started out so well in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMCBI2">Ruby in Paradise</a>, then seemed to lose her way in a number of big budget Hollywood hokums. Now 40, she's reached a time when there are a lot of younger, nubile actresses just aching to play stylish vampire hunters or glamorous government agents. I hope that she finally has decided to be an actress, not just another Hollywood star flavor of the year.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is first-rate. Extras include a commentary by Friedkin, an on-camera interview with him and a behind the scenes look at the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Agnes is living in a dingy motel room.  Her ex has just gotten out of prison.  Her boy went missing years ago.  She is lonely...until she hooks up with Peter, a shy and charming drifter.  But Peter isn't exactly what he seems...for he is convinced that there are bugs crawling through his veins, feasting on his blood.  And what's more: he's convinced Agnes has them, too...<br /><br />"Bug" isn't easy to watch for a number of reasons.  One: the acting is so realistic, so intense, it's hard to think of it as a movie.  Ashley Judd is a phenomenon here; Michael Shannon matches her step-for-step.  Harry Connick Jr., as Agnes's sadistic ex, is an utter thrill.  The cast is small--these three carry the film for most of its length--and the setting is small: most of the movie takes place in a motel room, the last few scenes featuring a motel room with walls papered in aluminum foil.<br /><br />Another reason "Bug" isn't wasy to watch is...well, bugs.  Let's face it, they make most of us squeemish...though you don't actually see any bugs in this film, which leads us to my next reason: This movie leaves a lot of open questions.  Are they real?  Is it all in their heads?  This is true psychological horror--it scares you, but you're not sure how.  It's psychological horror with a very physical bent; the scene where Peter rips out his tooth is absolutely horrifying.  "Bug" isn't perfect, but it's certainly one of the best horror movies to come out in a while, and it's a fine return to the genre for directer William Friedkin, who blessed us all with "The Exorcist."  Watch this movie only if you like your horror realistic, creepy...and genuinely frightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is a pretty dark and disturbing movie.  It is basically one man's descent into paranoid madness and how he brings a woman into his crazy world.  This movie based on a strange stage play often times comes across as a play.  Most of the movie takes place in the woman's hotel room.  The actors are good with the parts.  Harry Connick is very creepy as the sleazy ex-con.  His best bad guy role since Copycat.  I was really hoping for a big twist at the end to make the hour and a half of watching two people go crazy worth the view.  Sadly it didn't happen and I feel a bit cheated.  It is a well made film with good acting, it just left me a bit cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Director William Friedkin has made many films that have found a way to get under your skin in his illustrious career, most memorably "The Exorcist". And while that movie blatantly rocked your senses his newest film "Bug" does so in much more subtle ways.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Agnes White (Ashley Judge), a woman living in a convenience motel in a nowhere town in Oklahoma. Her life consists of working in a lesbian bar and dreading the calls from her ex husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.), a man who abused her that who she fears and who has recently been paroled.<br /><br />One night a friend of Agnes introduces her to Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) and things are never the same. Peter is a quiet, odd sort who finds refuge in Agnes' room. Eventually he finds it in her arms as well. The two misfits find themselves attracted and things could turn out fine with the exception of one fact: bugs.<br /><br />Peter begins to find them everywhere, microscopic bugs that he claims the government inserted into him as a guinea pig. Is this man insane or a part of some major conspiracy?<br /><br />From there we are drawn into a world where two people find themselves ruled by the concept of these "bugs". And as a battered woman who thinks she has found love begins to become convinced that what he says is true, Agnes is attacked by the same bugs. Until the last scene we never know for sure they exist or not.<br /><br />The movie offers a number of disturbing scenes, one of which is graphically violent. But perhaps more disturbing is the sense of paranoia and the possibility of Agnes' being brainwashed as opposed to there actually being bugs. Her willingness to believe becomes a centerpiece for the film.<br /><br />While the movie may not be for everyone nor invite multiple viewings, it does offer some great performances from the entire cast and a compelling story that makes you want to watch till the finish. This one may not be one to add to your collection, but it is one that you will want to add to your viewing list.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Bug (William Friedkin, 2006)<br /><br />William Friedkin has, rather quietly since the early eighties, crafted himself a career as one of American film's finest auteurs. Yeah, there have been some horrible, horrible missteps along the way (anyone remember Jade?), but a lot of movies that were castigated in the media seemed to me to be a whole lot better than people were making them out to be (anyone remember Rules of Engagement or the remake of 12 Angry Men?) Whatever the reason, a guy who pretty much ruled the roost in the seventies has sunk into such obscurity that his latest film, Bug, played on only 1,661 screens at the peak of its theatrical exposure. (Contrast this to the 4,362 screens on which Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End played the same weekend.) It is, at least, some consolation that long after Gore Verbinski's career is a footnote at best in film almanacs, William Friedkin's greatest films will still be available on holodisc or whatever they watch movies on that far in the future. Bug, in my opinion, will be one of them, on a par with The Exoricst and The French Connection.<br /><br />It shares a lot with those two movies, actually, under its surface. On top, they couldn't be more different; Bug is a somewhat ribald, if creepy, tale about Agnes (Ashley Judd), a waitress whose friend sets her up with Peter (Michael Shannon, who cut his indie teeth in The Woodman and Deadbirds, among others), a drifter who seems like a very welcome change from Agnes' abusive ex-husband Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), who's just gotten out of prison and is sure to be sniffing around soon. Agnes and Peter, both lost souls in the desolate armpit of an uncaring world, find themselves drawn to one another, but things get complicated with the arrival of minuscule, carnivorous, and very hungry bugs.<br /><br />I spent the first half of this movie wondering what all the fuss was about. Then the three-quarters of what was left. I mean, I enjoyed it well enough; Harry Connick Jr. showed us in Copycat that he makes a mean, twisted bad guy, and he does it here just as well, while Shannon and Judd are their usual excellent selves. Friedkin's direction is spot-on, and I get the feeling that the pace, which often feels as if it's far too slow, is absolutely deliberate. For whatever the trailers may be telling you, Bug is not a horror movie. Bug is about tension, paranoia, drama. It will take you a while to realize what Friedkin and scriptwriter Tracy Letts (adapted from his own play) are doing with this; the movie explodes, the evil machinations of the people behind the scenes blindside you, and you really have no recourse but to say "holy crap." Friedkin and Letts have pulled a fast one on us, and the sucker-punch at the end is just fantastic.<br /><br />None of this should be new to Friedkin fans. The Exorcist is two hours of buildup with a rather stock mystery plot before we get to see any classic cinema. The French Connection is notorious for the slowness of its first half. What do you think would attract a director like Friedkin to a remake of 12 Angry Men? This is a guy who likes to spend a whole lot of time setting things up in precise ways so that he can come barrelling out of nowhere with a freight train when you're least expecting it. And Bug is Friedkin's strongest showing in this arena in over three decades; it may, in fact, even be better structured than The Exorcist. The only thing that's missing is the late and very much lamented Jason Miller. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I can't decide whether to rate this movie a 3 or a 2. Bug is the film version of a stage play - basically a two character psychological drama about the lethal combination of paranoia and loneliness. Ashley Judd plays a lonely bartender, divorced from a violent convict, living in a flop-house motel in the middle of some white trash desert hell, she's surviving without companionship or prospects and abusing any recreational substance she can acquire. Through a concatenation of circumstances, she ends up hooking up with a shy, polite drifter. He quickly progresses from sleeping on her floor to joining her in bed, and in her hopeless desert he seems to be a movable oasis.<br /><br />Hmm, he's nice. But we got one slight problem....he's crazy.<br /><br />It's fundamentally just two people in a single hotel room getting crazier and crazier. Each moment of the film tries to make us squirm a bit more than the preceding one. The harrowing denouement resembles that of Requiem for a Dream, except that the catalyst is madness rather than heroin.<br /><br />In terms of commercial prospects ... well, as we say in Texas, this puppy was doomed from the get-go. It's the kind of movie where if it were done really poorly, people would hate it, and if it were done really well, people would hate it even more. Either way, it would provoke a lot of walk-outs and a lot of negative reactions. As it turns out, it is done quite well, but that just rachets up the ugliness of the viewing experience, and invites even higher levels of audience negativity. The script gradually increases the intensity of the characters' madness, which in turn amplifies the intensity of the audience's experience until the story explodes in a crescendo of destruction, as you might expect. (Not much room for a happy ending with this premise). Bug is effective enough at achieving its goal. Unfortunately, that goal basically consists of shocking us with deeper and deeper levels of dementia. I have to admit that the film did get under my skin, so to speak, and thoroughly creeped me out, so it's fair to say that the film is quite brilliant in its own way. If Edward Albee were a young man today, he might be exploring alienation with this sort of treatment rather than through "The Zoo Story". But brilliant or not, Bug represents a thoroughly depressing and unpleasant viewing experience, and that's not going to place this disc in the carts, and among the few who has purchased this disc, a high percentage will be pressing the eject button before the film ends.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>I saw Tracy Letts' play BUG on Broadway in 2004 and now the movie, and I must say that the film does an excellent job at conveying the extreme paranoid delusional episodes that the mentally ill experience.<br /><br />What starts off as a seemingly sweet off-kilter story about a struggling waitress names Agnes (Ashley Judd) and her love interest Peter (Michael Shannon, who played the same role in the Broadway play), veers rapidly down a winding road into the land of "what is real and what is not!"  Do they have bugs in their bloodstream? Agnes and Peter spiral downward into a dark and most bizarre world that borders between the comedic and the horrifically gruesome.Where the play could only allude to such things, director William Friedkin allows us to see and experience what Agnes and Peter honestly believe they see and feel! Just like the play, this film deliberatly places us between the world of paranoid delusion and what reality is (or at least you think it is) and never allows you to settle into either world comfortably! The film is an excellent brain-teaser and definitely geared to make the viewer think. It did so on Broadway and it still successfully does so here!<br /><br />The trailer for this film tends to make you believe that you will be seeing is a horror flick.You will and you won't!....such is the creepy-crawly world of the paranoid delusional!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>With so many horror movies lately that seem to assume it's tendency to stack the film to the nose with gore will scare audiences, it's kind of gratifying to finally watch a film that doesn't simply focus on it. Directed by William Friedkin who did possibly the best horror movie ever with the Exorcist as well as doing the French Connection, you're thinking Bug will be the same thing right? Not really. On first viewing, it's interesting if a little slow and hard to emotionally invest in characters and it might not have the same replay value again but it's a disturbing look into paranoia and is at least worth a watch.<br /><br />Agnes is a bar waitress in a small town who's trying to get out of the grip of her controlling, abusive ex Jerry. With her drug habit and a horrible event from her life, Aggie is not as open to meeting new people until her friend/lover R.C. brings home a stranger named Peter. Very unassuming with a quiet demeanor, Peter seems perfect for Aggie and they get together. But Peter has this problem with seeing bugs everywhere and Agnes gets drawn into it as well and the 2 become increasingly paranoid about being infested not only in the room but inside their own bodies.<br /><br />What sets Bug apart from films like Hostel and Saw is the film focuses mainly on the paranoia and delusions that the characters are facing with more violent elements being part of the characters rather than staging entire scenes around it. That said, it's a very slow moving film with characters talking...and talking a lot about bugs and it's more voyeuristic where we see characters become insane rather than understand or relate, we simply just watch. However, the film has somewhat of a cold feeling to it, as if the first viewing was enough so it might be hard to re-watch since we already know what the film was going to be and the tone it has.<br /><br />Inspired by a play, the film is as minimilist as it can get with less than 8 main speaking parts and one scene involving extras so the film doesn't have a narrative so to speak so it's mainly character-driven and luckily we have Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon to watch. Sane though lost, the 2 unravel and they become crazier by the minute when the bugs arrive (although it's funny it's the 5th film in a row I've seen of Judd where she disrobes). Also we have Harry Connick Jr. who plays Jerry who's good as that jerk women hate but he doesn't have much depth to him even though he turns out to be the sanest of the group.<br /><br />When I told a friend I rented the film, she said "that was a...weird movie." My thoughts exactly since at the end of it you were just kind of puzzled by what you saw even though there's nothing confusing. It's crazy, it's completely odd yet it's Bug. Go with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>For some reason, I love film adaptations of plays. The most effective ones involve two-four characters in one setting, such as WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF, TAPE, and OLEANNA. You can now add BUG to that list. Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick Jr all deliver excellent performances in this film.<br /><br />From the title (and the way in which it was marketed) you would think that this would be another cheap, disgusting horror film. You would be wrong in making that assumption. It is a horrifying tale of paranoia, and how contagious it can be. If that does not seem unsettling to you at all, then go ahead and watch the film. It is quite disturbing.<br /><br />There are a few moments where the acting is a bit stagy, but that did not bother me much. It's a good thing to see actor's working to the best of their abilities, and this film delivers three fine examples of that. Some loved this film, others hated it. Yes, it's one of THOSE films, but I recommend that if you have not seen it, give it a try...especially if you're a theatre and/or film buff.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Bug is a paranoid and tense story of a couples dissension into madness.  I would say it is similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion where we experience what the person is seeing and going through.  Ashley Judd gives her most vulnerable and powerful performance to date as Agnes White, a down on her luck bar waitress living in a Oklahoma Motel located off a highway.  She is tormented by phone calls from her abusive ex husband Jerry who just got paroled played effectively by Harry Connick Jr. Connick Jr plays Jerry as both witty, charismatic, and almost likable and also an intimidating abusive bully.  So, you can see where Judd's character would fall for him and also why she would hate and be afraid of him.<br /><br />One night after work a friend and co worker stops by to visit her and party a bit, she brings a guy she met recently by the name of Peter Evans played by Michael Shannon and yet again another great performance.  Peter takes a friendly liking to Judd's character and she to him, they are both very lonely and in need of companionship and are able to become very open and close in a short period of time.  Peter is an ex military vet that apparently went a.w.o.l because of experiments being done to him using his body as a guinea pig and infecting him with a contagion.  Peter believes they have infected him with some sort of bug and after an intimate night together between him and Judd they find bugs in the bed and so begins Peter's downward spiral into this horrific delusion of madness as he takes her with him.<br /><br />I found this to be a unique, interesting, and different story of madness with great performances all around.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>You'll be laughing at the wisecrack, deadpan humor between Agnes, (Ashley Judd), a cocaine snorting, booze guzzling bar waitress, living modestly with a hint of homespun ideals in a desert hole called The Rustic Motel, (picture a caricaturized Sheryl Crow with a beer ih her hand), and Peter, (Michael Shannon), a kind and homeless nerd she hooks up with who reveals a frightening smile of demented psychosis when you least want him to. Then you'll laugh, maybe inappropriately, as director William Friedkin turns, what burns steadily in the first half, as a tidy suspence thriller and evocative domestic drama, into a horrific assault on the senses, the way you would nervously laugh at Friedkin's "The Exorcist", when devil child Reagan informed you what your mother was doing in the afterlife. Not much happens in the first half, but danger lurks at every turn, and the involved drama of an abusive ex-husband returning home after a prison sentence, rivals the creeping suspense. "Bug" becomes a deliberately tacky and intellectual B-plus movie depicting helicopters and earthquakes bombarding a small motel (sort of), self inflicted body carvings, a dental root canal administered by the patient, and bedbugs the size of, well, bedbugs. Those nasty little bites can be maddening.<br /><br />It's a nightmarish diversion of fear and paranoia in modern culture. Not quite big enough to rival "The Exorcist", or cheap enough to be what you might expect from a horror film called "Bug". It's somewhere in between, playing out very much like the theatrical psychological drama, "Bug", by Tracey Lettes, it is based on. If the screenplay didn't include high-minded ideals, and topical horrific references, (many may see Iraq in all this), you would indeed have a horror film called "Bug". But when psyched-out bugman, Peter, covered in fresh gaping wounds, and tiny bug bites, screams The Jonestown Massacre was a cover-up administered by governing bodies, you momentarily think seriously about it. The film also offers a gripping performance by Ashley Judd, whose sad weary waitress begs for redemption, as she is surely on her way to meeting up with that big can of Raid.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I heard nothing but bad things about this movie by a few friends who saw it. I decided to give it a try and judge for myself. I found the movie to be a really compelling movie about mental illness. I thought the trailer and advertising campaign was totally misleading leading people to believe it was a horror movie where you would expect some alien species or some crazed bugs attacking people ala The Swarm. It was nothing like that at all. Also, I have heard when reading a critique of the play that it was a black or dark comedy. I didn't see this at all and didn't think there was anything funny about it at all. I thought it was good. I recommend it but I do think that it is not for everybody. There is a lot of disturbing material here.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>bug was way different than what i expected. i just thought i was really going to see some bugs, but they were the only ones who saw them. trippy movie, but grabbed my attention from start to finish. it was good all the way through. from the lonely waitress in fear of her ex husband and full of guilt of losing her child, to the strange drifter, and everything that follows that. it had a good introduction explaining her solitude, and then it just went full blast. i guess when you're that depressed and alone you believe whatever you have to so you won't feel that way again. it was a mind thriller, not scary, or gross, just wierd and captivating. the only problem i had was the ending. it was a good ending, but it left you hanging. i would have wanted to see something else. the actors were good. ashley judd, i can't hate, the woman did her thing. she was great. she played the part, she was convincing, and she delivered. nice job. it just gives you a glimpse through the eyes of some really disturbed people. a day to us how they live everyday of their lives. it's suprising with how just a few words they can suck you in and you may never get out. defenitly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Hold on to something, because BUG will get under your skin.<br /><br />I'm not really sure if I would classify this as a horror movie.  Maybe a dark love story.  A VERY VERY dark love story.  Playwright/screenwriter Tracy Letts seems to have an affinity for writing plays that feature the types of characters you'd find living in trailer parks and seedy motels. They are troubled folks, that's for sure, and often desperate.<br /><br />BUG is a tale of paranoia, yet coursing through its veins is a doomed love story. Agnes joins Peter in his paranoid delusions not because she shares his paranoia necessarily (at least not at first) but really because she desperately needs him as a lover and protector.  There are plenty of other reviews on this site to give you more specifics about plot and characters and theme, so I won't rehash it all here.<br /><br />The film is structured much like the play it is drawn from.  Having seen two of Tracy Letts' plays (many people in his plays end up naked, dead, or both) but not this one, I knew I was in for a wild ride.  The second half of this play/movie does not disappoint -- he ratchets up the intensity and adrenaline in each passing scene.  It actually got funnier as it got darker (typical Letts), thank goodness.  The ending was so explosive I can't possibly figure out how that could have been presented live on a stage.  I'm curious to know.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD to sophisticated fans of either horror or very dark comedy.  This is probably my second-favorite Tracy Letts work, resting just behind his play "Killer Joe" (not yet filmed).<br /><br />Trivia:  the actress who played the role of Agnes in the Off-Broadway production of "Bug" also played Lois the Prostitute in the first season of "NYPD Blue".  She was the one with special connection to the Andy Sipowicz character and played a part in his fate in the pilot episode.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Uhm...this was an interesting psychological thriller but fell short of being a great movie that I'd recommend to others.<br /><br />Ashley Judd plays a small-town crack-smoking waitress, Agnes, who is helpless against her estranged husband, who just got out of prison.  Meanwhile, her lesbian co-worker introduces her to a lonely, shy drifter.<br /><br />The drifter is a soldier, who've just returned from the war.  Eventually, you'll start to see that this guy is a few marbles short.  He believes that he is part of some classified warfare experient and that he's under the constant watch of the government.  He believes that there are microscopic bugs (critters) that function as...well...bugs (spy devices).<br /><br />Agnes feels obligated to help out this drifter with his problem.  However, his paranoia starts to affect her to the point where she actually believes there are bugs around and even inside of her.<br /><br />So, this simply leads me to believe that the power of word/persuasion is a powerful weapon.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was interesting.  However, the movie moves at a slow pace.  In other words, you could quickly lose interest in the movie.  Another thing, towards the end, where Agnes has gone over to the other side, the movie loses its appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>Gives you a tiny clue of what to expect ..... alsolutely award worthy performances from all  -  ASHLEY JUDD is so underrated as a performer!

Right there, the movie is worth seeing.<br /><br />BUT...I must admit the previews for the movie were all pretty misleading.  They make you think you'll be seeing a grimy little horror story, dealing with a bug infestation of some sort.  THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE...at least not in the traditional sense.<br /><br />It is a story about one lonely woman's descent into utter madness...led there by a man who is already quite insane himself.  It is a psychological horror story of the first-order...but it does not deal at all with anything supernatural, sci-fi, alien invasion, killer viruses, etc. etc.  If that's what you're expecting...then you'll be a one-star reviewer just like half the reviews on this site.<br /><br />The movie is based on a stage play, and it is talky.  Most of it takes place in Judd's cheap little hotel room that she has been living in for months or years.  This makes the movie feel a little "stage bound" but it also helps make Judd's world seem sad, lonely and pathetic.  Hopeless, even.  She has escaped a bad marriage...but one day, her ex-con ex-husband comes "home" and assumes he will just take up residence in her life again.  The hubby (Harry Connick Jr....devoid of any charm) also is clearly ready to start up his abusive ways again.<br /><br />We learn that this couple has also experienced a major personal tragedy...which explains the utter despair that has clearly helped hold Judd back from moving on with her life.<br /><br />Suddenly, into her life comes a strange, and strangely compelling, young man (Shannon) who despite his oddity and somewhat anti-social behavior, takes a shine to Judd and also helps to fend off the unwanted husband.  The two embark on a tentative affair that grows into a clingy relationship that grows into a madness that both share...one that grows ever larger because the two feed off and encourage each other.<br /><br />I don't want to say much about the nature of the madness...but suffice it to say that what the movie shows is that Judd is in a perfect psychological state to turn herself over completely to the delusions of another...to forget her real life and absorb the probably imaginary life of a person who actually has brought her some tiny measure of safety, comfort and intimacy.<br /><br />The acting feels a little "stagey" at times...almost over the top.  In fact, Shannon played his role on stage, and I suspect had a hard time turning his intensity down a notch.  So, Judd simply stepped up to the plate and matched his intensity.  She is tough, yet extremely vulnerable.  Closed off yet willing to give her heart and soul in exchange for very little.  Also, Judd brings pretty much no ego to the film...she looks haggard.  True, she is one of the more natural beauties in film (and yes, she even does a nude scene)...but her allure is more carnal, more base, more driven by need.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is quite shocking, a bit sad, and in many ways disappointing.  It happens abruptly, and when we realize that it's over, we might want to throw something at the TV.  But part of that stems from the fact that while these characters are far removed from anyone we know (hopefully!)...they have been built carefully and convincingly...and we eagerly hope for a different fate for them.<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone.  It isn't exactly an "art film" and it isn't a "genre film."  I think it can suit a viewer whose tastes are wide ranging and who appreciates good performances, even in a script that is a bit stagey and a bit contrived.  It has something to say about the power of loneliness to make us do unattractive things.  It is NOT designed to scare you, creep you out or even make you feel you've had a good time.  It wants to rattle you a bit...and it succeeds.  It is just hugely unfortunate that the films marketing was so misleading.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>This is truly an original !<br />If you are not interested in a deep character study, and especially in psychology, then you will probably be dissapointed in this movie.<br />If you are, however interested in the workings of the mind of someone with a mental illness, then you will probably be intrigued by this movie.<br /><br />It starts out with Ashley Judd, a lonely unhappy woman who has had more than her share of tragedy in life. She has a recently paroled husband who terrorizes her, and years earlier, her 7 year old son was abducted,which the guilt from that alone was probably what made her give up on life.<br /><br />Anyway, her co-worker introduces her to a drifter, who she becomes quickly attached to.<br /> The role she plays is so sad. She is so lonely, that she overlooks this new guy's quirky personality, and becomes totally convinced that he was part of an experiment while in the service, and was injected with bugs.These egg sacs are supposed to be growing and hatching in him and he uses self-mutilation to remove them.<br /><br />She, too becomes convinced that she is infected and starts digging at herself.<br />From here, the level of paranoia and insanity the two of them go through will make you want to SCREAM !!<br />At one point in the movie when he begins pulling out his teeth with pliers...you just MUST turn away.<br />And what he finds here under the microscope, had me thinking "IS he really crazy?"<br /><br />And the longer she is with him, she begins to be just as bad as him, or even worse in her delusions...up to the point that the whole room is literally COVERED in foil.<br /><br />I know, I know!! - I am giving away a lot here, but as deep as this mind trip goes, it really is only a small part I gave away, and I only did that to peak some interest in this story (which I think is EXCELLENT) because of all the bad reviews it got.<br /><br />I say, give it a chance! It's truly original, interesting, intense, and CREEPY!!! And the end will totally leave you in shock !<br />I give it 5-plus stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>BUG is a rare film, a psychological thriller/horror film that really works. Ashley Judd plays a lonely waitress living in an SRO in a backwater desert town.<br /><br />Enter Michael Shannon, a wandering Gulf War vet with a dark secret. He claims to have been the subject of a U.S. Army experiment in which insect larvae have been implanted into his body. As the film builds in suspense, Shannon's delusions (?) become increasingly baroque, feeding themselves on Judd's intensifying suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Most of this film consists of Judd and Shannon alone in a room together, living out a folie-a-deux, a shared madness.<br /><br />Although BUG has a significant gross-out factor, it also has a hugely successful psychological fear factor, a rare commodity in present-day filmmaking. The increasingly florid Shannon slowly and inexorably turns Judd into a True Believer, with horrifying consequences.<br /><br />BUG will turn your stomach, but it will also play with your mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>One of the most recent entries in the increasingly potent drama/horror hybrid field, "Bug" finds Ashley Judd playing a depressed and occasional drug-dabbling woman living in a small motel room close to the little town where she works serving drinks at a loud, boisterous bar.  With a troubled past that includes an abusive husband and a long-vanished child, she becomes deeply afriad when she starts getting annoymous phone calls shortly after her ex is released from prison.  When a fellow barmaid brings a new male friend over to Agnes (Judd's character)'s place for the evening, he (Michael Shannon) and Judd form a connection and later begin to grow closer.  It seems at first that the two may help one another get over their mutual loneliness, but he's got a very secretive nature, and, possibly, some very deep secrets to hide.<br /><br />  Peter (Shannon's character) is either insane or carrying some very nasty secrets within himself.  And then the bugs start appearing, small in number, at first...<br /><br />  Grim, even dreary at times (but proving itself one of the very few movies that can carry off extended periods of such bleakness and emotional desolation), full of horrors like domestic violence, emotional isolation and post-traumatic stresses, and possibly much weirder horrors as well; "Bug" also has a strange beauty to it.  That, and virtuoso performances, help prevent the movie from becoming overly depressing and creates a great film for both horror fans and drama fans.  Intense, dark, and very different from anything else out there, "Bug" surpassed my expectations and is a very rewarding movie, although in a bizarre way.  Not for everyone, I suppose, but way better than it's reputed to be.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Tracy Letts adapted her off Broadway play with Bug, directed by the legendary William Friedkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection), and in his hands, Bug is a visceral and bloody mind trip that is sadly underrated.  Ashley Judd stars as a white trash waitress with a shattered past who is dreading the return of her ex-con husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and holds up in a cheap motel.  Soon enough, she meets a scarred Gulf War vet (Michael Shannon), and afterwards, he discovers a bug in her bed.  What happens next is a bizarre and often compelling mind trip that turns quite bloody as the ever growing paranoia escalates into territory you'll never see coming.  Without giving too much away, Bug is a twisting examination of mental illness that is made only better by the performances from Judd and Shannon.  Shannon (reprising his stage role) in particular is spectacular, and should become more well known thanks to his performance here, but alas, Bug has gotten a bad rep thanks to some sloppy marketing.  It's no secret that Bug isn't what you may think it is (I wouldn't classify this film as horror really) and that it's definitely not for all tastes, but make no mistake that Bug leaves a lasting impression.  All in all, if you're looking for something a little different and quite compelling in your viewing experience, you could do far worse than Bug.</p></br></body></html>

The poorly misunderstood Carrie White is tormented by her fellow classmates and scorned by an abusive mother, but her years of ridicule are now manifesting themselves into a powerful psychic force that she will use to avenge herself.<br /><br />De Palma opens with a soft, sensual shower scene that is highlighted by Pino Donaggio's magnificent score. The mood immediately shifts to pure psychological horror as Carrie is assaulted by the other girls after her first period causes her to panic in the locker room. These feelings of repressed anger and sadness will continue to build throughout the picture. Sissy Spacek's Oscar-nominated performance as Carrie is crucial to the film's success. Her shy and apprehensive take on the character is played to a flawless perfection, while her fiery inner anguish is unleashed like a phoenix in the climactic ending.<br /><br />CARRIE is lined by more fantastic performances from each of its supporting cast members, with Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, and John Travolta delivering menacing roles as the high school bullies. It is Amy Irving and William Katt that become the most interesting  of the teens as Sue and Tommy thanks to the growing ambiguity that is written into their characters. Tommy's charming smile can be read any number of ways, but always seems to allude to a vicious deception that never surfaces. It isn't until Sue's ironic ejection from the prom by Miss Collins that their true intentions are finally revealed.<br /><br />Piper Laurie's exaggerated portrayal of the crazed Mrs. White is taken to a state of super-villainy, with her religious zeal serving as a constant source of satire. De Palma uses countless visual clues to accentuate Mrs. White's domineering persona. She is typically shot from low angles in full-frame, giving her an imposing presence on-screen. This is opposed to the high angles that Carrie is filmed from, which depict her as a cowering child that is forced into the corner of the screen. Little notes, like the weathered "For Sale" sign next door or Mrs. Snell's general unease, also work against Laurie's character.<br /><br />De Palma uses many of his favorite techniques to create CARRIE's unique look, most notably in his use of split-screen and dual lenses to bring the foreground and background into focus simultaneously. In what may be De Palma's defining cinematic moment, the camera follows as the prom ballots are collected and swapped, tracing each of the co-conspirators before it ends up overlooking the prom from atop the fateful bucket of blood.<br /><br />CARRIE is Brian De Palma's greatest achievement within the genre, and one of Horror's finest films. It epitomizes the teen revenge thriller, both with its incredible cast and superb direction.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 5/08<br />Rate: 7<br /><br />5/08: Carrie has been universally touted as a classic horror film, but honestly, for me, I'll say it's more of a drama piece that wasn't sustained very well to the end. Yes, I loved the build-up of the story from start to the "moment." Don't get me wrong, the build-up leading to the "moment" is skillfully and aesthetically done. But it was the "moment" where Carrie began to go wrong. In fact, I didn't like the editing work because I felt cheated when the "moment" shortly expired. Then, the next thing I know, Carrie walks out of the gymnasium and gets on road where she avoids a car by using her telekinetic powers. The rest of the film didn't help much either. It was hard for me to believe how the characters get dropped out like flies during the "moment." For me, if I had to do the editing work, I would have prolonged the "moment" a little bit longer and just end it right there. That's it. Why ruin a good thing? It's almost a Tarantino with some Peckinpah thrown in. Sissy Spacek gave a nice, soft performance although she was great much of time, but I wanted more screen time from her; I liked the gentle character of Tommy Ross played by William Katt; and the mother played Piper Laurie wasn't bad work, but I prefer Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford. It was weird seeing John Travolta playing his character because mainly he acted like himself pretty much the whole time. Luckily, he shows real acting when he took on the iconic character Tony Manero. There are plenty of gratuitous nude scenes throughout Carrie, but I wouldn't go as far to say that they were anything that meets the word "sexy." All in all, although I never went to my high school prom since I find it a rubbish idea, Carrie substitutes for it with even acting and nice build-up, but the last fifteen minutes is pretty disappointing for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Sissy Spacek won a well deserved Oscar nomination as Best Actress for her portrayal as a shy teenager with powers of telekinesis who is harrassed by her classmates in "Carrie". This nomination is unheard of as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rarely acknowledges performances in horror films. "Carrie" is based on the splendid Stephen King novel and also stars John Travolta in one of his first films. Piper Laurie gives a blood chilling performance as Carrie's mother, a Bible -thumping woman who demands her daughter live a celibate and isolated life.<br /> The DVD is beautiful and comes with a collectible booklet featuring info on the film. Also included is a featurette featuring interviews with Spacek and others, an animated photo gallery, theatrical trailer, and an interview with director Brian DePalma. French and english subtitles are included with a running time of 1 hour and 38 minutes.<br /> "Carrie" spawned a sequel in 1999 called "Carrie 2" and a remake of the film was adapted for television on NBC in 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>In league with 'The Shining', 'Cujo', and so on.  A 70s masterpiece in the horror genre.  It is relentless in scary psychological undertones that play on the emotions, sympathy as much as terror and wonder.  Sissy Spacek is dynomite.  The filming is dynomite as well with touches of the 70s that you make you wonder how you survived this era.  Truly creepy but a very interesting drama as well.  Beauty and terror ride high in this feat by Brian DePalma - and the mind of Stephen King.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This movie came out 30 or so years ago but it is still just as chilling in many ways.  Consider Carrie's tragic life, the mean girl bullies at her high school, her rude English teacher, her religious fanatic of a mother. This would be enough to destroy anyone.  Carrie, however, possesses telekinetic powers which eventually enable her to wreak the ultimate revenge on those who tormented and humiliated her.  She even ends up killing her own mother and causing their house to collapse on them, killing both.<br />Sissy Spacek has always been an outstanding actress, and this is only one example of how good she is.  You have to feel for Carrie; she has so much against her.  Piper Laurie is over-the-top-wonderful as Margaret White, who finds no joy in her religion but plenty of ways to condemn others, even her own daughter, whom she refers to as a witch because of her powers.  PJ Soles, Nancy Allen, and John Travolta are deliciously nasty as those who wish harm towards Carrie; while Amy Irving plays a teen who feel bad about picking on Carrie and tries to make it up to her.  William Katt sweetly plays Tommy, a kindly boy who agrees to take Carrie to the ill-fated prom at Sue's request.  Betty Buckley is unforgettable, too, as gym teacher Miss Collins, who tries to help Carrie with her self-image but ends up killed along with everyone else when Carrie goes into a trance during her final rage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is just your everyday social misfit in high school as she has been taunted and tormented by some students as she feels like an outcast. She discovers that she has telekinetic powers, Carrie also has a psychotic religious mother (Piper Laurie) and one night at the prom she goes berserk with her powers after a cruel prank goes bad.<br /><br />Co-starring William Katt, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror masterpieces of all time. Brian DePalma was a great choice in directing this classic supernatural shocker and it is faithful to Stephen King's classic novel, the performances are excellent especially the cute Ms. Spacek as Carrie and the music score is quite memorable in this movie even the prom sequence that made this a classic.<br /><br />This special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound quality with fine extras like theatrical trailer, two documentaries by Brian DePalma called "Visualizing Carrie" and "Acting Carrie" with the stars of the film, A bio on Stephen King, a featurette on the broadway musical of "Carrie" and a animated photo gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Scanners", "Akira", "The Shining", "Firestarter", "The Fury", "Making Contact (a.k.a.

When it gets there it will scare the you know what out of you! Most have seen this film,but for those of you who haven't, I don't want to tell too much. Truly a classic and one of Kings stories get a grade A movie treatment. Spacek should get a lot of credit as it is her at the prom in a trance like state that takes this movie to another level, she is magnificent. The DVD has a great transfer with some excellent bonus features.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Carrie White is a strange girl.  She is backwards, shunned, and ignorant of many things.  She is a tragic figure as many of her problems are due to her upbringing at the hands of a religious single mother.  But with advent of womanhood, Carrie starts to develop telekinesis.  Amy Irving plays a schoolmate who starts to feel guilty at the way she has treated Carrie in the past and tries to help Carrie out.<br /><br />But the help Amy provides may be too little too late as there are others in the school who do not feel the same guilt.  In fact, they with to increase their bad treatment of Carrie.<br /><br />The whole movie moves toward the senior prom and Carrie managing to attend ignorant of the plots against her.  But as plots converge and Carrie gets targeted, her powers grow into a terrible sword of vengeance with Carrie striking down all she feels have ever wronged her.<br /><br />In the end Carrie is truly a tragic character.  Although she was filled with anger and vengeance, she also knows she has done wrong.  Although different from the book, the ending is quite powerful.<br /><br />The disk is packed with featurettes and interviews that really help to fill out the movie and the whole Carrie phenomenon.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>There's not much I can say for this movie that others haven't already. Sissy Spacek does well as Carrie, and while not all of the events of the movie match the book, this movie is indeed a decent adaptation of the book. Watching Carrie stalk forward in a psychotic, telekinesis-fueled rage is always a treat to watch. Two thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie and more star in Brian De Palma's<br />1976 horror film based on Stephen King's novel. A teen girl<br />with telekinesis gets deadly revenge on tormentors at her<br />school. Sissy and Piper are terrific in this and I'm glad I<br />got this special edition. It has good picture and sound<br />plus some neat extras. I recommend this horror classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Carrie (1976) is one of the more unique horror films, based on the novel by Stephen King.  It has a down-to-earth feel to it, with the upcoming high school prom and a girl named Carrie White (played by Sissy Spacek) who is always being picked on by her classmates.  Carrie White possesses telekinetic powers that few people know about.  Her mother, played by Piper Laurie, is a religious fanatic who is extremely strict with her daughter, even to the point of physical abuse.  Carrie grows to hate her mother as time goes on.  This movie suddenly makes a sharp left turn and goes from being basically a teeny bopper high school prom movie to a horror movie filled with blood and destruction.  This movie can be summed up like this:  It is a movie about getting ultimate revenge on the people who have hurt you both physically and mentally.<br /><br />Spacek and Laurie both received Academy Award nominations for their roles.  This movie also stars John Travolta as a partying slacker named Billy Nolan who is in on the ultimate prank against Carrie White in this movie.  It also stars William Katt as Tommy Ross, who is Carrie's prom date, and PJ Soles as Norma Watson.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best performances were by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, the two Academy Award-nominated actresses.<br /><br />This DVD has good special features, including a documentary called "Acting Carrie" with Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, Betty Buckley, etc., and a documentary called "Visualizing Carrie" with director Brian DePalma.  There is also a featurette called "Carrie The Musical", an animated photo gallery, and a biography called "Stephen King And The Evolution".<br /><br />This movie has good special effects for its time.  I highly recommend this movie to all horror movie fans.  A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I've always loved Stephen King films for his highly unusual writing talent and for the way he always delivers unexpected and bizarre twists, but I *completely* forgot how much I love Carrie!<br /><br />I haven't seen this movie in quite a long time.  In fact, it must have been 20 years since I last watched it.  I completely forgot what it was about.<br /><br />Carrie is the name of a teenage girl who has special powers- she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  Her character is that she *constantly* gets picked on by all the girls in her gym class.  They do some of the most revulting things imaginable to her.<br /><br />Furthermore, her mother believes she is evil, so she constantly tries to save her daughter whenever the girl returns home from school by reading from the Bible, screaming in her daughters face that she's sinful, and other ways.<br /><br />Basically, the girl has a bad life, haha.  But... what goes around comes around, eh?<br /><br />The majority of the storyline focuses on the senior prom dance, and what will happen when Carrie gets invited.  Well I know one thing- her mother won't be happy about it, haha.  This is when Carrie REALLY takes advantage of her special powers.  She takes absolutely no crap from anyone, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There are some unintentionally funny moments throughout the film, such as when the head girl in her gym class gets smacked around by her gym teacher and her boyfriend.  It's because she doesn't know when to shut up, haha.  She's *always* getting smacked around by someone.<br /><br />John Travolta... WOW he looks young, haha.  With long black hair, too.  Surprising to see this.  I didn't even recognize him at first.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about the film is how Carrie becomes close to her gym teacher because she's the only one who understands how much Carrie is being picked on by her classmates.  However, it's very surprising what happens to the gym teacher eventually.<br /><br />Also, try to imagine school teachers acting the way they do in this film THESE days, haha.  Hard to imagine.<br /><br />This film is just really cool.  It contains a really weird storyline, solid characters, and establishes Stephen King as a really good writer.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>Even though it's thirty-four years old the horror flick "Carrie" (1976), made from the Stephen King novel, is still a very absorbing and chilling film. The young Sissy Spacek was perfect for the part, that thin body, those wide eyes with their translucent pupils, the whitest, palest of skins, that quality of other-worldliness, as if she's from another galaxy. Her classmates are stereotypical brats, and a few clich&eacute;s erupt here and there - in fact, the only character who isn't a caricature is her gym teacher, the actress Betty Buckley.<br />Carrie's mother (Piper Laurie) is a Bible-thumping fanatic who could drive any daughter round the bend. Carrie White has super-developed kinetic powers that can make her move objects or people wherever she wills them to go. The final scenes in the gym on prom night when she really lets go are horrific. It's a wild climactic scene. How they ever made this into a musical, I'll never know. Betty Buckley was in it, and it flopped.<br />You don't want to play nasty tricks on Carrie because she can get back at you in spades. The initial shower scene in the film with adolescent female nudity was and is quite daring. When Carrie discovers menstruation, her female classmates turn vicious. Director Brian De Palma guides his film through the treacherous shoals of teenage cruelty, and even the young John Travolta shows up briefly to play a Neanderthal goof.<br />The movie holds up well and is worth watching to see Spacek's brilliant portrayal.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Carrie White is the outsider of her class. She's a mousy girl, all of her classmates hate her, and her mother is a religious fanatic who walks around in a black cape. After she unexpectedly has her first period, she is teased by the girls more ruthlessly than before. The gym teacher punishes the girls that were involved and one of them, Sue Snell, feels sorry for what she did and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom instead of her. But another girl that has been banned from the prom, Chris Hargenson, isn't so forgiving and hatches an evil plan with her boyfriend that involves Carrie and a bucket full of pig's blood. But what none of the students realize is that Carrie has the power of telekinesis, the power to move things with your mind, and that when you make her mad, she transforms from an innocent girl to a rage-filled monster. And this is gonna be a prom no one will ever forget. You want to call this horror movie or thriller or whatever else is up to you, Carrie's scope can't reach beyond just one genre. It is a thriller, but at the same time a very humane movie. This movie wasn't made for cheap scares: every scene is brilliantly captured. The scary parts may be rare but when they are there you just can't move from your seat. If you are looking for a terrifying but also moving movie, Carrie is just right for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>De Palma managed to get a Stephen King novel right, but it's the sensational acting of Sissy Spacek, and Piper Laurie that drive this film way beyond the merely 'good' range. This is a psych-horror film that had so many splatter-fests ripping it off ( with not even close to the impact )- including a thoroughly, pathetic sequel- it should have gotten franchise rights. THE RING wasn't as scary as CARRIE by half. Aesthetically speaking, the afore-mentioned film doesn't even come close to CARRIE ( only a handful of 'creepers' do ). If you love revenge-films, or just no-holds-barred horror this is the ultimate in payback flicks. A must for any horror fan.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is very creepy. A teenaged girl named Carrie White is always being picked on and made fun by the sexy teenaged girls. (Her psycho God-crazed mom doesn't help.) The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also. The very end with Sue putting the flowers on Carrie's grave and a bloody hand pops up is awesome. Hell, the whole movie is awesome. I would love to take Carrie to the prom. If you love horror, revenge, and proms, you'll love CARRIE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>This is one of like 3 or 4 screen adaptations of Stephen King novels I can tolerate. I consider this to be the best. Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White! Piper Laurie IS her crazy mother! They shine in this classic battle between kids and parents, cultural norms vs. religious fanaticism, and knowledge vs. ignorance. Carrie is growing up. She experiences her first period and is humiliated by her entire gym class (who "stone" her with pads), due to the fact that her psycho-preacher mom  never explained the simple facts of life to her. Such things are far too "sinful" to even mention. Well, along with puberty comes a power that enables Carrie to move things with her mind. Slowly, we realize that this power is awesome and dangerous. This is not so much a spook show about telekinesis, as it is a tragedy. Most people know the story about the prom, the pig's blood, Mom's kitchen crucificion, etc. In the book, Carrie personified the awkwardness and misery suffered by the "outsider" in teen life. Sissy Spacek made the role her own. The intensity of her eyes during the final holocaust is incredible! Brian DePalma handled the direction with honesty, humor, and complete terror. An impressive film. Bonus- Check out the young John Travolta and Nancy Allen as the king and queen of slime! Amy Irving is great too! Also, see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in a funny hat! ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Seeing this movie on cable is nothing compared to actually seeing it uncut and rated R. Unlike the ludicrously-conceived sequel, which hit theaters in 1999, this movie does not have a strong emphasis on blood or gore, and  there is an evident emotional factor as well. The viewers can actually  sympathize with Carrie White as she goes through her adolescent period,  endures the hardhips of being the center of ridicule and banter, and her  feelings of happiness when Tommy asks her to the prom. Sissy Spacek plays  her character to a T, making the emotions believable and realistic. Piper  Laurie, who plays her mother, is the pinacle of the tight-fisted parent who  allows for nothing degrading to enter into her child's life or mind. Brian  de Palma has truly done a marvelous job in recreating the Stephen King  classic, and while some factors of the movie and the book differ at  different times, there is still a remaining quality of justice done to the  novel. This movie will also make some people think twice before making fun  of anyone again. To all who see this, I hope you enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>Steven King's novel depicting the trials of a bullied girl blossoming into womanhood while being victimized by a deranged mother is a masterpiece.<br /><br />At school, the misfit Carrie White is friendless. Her feminine beauty is invisible to her classmates, who view only her inability to meet the standards of adolescent society. At home, the harassment tears her soul apart. Her mother is a deluded, man-hating and sexually repressed sociopath who unleashes her repressed sexuality by sadistically inflicting punishment on her blossoming daughter in the name of "Jesus."<br /><br />When Carrie, ignorant of the facts of life, experiences the onset of her period at school, the scene is set for the perfect storm in horror movie history. Carrie believes that she is dying. Her classmates, like the pack of animals that they are, sense blood and go on the attack. At home, it becomes yet another means for the sadist to humiliate her prey. The school is ultimately clueless as to how to address the issue, thereby providing the perfect battlefield for the Armageddon to come.<br /><br />Carrie is emotionally powerful horror film, an outstanding metaphor for the trauma of adolescent change, and no other film matches it's perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The only flaw of this Brian Depalma vehicle is...dare I say this...the story? Yup, telekinetic devil child? It's certainly not boring but I almost can't possibly grant it a five star rating.  I'm going to anyway. King's first novel is not his best, but it is still very good. I will assert that the film is actually better and Carrie is one of the best adaptations of a King novel ever made into a film. My hats off to Depalma for creating one of the scariest films of all time in the process. I'm a huge horror fan, so Carrie has quite a few things to take into account for your own tastes. It's a bit dated and requires some imagination from the viewer...I'm probably preaching the quire here anyway.<br /><br />Most people my age have only seen the edited television version which is on about three or four times every Halloween. The made for television remake was a horrorshow in a different way because it came close to ruining the credibility of its original. Depalma holds back his amazing technical abilities intentionally and builds this tale of revenge and justice up for one of the most climatic sequences ever made. "They're all gonna laugh at you" rings in Carrie's ears after a bucket of pig's blood is dropped on her head...the music goes from extremely happy and glorious to tense and terrifying, the lighting goes from normal to blood red like Carries now blood soaked appearance. We go from feeling sorry for her to feeling sorry for the kids who we thought for one minute might deserve what's coming to them in a few moments. What follows is quite possible the most brilliantly filmed horror sequence ever. Split screening and panning from Sissy Spacek's amazingly tense eyes and face to her victims soon to be lifeless bodies. Then the fire comes in and we realize that these kids have unknowingly unleashed hell on earth. The film keeps going down a very dark road and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Anyway, it's one of the greatest horror films of all time and is totally unforgettable. In the long run its films that you remember fully that stay intact as classics and Carrie is certainly one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This movie is a horror film yes. But it's not as scary as films now a days. This film is about a girl named Carrie White. She is picked on everyday and has no friends. Soon she figures out she has telekenetic powers. She reseaches it and learns that other people have it. Her mother sees that she has that power and is upset. Her mother thinks that everything is a sin. If you ask me the mother is the scariest thing about this movie. Then  the classic prom scene. Almost everyone is dead. Carrie goes home and kills her mother and the house collapses. No more Carrie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>The acting was flawless in Carrie but I have many critcisms and complaints about a movie like this. It's very hard to enjoy Carrie. How anyone can I do not know. I've seen it years ago, but it was on tv last month and I couldn't stop crying. It is sooo depressing and not a laughing matter at all. This is a very serious issue. Kids coming to school with guns and killing their peers who teased and verbally abused them on a daily basis for years all throughout high school, is no joke. In Carrie, that sick and demented Kris girl, and the classmates who terrorized Carrie, and the whole time she just wanted to be accepted and to fit in with her peers. She finally gets a chance to go to prom with a nice genuine guy, and when she gets the nerve to go, she is laughed at, and lets not forget the pigs blood scene which is anything but funny. The movie is depressing and sad and gets worse and worse for carrie, who is a sweet, shy, and beautiful girl and the only reason she is different is because of the way she was raised by her psychopathic, religious fanatic, demented, and abusive mother, who by the way tries to kill her own daughter at the end. No happy ending. Carrie dies when her emotions get out of control, and her teleniketic powers cause the house to crumble causing her to die, after having to kill her mother in her own defense. Tommy Ross died, and he was the only good guy in the school it seemed. Schools have done hardly anything to stop the abuse of other classmates in real life. I was often teased and believe me it's no laughing matter. I did ageree with what the p.e. teacher did by punishing the snotty girls in the locker room who threw tampons at carrie telling her to plug it up, when she thought she was dying and did not know what a period was because of her deranged mother. It's just not a happy movie. You almost can't feel sympathy at the end for the kids who are killed by Carrie, the ones that tortured carrie and laughed at her, and even tried to kill her by running her over with the car (Kris and Travolta). A person can only take so much. (I'm not condoning turning to homicidal revenge. Just saying that in the movie you constantly despise the other kids, and feel sympathetic for Carrie)And that awful music that plays throughout the film is so sad, and makes you want to just shut it off. No wonder my mom, who was a teenager in the 70's, hated this sad and demented movie.<br /><br />One last thing I am sure is often over-looked. When the blood is poured on carrie, she begins to hallucinate. It was so tramatic and humuliating that she began to see and hear things that were not there. It first showed most of the kids laughing, but not the p.e. teacher, or the girl that was friends with Tommy Ross or her boyfriend. See what happened was, it showed US (the viewers) the people who DID laugh, and then showed Carrie hearing "plug it up plug it up, we're so sorry cassie, they are all gonna laugh at you, ..over and over again, and she thought that everyone was turning on her, even the p.e. teacher, who was really looking horrified once the blood bucket dropped. So all the abuse and teasing, finally had come to a breaking point, which pychiatrists call, a mental breakdown, or post-dramatic stress disorder, or temporarily insane, which are not made up disorders, they really do happen. So when that was going on, that's when her emotions came to a boiling point, and she killed everyone in the room uncontrollably, and the guilt even led to her own death. So to say Carrie is the evil one in the movie is not logical. It can happen to the best of us.<br /><br />TO THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOYED THE PIG BLOOD SCENE OR WHO ENJOYED WATCHING CARRIE GET BRUTALLY TEASED: You are sadistic and immature and don't know anything about pain and suffering, or compassion. How can anyone enjoy it. There is something sickly wrong with all of you. I know it's only a movie, but what does that say about you?? The idea makes you sick to your stomach, that people enjoy the suffering of others. Get a life. This happens everyday in schools, and when kids turn to violence and rage, it's nothing to be proud of as a teaser/tormentor, because it will come right around back to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Based on Stephen King's book, this horror outing finds director de Palma at his twisted best. Spacek is perfect as the diminutive blonde bombshell set to detonate, Laurie causes involuntary shudders playing Carrie's deranged Mom, and you can't wait to see all those nasty adolescents at school get what's coming to them.( This group includes future stars John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving).

Her mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie) is a zealot and does not stand for any nasty doings. Carrie is not the most popular girl in school. Let's face it she is the butt of many practical jokes.<br /><br />The time comes when puberty hit her hard. And Stephen King says that is the time when any latent supernatural tendencies creep out. Sure enough Carrie finds that she can telekinesis.

I liked this as much as the book and do not listen to anyone who says that the stupid remake is better because the remake sucked and anyone who thought it was better than this is a craphead (the remake was going to be a frickin tv series for gosh's sake). Buy yourself a copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Carrie is a good horror movie based on the book by Stephen king and it contains some tense and one horrifyingly scary scene. The movie isn't that scary but it's a lot scarrirer than most horror movies. Sissy Spacek gives a great performance as a very unique girl named Carrie who has psychic powers. She isn't popular and is always mocked by people but always keeps her powers under restraint. Her mother is very creepy and is a complete nutcase that locks her in the closet at times. Well, you know what's going to happen, something's going to drive Carrie absolutely nuts. And you won't believe what she does. I don't want to give away anything but believe the mom is freaky. John Travolta gives a good performance as one of the popualr kids in school. I recommend to be aware at the end of the movie or else you might jump off the couch like I did.(It's not over until the credits, believe me)</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>Now you want to talk about kids being cruel?  This would be the type of movie that would make a parent want to homeschool their daughter.  I got quite a kick out of Stephen King's creation with this one. I shook my head through the "plug it up" scene and the pig's blood screaming scene. This horror movie about an outcast girl who just could not manage to be accepted by the popular kids held my attention through the whole thing.  Do I think it was scary? Not even remotely.  Entertaining? Definitely.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The only flaw of this Brian Depalma vehicle is...dare I say this...the story? Yup, telekinetic devil child? It's certainly not boring but I almost can't possibly grant it a five star rating.  I'm going to anyway. King's first novel is not his best, but it is still very good. I will assert that the film is actually better and Carrie is one of the best adaptations of a King novel ever made into a film. My hats off to Depalma for creating one of the scariest films of all time in the process. I'm a huge horror fan, so Carrie has quite a few things to take into account for your own tastes. It's a bit dated and requires some imagination from the viewer...I'm probably preaching the quire here anyway.<br /><br />Most people my age have only seen the edited television version which is on about three or four times every Halloween. The made for television remake was a horrorshow in a different way because it came close to ruining the credibility of its original. Depalma holds back his amazing technical abilities intentionally and builds this tale of revenge and justice up for one of the most climatic sequences ever made. "They're all gonna laugh at you" rings in Carrie's ears after a bucket of pig's blood is dropped on her head...the music goes from extremely happy and glorious to tense and terrifying, the lighting goes from normal to blood red like Carries now blood soaked appearance. We go from feeling sorry for her to feeling sorry for the kids who we thought for one minute might deserve what's coming to them in a few moments. What follows is quite possible the most brilliantly filmed horror sequence ever. Split screening and panning from Sissy Spacek's amazingly tense eyes and face to her victims soon to be lifeless bodies. Then the fire comes in and we realize that these kids have unknowingly unleashed hell on earth. The film keeps going down a very dark road and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Anyway, it's one of the greatest horror films of all time and is totally unforgettable. In the long run its films that you remember fully that stay intact as classics and Carrie is certainly one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>There's one thing I specifically like about certain horror films, and that is those that contain the horror elements, yet have a story that allows you to feel a great deal of emotion for a main or secondary character, depending on the focus of the plot. When Stephen King wrote his first novel, Carrie, it was shocking as well as emotionally heart-stopping. Brian de Palma's film, following soon after, is groundbreaking and intense, and captures the horror of the character's actions as well as the horror of her secluded and alienated school and home life. <p>Carrie White has never been popular in school, and the verbal and physical abuse has apparently gotten worse with each year. One day, she gets her first period in the showers of the girls locker room, and frantically running to everyone for help, she is bombarded by shouts of banter and flying tampons. After it is learned that she was never told by anyone about this process of life, we soon learn the reason why: her mother is a Bible-thumping embodiment of a true maniac, who believes that every action committed by man is a sin in the eyes of God. Her treatment of her daughter is extremely harsh, but only until Carrie learns that she possesses a special gift, the ability to move objects with her mind. Meanwhile, Sue Snell, one of the girls involved in the malicious locker room incident, feels guilt over her actions and asks her boyfriend Tommy to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts, and attends the event despite her mother's warnings of doom and sin. But something much worse will happen, something more terrifying than Mrs. White could ever imagine. <p>&quot;Carrie&quot; is one of the most well-known horror films of all time, and has set the standard for many later films of the genre. The entire premise for the movie is quite original, and the execution of the material is even more powerful and emotional than the novel itself. What makes it so emotional is the fact that there is a human story that happens everyday around the world. Carrie is constantly bantered and teased about every aspect of her life: her home, her mother, her apparel, and her demeanor, and it is done in such a manner that you cannot help but feel a great deal of sorrow for her when she commits the ultimate act in the finale of the film. <p>De Palma's camera angles and cinematography add an immense amount to the overall effect. Many of his shots usually center on someone in the foreground, while Carrie is somewhere within the near background, making her appear minute and small among everyone else. His use of the two-window effect for the prom sequence helps us to see more of the destruction and the reactions people have to events going on around them. One more notable sequence is opening scene, in the girls locker room, where we see the rest of the girls having fun and making merry while Carrie is alone and singled out in the shower stall. Throughout the movie, De Palma does a spectacular job in making Carrie seem insignificant when put with a group of people. <p>Sissy Spacek was brought to the project to play the title character, and does a top-notch job. She is the perfect &quot;ugly-duckling&quot; type for the role, and she is able to play out all of the emotion and terror that Carrie experiences throughout the novel. Amy Irving is does a credible job as Sue Snell, and her performance makes us believe that Sue really does feel sorry for what she has done to Carrie. The rest of the ensemble makes the movie believable, and never is there a moment where you will question the authenticity of a performance. <p>Certain to remain a hallmark of moviemaking, &quot;Carrie&quot; will shock, scare, and incite emotion for years to come. It is a movie that operates on many different levels, each beginning at separate times of the film, yet converging in the end to sweep us up in horror and sorrow.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>I was like her once.... Maybe that's why this movie is so heartbreaking for me to watch. Its whole buildup to the inevitable climax at the Bates High School prom is so expertly constructed out of plot devices, stellar character development, and amazing visual style that we are helplessly swept out to sea by the undertow of our love for the title character. Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is so wonderfully innocent and remarkably performed that we have no choice in the matter. We are like her prom date at first: Sort of iffy, but then we can't help but adore her. And we can't help but empathize with her because of this grotesque life that she is forced to lead by her pamphlet-pushing religious radical of a mother (the outstanding Piper Laurie). The scenes between the mother and daughter in this film are the key to its satirical elements, as well as giving us a crucial understanding of Carrie's mind. We know why she's so shy, so emotionally distraught, because we would be too in her situation. The very first scene between Spacek and Laurie is a virtuoso, not so much of acting as being the characters, embodying them so fully that all traces of the actresses disappear. They are the key to the entire film; that and Brian Depalma's incredible visuals, which inject every last bit of fear into our veins. Depalma comments on one of the DVD documentaries that he had more time to toy with the visuals in "Carrie" than in any other movie he made. It shows. His POV and incredibly detailed crane shots are why certain scenes work at all. By seeing what these characters see, it becomes easier to understand why they act the way they do. Some people might criticize for the excessive use of slow motion, calling it overkill, but it does volumes for the buildup to the climax, which is so powerful with its harsh, constant musical undertone that I dare call it one of the best, most disquieting scenes ever filmed.<p>The film begins with Carrie in the far corner of the screen, awaiting a volleyball toss that she will miss, provoking insults from the girls in her gym class. Then we are shown the locker room in what would have been an exploitation shot if not for the fact that the music and slow motion camerawork make it seem so beautiful. But we are also put on our guard because of this shot, which shows full frontal nudity; frowned upon in most corners of cinema. However it makes one thing clear: This is a director who will do anything. All the "Halloween" cliches are not to be found here. There are no cheap shocks. Everything is crafted with only the purpose of building tension, from the blood cascading down Carrie's leg in the shower to one of the single best crane shots I've ever seen, where our fears are allowed to build and build to the breaking point, only to have them build some more before the final purge. The parallel stories of a revenge plot and Carrie's being asked to the prom by the most popular guy in school take the film along at the exact pace it needs, and the intercut scenes with Carrie and her mother supply the emotional center for the film, which rests with our love for Carrie: A character so sweet and unassuming that the slow motion approach to the stage brings a smile to our faces too, even though we are terrified of what awaits her. Therein lies the power of the film. The more we love Carrie, the more we hate her antagonists and feel hurt that they would be so cruel.<p>"Carrie" is quite possibly the single most dramatically sound horror film ever made. It maps out its characters so vividly and realistically that we never question anyone's actions. There's none of those traditional "She's so stupid!" remarks you hear in so many a horror film audience. "Carrie" is the real deal. A film that builds an entire house made out of brittle cards of terror, stacking it up until it falls and our fears are realized. There are no scenes of ridiculous scares or people jumping out of the closets to scare their buddies. Depalma recognizes these kind of devices for what they are: Useless. His film is a superb example of how many ways a story can go right, and it is a masterpiece that I am proud to place very high on my list of favorite films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>Carrie (Speical Edition)<br /><br />The movie is considered a classic. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't call it one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I did notice a few problems with the speical edition dvd, I dont know if other people have the same problem with this dvd<br /><br />When the woman tells the gym teacher to shove it up her...and that's it. This is the first time viewing the film and do not know if it's like that in the original version or this is a screw up. I think it is because the gym teacher got really mad hahahaha.<br /><br />When the three guys are picking out tuxedo's, it quickly goes into Alvin and The Chipmunk mode for a brief few seconds. That has to be a dvd error and not apart of the original film.<br /><br />That's the two problems I had with the movie but other then that, it was enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Again, leave it to Stephen King to give us another great story. Sissy Spacek gives a wonderful performance as Carrie..... a girl with supernatural powers. Coming from an abusive home with a very strict mother, we feel sorry for Carrie. Especially on prom night when her fellow classmates, known to pick at her constantly, play a prank on her unleashing a rage in Carrie and her supernatural powers. Those who have treated her badly end up paying for being so mean to her. Good acting and good suspense. Will always be one of those movies that no one will forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Carrie is admittedly a stylishly done (on what was apparently a slim budget) adaptation of the eponymous King novel. <p>Sissy Spacek turns in a very credible performance as the teenage Carrie White who has never had a good day at school, and the high school bullies who taunt her are amusing twits. This whole rigmarole of a kook's daughter reaching out to her paranormal capabilities is actually quite worth a watch if you are into this genre -- and no, it's not your blood dripping Living Dead type horror if that's what you were worried about. <p>But the denouement is a bit overboard. Amazon's reviews call it an "immemorable finale", but a harrowing high school holocaust (in split-screen, apparently mildly tongue in cheek) was frankly a bit uncalled for. By this point much of the film's wit and taste had quickly faded away anyway, so I guess it shouldn't have made much of a difference. <p>Worth a watch? Definitely, this is one of the better horror movies. A masterpiece? No, by any stretch of imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though a fairly competant horror film, Carrie tones down the scale of Stephen King's horrific vision to its own detriment; additionally, Piper Laurie's hystrionics are more laughable than scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>It's about this guy who asks a girl to prom as a joke. She has telekinesis. John Trovolta makes an appearance. The opening sequence sees Carrie White having her period in the gym shower and when her class mates throw tampons at her they all get detention. Though well acted,  it doesn't deliver many scares. Worth a rental or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Carrie ranks with the Exorcist as one of the all time great horror film classics.  Steven King's best novel directed by Brian DePalma and starring my favorite actress, Sissy Spacek, the film shot in '76 shows what '70s  high school is all about.  The characters in the film are divided  between essentially good (Carrie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Tommy Ross)  and essentially evil (Nancy Allen, John Travolta, Piper Laurie).  The film  has some important messages to it.  One is how ironic it is that religious  fanaticism could be the basis for evil, which this film and much of human  history proves.  Another is how &quot;group think&quot; can easily devolve  into evil, in this case the high school in-crowd where you must be evil to  be accepted.  3rd, the most purely good character in the film is Carrie  herself, a victim of the evil of her mother and classmates...not too  unbelievable a scenario for high school outcasts.  One note on the  widely misinterpreted prom scene:  as everyone who's read the book knows,  everyone's not laughing at Carrie, only the girl in on the prank is.  Everyone else is only imagined to be laughing by Carrie.  Finally the  film is a statement against the in-crowd vs. outcast mentality pervasive in  high schools and society in general.  Columbine and all the other high  school tragedies highlight this.  It's time to change the oppressive school  environment before many armed Carries recieve one taunt too many.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Every high school has its misfit, and Bates High school has Carrietta White, played with heartbreaking conviction by Sissy Spacek.  Her posture, frumpy clothes, and timid mannerisms make her the object of scorn from her classmates, who miss no opportunity to tease her.  Carrie doesn't even know her own body, explaining why she freaks out in the gym shower where she has her first (!) period.  But the minute the movie introduces us to her religious fanatic mother (done to near camp effect by Piper Laurie), it's easy to see why she's such a basket case.  And as if that weren't enough, Carrie has the &quot;gift&quot; of telekinesis.  She uses these powers to unleash hell on the night of her prom, where her main tormentor Chris Hargenson (a wonderfully catty Nancy Allen) plays a vicious prank on her.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is not only my favorite movie by director Brian DePalma, but it's also my favorite film based on a Stephen King novel.  DePalma's touch is all over this movie, and that's mainly evident through his signature camerawork.  What also makes this movie such a horror classic is the way it builds suspense to a near-intolerable high.  The scene where Carrie and Tommy Ross are crowned king and queen is done in agonizingly slow motion, creating a buildup of tension that literally ties a knot in your stomach.  The movie also works thanks to the performances from Spacek and Laurie, both of whom earned Oscar nominations.  The DVD has a very interesting documentary featuring interviews with the cast (sans John Travolta, who played the doofus Billy Nolan) as well as a photo gallery, a trailer, and another documentary on the technical aspects of the film.  After over a quarter century since its release, &quot;Carrie&quot; remains a convincing movie that excels both as a revenge fantasy and a horror story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Though perhaps more of a drama than what passes for horror by today's standards, CARRIE stands out as one of the genre's finest moments, having been made in a decade that also saw other classic thrillers such as JAWS and HALLOWEEN.<p>Based on Stephen King's first novel, the film is in essence a character study revolving around a socially repressed high school student (Sissy Spacek) who is tormented at school by her uncaring peers and at home by a religiously fanatical mother (Piper Laurie).  She soon discovers, however, that she has telekinetic powers; and when a horrible prank is pulled on her during the school's senior prom, those powers are unleashed with horrible and tragic results.<p>Brian De Palma's superb, Hitchcock-inspired direction mostly avoids the blood and gore until the bitter end; even the nightmarish prom scene is never explicit in its violence.  But CARRIE really succeeds as both horror and drama because of Spacek's incredibly devastating performance in the title role.  We sympathize with her situation, even as we shudder at the kind of horror she causes in the finale.  Her performance got her nominated for a Best Actress Oscar in 1976 and it can be argued quite convincingly that she should have won.<p>For those who appreciate horror with a certain amount of drama, not to mention heart, CARRIE is essential, classic viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Sometimes slow-moving, often with questionable cinematic techniques, Carrie still manages to stand tall as the yardstick by which all Stephen King adaptations are measured thanks to the combination of King's  unforgettable lead character and Sissy Spacek's classic performance as that  character.<p>Brian De Palma has always been quite daring with his  techniques, resulting in moments of great exhilaration when he succeeds,  but more often show-offy distraction when he fails.  In Carrie we see both  at work.  The split-screen he uses for the climactic scene of Carrie's  blind wrath merely serves to kill much of the tension and cause to no end  of confusion; though I applaud the attempt, ordinary parallel editing would  have been much more real-time and frightening.  (One may notice that for  the key shots, De Palma has to revert back to a single-image frame)  On the  other hand, the four cuts he does when Carrie and &quot;Chris&quot; come  face to face are brilliant, like a staggered zoom, but with ten times the  visceral effect.<p>All technical scrutiny aside, this is a performer-based  movie, and Spacek is damn near inscrutable in this role.  The humliiations  of being an outcast in a high-school world, the connection she has with Ms.  Collins, the sheer joy of relating to Tommy Ross at the prom, the blind  wrath and avenging-angel trance during the telekinetic sequences, and the  raw pain when her own mother turns on her -- Spacek nails every moment,  resulting in probably the single most cathartic and sympathetic horror-film  protagonist and lead performance I can remember.  So even as I am dismayed  at the parts when the narrative lags behind, when De Palma beats his  &quot;suspense sequences&quot; to death (the pig's blood over her  head...the suspense would have been perfectly intact with about half a  minute cut out of that sequence), I forgive the film.  After all, as the  title suggests, the film *is* its lead character, and this lead character  is blessed with a stellar performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>CARRIE shocked the living hell out of me when I was 17 years old. I could not get it out of my mind for years -- and have seen it at least 25 times since then.  It does have perhaps the most copied (and effective)  movie-horror-ending of all time, but it is the haunting performance of  Sissy Spacek that gets under your skin.  It is a spectacularly moving film,  even more unsettling because it is filled with sly wit and comedy.  Yet, as  in TITANIC, you know something really BAD is going to happen.  By the way,  William Katt resembles a young Redford here, and, along with the other  young luminaries, delivers a knockout performance. Donaggio's score is  chillingly effective, especially in the Carrie-Tommy dance, featuring  DePalma's trademark dizzying camera. It makes sense to me in some twisted  way that Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford (FAME) could visualize and hear a  musical in this story (B'way's CARRIE The Musical, 1988 -- w/Betty Buckley  as Mrs. White this time around, the original gym teacher in the film)-- the  sum of its parts is infinitely grander than one might expect in a  &quot;horror movie&quot;.  MUCH better than King's novel, which has its own  macabre voice. You will fall in love with Carrie too.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>You can have your "Sixteen Candles", "Rebel Without a Cause", and all the rest -- for my money, "Carrie" is the greatest film ever made about American High School.<br /><br />Released in November 1976, this high-octane adaptation of Stephen King's breakout horror novel is one of the mid/late-70s big releases that has aged exceptionally well. De Palma shot each scene with a pop-operatic sweep that he can proudly call his own. The teenagers in Carrie are nightmarish pigs, the environment a hellish American small town full of drunken homemakers and sadistic teachers.<br /><br />The material is absolutely perfect for De Palma's "Sisters"-era fireworks, as it builds up Carrie's sad and pathetic school life, her relationship with a freakish bible-thumping mother, and culminates in a Grand-Guignol bloodbath at the High School prom. Split-screens, overcranked cameras, dolly shots during gym practice...all this and more has been lifted in videos such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Hole's first album cover -- but no imitators have come close to making the same statement. "Poltergeist" ripped off the ending as well.<br /><br />I think Carrie is an interesting film to compare with John Carpenter's Halloween and his adaptation of Christine. In the former, everything is played for the slasher elements, and the teenage milieu is much more benign. It has none of the style or subtext of De Palma's film. Christine's best elements come across as an accomplished but somewhat imitative version of Carrie, complete with a John Travolta doppelganger for the villain.<br /><br />This is just one hell of a movie. De Palma did some other interesting work around this period but nothing else seems to have the same unity. And the Blu-Ray looks outstanding with the dream-like cinematography of Mario Tosi.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>You can make an argument that the most horrific moment in "Carrie" comes in the beginning when Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in an Oscar nominated performance) is in the shower of the girl's locker room at Bates High School and gets her period for the first time.  Carrie is so ignorant about her own body that she has no clue as to what is happening and thinks that she is bleeding to death.  Her classmates have no way of knowing that because they have largely ignored Carrie her entire life, but their reaction is that of a pack of vicious wolves attacking a wounded fawn.  We do not need to know anything about Carrie in order to have sympathy for her and to despise her attacks.  But Stephen King's story ups the ante because one of the young girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving) has an attack of conscience, which makes the rest look even worse, although Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), an original "mean girl," does not need such help.<br /><br />Certainly female viewers are going to respond viscerally to this opening scene.  Like the unforgettable scenes in "Psycho" and "Jaws" it is about something horrible happening when you are naked and vulnerable.  But it is also comparable to the chest buster scene in "Alien" in that the initial attack is internal.  That there are so many common elements between these classic horror scenes undoubtedly speaks to something significant, but we will save that for another day.<br /><br />Another key element of the horror story is that Sue tries to make amends.  Some find her decision to punish herself by making Tommy (William Katt), the boy she loves, take Carrie to the Prom to be somewhat unbelievable, but it works in this film because of the look on Amy Irving's face when Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) reads the riot act to the girls and Sue finally gets the depth of the wretchedness of their act.  Besides, their prom tickets are in danger at that point and throwing something away before it can be taken from you is a teenage art form (one that I mastered and used early and often).  This also adds an additional level to the horror because not only does Carrie's pink prom dress get ruined by all that pig's blood, so does Sue's act of contrition.<br /><br />This attempt by Sue establishes a contrast with the way that Carrie's mother, Margaret (Piper Laurie in another Oscar nominated performance), treats her own daughter.  A religious fanatic warped beyond the limits of caricature, Margaret is a monumentally abusing mother who wraps her attacks in the language of righteousness.  Ironically, her treatment of her daughter is a twisted example of an act of contrition, as Margaret seeks to atone for what she considers to be a sin.<br /><br />There is a blatant link between the blood of the shower scene and the shower of blood at the prom in that each serves as a catalyst for Carrie's telekinesis.  The first time it is for her powers to become active, as she learns when for the first time in her life the dirty look she gives to someone making fun of her are no longer impotent gestures.  At the prom this becomes the dam bursting, and what is key is not simply the image of the blood drenched Carrie but the wide-eyed look that Spacek gives us in one of the create close-ups in horror movie history.  Her attackers have gone too far and there is a juvenile sense of justice to the fact that she responds in kind.  You know that a lot of innocent kids die in that gym that night, but silence assumes assent and it can be argued that they are culpable to some degree with making Carrie's life so miserable.<br /><br />But we are so invested in Carrie as a character that the bloody climax of this 1976 film produces mixed feelings.  She gets to pay back her tormenters, an idea that virtually all high school students can relate to, but she goes too far, another inherent trait of the teenage psyche.  It is wonderful and horrible at one and the same time.  But when Carrie claims her final victim our sympathies are engaged again because the tragedy here is that what happened is not her fault.  Carrie White is culpable for her crimes, but the primary responsibility is not her own and the final justice of the film is that the person who is most responsible pays.  However, the final image is of another teenage girl damned for all time because of forces beyond her own control and the idea that no good deed goes unpunished is a rather horrifying final point for the movie to make.<br /><br />Granted, this is not a flawless horror film.  Director Brian De Palma has too much fun with the camera at times, as he is wont to do, such as when he over does the split screens during the gymnasium scene.  What works well to indicate that Carrie is using her powers to slam shut the doors works well, but then it just because too much.  Then again, the boys dressing up for the prom is a nice bit of levity before things go to hell, and filming in reverse Sue Snell's walk to visit Carrie's final resting place is a nice subtle effect.  Whatever failings the film has, such as Laurie's way over-the-top performance and the forced symbolism of her character's crucifixion, the best moments in "Carrie" are some of the most memorable in the history of horror films.  There are just too many body punches in this one to justify rounding down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Although widely regarded as one of the classic horror films of the 70s CARRIE is one of those movies that has moments you love AND hate for a variety of reasons. The first adaptation of a Stephen King novel, CARRIE is notable for jump starting the careers of many involved.Carrie White is a high school misfit who lives in a rundown house with her fanatically religious mother.<br />The film opens with Carrie having her first period in the girls shower room. Ignorant because of her mothers religious beliefs, Carrie thinks she is dying, but when she turns to the other girls for help the other girls pelt her with tampons and chant "Plug it up!". When one of the teachers intervenes to help Carrie the lights in the locker room mysteriously explode.Carrie is sent home to her religious fanatic mother (Piper Laurie, returning to film after a lengthy hiatus) One of the girls who joined in the hazing, Susan Snell (Irving) feels ashamed and asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom as a special favor.  However her nemesis, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) is not so sympathetic and having been barred from attending the prom, when she hears Carrie is going she gets her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and his friends to kill a pig so they can dump the blood on her at the prom. Amazing that even dimwits like them can see the symbolism in the shower of blood. But come the night of the prom, predictably all hell breaks loose...<br />For those of you who haven't seen the movie to go any further would be to spoil it, but there have been some changes from King's novel,especially the classic final 20 minutes. The movie is lighter than the book, and De Palma does a good job on a limited budget. But the film is almost embarressingly dated in places (William Katt's hair for starters) and I hope the TV remake airs in NZ. That said, CARRIE remains one of the best  adaptations of Stephen King to film, and is still fun Halloween viewing more than 25 years later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a teen who's being mentally abused by her mother (Piper Laurie) and by the popular kids at high school.  When Carrie gets invited to the prom under pretense and has a cruel prank played on her, the abuse becomes too much for her to bear.  Her anger reaches a point where she can no longer distinguish between good and evil and instead, just sees everyone as evil and needing to be punished.  Her extreme tunnel vision proves to be deadly.<br /><br />Carrie's mom also suffers from extreme tunnel vision and the results are deadly, too.  Like Carrie, a specific event  angered  her so much that she can no longer distinguish between good and evil and instead,  sees everyone as evil and needing to be punished.  And unfortunately,  at the end of this movie, this becomes a case of like mother, like daughter (sort of).<br /><br />Both Spacek and Laurie are compelling to watch.  Spacek plays her role as mostly sympathetic, but towards the end, becomes truly scary.  Laurie plays her role as mostly scary, but with sympathetic moments, too.<br />The movie ends with a scene that's meant to shock, but I anticipated it, so it didn't shock me.<br />Overall, though, I thought this was a compelling story about the consequences of mental abuse and tunnel vision.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>My caption is from this film and said with such power<br />from the one of a kind Piper Laurie(HI PIPEY)I LOVE<br />HORROR films and unfortunatly us AMAZON/HORROR fanatics<br />really don't have much to choose from,but when we do<br />have a JEWEL like this film it is so refreshing!<br />CARRIE(76)Is without a doubt ONE of thee greatest<br />HORROR films of ALL time.The directing is flawless<br />(what else would you expect from the man DePalma)<br />The cast is top notch and the story(KING'S FIRST)<br />Is amazing and scary at the same time.DePalma tells<br />the story of Carrie who is a pretty girl(though she<br />does not think so)and has no self esteem do in part<br />to her CRAZY religious mother.She has no friends and<br />with the exception of GOD and her mother has no one to<br />talk to.She does however have a power,the power to<br />move objects(telakineses,I spell wrong)This is such a<br />FANTASTIC movie.DePalma gives us DRAMA-ACTION-ROMANCE<br />COMEDY,and of course HORROR.You feel for Carrie when<br />she is at the prom and is Cinderella and you feel for her<br />at the FALL of BLOOD!

Stephen King created Carrie thanks to a few happenstances.  He was working for a laundry service when one day they were in a women's locker room, and he saw the dispense of feminine hygiene products.  He asked someone what it was, a coworker told him.  He had just read an article about telekinisis, and that night he went home and wrote the first scene of Carrie, when she gets her period in the shower and it awakens the power within her.  He threw it away, but a few days later he came home to find his wife, Tabitha, had dug it out of the trash.  When she asked if he had writen this, he said it was just an idea he'd had but didn't like it.  Per her insistance, he went on to write more.  Tabitha told him "No this is good, you've got something here."  Tabitha helped him, as it was a story about girl stuff.  He based Carrie on the two ugliest girls he knew growing up, and her mother around a devoutly religious woman he worked with who he always wondered what her home life was like.  It was submitted and published, and Stephen King had his first big hit.  And, the rest is history.<br /><br />Carrie is the story of a squelched, nervous outcast.  It takes place in the most horrifying of places, high school.  Pushed around, teased relentlessly, and made to feel the butt of every joke, Carrie is trapped between the laughter of her peers and the heavy handed world of her mother's religious beliefs.  She's odd, afraid, nervous.  Then, one day, when the late bloomer reaches maturity right in the middle of the gym locker room shower and made a fool of by the other girls, the power is awakened within her.  Suddenly she has the power to think and effect people.  When that mean boy down the street harasses her on his bike, she throws him an angry glare and he falls off his bike.  When in the second half, one of the girls from the locker room, Sue Snell, feels guilty about her behavior, she does something completely out of character for a "popular girl".  SHe not only feels guilty, but asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom to make up for it.  Her boyfriend Tommy, the handsome, equally popular all American nice guy agrees, and they go to the prom.  Carrie, in the one and only time she ever had a real date, looked pretty as a picture, and is even voted queen, is subjected to the ultimate humiliation when the queen bee and her legion of thugs dump pig blood on her.  Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to take out her revenge, and burns down the town, killing hundreds in her path.<br /><br />Why is this such a great story?  Because it speaks to each and every one of us on some level.  Rebelling against the old world parent, lashing out at teachers who were too meddlesome or ignorant.  Transforming from an ugly ducking into a swan, and the handsome prince comes riding in a white horse to take us to his enchanted kingdom (in this case, the prom).  Having hope that you can break out of your social mold, that you too can be everything you secretly wanted to be.  And when the final insult comes, the one that breaks you, the one that you can't just turn the other cheek this time, you can kill them all with your secret power that you always wished you had.<br /><br />This was a long time ago, and it shows.  Political correctness has overtaken us (the bullying aspect that might have lead Carrie to mow everyone down with an assult riffle if she didn't have the power), fashion has changed, etc.  And the shrillness of the acting, corny, antiquated special effects make it just as campy rather than a serious drama / horror now (thanks mostly to Mrs. White played hilariously by Piper Laurie).  And yet, add the element of the fanatic mother who is really REALLY crazy (and happened to put all her crazy energies into Christianity rather than the bottle, self mutilation, or promiscuity) yet somehow right all along about people really gives us something to think about in the end.  A timeless classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>"Carrie" from the mid 1970's remains among the very best in horror cinema even today! The atmosphere holds a solid chill in my bones from start to finish. The performances by the two leads Sissy and Piper are Oscar worthy! The rest of the cast fall right in order with perfection. The films finale in the gym and to the closing credits is shot with brilliance by the superb Brian DePalma. "Carrie" "may" be the best Stephen King adaptation ever.. it differs from the book in ways but, it still holds true to the just of the novel enough for me. Both the movie and the book stand on their own.. you can watch the movie and be surprised by things that arent in the book and vice versa. Of course with all book to movie films, there is always things from the book that do not make it to the motion picture. This film is a true tale of revenge and, deserves to be hailed as the masterpiece it is!<br /><br />Other good King adaptations: "Stand by me", "The Shawshank Redemption", "Misery", "Dolores Claiborne", "The Green Mile", "Pet Sematary", "The Shining".</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Carrie has everything you could possibly want in a horror film.  Good characters, a good plot, good acting, and some very unsettling violence to top everything off.  Anyone who knows horror knows the ending of Carrie, but unless you have seen it for yourself (in the context of viewing the whole film) you will never know the intensity, brutality, and shock value of the prom sequence.  Brian De Palma put his name on the map with this movie, and rightfully so.<br /><br />Most know the basic plot of Carrie:  troubled teen is made fun of at school, abused physically and mentally at home by a psychotically religious mother, and the trouble teen just happens to be able to practice telekinesis.  Not a good combination.  The film moves along at an awesome pace, as De Palma lets the viewer get sucked in almost the exact way that Carrie is getting sucked in, just to have it all come crashing down in the gut-wrenching finale.<br /><br />This film belongs on the top of most horror aficionado's all-time best list, and it is definitely one of Brian De Palma's best films.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Other than Delores Claiborne, I still think Carrie is the best adaptation of a Steven King novel.  The diary format of the book is shelved for straight narrative and it is beautifully told and brilliantly cast.  Spacek and Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations, Allen, Travolta. Irving and Soles are perfect for their parts.  Very gorey and frightening at times, it's still heartbreaking and moving at others.  This is one of DePalma's best achievements and even at its age, it's timeless.  One of the best horror flix ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;Carrie&quot; is a monumental film released in 1976 that was so fresh for its time that many rushed to the theater to see it.  This is based on the first novel published by Stephen King in 1974.  When it was released, no other author had touched such territories in a such unique style.  The unusual theme kept people curious to what he would write next.  He immediately became a celebrity.  Such uniqueness remains fresh today.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is also the first film adaptation of one of his novels.  It earned two Oscar nominations: Best Actress (Sissy Spacek) and Best Supporting Actress (Piper Laurie).<p>This brilliant plot of a high school student, Carrie White, continues growing more interesting moment after moment.  The mystery and the suspense builds as Carrie slowly discovers and understands her supernatural powers.  Once she learns that it has a name, telekenesis, they begin growning more destructively.  However, the emotional aspect remains present, namely through the bullying and being emotionally tortured by her abusive religious mother.  The chain of events keep audiences watching closely up to the chilling conclusion.  The haunting conclusion has since become famous like the shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960).  Her rampage has since been imitated by several films, but none have matched the intensity of &quot;Carrie&quot;.  Such tremendous film quality goes beyond Carrie's humilating moment of having pig's blood dumped on her by some bully pranksters during her senior prom.  <p>The physical surroundings and the performance enhance the eerie theme.  The house decorations enhance the good vs. evil aspect, going beyond the multiple crosses.  They give the supernatural plot portions a deeper horror feel.  Though all the actors performed their roles well, Spacek and Laurie stand out.  Spacek expresses her tortures splendidly, giving audiences the powerful aspect.  This is the film that placed her in much higher acting territory.  Laurie's performance alone made the telekenesis theme more scary.  <p>&quot;Carrie&quot; is a great film for those looking for a great horror classic.  It's sure to please audiences for many more years.  However, it's sequel &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot;, not based on a Stephen King novel, is not as great as the original though worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>The best movie monsters have always been ones that are the most human, and Brian DePalma's powerful adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller &quot;Carrie&quot; features some of the most vile to ever fill the screen.  Selfish, sadistic, arrogant, violent, and senseless, the teenagers that torment Carrie White (an outstanding Sissy Spacek) deserve their punishment--and more--and DePalma milks every drop of sympathy for Carrie and animosity for them possible.  Unlike so many DePalma films (&quot;The Untouchables&quot; being a notable exception), &quot;Carrie&quot; builds to its climax with a natural sense of inevitability, making the tragedy that ensues all the more devastating.  By now, the plot is well known; a misfit with budding telekinetic powers struggles with puberty, a cruel religious zealot of a mother (Piper Laurie), and a high school populated by representatives of everything that is despicable about humanity (or European-American culture, as none of the major players is an ethnic minority and the social commentary is rather obvious).  When the full extent of her powers are realized, Carrie cleans house, sparing neither the guilty nor the innocent.  (Even a well-meaning teacher ignorant of Carrie's true powers is not spared.)  DePalma gives the film a dreamy sensibility, and now that the music and fashion have returned somewhat, &quot;Carrie&quot; does not seem as dated as it was even a few years ago.  Special mention goes to John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles for being so effectively rotten (their glee when slaughtering a pig is especially creepy); their villainy is far more chilling than the paint-by-numbers variety that most actors portray.  And what of Carrie, herself?  The film correctly leaves that up to us to decide.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Brian De Palma<br /><br />Cast:  Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, William Katt, Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, P.J. Soles, Priscilla Pointer.<br /><br />Running Time:  98 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, some gore, and language.<br /><br />Nowadays, we have literal truck loads of books on how to deal with our tormented teenage daughters. We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film "Carrie" already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film; to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in a brilliant performance) is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother (played by the over-the-top Piper Laurie) is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens (played by Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles), who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period, incredibly late, finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out and of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing.<br /><br />With her the onset of her menstrual cycle, her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately, no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell, her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody, fiery apocalypse as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course. "Carrie" is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed.<br /><br />"Carrie" is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian De Palma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but De Palma does it.  King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. De Palma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre "Danse Macabre")  As is the case in most De Palma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a De Palma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and De Palma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after "Obsession" was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and "Body Double" are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. "Carrie" is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in "Sisters", "Obsession", "Blow Out" and "Raising Cain".  But it is the performances that make "Carrie" stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for "Aliens").  She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way.  "Carrie" is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. "Carrie" is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror.</p></br></body></html>

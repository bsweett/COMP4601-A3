The first remake was the 2001 film called `Mean Machine' staring soccer player-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, and now here comes another `The Longest Yard' with Adam Sandler. Both remakes are reasonably amusing, with the original story kept basically intact, plus the reasonable supporting cast, but I still don't know why the four film companies Columbia/Paramount/MTV/Happy Madison had to remake this film now.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays the role of ex-NFL player Paul Crewe, who is sent to the jail in Texas after being arrested for `stealing' his girl friend's car and his reckless driving. The warden of the prison Hazen (James Cromwell) asks - or orders - Crowe to organize a football team for the inmates. The warden's idea is, the inmates' team must be so horrible that the guards' semi-professional football team can beat them easily, feeling happy and more confident.<br /><br />But you know, the inmates refuse to be losers. After enlisting a help from `Caretaker' (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), Paul Crowe's team named `Mean Machine' get stronger than he had expected.<br /><br />The director is Peter Segal, whose approach to the material is alarmingly silly at times (inmates' cheerleaders, for example), and as a result the tone of the film is at best very uneven. William Fichtner appears as sadistic prison guard, but his violence is soon forgotten in the following slapstick scenes with supports like Bob Sapp. All in all, the actors supply funny moments and the sports stunts are convincing. Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds are good, if not great, and the brief cameos from Cloris Leachman and Rob Schneider provide amusing scenes, but Sandler is least interesting, far cry from '50 First Date.'<br /><br />The overlong remake has little to offer except several funny scenes and amusing cameos. In the final chapter the film delivers the goods, but you have to go through the long road to reach that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>How would it feel to be a prisoner and have the opportunity to "get even" with your superiors by challenging them in a game of football? This situation would cause a great feeling of exhilaration among many inmates, and it happens to form the main plot of "The Longest Yard", a movie remake of the 1974 original that starred Burt Reynolds in the main role.<br /><br />In this updated version of Longest Yard, Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe. He is a man with a troubled past and a guilty conscience. He was once a professional football player, but was banned from the sport for fixing the outcome of a game by shaving points. This guilt has never quite left him and now, many years after the shameful scar from his past originated, he finds himself in prison. He is coerced by Warden Hazel- the man in charge of the prison and a guy with political aspirations- to put together a team of football players using other prisoners, with the goal in mind of pitting them against the guards of the prison in a nationally televised game. Sandler resists, but he ultimately gives in.<br /><br />This sports film offers some suspenseful moments and some good action. It also finds Sandler's character in a tough situation once more, when he is blackmailed by Warden Hazel into once again fixing a football game- this time, the actual game between the guards and the prisoners. Sandler has to make a difficult decision between taking the easy way out (fixing the game and avoiding a longer prison sentence) and doing what is ethical: Refusing to fix another game, like he did in the past, regardless of the consequences.<br /><br />Sandler is ok in his role as Paul Crewe, but I find myself a little resistant to accept him playing a semi- serious part. I say "semi- serious" because this film has many funny moments and Sandler fits it nicely during the comedic segments. But the more serious parts of the film seem a little awkward for Sandler. However, in the case of "Longest Yard", you don't seem to mind because the supporting cast is very good, and it includes Burt Reynolds (just like in the original movie), James Cromwell, Chris Rock, etc., along with several professional athletes, like Brian Bosworth, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sports film with a generally positive message and a satisfying outcome. It isn't quite as good as the 1974 original, but it does offer some solid entertainment, some good comedy, and some serious moments as well, to combine into a pleasant motion picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Not a typical Adam Sandler movie as for his character-he's not his typical Billy Madison, Happy Gilmour-self but it is still a funny movie. The reoccurring McDonald's "cheeseburger" character was hilarious. If a wrestling fan you will notice 3 wrestlers in it-Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash. The football game was action packed. Besides being funny it was 100% entertaining and well worth the admission. The movie itself was about 2 hours long and not being a big fan of MTV itself they did do a great job of making this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>Under the guiding hand of producer/star Adam Sandler, THE LONGEST YARD is a formulaic sports prison movie that accomplishes its goal to entertain for a couple of hours. Its goal is not to outdo the original, but it makes a decent, companion piece to the great and classic Burt Reynolds original. The inspired Sandler had the good sense of casting Burt Reynolds in the film in a key support role of 'Nate Scarboro'(originated by Michael Conrad-HILL STREET BLUES) and Reynolds had the good mind in accepting it because it was tailor-made for him now that its 30 years since the original was released. In an interview with Reynolds, he stated that he was apprehensive of the whole remake concept along with the fact that he created the 'Paul Crewe' character. However, he realized that the film wasn't 'Shakespeare', so why not? Robert Aldrich directed the first 'YARD' which had a familiar theme from some of his earlier films (FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DIRTY DOZEN), showing men in dire situations rising to the occasion. Peter Segal directs the sequel with men making smart-alec remarks in comedic situations. In the original there are characters. The remake has caricatures. Also, the original worked as a dramedy, whearas the remake is more comedy. The original film had a bit more suspense with plot twists in the storyline that leads up to the big game. In the remake, the plot simply has to get from Point A to Point B. Lastly, the creators completely missed the meaning of the title of the film which is exemplified by the final play of the game. Sandler/Paul Crewe scores the winning touchdown  and the inmates (The Mean Machine) win the game.  If one watches the original version compared to the remake, one will see why the film is called THE LONGEST YARD.  If the people involved were more creative, they should have had Burt Reynolds reprise the 'Paul Crewe' character and do a sort of THE HUSTLER/COLOR OF MONEY-type sequel. Overall, a typical Adam Sandler crowd pleaser that retains most of the original film's screenplay with some added contemporary themes. (Note: In a weird ironic twist, actor Eddie Albert-tv's GREEN ACRES- who originated the role of 'Warden Hazen' in the first film, died the same weekend the remake was released. - and - Question: Was that Courtney Cox' real cleavage in the film?)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Thank God that I did not let my 10 year old watch this film...for it being rated PG13, this movie was very vulgar, to the point of ridiculousness..really!!

If you want to see my list of great sports movie check out my review of Friday Night Lights.  Lots of laugh but there is some drama.  Its another great Sandler movie.  Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love saw parts of both of them and couldnt get into either of them so I didnt finish watching them.  Anyway The Longest Yard is a good movie.  And the music in it is good to.  Cortney Cox is hot and she shows her cleavage and wow.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Adam Sandler (Paul Crewe) is great in this film.  Heck, everyone is great in this film!  This is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is Sandler actually looks tired, beat, and downright exactly how I would picture a former NFL star quarterback who lost it all and ends up in jail.  Sandler proves that he has staying power with this film.<br /><br />Chris Rock (Caretaker) is excellent as the man to talk to and get the lowdown on prison life (more importantly, how to not end up someone's girlfriend).  Rock has some really funny lines, and he just seemd to fit this role better than I thought he would.  I think this is his greatest work yet, and I hope he just keeps moving up from here.  "Hey, Chris, if you read this, thanks for making me laugh out loud after an eighty-hour work week!  You rock, Rock."<br /><br />Burt Reynolds (Coach Nate Scarborough)didn't turn in the performance of a lifetime or anything, but he didn't do all that bad either.  The man has been through so much in his life, it was cool just to know he has bounced back so many times.  He's not a quitter, that's for sure.  I think he's a lot like the coach he played in the movie.  I still want to buy that Trans-Am from Smokey and The Bandit!  If you read this, Mr. Reynolds, can I at least take the T/A out for a weekend?  C'mon, I've spent a lot of loot on your films.<br /><br />William Fichtner (Captain Knauer) is always great in whatever role he plays.  From "Grace Under Fire" to "Contact" to "The Longest Yard", Fichtner is one of my favorite actors.  He never overacts.  He never underacts.  He just slides into a role as himself, and somehow makes it work like it's nobody's business.<br /><br />Nelly (Megget) has got skills - acting skills that is.  It was almost like he has been in jail before.  He was that good!  But best of all, he actually managed to pull off the small amount of talking parts and still be so memorable in the film.<br /><br />Megget: "Y'all got a running back?"<br /><br />Paul Crewe: "Not any good ones."<br /><br />Ya gotta love it!<br /><br />Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, David Patric Kelly (Warriors, come out to play!), Goldberg (Who's Next?), Terry Crews (with cheese), Bob Sapp (He broke-ded my nose), and the rest of the cast deserve all the credit in the world for coming together to make one of the best movie remakes in the history of film!<br /><br />This movie has a little bit of everything.  See it, buy it, rent it...whatever...just don't skip it.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>The Longest Yard is advertized as a comedy, but it's not that funny. You have to get half way through the movie to get the laughs (most come from a cameo) Hoping for more coming for great comedians like Rock and Sandler.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I'd imagine that doing a re-make of a movie that many people really liked must be very hard.  First of all, everyone is going to have an immediate bias because you're not being original and also that the original was good and its a hard movie to live up to.  Luckily, Sandler and crew did a pretty good job of keeping the movie entertaining and funny.<br /><br />This movie is about ex-MVP qarterback Paul Crewes (Sandler).  He got kicked out of the NFL for fixing a playoff game.  So he goes on a drinking binge one night and gets arrested for reckless driving and a DUI.  When he goes to prison, he gets immediately harrassed by the guards and is not well liked by his fellow inmates.  Then the warden of the prison offers him to coach a team that would play his team of prison guards.  Obviously the prisoners want to cream the guards so they make a football team.  They practice really hard and play against the guards.  Sounds like something that you've heard before, right?<br /><br />First, I have to say that I'm glad that Adam Sandler's comedy has grown up a little bit.  Now he's targeting late teens to early twenties, rather than the 13-16 range of teens.  This movie is actually pretty funny.  Much of that has to go to Chris Rock's credit.  Theres a cast of wacky characters on both teams, but Chris Rock provides most of the film's jokes.  I guess the thing that bugged me about the film is that it is way too predictable.  You know whats gonna happen at the end and it takes away from the film.<br /><br />So my overall opinion would be to see this film.  Theres so good stuff in the film, and it does keep you entertained pretty much thoughout.  If you're bored one day or are a football/Sandler fan, then check out this film.  Otherwise, this may not be what you're looking for.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Paul "wrecking" Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL star quarterback that left the league in scandal after being caught point shaving.  He has been down on himself ever since, and after a drunken car chase, he finds himself in prison with a chance at redemption.  He has been "recruited" by Warden Hazen (Cromwell) to coach the prison guard's team.  This leads to him putting together a team on inmates to scrimmage against the guards before their season starts to give them confidence.  Of course, along the way the Crewe and the inmates start to show the desire and ability to win.  The game will be a free-for-all, guards against inmates on national television.<br /><br />"The Longest Yard" is a remake of the movie of the same name from 1974.  Having not seen the original, I cannot make a comparison.  I have a feeling that this one packs a few more laughs with the likes of Sandler and Rock in the cast.  Burt Reynolds (who was also in the original) rounds out the cast of inmates.  Full of football action and laughs, "The Longest Yard" succeeds at what it sets out to do.  This is not a great movie, but it is an entertaining way to spend a few hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>This year there's some remakes that didnt make the cut (The Amityville Horror which was like the boring original) and there's one in mind that did (Assault On Precinct 13 which wasnt that bad) and unpcoming one's (The Pink Panther, King Kong...etc). The Longest Yard is one of the ones that didnt make the cut and which is utterly stupid with some funny one liners in it but otherwise its a Adam Sandler/Peter Segal failure. Sandler (Spanglish) plays ex-quaterback Paul Crewe who's career went down the toilet after he shaved points on a football game...so, he takes his bitchy girlfriends car, that would be Courtney Cox Arquette (Friends), in a drunken manner he piles 5 or 7 police cars ontop of one another and winds up going to prison...a country prison which a footballl fanatic Warden, played by James Cromwell (Babe). The guards are real nasty to its inmates and Sandler finds that out the hard way as he fights and gets into mischief. So, Warden Cromwell tells Sandler to make a team of inmates to play football against his guards and so Sandler does so with the help of the caretaker, played by Chris Rock (Madagascar) in a throwaway role and old timer Coach, played by Burt Reynolds (Dukes Of Hazzard) who played Sandler's part in the 1974 original. Not much fun here, with the usual Sandler raunchiness this comedy tries to take itself serious in some parts but its all too laughable when it does and most of the cast is rendered dumb. Also starring Rapper Nelly (Snipes) who cant act worth crap, Dallas Cowboy Wide Reciever Michael Irvin who is right along with Nelly, William Fichtner (Armageddon), Brian Bosworth (One Man's Justice), Bill Goldberg (Universal Soldier 2), Stone Cold Steve Austin, Tracy Morgan (SNL), Nicholas Tuturro (NYPD Blue) and a cameo by Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow Movies). Some people might find this entertaining but I certainly dont. Stick with the original people....hey Burt, what the hell man?</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I have never been one to enjoy sports movies, so I hesitated to watch it when my friend rented it...but since I'm a HUGE (and I mean HUGE) Adam Sandler fan, I decided to watch it... man am I glad I decided to!!!

I can't wait to go buy it!<br /><br />Chris Rock definitely upped the comedy for this movie.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Anchorman, Bad Santa, Old School</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Adam Sandler is his usual self and lets the other actors play off him and each other nicely. This film is loaded with WWE wrestlers, NFL players, and other people who populate ESPN & Sportscenter. The first hour or so had me laughing out loud numerous times (Chris Rock has some great lines), but it turned more serious and less fun once the final game began. After a great 3/4 of a film the final game was kind of boring. Still...this is one of the best comedies to come out this year and I'm really surprised it didn't get an R rating for quite a bit of racial humor and more than enough violence to fill five PG-13 films. ***1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I have to say I like Adam Sandler in some of his movies (50 first dates and Wedding Singer) and then the bad ones ( Mr.Deeds,Spanglish and more).

Nice to have Burt Reynolds in the remake as he was in the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>As the North American box office begins to stage a recovery from its rather lethargic slump over the past few months earlier this year, though still quite far from where studio executives would desire it to be, thanks to the release of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith last weekend, focus now shifts to comedian Chris Rock whose two films, both with entirely different demographics, lead the Memorial Day weekend. While Rock has taken quite a bit of criticism as of late due in part to his lackluster performance as host of the 77th Annual Academy Awards presentation, whether this was due to censorship limitations or his own material's inability to clash with the ceremony's key demographic is insignificant, his movie career has yet to be impacted. And should The Longest Yard and Madagascar perform significantly this weekend, even if they end up behind the last Star Wars film on the box office charts, there is no sign that it will be slowing down any time soon.<br /><br />The story for The Longest Yard is not of significance as soon as the game between the guards and the convicts begins and violence quickly ensures. It is all but forgotten with the audience along with a few of the players onscreen as well. How precise this inception follows its predecessor's storyline is not of concern either. This is an Adam Sandler project after all and like another remake he made a few years ago called Mr. Deeds he pays no heed to the classics as long as laughs are able to be made, no matter how lowbrow they may be. However, as Sandler has (somewhat) matured over the years so have the atmospheres of his films. In the past, films such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison would be nothing but comedic entertainment from beginning to end. But as was evident with Big Daddy, Sandler began developing a level of sobriety in his projects. The Longest Yard is the most extreme example of this with a heavy emphasis on violence, which in this case is not the comedic kind, and racial slurs. This is a relatively minor difficulty but one which may catch certain audience members off guard if they are not prepared for it.<br /><br />Adam Sandler may exhibit the eccentric personality which makes the cynical and downtrodden Paul Crewe who he is but quite noticeably he lacks the corporeal build of a former NFL quarterback, even one who has been removed from the game for several years. This abstracts from the audience's ability to perceive Sandler's character as a man who is able to bring his underdog team of convicts to victory, even to the last second of the game. This could have been passable in his other football comedy, The Waterboy, seeing as how Bobby Boucher was the underdog who was not foreseen as one who could rise above the odds, but doesn't here. Burt Reynolds on the other hand thoroughly symbolizes the physical build of a man whose fans abandoned him years ago but he has yet to either accept this fact or relegate himself to this position in life. Reynolds, who starred in the original 1974 film, The Longest Yard, on which this picture was based on, fits impeccably in the role of the gruff Coach Nate Scarborough. The only gripe against his character is that Reynolds appears rather late in the storyline and doesn't receive as much screen time as the audience would need to connect with him, although he certainly makes up for his absence in the last half hour of the picture. Surprisingly Chris Rock is not as irritating in this film as he could have been though his white/black people jokes do get old as the movie progresses. Rock's departure in the film leaves a hole in the flow of the picture which is not easily replaced, but it is so late in the film that it is hardly noticeable. And James Cromwell performs to perfection in the role of the corrupt Warden Hazen. Cromwell has had past movie experience in the role of a warden years earlier with his appearance in The Green Mile, although that was a more dramatic opportunity then this one to say the least.<br /><br />Tracy Morgan appeared to have dropped off the face of the planet following his abrupt departure from Saturday Night Live, which few noticed immediately seeing as how at the time he had been restricted to a skit or two per episode to begin with, and after the cancellation of his NBC television program, but his unsettling appearance in The Longest Yard demonstrates he retains the ability to scrounge up work every now and again. Did Adam Sandler, who happens to also be a Saturday Night Live alum, bale him out with a role in this film? Though Sandler has been known to do that for a number of former cast members, especially with his close friend Rob Schneider, Chris Rock may be more to blame for this one given Morgan had a role his Rock's Head of State a year ago. The further it is poured on through the film the more exasperating it becomes for the audience to tolerate without a garbage can nearby. Those with weak constitutions are given no reprieve especially when it comes to the scene Adam Sandler has with Cloris Leachman, his co-star in the James L. Brooks' film Spanglish. Leachman plays Lynette Reynolds, the Warden's secretary, who is obsessed with Crewe's underwear advertisements and forces him to engage in activities of a sexual nature in order to obtain tapes of the guards' games from past seasons. This is of course recorded via the security camera in the room and is shown to the inmates shortly thereafter, much to the chagrin of audience members. It may have been humorous on a certain level in suggestive form but outright repugnant when actually carried to a certain degree onscreen. Courteney Cox's breasts make a brief appearance in this film as those belonging to Crewe's girlfriend, Lena. This must have been while she was pregnant with her first child which actually makes her abrupt stint in The Longest Yard, a mere cameo actually, all the more discomforting. And what would an Adam Sandler film be without Rob Schneider's "You can do it!" which surprisingly has not gotten old after all these years.<br /><br />Overall, The Longest Yard fulfills the promise its advertising suggests it set out to accomplish from the beginning which was to deliver a load of cheap laughs to its audience in a senseless piece of comedic entertainment, albeit coming off a bit abrasive, mean-spirited, and even indecisively salacious in the process. This not uncommon amongst Adam Sandler pictures so this should not come as a surprise at all to his royal fan-base which undoubtedly be the backbone of this film's box office receipts. It is quite unusual to see that The Longest Yard received a PG-13 rating especially given its prominent use of vulgar language, particularly racial slurs aimed at the black community, and excessive violence which can hardly be viewed as comical in nature. This however does not necessarily go against the film considerably but it can be quite off putting for a few audience members not accustomed to this sort of behavior in their comedies. There is not a whole lot to say about this film other then the attitude one will have for it vastly depends on how you have viewed Adam Sandler and his comedies in the past. It definitely pales in comparison to his previous football picture, The Waterboy, but it's humorous enough to be recommendable for a shameless evening at the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In what is fast turning out to be one of the biggest years ever for cinematic retreads (doesn`t anybody out in Hollywood have any NEW ideas anymore?), "The Longest Yard" is the second remake of a Robert Aldrich film to hit theaters in the past six months.  The first, "Flight of the Phoenix," was released last December.  Now all we can ask is, can the "new and improved" version of "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?," starring Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, be far behind?.<br /><br />In this new edition of the `70`s hit, Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an ex-quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who was banished from the league six years earlier for allegedly shaving points off a game.  When he is arrested for stealing his girlfriend's car, Crewe is sent to a Texas prison run by a diabolical warden and his cadre of sadistic guards.  The warden, a football fan from way back, enlists Crewe's expertise in putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a "friendly little game" of intramural football.  The caveat is that this ragtag team must be good enough to make a decent show of things but not good enough to beat their opponent or there will be hell to pay.  Thus, the game becomes an inverted, high stakes encounter pitting the forces of good (the prisoners) against the forces of evil (the penal authorities).<br /><br />Thirty years have elapsed since I saw the original version of this film, so I don't feel particularly qualified to evaluate how this new one stacks up against the old.  I will say, however, that this "Yard" faces some serious problems at the get-go with the casting of Sandler in the lead role.  Burt Reynolds, who played the protagonist in the original film and who gets a fairly good-sized role in this one as well, was at least credible as a man who might have been a professional football player.  But Adam Sandler!?  Come to think of it, Sandler is probably more believable as an NFL legend than he is as a hot underwear spokes-model, an absurdity we are also asked to swallow - but the less said about that the better.<br /><br />There isn't much to recommend this latest edition of "The Longest Yard."  The plotting is predictable, the characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes and the humor obvious and lowbrow.  And the final showdown - i.e. the big game - goes on for so long that most of the tension inherent in the material simply drains away long before the closing credits.<br /><br />Perhaps the saddest aspect of this movie is watching Cloris Leachman making a complete and utter fool of herself playing a grotesque, beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed with seducing the young Mr. Crewe.  Some sights we should just not be asked to face in this lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Seems like you have to look hard to find a funny movie these days. The Longest Yard fails at being funny mainly because it tries too hard to be like many other sports comedies. It seems to use the same type of jokes over and over again (one liners and overuse of profanity for instance), and the same formulaic and predictable elements that you would find in any Adam Sandler movie.<br /><br />The characters are all typical prototypes. For instance, you have the corrupt warden of the prison who tries to get Adam Sandler's character to form a team that will seemingly be doomed. You have the big dumb guy who just likes to hit people, but wants to play. You have the fat guy who just wants to be a part of the team, and is the source of several jokes. You have the sidekick(Chris Rock) who knows everything about the prison, and is a willing participant to help Sandler's character out. You have Adam Sandler being the washed up athlete with a snobby girlfriend. You have Adam Sandler trying to turn a bunch of less-than-average football players into winners. You have the corrupt guards who try to bully some of the inmates, etc.<br /><br />It also doesn't help this movie to see cameos by the least respected sports personalities (such as Micheal Irvin and Bill Romanowski). I mean, I know it is suppose to be a tasteless comedy, but sheesh!<br /><br />There are certain funny points, sure, but this is a forgetable movie, and there are better and funnier Adam Sandler movies out there (Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer come to mind). I happened to go see this one at the show, but, in hindsight, I would have been better off waiting for this one for rental.<br /><br />Rating: 2 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>This hilarious romp in the gridiron is entertaining and memorable.  If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.<br /><br />Several of the reviewers rated it low in comparison to the original.  It doesn't need to be compared.  It can stand on its own.  However, if one must compare it, I liked it nearly as much as the 1974 version.  It is updated for a new generation.  Burt Reynolds even acts, which is another bonus.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Another poor Hollywood remake even Sadler fans will find few positives:<br /><br />This movie pretty much sucked starting from the idea that it could somehow be better than the 1974  cult classic.  This movie fails on so many levels it's not even funny. Even guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin or Kevin Nash  can't distort  the pathetic director, the overused  prison stereotypes that we've seen a million times, and UNLIKABLE character in the  lead (Sandler). Etc.<br /><br />Well let's start with the last part, Adam Sandler just sucks in the lead, Sandler himself is pretty hard to put up with so why put him in the lead?<br /><br />Other failures. The fact of the matter is that is a typical Sandler vehicle, his worse one yet , but if you have seen his other movies they're almost the same He makes an ass of himself gets away with it, then the movie ends. "Punch Drunk Love" was the exception.<br /><br />The plot is that Paul Crewe (Sandler) wrecks his car into another police car while the fact that his car was reported stolen by his girlfriend played in a small role by Courtney<br /><br />Cox. Then he gets of to prison which results in the usual prison offensive jokes we've seen a million times that gets old:<br /><br />"Someone will make his bitch"-Caretaker (Chris Rock).<br /><br />How enlightning, lol Tell us something we don't know. Eventually the Warden of the prison played a weak and flat James Cromwell who has an easy role recruits Paul to play against the guards in a football game.<br /><br />As someone else stated Sandler is totally unrealistic as a former football player, much less a quarterback. Didn't we actually see Sandler play a football/loser type of role<br /><br />already? Why yes we did it was called The WATERBOY!!!<br /><br />Why Peter Segal elected to choose Sandler is anyone's guess.  I guess he figured Sandler could carry this movie, he was wrong.<br /><br />I guess he figured Sandler could be funny enough in this movie to warrant a full viewing. He was wrong again. I guess he figured that fans would forget the great original that  inspired the remake and wouldn't notice the fact that  this movie is a pale and cheap imatation of it, he was wrong a third time.<br /><br />I did get a couple of good chuckles though (one or three at  the least) when Paul recruits his huge inmate playing Ping  Pong is actually well executed. However that's one of a  few good laughs I did get.<br /><br />Unlikable characters, prison stereotypes and familiar jokes,<br /><br />a dimwitted weak actor/comedian in the lead is all that<br /><br />told me this movie was a familar. Ebert and Roper were<br /><br />right on this one panning the movie.<br /><br />The original was funny but it was also raw, gritty,<br /><br />suspenseful and the keyword....it was original.<br /><br />Thus a remake was unwarranted and unneeded. I second then all the other critics and fans who say Hollywood should stop remaking these classics and leave well enough alone.<br /><br />Theyre not fooling anybody and in the process our respect for any filmmaker who participates in a remake is lost. Peter Segal has made some good funny movies: The Naked Gun the Final<br /><br />Insult, Anger Managment and Fifty First Dates were e<br /><br />ntertaing but this movie is not. This movie unlike the<br /><br />original does not stand for anything.<br /><br />It's just a predictable ride, boring and lame ride that doesn't deserve a second turn. It has no value or point to it.<br /><br />But then again Segal as most Hollywood directors , probably could not deny the huge money he was offered to do it as well as the unfunny and uninspiring Adam Sandler.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Adam Sandler is the straight man for most of this remake of "The Longest Yard," starting when his character, former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, is hauled off to prison for taking his wife's Bentley for a late night drive and finding a way to wreck a whole lot of cop cars while standing still.  If you have seen the trailer for this 2005 film then you have really seen most of Sandler's funniest bits.  However, most of the funny lines go to Chris Rock, and you are not going to be able to see them on a trailer or repeat them in polite company for that matter.  Unfortunately, Rock's character of Caretaker does not get to stand on the sidelines and make jokes during the big game because that honor goes to ESPN's Chris Berman and color man Baby Face Bob (Steve Reevis), which is too bad because Rock is a lot funnier, especially without a script.<br /><br />The basic situation is the same as the original.  Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is proud of his football team made up of prison guards but insists Crewe help his team prepare for the new season.  Crewe's suggestion is for the guards to play a tune-up game against some weak opponent they can crush.  The warden loves the idea and insists Crewe put together a team of inmates to be the requisite cannon fodder.  The problem is that all the murderers, thieves and rapists in the prison do not like Crewe because he was kicked out of the NFL for point shaving.  So he has to put together a rag-tag team of misfits and psychotics until the real bad studs come out to play.  There are some bumps along the way but apparently these convicts can run around in the middle of the night all they want and eventually we get to the big game between the Guards and the Cons (a.k.a. the "Mean Machine").<br /><br />All of the best scenes in this movie come on the football field, where the goal is usually to come up with the most viscous hits ever seen in a football movie.  The two most famous bits from the original movie pop up in this one as well with only one slight variation on what we enjoyed the first time around way back in 1974.  How different are these two films?  Well, the warden's secretary was played by Bernadette Peters in the original and this time around Cloris Leachman gets to milk the role for more than it is worth.  But I can make a better case for the more important difference that while the original had to do with the quest for human dignity this one is more violence for the sake of violence.  Crewe has to remind the players that any bones the guards break are going to heal, but beating them will be something none of them will ever forget.  But since Burt Reynolds is around to play the coach ("Iron" Mike Conrad in the original) instead of the quarterback this time around, there is an implicit stamp of approval, although my guess is Reynolds knows these guys are just making the original look even better.<br /><br />It is strange that MTV Films is part of the mix on this one because the familiar faces tend to be from "Saturday Night Live" (e.g., Tracy Morgan), ESPN (e.g., Dan Patrick, Jim Rome), and the NFL (e.g., Brian Bosworth, Bill Romanowski).  Then there is Michael Irvin who would count for both the NFL and ESPN, and Nelly, who counts record sales.  Also running around are Steve "Stone Cold" Austin, from the wonderful world of wrestling, and playing the role in the film I would most like to have seen cut is Nicholas Turturro, who learns there are worst things then filming a nude scene on "N.Y.P.D. Blue."  But for it me it was the fact that not long after I was thinking that Bob Sapp as Switowski was one of the biggest human beings I had ever seen along comes Dalip Singh as Turley to prove me wrong.  The only thing is that there are so many of these characters running around that not everybody gets to have a decent payoff while the difference between steroids and estrogen is driven into the ground.<br /><br />Strange to realize we live in a world where the appearance of Rob Schneider yelling, "You can do it!" is greeting by an audience with something akin to delight.  For me it was nice to see Ed Lauter who played Captain Knauer in the original film putting in an appearance in this one, although the cameo was bittersweet given that Eddie Albert died at the age of 99 the day this remake opened (and the obituary in the paper did not mention he was the warden in the original despite the fact everybody was impressed that the guy from "Green Acres" played a villain so well).  I was rather disappointed by the sports media people who play themselves and ended up rounding down on this one because the humor was not up to "BASEketball" standards let alone "Major League."  Chris Rock makes the first half of the film enjoyable and the football game delivers for the most part at the end, but in the final analysis I think that the actors had more fun remaking "The Longest Yard" than we had watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Longest Yard was not a very funny movie.I'm not even really sure if it was suppose to be.Chris Rock is in the movie he later gets killed by a fire bomb.But Chris always adds his racial jokes and to be honest his jokes aren't funny anymore AND that goes for all black comedians talking about race.Adam Sandler did a decent job , he can't act for nothing as a drunk.Courtney Cox and her fake boobs weren't spectacular.I just rented this movie ,I wouldn't buy it if it was 10 dollars.But it was a great sports movie.Best sports movie since Varsity Blues ??</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I'm sorry to have to say this, but this sucked.

Its a good comedy, mixed with a little drama, good action but very predictable. I'll admit I never seen the orignal but the thing that shocked me was the language. I dont have a problem with swearing but for a PG-13 movie, it seemed like it was too much. Espeically hearing Steve Austin drop the n word, made me cringe. I saw kids that were 10 and younger sitting in the theater, and I realized this world is diffently going down the tube. This movie diffently deserved an R rating for the language alone; I mean if this movies passes for PG-13, I cringe to think of how the vaules of America is going down the tubes. Just check the music scene of today. Whats next that will be tarnished?</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Here we have another watered down remake that tries to take a very well done film and open it to the general public.  The film, while although enjoyable at times, is full of cheap humor, bad dialogue, and illogical events.  The story follows Paul Crewe, a washed up pro quarterback who lands himself a 3 year sentence for getting drunk and stealing his girlfriend's very nice car.  In the original instead of arguing with his girlfriend he beats her and then steals the car, so we already know that any seriousness from the original is lost.  The very first shot of the film is a flashy split screen shot of a girl swimming in the pool in her bikini.  The camera follows her out of the pool to reveal a big party going on, then we follow Courtney Cox Arquette upstairs to find her lovely boyfriend all drunk and watching football.  All the camera does is focus on her bulging bosoms for her entire 5 minute screen time.  We already know the target audience so it's not a shock, but it's just degrading to the original work it's being based off of.  Once Crewe is ordered to assemble a team to face the guards as a "practice" game then the eye rolling will come.  You watch and think to yourself, "These guys are criminals?"  I mean they are all little annoying asses, and the jokes are also tasteless.  Tracy Morgan makes a cameo as the head of the gay guys in the prison, and they become the cheerleaders for the convict team, yeah ha-ha, gay jokes, men in skimpy clothing with pom-poms.  Later, when Sandler is recruiting players he goes to see this huge hispanic guy who is locked up in a room that shares the likes of Hannibal Lecter's cell in Silence of the Lambs.  Sandler finds him banging his head against the concrete and asks "what's his problem", the guard replies "he's crazy".  Maybe that's how they'll depict Hannibal Lecter in the remake 20 years from now.  So, once they finally recruit this guy who was being guarded 24 hours a day in a room with bullet proof paneling, he is let out to play.  That's right, they just let him out of his hold so that he can practice football, no guards supervising.  The turning point of the film is so out of place because they try to make it serious, and it just doesn't flow with the tone the movie already established.  As for the entire plot, it does not stray away from the formula one bit.  C'mon, guess who wins at the end.  It's not hard since you know what is coming.  They assemble the team, they practice, all odds are against them, they have to overcome the death of a friend (won't say who though), Sandler has to choose between being faithful to his team or be selfish and throw the game . . .  guess the ending.  I thought Burt Reynolds would come to lift this movie, but he didn't.  I laughed out loud maybe 5 or 6 times.  Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler, but this movie is lacking any social commentary and impact that the original had, just like his other remake, Mr. Deeds.  What is Sandler trying to do? Remake classics into crappy comedies? Whatever it is, it's not too hot.<br /><br />ACTING:  You won't buy Adam Sandler as an all pro quarterback for one bit, not at all.  You'd think he'd do some body building for the role, but nah-uh.  As for his acting, he acts the same throughout, and it's funny that he has no funny moments in the film.  It's all the supporting cast of cameos and nobodies.  Don't worry, Rob Schnieder is there like he always is with the "You can do it!" line.  He also gets Allen Covert in there as he usually does with his movies.  Chris Rock is pretty unfunny too.  All the funny comes from the wimpy convicts and some mega slowmotion football hits as a huge guy knocks down the little guy.  Those are always funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The original had a social commentary, it was a stronger film.  This film shouldn't carry the same name because it's just a tasteless mix of big hits, crappy jokes, and illogic.  It's also filled up the whazoo with Reebok product placement.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Remakes usually surface like the bubbles in a bathtub, with an expected reeking sensation.  However, this remake is rather amusing, even though it does not measure up with the original.  The cast is decent and the story amusing without much greatness to be pondered, which leaves the audience with an enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth a viewing and several laughs.<br /><br />In football, individuals put in hundreds of hours over the off-season in the weight room to get into ideal shape and the team polishes its plays to perfection through countless hours of preparation by coaches and players.  Despite all the preparations, one single mistake could break the whole situation, which could possibly result in a loss, or injury.  This in turn could have a downward spiraling affect on the team as a whole and affect the whole season.  Thus, when it happens, the coach is usually in the face of the player to make sure that it never happens again, as mistakes are what separate the winners from the losers.  This is why football is the ultimate team sport. In the testosterone pumped remake The Longest Yard, Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) embodies the mistake of all mistakes in a football career, as he is sent to prison for the theft of his girlfriend's Bentley.<br /><br />Paul Crewe destroyed the valiant notion of hard work and dedication that surrounds football some years before the film takes place by shaving points in a football game for personal gain.  In disgrace, Crewe has withdrawn from public life while his girlfriend, played by Courteney Cox Arquette, flourishes in exposure.  This personal conflict between the two leads the drunken Crewe to steal her car, as she has it reported stolen.  The combination of alcohol, smart mouthing, and the car theft among other things lands Crewe a lengthy prison term in the Texas penal system.  Crewe ends up in Texas due to Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) who has pulled some strings to have Crewe sentenced in his prison, as he wants to win the Texas penitentiary league.<br /><br />When Crewe arrives to the prison, he quickly learns that both the guards and the inmates do not desire his presence.  This is also one of the reasons why he declines to help the Warden, as the guards are disgusted by his past in the professional league where he was appointed the most valuable player.  Immediately Crewe sets an example through which he acquires some respect, but it also means that he must help the warden.  He finds himself suggesting that the guards should play a tune-up game against some bad players, which gives Hazen the idea of a game between the guards and the inmates.<br /><br />At first, some inmates join up with Crewe, but there is a severe lack of talent among the prisoners and many of them are suspicious about Crewe.  Eventually, some talent emerges out of the secret hiding places and offers services to the team.  Many join the team to get a chance to repay the guards for years of humiliation and pain.  With the help of former Heisman winner Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and Caretaker (Chris Rock) Crewe has four weeks to prepare this rowdy bunch into a well-oiled Mean Machine that will be ready to stomp the guards.  However, it is not a painless journey for Crewe and company, as they face much adversity from within the prison while the heat begins to build up for a game that is beginning to gain national attention.<br /><br />Once again, Peter Segal partners up with Adam Sandler with whom he made Anger Management (2003) and 50 First Dates (2004), but it is not where Segal began his career directing comedies.  It is clear that Segal possess the skill of delivering decent comedies, yet much of the humor in the film is unoriginal and recognizable from other films.  Despite the formulaic approach, Segal succeeds in creating an entertaining concept that works and offers both humor and drama.  Some of the success might be due to that the film staying close to the original by Robert Aldrich from 1974 with Burt Reynolds.  Whatever it is in the film that makes it work, it ends up creating a story of trust, unity, and loyalty, which emerges in one of the least likely places in the world - prison.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I like a few Adam Sandler films, and this is one of them.  I admit I mostly liked the Longest Yard because I'm a big WWE fan, and the film featured stars like "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, The Great Khali, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash (and probably a few others).  It was, however, disappointing that Steve Austin was only featured in a few shots.  He should have played a bigger part.  Despite all the wrestler appearances, I would have probably liked this film anyway.<br /><br />I'm no fan of Chris Rock, but even he was pretty tolerable for the most part.  He played a nice guy in the film (well, as nice as a prisoner can be) and his parts were all pretty decent.<br /><br />I had to laugh at the end of the film when the guards thought Adam Sandler was trying to escape, so they pointed a gun to his head and thought about shooting, but changed their mind when they realized he was only walking away to pick up a football.  It was an unintentionally funny moment.<br /><br />The film did a respectable job turning a bunch of prisoners into football players.  They actually spent a good amount of time building them up, and training them, and correctly showing them how to play the game.  Overall, good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>It'd be hard enough to imagine a remake of the classic Longest Yard.  It'd be even harder to imagine a remake of the classic prison football film with Adam Sandler posing for Burt Reynolds.  Well, it became a reality, and just like you'd expect, the remake of the Longest Yard is a lame and needless remake of a classic.  Sandler plays disgraced NFLer Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, who finds himself in jail for quite some time.  The warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to assemble a team of prisoners to play his guards (led by William Fichtner) in a one-sided football game, which just so happens will be broadcast on ESPN.  Yeah, the Longest Yard is about as mainstream and product placement filled as anyone with operating brain cells can expect, and the supposedly funny and comic moments just come off as tiresome and, well, lame.  Yeah, that word has popped up a lot in this review, but I can't think of a more fitting word that suits this crud remake.  Not to mention the just plain unnecessary racist remarks to come from the guards in attempting to goad the running back (Nelly) into a fight.  The only thing that saves this crummy remake is Reynolds himself who shows up as the coach of Crewe's team, as well as a somewhat spirited performance from Chris Rock.  Not to mention that it's kind of fun to see many ex-NFLer's and greats like Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth as the guards, as well as pro wrestlers like Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash to boot.  Other than that though, saying that you're better off with the original Longest Yard is quite the understatement.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Not one of Sandler's best films, but it isn't horrible by any means. This is mainly drama, but it does have it's side jokes. Having never seen the original film, I can only judge it based on the movie alone and it is good, but not great. Everyone in the movie is really good, but the story wants to drag in scenes. But, there are some moments I thought were really funny. If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, give this a try, but if you are a fan of the original film...there is a good chance that this won't live up to it. Very few remakes ever do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Although less a review than a basic analogy, Peter Segal's 2005 remake of "The Longest Yard" is to Robert Aldrich's 1974 prison football epic as 2005 star Adam Sandler is to 1974 leading man Burt Reynolds.<br /><br />While Reynolds' Paul Crewe was a trademark '70s anti-hero, a pigskin-chucking sibling to the pragmatic rebels played by the likes of Jack Nicholson or Gene Hackman, the only real antecedent for Sandler's Crewe are the actor's own highly financially successful string of athletic loveable misfits, a character more intellectually gifted than Bobby Boucher of "The Waterboy" and more sedate than the title character in "Happy Gilmore." Reynolds could play self-destructive and willfully belligerent, a man who could demand and receive respect in the most precarious of situations. Even if he's trying to play a superstar jock, Sandler is a benign doofus, an Everyman as comfortable in a maximum security prison as Britney Spears would be at a Mensa meeting.<br /><br />Glossy where the original was gritty and raw, silly where the original was scabrously funny, cartoonish where the original was dangerous and threatening, this new "Longest Yard" aims only to be a diverting summer lark. With the help of a game and eclectic supporting cast and a spunky (but never convention-challenging) attitude, it succeeds admirably.<br /><br />Sheldon Turner's adapted screenplay stands by Tracy Keenan Wynn's original script down to the tiniest of plot details, lifting every twist and many of the most pointed conversations. Sandler is Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, a former NFL MVP quarterback booted from the league for allegedly fixing a game. He bottoms out in an elaborate escalating traffic violation that lands him in Allenville Federal Penitentiary, the personal fiefdom of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a martinet passionate about his prison football team and his own political aspirations. Distressed by his team's recent stumbles, the warden entrusts Crewe to put together a squad of inmates to go against the guards in what he assumes will be a season-opening rout. What he doesn't understand is that for the Mean Machine, this game will be a chance at revenge and vindication.<br /><br />Buried amidst the portrait of a disparate group of men bonding in adverse circumstances (a trademark Aldrich theme), the original "Longest Yard," also questioned the rehabilitating possibilities of the penal system, with an interesting racial critique on the side. Sandler's version strips away most of the thematic richness, sprinkling cheap laughs on the already fertile framework like so much natural fertilizer. None of the changes in this new version is more telling than the reimagination of the warden's secretary, a lusty young Bernadette Peters in 1974, a randy and perverse (and hilarious) Cloris Leachman now. Throw in a gang of cross-dressing cheerleaders (led by Tracy Morgan), prison sodomy jokes galore and repeated references to the prodigious size of wrestler Bill Goldberg's, um, Gold-member and this "Longest Yard" isn't better, but it's probably funnier.<br /><br />Chris Rock assists with the wisecracking humor as Caretaker, one of those obligatory prison movie inmates who knows all of the loopholes and catches in the system. Rock's acerbic one-liners are sharper than anything else in the film conveying the impression that nobody forced him to stick to the script.<br /><br />The easy interplay between Rock and Sandler probably helped create a comfortable work environment for the cast's legion of non-thespians. The reliable character actors (Cromwell, William Fichtner), genuine football stars (Michael Irvin, Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski) and professional wrestlers (Goldberg, Steve Austin) blend perfectly. None of the non-actors embarrass themselves and Cowboys' great Irvin, stretching as a star wide receiver, and rapper Nelly, as an unstoppable running back, are big screen naturals. Less successful are the appearances by various ESPN personalities, particularly Chris Berman, who proves to be even more ingratiating when his shtick is written for him than when he works off the cuff.<br /><br />Reynolds shows up in an extended cameo and he even gets the movie star entrance, striding in purposeful slo-motion with the sun setting behind him, but his presence is mostly a reminder that even at a mind-bogglingly spry 69, he's more convincing as a sporting legend than Sandler.<br /><br />Although he and Sandler have had hits with their previous collaborations ("Anger Management," "50 First Dates"), this is easily Segal's most accomplished film. Much of the credit probably goes to Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler ("Dances with Wolves"), who works with Segal to deliver vigorous football action -- set, often music video-style, to an assortment of classic rock favorites and hip hop -- to accompany the comic scenes and even one or two moments of actual pathos.<br /><br />At some point this summer, a literate independent film will be released with an R-rating because of a fleeting glimpse of a nipple or because characters discuss a sexual relationship in an emotionally honest matter (something in the "Raising Victor Vargas" vein), preventing responsible young adults from seeing the movie. When that happens, I hope those filmmakers point to "The Longest Yard" and its PG-13 rating as a sign of the MPAA ratings board's ongoing hypocrisy. Whatever the limits are for casual verbal obscenity, crass dialogue and jokes about sexual deviance, this movie pushes them.<br /><br />Sandler's core audience of young male teens and frat boys will love this movie, but the Boys Club tone (Leachman and Courteney Cox, in a fleeting cameo, are the token females) may turn off distaff viewers who would rather see the funnyman romance Drew Berrymore than do hard time.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This version is a lot funnier, and a great tribute to the classic 1974 film.

But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen, a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team. A good comedy worth seeing.

I've seen the other movie and liked it, so I thought I would check this one out as well.  I was suprised that I actually enjoyed this movie, and its a great remake of the film. I thought it might be a little over the top with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, just one bad joke to another, but it wasn't. It was very similar to the original. I think the one thing I enjoyed more about this movie that the original is the fact that they had an actual soundtrack that gave it a more polished feel. I wouldn't have guessed that it would have made that big of a difference, but it does. It's like taking the imperial march out of star wars.

Was there anything worth keeping with this nearly play by play remake that would make even the British version blush?  Outside of the hits and the music, there was absolutely nothing.  "The Longest Yard" was the sorriest sad sack of a comedy ever to be called a film.  While it tried to be identical to the first, it misses the mark mainly due to the characters, the cheap inserted jokes, and the obvious over budget.  Do we need to be spending millions of dollars to make the grass greener?  Before I begin, I want everyone to look at the box to this DVD - see Adam grinning - does he look tough enough, does he look like a QB, does he look like he can be hit by huge linebackers and live to tell?  My answer is no, and for you hoping to see a Happy Gilmore in a football jersey, you will be sadly disappointed.  This film was plastic wrap in its grandest of ways.  This film is Styrofoam when you really just needed a big belly laugh to ease the day.  This film was clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; with a VERY LOUD soundtrack.  How could this be?  Basically, this was the same film that Reynolds did a long time ago, but with Adam Sandler ... shouldn't it be funnier?<br /><br />Alas it wasn't.  How did this film fail?  After watching the original film, the British "Mean Machine", and finally this one, I came to realize that the spirit was just missing from the cast, the production, and the design.  While Sandler spewed the same lines that Reynolds did during his prime, it was difficult for me to see Sandler filling into Reynolds' boots.  The two actors are not the same, the age of America is different, and what originally was a creative film about self-discovery, turned into an over-budgeted film about trying to make the audience see those amazing hits that can be seen on ESPN.  Director Peter Segal has nobody to blame but himself.  "The Longest Yard" is one of those films that couldn't be remade today because the surrounding themes are obsolete.  The bulk of this issue falls on the casting.  I have already denounced Sandler, but Chris Rock is the icing on the cake.  He is absolutely not Caretaker.  He was not the smart, Jiminy Cricket-esque character that Crewe needed to see what was important to him in the long run.  When it comes to the quintessential pinch moment, there is no emotion - I literally didn't care what happened between the two.  They tried to be funny together with words, but the humor in the original fell in the situation, not Rock lounging around like this was his obvious first day at prison.  The rest of the story, with the miscast of these two, fell completely to the ground.  Sandler's cronies are there, Schnieder humiliating himself again, but Cromwell made me twitch again.  Where was his evil, his motive, his sinister tenacity?  Again, due to a much bigger budget, bigger stars, and a decision to make the punches bigger than the story, Segal let this film slip right out of his hands and into a failed category.<br /><br />Nothing worked in this film - at least I didn't think anything did until I finished the film and found myself humming a few bars from the music.  The music was way TOO LOUD - it distracted (like so many other elements of this remake) from the essential storylines, but it was perfect music for this film.  They strengthened the hits, made us feel like we were on the field with the team, and inspired us to root for the good guys - but the music alone doesn't create an amazing film (unless it is a musical - but I digress).  "The Longest Yard" suffered because of its poor character development, its poor casting decision, the painful story, and the insufferable direction.  Yet, the music remained a constant focus.  Thank you music team - it is the only one that I am handing out for this review.<br /><br />Overall, I hated this film.  It disgraced the original and I don't even find myself a fan of sports films.  If I had to rank these three films (the original, the remake, and the British) it would be a tight race between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds - I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did.  Sandler was a joke, Rock sunk to the bottom, and it was obvious that Reynolds was just in it for the nostalgic effect.  While the cameos by the ex-jocks would make any enthusiast drool, they try their best to hold up any remaining value to this film.  It took me two views to make it through this, while I can nearly recite all of the lines from "Happy Gilmore" or "Billy Madison".  That should be the perfect example of what horrid road Sandler has been traveling.  I would strongly suggest skipping this film.  Watch the original or import, but seem to know better what comedy is all about than Mr. Segal.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>From the people who brought you "50 First Dates" comes this synthetic remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds-Robert Aldrich crowdpleaser. Instead of a hard-edged prison population, we get caricatures and stereotypes. Adam Sandler is far more convincing as Happy Gilmore than Paul "The Wrecking" Crewe. Though a brilliant stand-up comedian, Chris Rock has yet to find his cinematic niche. The only bright spots are Reynolds (in the Michael Conrad role) and Courteney Cox.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I may not be the biggest fan on Adam Sandler but I must admit to being entertained on quite a few occasions by his films.  Now I didn't even want to see this film to tell you the truth but I had free Showtime this weekend so I said "what the heck" and turned it on.  Into the movie about ten fifteen minutes and I wasn't really impressed.  Adam was pulling his same bad boy persona and the laughs where coming slow and when they came I had to force myself to laugh.  Even after Chris Rock showed up I was a bit letdown since his one-liners were clich&eacute;.  But about a half hour in the jokes felt funnier, the chemistry started to click and the film began to pick up.  I was actually impressed by the time the credits began to roll.  So, it's not a brilliant comedy by any means, and it's certainly not Sandler's best but it's a step above mediocrity and a nice diversion from a hectic day.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Adam Sandler plays "Wrecking" Crewe, a retired football player infamous for "shaving points" off a football game many years ago. He's a drunk these days, and in his drunkeness takes off with his rich girlfriend's car, where he ends up in a mad car chase and a colossal crash. He is sentenced to three years jail, in a prison full of wardens and guards who take a little too much pleasure in punishing the prisoners. The guards have a football team, and since Crewe was once a professional football player, they turn to him for advice. Crewe suggests they play a game against a weaker side and beat them to get their confidence up. The guard's agree and get Crewe to make the weaker team, out of the prisoners! Crewe agrees and convinces his cellmates (who he isn't too popular with) to try out. Will they agree to join the team? If they do, will Crewe force them to lose?<br /><br />I remember back in high school, there was this really funny guy in our drama class. He was a fan of Adam Sandler, actually. Anyway, whenever we'd do improvisation, everyone would expect him to do something really funny. He'd end up just going through the motions, kind of a little tired and deadpan. It's kind of how Adam Sandler plays "Wrecking" Crewe. Maybe Mr Sandler's heart wasn't in this film, maybe making all these films are exhausting him, I don't know. His dialogue gives the impression that the character's kind of rebellious, but from Sandler's performance, I didn't exactly know why. Sandler's best acting here is when he has to get himself hyped up, like in the drunken car chase.<br /><br />Chris Rock, who plays the friendly cellmate Caretaker, is his usual chirpy self. The inmates are well cast, and are all interesting enough characters. Though they're criminals, they're likeable, and I ended up wanting to see them win. Being a Adam Sandler film, Rob Schneider makes a cameo, as he always does. Oh dear...<br /><br />I don't know that much about American football, but the football parts of this film were easy enough to follow. The teams strategize, play plays and such, and you don't really need to know what they are, which is good.<br /><br />Three and a half stars, but I'll round up to four. Worth a look for Adam Sandler fans. A little different, not his best, but interesting, even if it is a bit silly at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>The only reason I gave this poop 2 stars is for the role oc Chris Rock .... unfortunately he doesn't make it through the wole movie .....

Rather than live in the shadow of the original film, THE LONGEST YARD manages to set up a decent comedy of its own, despite being formulaic and cheesy at times.<br /><br />By now, you should be very familiar with the plot: Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is a former NFL star, who was indicted for throwing a game and has been recently picked up for reckless driving.  He gets the opportunity to round up a bunch of prison misfits to form a "prisoner" football team, set to go head-to-head with the prison guards.  Crewe's rag-tag bunch does remarkably well and the warden of the prison begins to worry about his chances of winning.  In turn, Crewe is faced with a moral dilemma: throw the game again and save his skin or play the game and risk his life.<br /><br />THE LONGEST YARD is the very definition of a formula comedy, but I still managed to eek out some entertainment from it.  The supporting cast is really quite superb if you take a close look at it.  While the not the greatest film I've seen all year, it does provide the people with exactly what they want: mind-numbing entertainment.  Just don't spend $20 on it.  Trust me.  You won't like it that much.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I noticed a lot of people are hostile twoards this movie and I don't see how. It was pretty humorous to me, yes the swearing and some of the jokes did make the movie lose points but hey that's an Adam Sandler comedy for you. If you look past that you can see this movie was pretty humorous and there were actors that kept this movie up. I find the plot overall interesting and the ending I rather enjoyed. It wasn't the same old cliche stuff and I liked that. It isn't the most funniest comedy I know from Sandler, but I thought it was a good one from him.<br /><br />I know people who have seen the older version of Longest Yard and they said, despite the swearing, it was an actual good remake of it. And from the humor I found from Sandler's version, I may just watch the older version. I give the new version though a good 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>In most instances the characters on this movie just recite the same lines as in the 1974 original except when Crewe unnecessarily explains his actions to his team mates. Their biggest achievements appear to be a basketball game to convince the black inmates to join them against the guards, vulgarizing the hilarious warden secretary from the original film and adding plenty of distateful jokes. Adam Sandler is his usual annoying and uncharming self and if you believe him as a pro-QB you probably beleived Burt Reynolds as "Boss Hogg".<br /><br />What a waste of celuloid !</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I love the original, and I've heard good things about this one. I saw enough to learn the subtitles are unreadably Chinglish, and that I won't understand the dialogue unless it's loud. The video is low quality, as if some guy pirated it with a camera in a theater. So I'm going to pick another time to watch it. I'm not in the mood tonight.<br /><br />It starts outside prison, which never happened in the original, and with Adam Sandler being difficult to watch as usual. If you've seen this, and if you love the NFL the way I do, tell me the truth. Is this crap?<br /><br />Oh, and let me share the cover blurb with you. "Protect is a red very a fit of occupation rugby contestant ever, but was closed into because of a certain reason jail. The jail grows the cool love rugby, however born nature Endure. He hires the exclusively those excel the jail that play the rugby, letting them proceeding with prisoners' game." Yeah, I think Roger Ebert wrote that.<br /><br />** UPDATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING THE CORRECT DVD **<br /><br />The first eight minutes reminded me why I hate Adam Sandler. Actually, I didn't need that long. That's just how long it took to end the drunken party of a sort that only happens (I hope) in Hollywood movies with overworked stereotypes, and the car chase with cops who are overworked stereotypes. And Adam Sandler, himself an overworked stereotype portraying a character who is yet another overworked stereotype. Convinced that this was the only scene he and his peeps felt compelled to splice onto the original movie, all of which happens IN PRISON, I ejected the DVD and got back to it three days later.<br /><br />Segment three begins with Sandler's arrival in prison. However, it isn't a real prison. It only exists in Hollywood movies. It's where they lock up the cliches. I waded through ten more boring minutes of prison guard violence, brutal crotch hits and so-called wisecracks. The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.<br /><br />"The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared." I never thought I'd type those words.<br /><br />At last, the movie. What came before was backstory in the original film. I dunno why they felt they had to show it now when they were only going to tell it later, since it was too boring to show. Oh well.<br /><br />When this film got down to the football itself, that's when it got real. This one isn't for the girlie girls, okay? Since there were many NFL players in this film, football is what they know. Kinda surprising the prison wasn't more realistic, though, since many NFL players know that subject as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hell out of its juvenile humor in a testosterone-charged way. I appreciate what it has to say about football, prisons, violence, and whatever else it's on about. How brutal was the original? So brutal that this one was less so in spots. They tinkered with a few bits, but in a good way. A homage not a copy, they say. I agree. It's excellent. I'll keep it and watch it again, skipping the first 20 minutes or so, and I'll love the hell out of it. It's a damn shame to think everything else Sandler makes will probably suck like the parts of this movie I'll keep skipping.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Let's face it.  Hitting refs with a football in their own very personal foul areas is just funny.  Fortunately, there's a lot more funny stuff where that came from in this comedic remake of The Longest Yard.  I was never a big fan of the original, so I can't compare and contrast the two here.  What I can say is that the remake, which milks as many stereotypes as it can find for all their comedic worth, is a genuinely funny movie.  There's no effort to make some kind of sociological argument here.  The Longest Yard is just a comedy, pure and simple.  Even the one serious moment in the film doesn't really hit you with anything more than surprise at what just happened.<br /><br />With the tandem of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock leading the way, you know you're going to do some laughing.  Combining two such heavyweight comedians in one film, though, is a handicap in some ways because your expectations may be too high going in.  That's probably why some viewers don't think the film is funny enough for their liking.  I think the inclusion of Burt Reynolds in the cast was a bit of risk, but the role of the old veteran really fits in perfectly with the script.  The rest of the cast is a hodgepodge of surprising faces: Cloris Leachman as the warden's lecherous (and thereby disgusting) secretary; professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg (who, like Burt Reynolds, did play college FB), Kevin Nash, and Steve Austin; former NFL players Michael Irvin (Michael Irvin as a prison inmate is perfect casting, if you ask me), Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth (who was in the NFL only long enough for my man Bo Jackson to run him over on Monday Night Football).  With Sandler serving as executive director, you have to wonder how this motley crew of individuals could have been held together long enough to actually make a movie.  You can't argue with results, though.<br /><br />There's not much to the story.  Paul Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL MVP whose career ended with a point shaving scandal.  Now, six years later, he seems determined to ruin his life completely and winds up in the big house, Texas-style.  The warden wants him to help get his prison guard football team in shape for the upcoming season, and he ends up recruiting a team of convicts to take on the guards in a pre-season game.  All of the inmates hated him at first, with the exception of Caretaker (Chris Rock), so he's got his work cut out even fielding a team, let alone teaching them how to play.  There are some bad dudes in the joint, though, and the opportunity to crack heads with the hated guards can be a pretty powerful recruiting tool.  The game itself turns into a big event, as ESPN2 and Chris Berman come in to broadcast it nation-wide.  You know everything that's going to happen, but it doesn't matter one iota.  The closest thing you get to suspense is your natural curiosity over the possibility of Burt Reynolds' overstretched face popping at any given moment.<br /><br />Is this Adam Sandler or Chris Rock at his best?  No, not by a long shot.  Still, it's a consistently funny film, and you just can't go too far wrong with a combination of comedy and football - not with male viewers, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>If you don't know the original with Burt Reynolds, while not a horrible movie, this movie still has a big problem:  Adam Sandler is simply too small with too non-athletic a physique to be believable as an MVP quarterback from the NFL.  When the original came out in 1974, a six foot quarterback was still believable and the six foot eight giants of today were still rare.  Nowadays, someone who is five foot ten is simply too small except as a running back or a wide receiver.<br /><br />That aside, the movie does take a few twists from the original.  Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the "superstar" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.  However, if you want the better telling of this story, go rent the original 1974 movie with Burt Reynolds.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Some people are complaining that the Remake of The Longest Yard is not funny enough.  But if you're familiar with the original, you know that while there was a lot of comedy, there was also an ample amount of drama as well.  In a refreshing change in a remake, Director Peter Segal who also directed Sandler in "50 First Dates" and "Anger Management" decided to stick to the spirit of the original film.  Too often directors of remakes try to put their own stamp on them and end up changing too much of the story, such as with the recent Dawn of the Dead remake.<br /><br />Segal basically runs the show scene for scene from the original with some cosmetic changing of characters.  Caretaker is now a black man (Chris Rock).  The role that Richard Kiel played as Sampson is now played by the behemoth black wrestler Bob Sapp as Switkoski.  The Role of the baddest cat in the joint which was Connie Shokner in the original, is now played by Giant Indian wrestler Dalip Singh as Turley.<br /><br />Other than these character changes, about the only other major change is that less time is devoted to Pau Crewes (Sandler) life in the joint and his interaction with the other prisoners.  The remake dispenses with that aspect and gets right into Crewe having to assemble a team of inmates to give the guards a tune-up game at the insistence of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell).<br /><br />Sandler probably isn't the athlete that Burt Reynolds was.  Reynolds did play college football afterall, but he pulled off his role as quarterback pretty well.  Rock is toned down a bit from his usual manic personality and Nick Turturro provides the comic relief and the butt of most of the jokes as Brucie.<br /><br />The film is loaded with personalities from wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, and Bill Goldberg, to former NFL stars Michael Irvin and Bill Romanowski.  Throw in sports personalities Jim Rome and Chris Berman and you really have an all-star event.<br /><br />The actual football action was pretty well choreographed.  It's easy to spot who were the real athletes and who were the actors, though.  All in all this is a worthy remake that holds up well to the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>I like the Longest Yard despite what the critics said. It had plenty of laughs and addition of Burt Reynolds who has more pivotal in this movie than the original was awesome. The teaming of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock was genius at best. The cameo of Courteney Cox was entertaining and funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>This year there's some remakes that didnt make the cut (The Amityville Horror which was like the boring original) and there's one in mind that did (Assault On Precinct 13 which wasnt that bad) and unpcoming one's (The Pink Panther, King Kong...etc). The Longest Yard is one of the ones that didnt make the cut and which is utterly stupid with some funny one liners in it but otherwise its a Adam Sandler/Peter Segal failure. Sandler (Spanglish) plays ex-quaterback Paul Crewe who's career went down the toilet after he shaved points on a football game...so, he takes his bitchy girlfriends car, that would be Courtney Cox Arquette (Friends), in a drunken manner he piles 5 or 7 police cars ontop of one another and winds up going to prison...a country prison which a footballl fanatic Warden, played by James Cromwell (Babe). The guards are real nasty to its inmates and Sandler finds that out the hard way as he fights and gets into mischief. So, Warden Cromwell tells Sandler to make a team of inmates to play football against his guards and so Sandler does so with the help of the caretaker, played by Chris Rock (Madagascar) in a throwaway role and old timer Coach, played by Burt Reynolds (Dukes Of Hazzard) who played Sandler's part in the 1974 original. Not much fun here, with the usual Sandler raunchiness this comedy tries to take itself serious in some parts but its all too laughable when it does and most of the cast is rendered dumb. Also starring Rapper Nelly (Snipes) who cant act worth crap, Dallas Cowboy Wide Reciever Michael Irvin who is right along with Nelly, William Fichtner (Armageddon), Brian Bosworth (One Man's Justice), Bill Goldberg (Universal Soldier 2), Stone Cold Steve Austin, Tracy Morgan (SNL), Nicholas Tuturro (NYPD Blue) and a cameo by Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow Movies). Some people might find this entertaining but I certainly dont. Stick with the original people....hey Burt, what the hell man?</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>When I told my mom I was going to go and see "The Longest Yard" she asked me who was in it. I mentioned Adam Sandler and Chris Rock and then mentioned that Burt Reynolds was also in it. Familiar with the 1974 original, she jokingly asked if Reynolds was going to play the `Coach' in the remake. I said I didn't think so, there was no indication of that in the trailer. After watching the film, I can report that my mother was right. She knew he would be playing the Coach because it is a clich&eacute; and "The Longest Yard" is filled with clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler), an ex-quarterback in the NFL convicted of point shaving, goes on a joyride in his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox - Arquette) Bentley. Crashing into a series of police cars, he violates his probation and is sent to Allenville Penitentiary in Texas. Upon arrival, the Warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to help his Guard's football team prepare for the new season. The Captain of the Guard (William Fichtner) warns him against participating. He doesn't want the convicts help. Caretaker (Chris Rock) befriends Crewe, who seems to be universally disliked due to the point shaving scandal. Together, they set about forming a team to play the guards, and events quickly escalate. Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former Heismann Trophy winner, offers to help coach the team. Soon, the game attracts the attention of the national media and the Warden, who has designs on the Texas Governor's office, plays along.<br /><br />Sandler's company is one of the producers of the film and Sandler is listed as an executive producer. My question is: Why? In his last few `comedies', Sandler has essentially become the straight man to other, funnier actors. In "Mr. Deeds", John Turturro stole the film. Granted, it wasn't difficult, but when you are a comedian, making $20 million per film, you should be funny. In "The Longest Yard", Sandler essentially hands the reigns to Rock, who is easily the funniest thing in the film. There are more scenes of Sandler being beaten up by prison guards, football players, basketball players, etc. than there are of any comedy.<br /><br />Most of Rock's laughs are generated from comments he makes about other members of their ragtag football team. The other players are your basic tried and true stereotypes, stereotypes that you will recognize from any sports - themed or prison film. Because these characters are so tired and boring, his comedy is lacking.<br /><br />You have: The old geezer who has seen all and knows all, the psychotic guy who can run fast, but also wants to kill everything, the big, lumbering lummox who won't talk to anyone until Crewe takes an extra moment or two to talk to him, the extremely overweight guy who just has to be on the team, if only to provide an excuse for fat jokes, the politically ambitious warden who thinks televising a game between his guards and convicts will be a good thing for his career, the guard with a `heart of gold' who eventually sees the light. There is also a group of transvestites (led by Tracy Morgan of "Saturday Night Live") who dress up in cheerleader's outfits for the big game. Yawn. Double yawn.<br /><br />If the filmmakers had managed to do anything, anything at all, original with the story or the characters, the movie would be a little more enjoyable. Let's face it, if you are going to see a sports-themed film, in all likelihood, the underdog is going to win. I can think of only two instances where this was not the case. The reason the underdog always wins? To help create suspense. But since we know the underdog will always win, how much suspense does this type of story create? Zero. What else is there? No suspense. Dumb characters. Predictable story. Hmmmm. Nothing. There is nothing else.<br /><br />I think the filmmakers realized this as well. During the football scenes, they seem determined to show some sort of visual style. What this means is that every time someone makes a catch or tackles someone, the action will slow down, then at the point of impact, stop, and then start moving again. Actually, this in of itself, is a clich&eacute;. We have seen this technique used in a number of films, music videos, commercials, the like. They use another technique of splitting the screen into various different images, so we can `follow the action'. This might have been interesting except more then one of these images is blurry and sort of calls into question the whole technique. Why do we need to see a blurry image when five other things are going on at the same time? We don't.<br /><br />The film is also filled with a number of unbelievable things. Sandler as a quarterback? At one point, Reynold's character calls Crewe a natural athlete, just before he starts playing basketball. Adam Sandler? Also, how does someone living in San Diego get sent to prison in Texas, especially when they are simply serving the remaining three years of a sentence? This doesn't seem realistic. Granted, many comedies are unrealistic in many ways, but it helps if they have some grounding in the real world. It makes the comedy more memorable if we think these situations, characters, etc. have some basis in reality. Nothing in "The Longest Yard" has a basis in reality.<br /><br />"The Longest Yard" will probably find an audience, but hopefully it won't be any of you.</p></br></body></html>

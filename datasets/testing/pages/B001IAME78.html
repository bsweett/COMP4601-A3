The first time we saw Edward Norton on the big screen he was playing a key role alongside Richard Gear in Primal Fear. Norton was so amazing in his performance that we have become fans of his.<br /><br />Here, Norton plays Bruce Banner, a scientist that travels fast from place to place, avoiding detection by those who want to turn what he carries inside into a powerful weapon. We find him working and surviving among the thousands that live in the Fabellas of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where from a bottling company, he is in communication with a US scientist, attempting to eliminate the effects of the military experiment that has transformed him into an enormous creature, capable of anything, with a powerful force that can send automobiles into the air as if they were Frisbees.<br /><br />Bruce is also learning the art of self control while receiving training on how to lower his heart rate through breathing and muscle exercises. When his heart rate is fast, he transforms, so we see him struggle to keep it low and to control emotions such as passion, rage, anger and love.<br /><br />William Hurt plays the part of General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, the man responsible for the project that has left Bruce in his present condition and who is after Bruce so he can make many just like him. The General also happens to be the father of the girl Bruce is in love with; Betty, played by Liv Tyler.<br /><br />The General is unable to capture Bruce in Brazil and Bruce escapes. We see him next in Guatemala, where a farmer finds him shivering in the cold of the jungle and takes him into town. There we see a rather funny scene as Bruce acquires clothing that can stretch as he transforms into the Hulk and because he can't determine the size... he tests it against the bottom of a rather large female that stands behind him.<br /><br />Next, he returns to the USA in search for a solution from the scientist he has been corresponding with, and when he finds him, he realizes that the doctor has kept samples and has test subjects that can progress the experiment. By now, the General has enlisted the help of an older soldier who seems to be capable of anything and wants nothing but to remain a fighter. This soldier confronted the Hulk back in Brazil and dreams of being able to fight against him, so he agrees to undergo experiments to see if he too can transform into a powerful "abomination."<br /><br />The scenes that follow are amazing, the fights a bit contrived, but the pace of this movie is wonderful as we go from place to place following the struggle between the two monsters. Hulk is simply a movie worth seeing and a wonderful resurfacing of one of our favorite superheroes. One of the most appreciated moments were when the producer provided cameo appearances by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey, Jr. bringing all our favorite superheroes together. Don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I wish I could explain eloquently how changed I am about an opinion on a film. Watching the BD is experiencing an entirely different and much better movie.<br /><br />Technically, this is a 5 star product. I played it both on plasmas and LCDs over the last few days and it looks excellent. Paused well over 50 different scenes (motion and still scenes) and everything looks as it should for what they were trying to create. The filmmakers held an exclusive BD screening to show off their special effects and their pride in how the fx came across, so the resulting look is reasonably solid. The usual Universal menus and selection sounds are throughout, and all of the typical BD features are enabled/possible here.<br /><br />The resounding difference here are the deleted scenes. There are over 42 minutes of all the best parts left for us to interject back into the film. The reason I did not give this a 5 star is they should have made the choice to have the BD be the 2 hour 35 minute cut. The majority of every gripe I have heard about this film is answered or fixed with these scenes. Christina Cabot (Major), Ty Burrel (psych boyfriend), and Peter Mensah (the other General) all had their characters ripped to shreds with this theatrical cut. There was actually a good side to Roth, there was actually tons of character development; all apparently cut (in my opinion) to dumb down the film. What a waste.<br /><br />Be sure to have your speakers adjusted correctly because this sound mix can blow a sub or mids if you have them set to high. Great sounds, great clarity and plenty of features. Highly recommend as a purchase, and the only shortcoming is on the director for giving a 3 second intro to the deleted scenes that stated nothing of why he destroyed this film by cutting them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the run from the authorities after conducting an experiment to himself that made him into a green and powerful brute called The Hulk (Voiced by Lou Ferringo) as he hides himself in Brazil where he can find inner-peace with himself. While he searches for a cure to his condition, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is and tracks him down so he and his soldiers can take them alive to conduct experiments. As Banner returns back to the states, he is reunited with the love of his life Betty (Liv Tyler) and accidently releases his rage to become the Hulk on some soldiers with Betty as the only thing that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with the same gamma that made Banner the Hulk when he's angry as it later transforms him into a hideous monster called The Abomination who's powers matches the Hulk's as the green goliath is the only one that can stop it.<br /><br />Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee film which wasn't too bad but left a bad taste to most people's mouths. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton has made a stand-alone movie that remains more true to the roots of both the comic books and the classic 70's TV show with Bill Bixby. The special effects are a vast improvement over the last one with the Hulk being more convincing and less cartoonish this time, the action is non-stop and the performances are just terrific including Norton as the tortured soul Bruce Banner. There's special appearences by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee and Robert Downy Jr as Tony Stark which leads up to a big Marvel event movie coming in 2011.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the best quality picture and sound that is mindblowing like the film itself! the extras are outstanding like the U-Control mode where you can watch extras during the movie or after the movie. There's a BD-Chat where you can hook the internet to your Blu-Ray player to make your own commentary with other people on-line plus some great extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate opening, Comic Book gallery, character files, picture in picture access where you can see interviews and behind the scenes footage during the movie, animated comic, four featurettes and digital copy with the Blu-Ray box-cover in limited edition 3-D.<br /><br />Nice to see Marvel getting back on track on film with this and "Iron Man" being examples.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Back in the seventies television attempted to bring the story of the Incredible Hulk, Marvel Comics gargantuan green goliath to the small screen. It succeeded in telling not the story of just the monster but of the man inside, trying to find a way to stop the dangerous beast inside.<br /><br />In 2005, we had another version arrive, this time directed by Ang Lee. While Lee is noted for his storytelling ability, there was no way he was the man to bring this character to the big screen. Plotlines were change to accommodate the times and the director leaving fans with a less than favored film.<br /><br />This year director Louis Letterrier who worked with Corey Yuen on THE TRANSPORTER and directed THE TRANSPORTER 2, takes over and finally give the monster his due. With touching scenes between ill fated lovers and fight sequences that have to be seen to be believed, this film finally does the tale justice.<br /><br />The film semi-bypasses the last by giving us glimpses of the creation of the Hulk. Gamma radiated scientist Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) has no chance of stopping the release of his inner rage in the form of the giant green monster that dwells within. Somewhat of a take on the old Jekyll and Hyde story, the Hulk destroys his lab and injures the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler).<br /><br />The Hulk also incurs the wrath of the man behind the project, Gen. "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt). Warning Banner to stay away from Betty, his daughter, Banner heads out. When he realizes Ross wants what is inside to use as a weapon, he leaves.<br /><br />We learn all of this from the credits as the story unfolds with no dialogue. We end in Brazil with Banner working in a soft drink bottling plant and messaging back and forth with a "Mr.Blue" as he continues to search for a cure. But Gen. Ross gets a lead on him and sends in the troops to capture him, led by Maj. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).<br /><br />Blonsky fails to capture Banner/The Hulk but is fascinated with what he saw. Demanding to be put in the loop, he eventually convinces Ross to use him as a guinea pig in a process that may result in a soldier with the power to take down the Hulk.<br /><br />After Banner reunites with Betty, Ross finds him and a clash is at hand. Cornered, Banner turns once move into the Hulk on a small Virginia college campus. With soldiers and a ton of firepower behind them as well as the now enhanced Blonsky, the Hulk takes to the battlefield. It is only when he fears for Betty's safety that he finds the strength to turn the tide, running off with Betty in hand.<br /><br />Now an accomplice to Banner's attempt to find a cure, Betty aids him in an attempt to unite with Mr. Blue to find the cure. At the same time, Blonsky finds himself altering even more. When he gets Mr. Blue to provide the same sort of radiation that Banner suffered, he becomes the Abomination, a nearly unstoppable creature that perhaps only the Hulk can stop.<br /><br />The film moves back and forth on three levels. The first and most obvious is the monster whose rampages leave in their wake a ton of destruction. The second is the unrequited love story between Banner and Betty. And the last is the story of a man literally possessed who seeks release.<br /><br />The acting in this film is fantastic as two dimensional characters are given life on screen. Norton not only looks the part but turns in a performance that ranges from rage to pathos, at times showing an almost unbearable sadness in little more than a look. Tyler does a great job as well, offering a love interest that cares deeply about the man she loves. Hurt and Roth both do a commendable job as well, but leave their characters in their two dimensional forms offering little more.<br /><br />The CGI used to simulate the Hulk is top of the line. It is like a seamless painting where the entire landscape is laid before your eyes. You will believe that this creature exists. Even CGI haters have found this portrayal excellent.<br /><br />A great story, acting on top of it's game, effects that rival almost any seen and the comic book creation brought to screen in a tribute that pays homage to the original source rather than attempt to make it something it is not. You get it all with this package. And while I liked this summer's IRON MAN much more, this movie does offer escapist entertainment at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>December 9, 2008<br /><br />This is an update of my original review. Since that time, I have purchased the special 3 disc set and now its Blu-Ray version! Both look great on an HDTV and the Blu-Ray version is VERY clear!<br /><br />As for the film itself, let me tell you it will make you forget about the 2003 film Hulk! While the TV version with the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno will always be the Hulk to me, this is the way you should do the comic Hulk!<br /><br />These guys definitely took the best from both the TV show and the comics and blended them together into one great film. This film definitely gets a 5 star rating from me for non-stop action and a little bit of drama and storytelling. While I am sure everyone knows, it ties into the recent Iron-Man release. Perhaps a showdown between the two on the big screen soon? We'll see!<br /><br />Back to this, the transformations are great and they make more sense here than in Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003. While the Hulk did get stronger as he got angrier, I don't recall any version of him growing due to the rage! That made it a bit ridiculous to me. Here, he stays a consistent size and it just as menacing and scary at times. The villian Emil Blonsky (The Abomination) is much better than the villian in Hulk (though Nick Nolte did do a good job with what he had in 2003) and an actual threat to The Hulk.<br /><br />Overall, this won't be a waste of your money, no matter what version you get! This is a must buy for comic fans and action junkies!</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>This movie takes an awful lot for granted, like assuming that everyone is already well acquainted with the Hulk before they started to watch this version.  The flashback reminders that zip through the opening credits don't help.  They never paused long enough to jar one's memory or give a boost to someone who has absolutely no idea who or what the Hulk is and why it's dangerous to make him angry.<br />Never mind, sorry, no time to pause... before you know it, ready or not, new story, new locale, new actor, brief homage to Bill Bixby and a walk-on by Lou Ferrigno, and we're off.<br />Why is he in Brazil of all places?  I know he's hiding out and all that, but still, Brazil?  It's not as if he wasn't easily found there.  I'd also like to know exactly where he lost his personality, Mexico?  Did they hire Edward Norton only because he sufficiently looked the part of a scientist/geek?  Or did they want someone so invisible that when the Hulk appears he really stands out?  And why was Tim Roth in this movie?  Anyone could have played that part, a stand-in even.  Was he hired for his lack of height?  As for William Hurt (I don't care if he did win an Oscar several decades ago), he only comes across as ruthless because they wrote him that way; he brings absolutely no menace to the part on his own.  Come to think on it, the only good parts in this movie were the three action sequences set so far apart I almost fell asleep waiting for them.  Each one an ambush; how many times can you ambush this guy before it figures it out, which he didn't, so I guess the answer is: he's a sucker for a good or bad ambush every time!  And this guy was supposed to be a brilliant scientist!  Hello!  He had enough sense not to use credit cards or cell phones yet he sends an email that's easily traced!?  Now that's congenitally stupid.<br />This, for me, was an extremely frustrating movie (the very end only made it worse).  I hope there's not a 3rd attempt to get the green guy right.<br />(I had a hunch I wasn't going to like this movie, which explains why I stalled so long before watching it.  And no, it's not a keeper.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>I think we can all safely say we've put that 2003 attempt at a Hulk movie out of our minds. Sure it was aweful, and made some of us sweat with sheer hatred at the boredom we suffered. When made aware of this film some simply sighed and said, "keep Ang Lee as far away as possible" he's a great director but isn't a comic book movie maker. This adaptation wasn't a sequel, nor was it a reinvention, it was simply a nudge in the right direction and had Louis Leterrier say this is how it should have been done.<br /><br />Ed Norton now takes the role as Bruce Banner and is supported by the sexually appealing Liv Tyler. Yes, I said sexually appealing. The film starts off in Brazil where Bruce is hiding from the United States army and keeping the Hulk at bay. He works in a bottling plant and one day cuts himself leaving a drop of blood in one of the bottles, which makes an un-witting Stan Lee very ill indeed. By the way, off topic a little but can Stan Lee please stop with the cameos. Yeah, we get it Stan, you came up with the characters it doesn't mean you have to appear in every single Marvel movie ever made.<br />Back on topic. The Army track Bruce through the sick Stan Lee and employ Emil Blonsky, a man who's very high ranking in the British Royal Marines and is entrusted to bring Banner back to the states. Things don't go too well and the Hulk is awakened and destroys the soldiers, escaping once again. Blonsky isn't happy and with the help of General Thadeus Ross, he is put in the super soldier program for round two with the Hulk.<br />Meanwhile, Banner wants a cure for the Hulk so he seeks out Betty Ross to help him cure himself along with the help of the mysterious Mr. Blue.<br /><br />I can't really go further into the story as it all comes together at the end in one excellent climax, but as you can see in the cover it involves Abomination in some way. In my review title I mention that this is a nod to everything Hulk and I wasn't kidding. Just the little things you tend to notice more if they're familiar to you. The nod to the TV show with Lou Ferrigno having a cameo and a nod to the games in the final scene, Hulk smashes a police car in two and uses the parts as make shift boxing gloves. Comparing it to the first movie, this has definitely taken more inspiration from the comics. Utilising comic villains and giving a possible hint to a villain in a future installment. The look and general feel of the film are very cartoon like but are still very cool.<br /><br />Hopefully this, along with Iron Man will lead to much more comic inspired comic book movies being made. Sure, you can give us a comic movie with the main hero, but it's not really a comic movie if you take that character and change the world around them. A very enjoyable movie and worth the time, especially for the end fight sequence between Abomination and Hulk.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The film was just AWESOME! HULK was done perfectly. Massively powerful yet completely life-like and believable at the same time.  It is a film that will appeal to all ages and genders.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Is it too much to ask to have the actual Hulk look like a real living, breathing, being?  This creature was so cartoonish my suspension of disbelief evaporated even faster than a Liv Tyler tear, making the INCREDIBLE HULK a most annoying viewing experience.  Don't get me wrong:  I truly admire comic-based movies that are engaging and well made (case in point, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man</a>); but when the action hero is presented so grotesquely over the top as this version of The Hulk, all bets are off.<br /><br />Which is kind of sad, as I'm a big fan of Ed Norton films (and this is the first one of his movies that I did not enjoy); yet Norton's considerable talent is wasted here, as he's little more than a prop between monster manifestations.  Liv Tyler is a solid thespian as well (and easy on the eye), but she, too, seems to be going through the motions.  William Hurt plays a great villain, and is one of INCREDIBLE HULK's few positives, while all I could do was just laugh at Tim Roth as a deranged soldier turned Hulk Antagonist (and if you think Hulk is over the top, wait 'til you see Roth's Cloverfield-looking get-up).<br /><br />Lastly, Norton's Bruce Banner character always wears elastic-band pants under his everyday clothes so that should he "change" he will at least be modestly attired.  My take is, once he Hulks up into his giant green bling, who the heck is gonna protest he's in the raw?  Like I said about INCREDIBLE HULK. . .annoying.<br />--D.

Louis Leterrier who was second unit director on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008AOVL">The Transporter</a> & promoted to director on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTITKS">Transporter 2</a> took the helm and kept the pace moving as the special effects shine.<br /><br />The reason this film works so well is that Edward Norton is an amazing actor.  He adds reality and commitment to even the comic book world of the Hulk.  Norton has two Oscar nominations for "Primal Fear" in 1996 & "American History X" in 1998.  He was nominated as Best Actor by the Independent Spirit Awards for the lyrical and moving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>.  As Bruce, his calm demeanor is the perfect foil for the wild anger of the Hulk.<br /><br />Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross (sounds like Betsy Ross) who was in love with Bruce.  She carries her torch for him and serves as the damsel in distress.  Oscar winner William Hurt plays Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, a military man who wears his patriotism with blinders on & places his own career interest above his daughter's love & respect.  Tim Roth does a great job as the loony Emil Blonsky who transforms into a bigger hulk.  Tim Blake Nelson was named Best Director for "O" by the Seattle International Film Festival.  In this film he plays Samuel Sterns, aka Mr. Blue, who is jazzed about the scientific possibilities that the Hulk's physiology contains.  Ty Burrell who was in "Black Hawk Down" has a strong appearance as Leonard, Betty's new beau who sticks up for her to her father, even after she's dropped everything to help Bruce.  Christina Cabot who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AP0MW">The Maldonado Miracle</a> has a strong showing as Major Kathleen Sparr who stands up for what's right.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting.  The Brazilian scenes immerse us in an exotic culture.  This is a film that is able to rivet us because of the excellent elements and Edward Norton's outstanding screen presence.

Much more watchable, because the people are interesting. CGI is CGI. Roth is as usual, super.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The first thing you'll notice is that there are no giant poodles in "The Incredible Hulk". That's a good thing. While Ang Lee's first film had merit, it was flawed and we won't even discuss the silliness factor of a trio of giant dogs attacking Hulk in that film. Director Louis Leterrier's film manages to be both a smashing action film AND a bit of character study returning unashamedly to the comic book roots of the character. This is a fun popcorn flick with really good performances.<br /><br />The opening titles of the film give us a recap of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) became the Hulk ignoring the more complex origin of Lee's film. We catch up with Banner in South America working in a soda factory and working on a cure with the help of "Mr. Blue" a researcher in the United States. All it takes is a drop of blood in a contaminated soda bottle for General Ross (William Hurt) to locate Banner who he considers to be government property. Putting Blodsky (Tim Roth) a Russian born British soldier in charge of the retrieval, Ross and his team try and take Banner only to have him Hulk out on them.<br /><br />When "Mr. Blue" suggests that if he had all the data he might have a cure for him, Bruce Banner visits the only person that would have it--Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Unfortunately for Banner, General Ross manages to track him down and sents a genetically altered Blodsky after Banner with destructive results.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with great picture quality. In fact it's so good that you can see some scenes that should have been rendered in CGI a bit better than they were but weren't because of budget constraints. Nevertheless, "The Incredible Hulk" is a step up visually from Ang Lee's film from 2003 with Eric Bana with a ribbed but more realistic looking Hulk and his foe Abomination. The final showdown between the two of them combines CGI and miniature work nearly seamlessly.<br /><br />The extras include about 40 minutes of deleted/edited scenes including an alternate opening where Bruce treks to the Arctic and, supposedly, if you look really carefully you can see Captain America buried in the ice just before Banner Hulks out. The deleted scenes are in 480i.<br /><br />We also get a number of cool featurettes including two that show how they used motion capture and the actors to create their CGI counterparts in the film. There's also a "Making of" featurette (sponsered by Volkswagon!), a dossier that gives us information on the characters, picture-in-picutre (courtesy of Ucontrol)that allows you to compare scenes from the comic book that inspired scenes in the film as well as animatics and storyboards. The Blu-ray Live feature is also enabled for this disc so if you have a Playstation 3 you can go on line to discuss the film, etc. There's also a digital version of the film that you can load on to your PC and into iTunes or a Windows player if you so choose.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" may lack the angst of Ang Lee's film "Hulk" but it does make up for that lack of angst with a load of action. It's a pity that we didn't get the theatrical cut and Edward Norton's more character driven version as well on this set as that might have rivaled Lee's film in that department. It's hard to tell from the deleted scenes included here simply because they aren't integrated into the film. A lot were cut for good reason while some would have given the film additional depth.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" is a very good action flick that could have used a bit more character depth but even as presented it's a fun piece of entertainment that almost equals "Iron Man".</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>There is not some reworking of the comic book character, so the movie is focused on action scenes which truly capture this unique super hero in fist-throwing romps. Actor and co-screenwriter Edward Norton portrays Bruce Banner in a way to push things to the computer-generated - and highly cartoonish - Incredible Hulk, who clearly is the star.<br /><br />Without a complicated backstory and rapid pace - though it may have too much of a video game feel for some - the battles of the Incredible Hulk are...well, incredible; especially when the military futilely throws all types of gadgetry at the large one. This emerging franchise has mapped out a solid plan to become a successful second-tier hit in the future summers of super heroes on the large screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>I'm not the type to obstinately dig-in when I'm proven wrong.<br /><br />So I admit - I was wrong in dismissing this follow-up to the Ang Lee disaster.<br /><br />That first Hulk movie was just about the most blatant example of celluloid excrement I can think of when the category is 'super hero'. Admittedly, 'Superman's III and IV' and the moronic Joel Shumacher '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXO">Batman</a>' films certainly requires liberal doses of liquid brain bleach when screened. But I've always categorized those as infantile satire - not real films.<br /><br />No question Lee has talent - none. But let's be honest and say there are obvious limits to that talent. And his attempt at the world of comicdom is where that line exists. Sans flying kung fu priestesses and lonely men in tents, the first incarnation of the Hulk redefined the term "the living dead" - as most of the audience, including myself, were virtually flatlined having sat through that mind-numbing crapfest.<br /><br />An announced revamp of the entire project did little to recharge my enthusiasm. There was absolutely no way I was going to go through another monstrosity without the monster. A difficult decision given how much of a fan I am all the actors attached to the sequel; most especially Tim Roth, a favorite performer. But I usually make an effort to avoid the axiom definition of insanity.<br /><br />Fast forward four years. Just screened '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083SBMBM">Marvel's: The Avengers</a>'. Wow - incredible film!<br /><br />My curiosity was piqued. Watch the only original Avenger flick that I intentionally avoided? Take the chance of being ticked off again at expending funds and, more importantly, wasting time screening another pile?<br /><br />Ah screw it.<br /><br />Couple of hours later - I was wrong.<br /><br />This was not bad. Not bad at all. It wasn't quite the quality of the '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JMSIRC">Iron Man</a>' films, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P8A">Thor</a>' or '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IZLPMY">Captain America</a>' - but it was close. And any improvement from the Lee disaster would be reason to celebrate. So I'm giving a lot of credit to Director Louis Leterrier. He saved the character from the well-deserved bitterness directed at the utter failure of the first film.<br /><br />Had a decently fun time and, more importantly, I was able to engage the characters this time around. Bruce, Betsy, William Hurt's lesser interpretation of General Ross (Sam Elliot was the lone performance from the original that I enjoyed) and even the fully CGI'd Other Guy.<br /><br />The script struck the right blend of action and thoughtful insight - bringing us into the terrible existence of Dr. Banner as he runs, hiding in various third-world bleep holes, desperately trying to avoid the relentless pursuit by the government. The refreshing plot proposition that he's "property" owned by the United States, and not a man with an illness, certainly added unexpected depth to the story.<br /><br />Additionally, the clever nods to the original television Hulk - incorporating Joe Harnell's haunting soundtrack, the rain soaked walking man, and other fun cameos added a lot of value to the rental fee. However, I do kinda wish the filmmakers showed what happened to Stan Lee when he drank that very special bottle.  :-D<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- Again, having recently watched 'The Avengers', I noticed the calendar. Almost a full decade had passed since that terrible first film. Amazing how much better, how much more improved the character was when Mark Ruffalo took on the role. Proof that some particularly adept directors, like Joss Whedon, can learn from the mistakes of others. I'm always amazed that some directors actually listen to fans; they're usually so high on themselves, disconnected from reality - i.e. Joel Shumacher - that nothing penetrates their egos.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- Disliked one of the plot threads because it was left unanswered: What happened to Bruce's dog? As a person who considers the four-legged ones his kids, stuff like this tends to irritate. Would you forget your kid? Just sayin'.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This is a vast improvement over the Ang Lee Hulk movie.

I just wish the would of cast Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in this movie it would of made it a little better, he does a great job as the Hulk in the Avengers. I am not saying Edward Norton did a bad job as the Hulk but it seemed to me after watching The Avengers, that Mark really played the part better, especially when he is Bruce, and everyone knows the Hulk is nothing if you don't have the right Bruce. Don't let that stop you from seeing this movie though. It is filled with alot of.action, and well worth a viewing. I have the DVD version, but want to badly upgrade to the blu ray version, because I have heard this is one of the best looking blu ray films from Phase one. So if you are looking to upgrade, based on what I have been told you should definitely do that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This is a much, much, MUCH better movie than that other Hulk movie they made in 2003 (I think it was 2003?)! Better acting, story, music, characters, just everything. Good action, good settings and moods, not too much drama (hate it when drama takes over in a superhero movie!). This is a good superhero movie and I recommend it! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This 2008 rendering of The Incredible Hulk makes for good summer fun. It has a hero you can like, a girlfriend you can like even more, and bad guys you can feel good about disliking. The hero, of course, is Bruce Banner, a basically nice guy, a scientist, living life on the run. He has plenty to run from and that includes himself - but, for once, he's winning that part of the race. Liv Tyler brings girlfriend Betty to life as a strong, loving character with Tyler's unique kind of good looks. The bad guys include a military nutjob who wants to own Banner and another military nutjob who wants to be Banner.<br /><br />This Hulk had a lot to live down, because of unfortunate previous attempts at bringing the green guy to the screen. It does a fair job, too, largely because of up-to-date effects. This does have its own problems, though, like the ridiculous efforts at military action to capture The Hulk - the same efforts, again and again, no matter how often they fail. Well, maybe that is realistic.<br /><br />This time, Marvel has put its creative efforts into a fair piece of summer movie entertainment. I found it pretty forgettable, except for that sequel-bait at the end, so wait for a hot day, then sit back and enjoy the popcorn, the air conditioning, and the movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>A few observations about the mostly successful, mostly entertaining 2008 film "The Incredible Hulk"...<br /><br />The movie is billed as a reboot or totally new version of the Hulk, not a sequel to the 2003 Ang Lee film that was simply titled, "Hulk".  I'd call the movie more of a semi-reboot.  Why?  Well, the earlier movie ends with Bruce Banner in hiding in South America, with General Ross and his cronies madly searching for him.  And the new film, well... opens with Bruce Banner in hiding in South America, with General Ross and his cronies madly searching for him.  I think Marvel smartly structured the film to appease both camps: if you liked the earlier movie you can- contrary to all the "forget the earlier movie!" hype- view this one as the next chapter in the story.  And if you didn't like the earlier film, you can point to the recasting of the actors and the less introspective,  more "big summer movie" tone and say, "Whew, it's NOT the same storyline!"  Your money, your choice.<br /><br />The new film offers a more kinetic, visceral, action-oriented story, peppered with just enough quietly dramatic moments (in other words, talking scenes) so the movie doesn't turn into a relentless, flashing, pinball machine.  If you ever read the comic book, it really feels like a three-issue run from the mid-70's "Hulk Smash! era.<br /><br />The deleted scenes in the 3-disc special edition are interesting.  Apparently a more pronounced love triangle between Betty, Bruce, and Betty's new boyfriend Leonard (who we learn, via one deleted scene, is actually comics character Leonard Samson, pre-irradiation experiment) was a bigger part of the original conception of the film.  Though the five or six deleted scenes involving this triangle are intriguing to see, I think I like the final film's decision to simply allude to the tension between the three characters instead of turning the middle part of the movie into an episode of "As the Hulk Turns".<br /><br />There are one or two deleted scenes involving General Ross that I wished were kept in the film.  Though never depicting him as warm and fuzzy, a couple of those scenes showed that his motivation to capture the Hulk and harness his power, though misguided, didn't come from an evil place.  If they were included in the film, those scenes would have made it easier to swallow the General's semi-change of heart at the end when he decides to extend an olive branch to Bruce and join forces with him to take down the Abomination.  That's a quibble, though.  The film and its developments in the current cut still work; there's just less explicit evidence on display that the General is capable of making that emotional leap.<br /><br />Other treats abound. There's a fun little cameo involving Iron Man's alter-ego Tony Stark which was clearly moved from its original "Easter egg" post-closing credits position to the final scene in the main body of the movie after the huge success of "Iron Man".  As said, it's an enjoyable cameo, but a little confusing: Is Tony asking General Ross to help him recruit the Hulk into the new super-team he's forming or offering the use of that team to help Ross take down the Hulk?  I guess we'll have to wait for the next round of Marvel movies to find out.  Also fun but somewhat under-written was the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, where we see him as an innocent bystander who drinks some gamma-infected soda pop (the scenario is not as inane as it sounds) and then freezes up and drops the soda bottle.  It's amazing to me that they missed the opportunity to have him writhe on the ground and turn at least a little green, if only for a moment.  Oh, well.<br /><br />More about the three-disc DVD I bought:  Though generous, the set is not as lavish as the term "three-disc DVD" might suggest.  The first disc is the movie (looks and sounds great) along with a commentary track; the second disc contains a thirty-minute or so "making of" piece, a few short (about ten minutes each) companion pieces that provide additional details about different aspects of the production, the deleted scenes I mentioned, and a cute piece (a few minutes long) showing how a scene from the movie was inspired by a scene in the comics.  The third disc is simply a digital copy of the film that you can upload and watch on your PC.<br /><br />I hope that the DVD release of "The Incredible Hulk" puts the movie over the top financially, offsetting its somewhat lackluster box office (so much for blowing the Ang Lee film out of the water). It would be be nice to see another chapter in this saga, after all, and without having to suffer through another re-boot, or semi-reboot, or whatever confusing technique they'd end up employing in a hand-wringing gesture to overthink the concept of what people want from this character that's simultaneously highly commercial and "what's he really about?" offbeat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This re-imagining of the green Goliath works far better than Ang Lee's 2003 outing that's for sure. Being an avid admirer of the Bixby/Ferrigno series in the late seventies and early eighties I found this film to be closer in spirit to the series and I definitely liked that.<br /><br />The Hulk's origins are played out at the very beginning and once that's over and done with audiences are in for a fast paced and enjoyable ride. The film attempts to keep people who liked the series happy as well as the crowd who want it firmly rooted in Marvel tradition. The Hulk battles a foe called The Abomination in the final third, and by the way that fight is pretty amazing, and I gather that that's a person to be found in the original comics.<br /><br />While Eric Bana was one of the few things that was positive about Hulk (2003), Norton betters him here. He's such a natural performer and he can convey so much with mere expressions. He was the perfect choice to play Banner, in some ways he reminded me of Bixby. Tim Roth is one of those actors who's always good and he doesn't falter here. But William Hurt really surprised me. I've always thought he was good but I'd have to say this is his finest performance in many years. General Ross is a much better written character here than in the 2003 version and Hurt simply excels in the part.<br /><br />As for the CGI, they work really well. The Hulk looks extremely cool and far better here. He doesn't continue to grow as he gets angrier and while that may annoy some I actually found it a plus. And those huge leaps are history as well, he jumps far enough but nothing compared to Ang Lee's version.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk does well what it intends to do which is entertain. Overall it's full of action, very well acted and fairly well written. Must See!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.<br /><br />The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.<br /><br />Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.<br /><br />Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.<br /><br />The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps - almost flying - as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area.<br /><br />Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.<br /><br />The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the "super soldier" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.<br /><br />Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.<br /><br />Great soundtracks in both versions.<br /><br />So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (Sorry)<br /><br />Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This one is alot better than the first movie. Only one reason the actually have a villian from the comic book abomination kicks ass i love that villian. The incredible Hulk is an awesome movie. action packed from beggining to end.

You're probably wondering if this movie is similar to Ang Lee's 2003 movie "Hulk."  Surprisingly, it's not.  It's better!  How can this be?  Oh, it be!<br /><br />This movie is not a sequel to 2003's "Hulk" but rather is a reinvention that establishes a new back-story where Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who rewrote some of the script) becomes the Hulk as a pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate a "super soldier" program through gamma radiation.  (Why and how Banner becomes the Hulk is established in the movie's opening credits.)<br /><br />On the run, Banner attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he's captured by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt).  The General's worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier (Tim Roth) becomes a similar but more Hulk-like creature (called the "Abomination").<br /><br />This movie has it all: action, drama, humour, (dare I say) incredible special effects, and good acting (with one exception).<br /><br />I missed Jennifer Connelly who played Dr. Elizabeth "Betty" Ross in the 2003 movie.  Here she's replaced by Liv Tyler who's rather bland.<br /><br />The CGI creation of the Hulk was quite good.  This movie did not over rely on special effects but let the actors do their jobs.  It was only at the end where (as you can probably guess) there's a confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination that the movie becomes cartoon-like.<br /><br />Be sure to look for a few cameo appearances.  Do not miss, especially, Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk in the late 1970's television series).  He voiced the words said by the CGI Hulk in this movie.  (Lou...what a guy!!)<br /><br />I also liked the "Days without Incident" meter.  I thought this was a nice touch.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2008) has good picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a surprisingly entertaining Hulk movie.  Be sure to watch it to discover why you shouldn't get Bruce Banner mad.  (You wouldn't like him when he's mad.)<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this on Friday the 13th, and buying it while we were traveling to get my dad signed up for his retirement! This version of The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than the 2003 version. It has more elements to the classic t.v. series! The Hulk looks awesome! The fight that the Hulk has with Abomination is pretty sweet! The 2003 version was a lot more military oriented and had a soap opera element between father and son, but this one is just right. It even has a cameo from Tony Stark! I highly recommend THE INCREDIBLE HULK!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Great movie, and certainly way better than the 2003 film "The Hulk".<br /><br />In the 2003 film "The Hulk", you really saw the computer input in the movie graphics and you could tell it was fake. In "The Incredible Hulk", it all looked real.<br /><br />I even was happy to hear the soundtrack of the old Hulk series. I was also happy to see them give tribute to Lou Ferrigno, the true incredible hulk.<br /><br />What was new about this movie is seeing a villain with very similar powers to the incredible hulk, instead of the classical Hulk vs the army where he kicks their butts throughout the movie. This time we see a real match to the powerful hulk.<br /><br />Definetely a great improvement in the Hulk prequal, and I salute the casting team for choosing Edward Norton to play the hulk role.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of Hulk.  The TV series used to scare the daylights outta me as Bruce Banner was morphing into the Hulk.  (And people wonder why I love Wonder Woman.)  Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 was a huge disappointment!  Those comic book panels didn't sit well with me and the CGI was laughable.<br /><br />I was hesitant as I saw this movie.  Hmmm...not bad.  The storyline continues from 2003.  Banner is in hiding, somewhere in South America, and is working in a factory.  Meanwhile, he has been emailing with someone in search of a treatment for his exposure to gamma radiation.  This contact, we only know him as Mr. Blue.<br /><br />General Ross, with help, discovers Banner's hiding place and sends a team, headed by Emil Blonsky to capture him.  Of course, Banner, as Hulk, is unstoppable and is able to get away.  After this escape, as Banner, he reunites with Betty Ross.<br /><br />Not one to be discouraged, Blonsky continues his search.  However, Ross tells Blonsky about a special serum that could give him super soldier strength.  Blonsky asks for the injection and his next confrontation with the Hulk becomes interesting.<br /><br />In search for answers, Banner and Betty finally meet Mr. Blue, who is really a research professor, Dr. Sam Sterns.  Sterns is able to synthesize an antidote.  However, Banner and Betty disagree with Sterns' mission for the antidote and persuade Stern to destroy the supply.  Unexpectedly, Blonsky arrives and forces Stern to inject him with this antidote.  Of course, things go wrong and Blonsky becomes Abomination, who seems to be much bigger than Hulk.<br /><br />And it's the fight of all fights.<br /><br />The storyplot...ok.  Special effects...ok.  I just get bored with these angry men/creatures fighting like primitives.<br /><br />P.S. - At the end, you'll see Tony Stark (aka Ironman) approaching General Ross about assembling a team.  If you're current with Hollywood gossips and news, The Avengers is next (slated for 2011).  However, not before Ironman 2 and a Wolverine movie.  Apparently, Spider-Man, Ironman, Hulk and Wolverine will be the Avengers.  (I'm already disappointed with the team lineup.  No Thor?  No Spiderwoman?  No Black Widow?  No Hawkeye?  No She-Hulk?  And if you know your comics, Wolverine isn't an Avengers.  He's an X-Man.  Hulk isn't a team player.  And Spider-Man is a soloist.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />I haven't seen Ang Lee's Hulk as of this moment, so I can't compare it to this reboot. However, I'm always up for a well-made superhero movie, and Louis Leterrier's revision is quite entertaining to say the least. Growing up I never really followed the Hulk. His character just never interested me with the whole duality struggle between Bruce Banner and Hulk. Admittedly, if you think about it in the long run there could be some really good potential for some interesting theme exposition, but I've yet to actually witness it through the comics or other forms of media. This particular movie, however, is still very enjoyable as an action flick. You've got chases, drama, smashing, more drama, more chasing again, and finally an epic battle between two behemoths in the film's finale. I was very surprised at how well-choreographed all the action is. But because the majority of focus is on that action, I feel the movie falters a bit in character development. I like Edward Norton a lot. He's a great actor when given something good to work with. Unfortunately, they don't do much to build Bruce Banner as any kind of real character, other than what we see in the opening credits. I like how Banner was trying to suppress/control his Hulk self throughout the film, but it's always in spurts and they never really utilize that to convey anything to the narrative effectively enough. I remember hearing a rumor of a potential Director's Cut that was supposed to have 70 extras minutes of footage, but I don't know what happened. If Universal should ever decide to double-dip, though, I'd certainly consider it. The Incredible Hulk is a very good movie, and I'm anxious to see more cameos in future Marvel productions.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Colors and flesh tones look outstanding, especially greens. I really like the cinematography at the beginning with the shots of Brazil and other landscape environments. CG integration of the Hulk and Abomination also looks seamlessly perfect. I didn't detect any signs debris or artifacts through my viewing, nor did I see any signs of image manipulation. There is a fine layer of grain to the photography, but I think it actually gives the film an extremely gritty look, which fits the thriller-esque nature very well. Contrast levels never falter, making all sorts of shades feel like you were right there in front of the camera yourself. Black levels are deep as well, and detail is particularly sharp. Everything from the blades of grass in the park to the wrinkles on Liv Tyler's pouty lips look.. incredible. This is easily the best the Hulk has ever looked in the film medium.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Universal presents The Incredible Hulk to us with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track. And yes, to be clich&eacute;, you can take whatever Marvel superhero adjective you can think of and apply it right here -- incredible, amazing, spectacular, uncanny, fantastic. The sound design and audio placement is flawless. Directionality is very impressive during the action sequences; bullets, rockets, explosions, propellers, sonic cannons, roars, tearing metal, shattered earth; everything is perfectly placed throughout the entirety of the movie, and all with absolutely zero loss in dialogue quality. Speech, sound effects, and a surprisingly good soundtrack by Craig Armstrong are all as crisp and dynamic as you can get. And of course, LFEs are rightfully booming. The Hulk's and Abomination's thunderous footsteps will give your subs a thorough workout.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I was never a big fan of the Hulk. But after watching the special features, I have to say I'm a little more intrigued now by the whole concept and central theme of "duality." I guess you could look at the Hulk as representing two sides of ourselves. You've got the normal, controlling, happy-go-lucky human side that we see in the mirror everyday that does his routine, wants to be happy, goes to work, comes home, and repeats. But inside, there's a part of us that's a bit of a savage, some kind of hedonist that, if fully unleashed, can amount to any kind of potentially destructive force controlled by rage or whatever kind of negative emotions we're keeping inside. Granted, this movie didn't emphasize it enough, but I wish it did. I also find it interesting that Norton almost turned the movie down, which I'm most certainly glad he didn't. Also of special note is the alternate opening, presented in full 1080p and with DTS-HD. It's a nice twist to start the movie with. It's just too bad they didn't make that Director's Cut that was rumored.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect. I really like Leterrier for Danny the Dog, and even a little for Transporter 2. Both were entertaining in their own respective rights, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't want The Incredible Hulk to carry over the same kind of writing/directing as his first effort. Regardless, though, The Incredible Hulk is still entertaining enough to make up for the loss in actual character development. With a reference A/V presentation and some pretty good explanatory features, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone of the comic book genre that's looking for a quick fix in action.</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>The Incredible Hulk. The title itself is great. Just to start things off. Edward Nortan stars in this sci-fi film about how a man always has something inside him. Something that has a bad temper. Something thats INCREDIBLE. I won't give away much as some of you don't want to hear any major spoilers. I will go by each disc and break down the major things contained on it.<br /><br />DISC 1<br />-The film The Incredible Hulk. As with all dvds it has language, subtitles, and all of that stuff.<br />DISC 2<br />-This is the ultimate disc!!! On this disc are 17 deleted scenes! That alone is fantastic. Then is has the making of the Incredible Hulk, how they filmed some of the battle scenes from the movie, an alternate opening to the movie, and oh soooo much more I cannot remember because I have a friend borrowing it right now!<br />DISC 3<br />-The digital copy to the film. Even as we speak I have the movie right o my mac computer! And also on a video iPod! Digital copys are becoming very popular. And they are also very handy as if you have someone borrowing the movie (as in my case) you can watch it on your computer! The digital copy is a must. And the quality is very nice too, I might add.<br /><br />Now lets move on to the effects. I cannot explain how amazing the special effects are in this movie. The hulk himself looks more realistic than ever before. I have never seen the 2003 version, but I can imagine this version is A LOT better! The movie has almost no "bad scenes" in it. When the back of the dvd says "brief suggestive content" they aren't kidding about "brief". The suggestive content lasts for about 15 seconds and then the movie continues. It does have a PG-13 rating for a reason, though. If you buy this movie, be prepared for violence. There is really not much blood as such. Its just how many people are killed that makes the violence level go up. So don't be fooled by that. Overall, this movie is great and I definitely recommend this to you!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Bravo and good show to Liv Tyler.  Her performance as Betty Ross is her best acting to date.  She almost steals the show from everyone else involved on the screen.  She works extremely well with Edward Norton, who also makes an excellent Bruce Banner.  The struggle of fighting against the government's plan to use genetic manipulation as a war weapon always makes for a good action flick, and The Hulk does not drop the ball on that history.<br /><br />The storyline keeps moving along, and the rich landscape scenes make this movie play out like an artistic wonderland filled with covert operations and outright war in the streets.  The CGI was able to make The Hulk come off the pages of the comic books and appear on screen.  That said, I still had a problem with the cartoon-look at different times in the movie.  I also found it a little strange that in the final fight scene of the movie there just happened to be a giant chain to for The Hulk and Abomination to choke each other with.  I mean what are the odds that such a huge chain would just fall into the battle in the middle of the city.<br /><br />I do believe Sam Elliot would have been a better choice than William Hurt in the role as General Ross.  I like William Hurt, but in this role, he just seemed a little too stiff.  Elliot would have provided that "is that dude crazy" element.<br /><br />Christina Cabot is always a pleasure to see on any movie screen.  This woman's career has just begun!  Look for her to have way bigger roles in the near future.<br /><br />So, to finish off this review:  If you liked The Incredible Hulk comic books, then you will like the CGI work in this film.  If you have to have perfect CGI in order to get through a script on film, well The Hulk is not the movie for you.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I liked it. I know it wasnt a masterpiece of film, but for an action all out superhero movie, this delivered. This was a great film for what it was meant to do and that is a roller coaster ride. Edward Norton was a great Banner and the Hulk looked better here. The Abomination was a cool Hulk villain. This had all sorts of inside jokes with references to Marvel,Lou Ferrigno,the late Bill Bixby. I found this better than IronMan,and on par with Indiana Jones & Hellboy 2. This is also better than the first Hulk movie. This is a sequel to a certain degree. As a fan of superhero movies, & a Hulk comic fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I don't think this is any better than the 2003 version. It starts very well with Dr Banner in South America trying to control the urge within him. This reminded me of the first part of Batman Begins. Controlled film-making where you get to know the characters and they develop in front of your eyes.<br /><br />After that it was a little bit downhill. Too much CGi that wasn't always that good and the battle of the giants at the end was entirely predictable.<br /><br />Edward Norton was fine, when he was Banner, and its a shame we couldn't have had more of Tim Roth, but once they both morphed into their respective gamma-fuelled monsters I was less impressed.<br /><br />That said the use of the still memorable TV series theme tune, was a great idea, and there were lovely cameo roles for Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey Jr. Overall its certainly worth seeing but not quite the film I was hoping for....</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>This is a review of the Blu-Ray (some of these reviews were simply ported over from the SD), tested on a 42" Panasonic Plasma and BD30k BD Player. PQ 4/5, Sound 4/5. The picture had some noise in it, but nothing too distracting; overall, the picture was very sharp, but not the best transfer I've ever seen. The sound was powerful at times, and the DTS sound was powerful and effective during shooting and "thunderous/base" portions. It was not as powerful as some other Blu-Ray films I've seen.<br /><br />I prefer a gripping story over over the top effects, but you expect the latter when you watch a super hero action movie. I am a fan of Ed Norton and thought his portrayal as a meager guy engulfed in his superpower worked for the film. His "every-day guy" look worked to express the juxtaposition with the hulk. Liv Tyler continues to be flat in her affect for most of her films, so I just could not sympathize with her character.<br /><br />I do wish that the movie was paced faster. Aside from 3 action scenes, this was a slow moving film in the super hero genre. The last 20 minutes of the film were a standout, where effects are concerned, and the tie in with Iron Man was a welcomed tidbit at the end, which showed continued promise for the franchise.<br /><br />I had hoped that they would take an opportunity to share more info about how the Hulk had gotten his superpower and what research had been done with Betsy's character. I realize this is an action movie, and is not supposed to be a scientific examination of gamma rays and its effects, but I think it would have been interesting to add another dimension.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Better than "The Hulk" of 2003. Great fight scene toward the end. Yet a little short and could use more depth even for an action movie. Edward Norton does an exceptional job as Bruce Banner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>No longer weighed down by the angst and downright boring emotional drivel of the Ang Lee vision, "The Incredible Hulk" allows the big green angry guy to flex his muscles a bit more.  I'm sure there are some fans out there who enjoy their Hulk with tears and a blanket, but I believe that most fans really just want to see him smash and crash his way through everything.<br /><br />Edward Norton takes the purple pants from Eric Bana and gives us a more convincing portrayal, albeit in limited screentime, of Dr. Banner. Also in a limited role is William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross.  While he does a sufficient job, a part of me longed to see Sam Elliott back in the role.  Tim Roth provides the film with a villain in the form of Blonksy.  Liv Tyler takes on Betty Ross, but, as with the rest of the actors in this film, has limited screentime compared to the big green one.<br /><br />The story finds our hero (Norton) hiding out in South America and trying to learn how to control and/or cure his emerald alter-ego.  When the military finally catches up to him, though, the story's pace quickens and features a chase that takes us from a college campus to the city streets.  Hulk fights through sonic weapons, helicopters and automobiles and uses a few jeeps, chains and whatever else happens to be nearby as a weapon.  In short, the meat of this film is action, and fans of action will go to bed after watching "The Incredible Hulk" with a full stomach.<br /><br />Light on story, heavy on action and plenty of nods to the classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno television series make "The Incredible Hulk" a big improvement over its big screen predecessor.  There are also a few blinks of what is to come in the future "Avengers" film.<br /><br />Is "The Incredible Hulk" perfect?  No, but it's still an excellent film.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When I was younger, I used to watch re-runs of the 1970's INCREDIBLE HULK television show.  The show's executive producer, Kenneth Johnson, is a master storyteller and realized that if you tell a story that's nothing but action with no characterization, you don't have much of a story.  I was excited to see Ang Lee's 2003 HULK movie when it was released in theatres, but like many viewers was disappointed.  The film was a huge box office bomb and was stoned by most critics.  After that, I thought that would be the last we would see of the Mean Green Machine on the big screen for awhile.  But, Marvel wasn't ready to give up on one of their most famous characters soon announced plans for another Hulk film.  They promised that the movie would be a better film and would relaunch the character into cinema stardom.  The big wigs at Marvel believed in the project so much that they bet their future as an independent film company on it (IRON MAN was the other film that the studio hoped would turn them into a film studio of reckoning).  At first I was skeptical about the project, but then I learned Ed Norton had signed on to star as Bruce Banner and I felt better about the whole thing. The result is THE INCREDIBLE HULK: an action comic-book movie full of character development that stays true not only to the spirit of the original comic book, but the beloved 1970s television show as well as loosely connecting with 2003's HULK.<br /><br />The movie opens five years after HULK ended.  If viewers will remember, the movie ended with Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) living in South America.  He's (Edward Norton, now) still there and has been able to stay completely off the grid and below the radar, even though he has secretly been looking for a cure for his "disease".  Correspondence with a Mr. Blue in the United States have made him very hopeful and he plans to visit Mr. Blue in the near future.  However, those plans are thrown out of balance when the military, led by top soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) and under the official command of Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), discover Banner's location and seek to bring him in.  The confrontation is a disaster, Blonsky's troops are wiped out and Blonsky is critically injured.  Meanwhile, Banner escapes and finds his way to the U.S. to meet with the love of his life, Betty Ross, and attempts to locate Mr. Blue in hopes of eradicating the monster within.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE HULK. It's not the best comic book/super hero movie ever made, but it is a good one and is just a very entertaining and exciting overall film.  The acting is superb, the special effects are great, there's just the right temperance of character development and action, etc.  The film does a superb job of synthesizing the previous incarnations of Hulk and uniting them together in a coherent whole that both geeks and casual film-goers alike can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In an effort to redo the start of a potentially good franchise, Marvel Studios offers up a great story about the one character who doesn't want the power he has.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk starts the origins over with a bit of everything thrown into the mix.  This movie is part comic book origin, part TV series origin and assumes most of the events that took place in the first movie still happened.  Bruce Banner is the brilliant scientist who experimented on himself due to the confidence in his work and converted himself into the raging green giant that becomes The Hulk.  His work was preliminary weapons research but he was not aware of it.  He was lured into thinking it was research for making soldiers more resistant to toxins and radiation, but really it was for creating a new breed of soldier.<br /><br />Ang Lee's Hulk that was released back in 2003 took a very deterred look at the Hulk and added elements of repressed anger and paternal gene splicing.  In other words, the father messed with his own DNA and passed it on to his son, who then witnessed his mother's death at the hands of his father.  Way too much existentialism added to what should have just been a man who had been given a power that came at a price.  There is enough drama and character development in the basics of Bruce Banner/Hulk that you don't need to pull in sins of the father elements to make it more complicated.<br /><br />This movie throws most of that into the trash and works with the premise that Banner (Edward Norton), now on the run, is hiding out and working to cure himself from a small town in Brazil.  He is a fugitive, which draws on the serial plot of the original TV series.  Bill Bixby's cameo is brilliant, BTW.  Once he finds out that he must travel back to the US for a potential cure, the chase is on.  Before he can pack up and start heading north, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and his squad of special forces led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).  They fail to capture him, but are successful at meeting The Hulk.<br /><br />Blonsky finds himself curious as to the origins of the Green monster.  When The General reveals to him that it was the result of experiments gone wrong (or right) he wants a piece of that power, which the General obliges.  As Bruce makes his way to New York, he reveals himself to Betsy Ross, the Generals daughter, whom he was in love with before the accident.  They find their way to Dr. Samual Sterns in New York for the ultimate cure and eventually the high end climax occurs.<br /><br />The best thing Marvel did here was to just make a good movie.  Too many times in Hollywood they make every movie the be-all-end-all...so how do your follow that up.  Just make a good story.  And this move does that.  It's entertaining, it's got great action and a good script.  Thank God Marvel has it's own studio to do their movies they way they should be done.  All the actors perform well; Roth is a great villian (again), while Hurt shows a deep level of deceptive character that I've never seen before.  Norton is well balanced as the brilliant scientist who wants no self pity and shows great determination to get rid of this rage driven curse.  He and Tyler have good chemistry as well.  And of course Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno make cameos along with Bill Bixby.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays.<br /><br />When the "Hulk" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed "The Sandman" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this 2008 version of the Hulk, too.  By the way, if you can, watch both of those on Blu-Ray as they look incredible.<br /><br />One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, "Superman Returns," we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s "Adventures of Superman" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.<br /><br />The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again, especially with this great Blu-Ray transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The Hulk is more visceral that any other Comic character made onto the silver screen. His alter ego is played by the vulnerable Edward Norton, an excellent choice. The special effects are at times magnificent, convincingly in harmony with the real life cinematography. Liv Tyler plays a sensual, sympathetic girl friend and John Hurt delivers cold determination with the prophecy of redemption in his caring eyes. Some parts of this well filmed movie take place in beautiful Brazil. Overall, a good film.<br /><br />It is a film that unexpectedly turns its cultural attention, for a time, away from our shores, and to South America. I enjoyed the attempts at expanding its borders and giving a scale larger than its predecessors, and perhaps its comics. The boost is needed for a film that really, perhaps, shouldn't have been given another chance considering the hushed hype that this franchise has. Its fans, are no doubt, no less enthusiastic than say, Spider mans, but the numbers are surely lesser.<br /><br />But the Hulk, is a change in what we know to be superhero's. He is unstable, and unpredictable, and can you say that the green monster really is a good guy all the time? He is a beast, with mega strength, and an anger problem that is dangerous, and like a loaded gun, only needs to be pointed in a direction. If you happen to be standing in the way, you are in trouble. And for me, there isn't a classic nemesis to battle with the Hulk that has yet to catch our nations attention. We don't have, say, supermans Lex Luther. We have mutated poodles? That is lame.<br /><br />Hulk is presented in sometimes good CGI, but it never amazes as the title would lead you to think. It's editing is more impoved over Ang Lee's version, which did not stick to a winning formula. Here, the pull back a bit on the Comic page edits, and for a time tried to be more serious, like Christopher Nolans Batmans serious, but don't get me wrong, it never operates on the classic level of Nolan's Batman series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics' raging green powerhouse returns to the big screen in the entertaining summer thrill ride "The Incredible Hulk". For five years, scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has kept hidden from the world while searching for a cure to his gamma-irradiated DNA that transforms him into an unbelievably strong creature known as the Hulk. Banner struggles to control the raging power within him and prevent the US Army from turning this power into a devastating living weapon. Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2), "The Incredible Hulk" is a fast-paced action-packed adventure that succeeds over the previous 2003 film. The latest comic book adaptation offers plenty of excitement and well embraces the popular 1970's television series. The climatic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is really exciting. "The Incredible Hulk" also stars Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and Academy Award-winner William Hurt, and features cameos by series star Lou Ferrigno and comic book creator Stan Lee.<br /><br />With its stunning picture quality and intense audio, "The Incredible Hulk" packs quite a punch on Blu-Ray. The 2008 comic book movie is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Blu-Ray has a nicely detailed and remarkably sharp video transfer. Its 5.1 DTS-HD audio is really dynamic. The special features include 40 minutes of deleted scenes, a comic book picture gallery, alternate opening sequence and a feature-length audio commentary with director Louis Leterrier and star Tim Roth. "The Making of The Incredible Hulk" documentary offers several interviews with director, cast and production crew. It also includes four short behind-the-scenes featurettes: Becoming the Hulk, Becoming the Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out and From Comic Book to Screen. Overall, "The Incredible Hulk" gets a "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>This 2008, interesting "re-boot" of the Marvel Comics character comes across as a sequel to an origin movie that was never made!<br /><br />Pretending that Ang Lee's interesting but bonkers "Hulk" movie never happened, director Louis Leterrier's colorful comic-book saga brings us a kinder, more identifiable Bruce Banner in the form of Edward Norton. Intentionally channeling the Bill Bixby series more than its predecessor, this "Hulk" finds Banner on the run in South America, still trying to find a cure for his transformations into the Big Green One. Circumstances, of course, get in the way, with the military -- including General Ross (William Hurt) -- in hot pursuit of Banner, going so far as to send a newly Gamma-infused soldier (Tim Roth) into the fray in order to stop the Hulk from causing further damage. Banner, meanwhile, seeks help from old love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), who hasn't spoken to her military dad since Banner's accident, as well as a scientist (Tim Blake Nelson) who hopes to provide a serum to help our hero at least control his transformations.<br /><br />Loaded with effects and chase sequences, this "Incredible Hulk" is a lot more faithful in spirit and execution to the Marvel Comics -- as well as the old CBS series -- than its predecessor, no question. In-jokes and references for fans abound, from a quote of Joe Harnell's series theme to Lou Ferringo's cameo and vocal performances of the Hulk's dialogue as well (there's no mistaking Big Lou's "Hulk SMASH!" line). The Zak Penn script (which Norton rewrote, though without final credit) doesn't aim to be anything other than a basic, straight-ahead action movie, but the set-pieces are well-executed and the final brawl between the Hulk and the Abomination -- with splendid Rhythm & Hues effects -- is something that kids and comic book fans ought to find perfectly satisfying.<br /><br />The performances are all fine, and although one wishes there was more of a human element to this "Hulk" (something that Norton lamented was lost in Marvel's final cut, and could possibly be rectified by an extended DVD this fall), it's still an entertaining summer fantasy that finally does the Incredible one justice on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>It wasn't a tall order to improve upon Ang Lee's disastrous 2003 effort, which was simply horrible in every way. Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.<br /><br />Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Let me state unequivocally at the outset that in comparing Ang Lee's "Hulk" and Louis Leterrier's "Incredible Hulk" movies, I believe Ang Lee's version is superior. My reason for this can be summed up by a paraphrase of a quote from Roger Ebert's review of "1984": "(Leterrier's) version of (Marvel's tormented green character) turned (the Hulk's plight) into a cautionary, simplistic (superhero) tale. (Ang Lee's "Hulk") penetrates much more deeply into (the character's psychological) heart of darkness." If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of my reasoning, I refer you to my "Ph.D. thesis" review of Ang Lee's "Hulk" on IMDb.<br /><br />However, all that psychological complexity elicited a lot of discomfort and hostility from "Hulk" viewers. They didn't want to see a tragic, emotionally reserved character struggling with mental and father dilemmas and abuse as well as his gamma-irradiated condition. God damn it, they wanted an unambiguous superhero rising up to beat the bad guys to a pulp and save humanity, the world, or something. They wanted the most unconventional, unlikely "superhero" of all to follow the old movie superhero formula: 1) Origin of good guy superhero, 2) Origin of good guy superhero's nemesis, 3) Circumstances that bring the superhero and nemesis together to fight. Apparently, the corporate suits listened to this plea and gave the world "The Incredible Hulk".<br /><br />Consequently, Leterrier's "The Incredible Hulk" takes the character nuances and motivations Lee's "Hulk" worked so hard to cultivate and makes them slicker, simpler and more basic. The Hulk/Bruce Banner no longer is the reluctant or accidental hero who only wants to live a peaceful life and inherits his powers by accident. This time Banner (Edward Norton) is a rash, ambitious graduate student who deliberately subjects himself to gamma radiation almost as a lark, to see what superpowers he'll get and soon rues his choice. The Hulk's/Bruce's anger no longer arises from trauma suffered from years of parental abuse. This time, being chased around by the military because he is "U.S. government property" as General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt) puts it, and has a power Ross and many others want to scientifically duplicate, makes Banner lose it and "Hulk out". General Ross himself is no longer an ambivalent character, a dutiful soldier bent on crushing the menacing Hulk but also obsessively protective of his only child, Betty Ross. Instead, he is a purely unscrupulous, selfish villain. However, the Hulk himself does manage to keep most of his pathos and sympathy in spite of Leterrier's efforts to steer him into superhero status.<br /><br />Leterrier glosses over the Hulk's creation in a frantic montage, instead of Lee's deliberate, contemplative origin story. Conversely, however, he takes more time following the creation of the Hulk's ultimate nemesis, another gamma creature known as the Abomination (not named in the film). The Abomination is actually Emil Blonsky, a Slavic (?) mercenary Ross retains to help his troops capture the Hulk. Blonsky, a veteran soldier past his prime, is apparently an adrenaline and power junkie. Impressed by his first encounter with the Hulk in South America, and gradually learning from the reticent Ross about his origin, Blonsky is insanely eager to become a match for the Hulk.<br /><br />Meanwhile, chased from his hideout in the Rio favela slums by Ross's troops but escaping to Culver University in Virginia (I think) partly by transforming into the Hulk, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and conspires with her to go to New York and meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns, to whom he has shipped blood samples in hopes of finding a cure. Unfortunately, Banner learns to his shock that the animated Dr. Sterns too has jumped on the "Super Soldier" bandwagon and has cloned his blood proteins to discover their amazing properties. Before Dr. Stearns can proceed with his research, Ross, Blonsky, and the military arrive. Having received an initial dose of the "Super Soldier formula" from Ross and already lost to the Hulk in an initial confrontation, Blonsky comes back for Round 2. Blonsky forces Dr. Stearns to give him a booster shot of Banner's proteins, which completely transform him into the Abomination. He goes on a rampage.<br /><br />To save New York, Banner skydives from a military helicopter without a parachute to compel himself to transform into the Hulk. He does so just in time before hitting the pavement. He collides with the Abomination in the night-time New York streets and the two behemoths have a battle royal which culminates on a building roof. After about a half-hour of punishing blows, the Hulk eventually triumphs and jumps away. Humanity is saved (and the Hulk has caused minimal collateral damage).<br /><br />Despite the "dumbing-down" of this iconic "monster", I still enjoyed "The Incredible Hulk" as a well-paced, exciting action flick that makes some improvements on Ang Lee's version. Much as I like Eric Bana in Ang Lee's "Hulk", he's really too tall and muscular to play Bruce Banner. Edward Norton's slighter build is more suitable to the role. Norton's Banner also projects more vulnerability and desperation. Liv Tyler's performance as Betty Ross reinforces Banner's humanity even as the Hulk even more than Jennifer Connelly's version in "Hulk". Tim Roth's manic, driven Blonsky/Abomination promises to give the Hulk more headaches in sequels. And we get to see the Hulk act truly heroic, with hints that he will do so again in the future, if Banner has anything to say about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Unlike 2003's The Hulk, 2008's The Incredible Hulk is actually a good film! Go figure, it only took a remake slash sequel, a concept re-launch if you will, five years later to really do the character justice! This film's improvement over the last isn't just due to the advancement of CG technology (which it has big time!); it's also about a solid, entertaining script and talented actors delivering convincing performances. Everything about this Hulk film just seemed to work so well, so much better than I assumed could have been possible after being subjected to the first film. Obviously, I wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk was a blast to watch, this is entertainment gold! Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors; his Bruce Banner was leaps and bounds more likable and sympathetic than Bana's and, truth be told, the overall re-casting of established characters was the best thing they could have done for this series. Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliott are both admirable actors but they can't hold candles to Tyler and Hurt.<br /><br />Now, once again comparing this film to the last, The Incredible Hulk's new villain, Roth's Abomination, just took a big fat, steaming cinematic dump all over Nolte's goofy character, Father. Really, I don't even know what they were thinking with that bit of casting! I like Nick Nolte and all but c'mon, his character stunk! Abomination is where it's at and where it should have been in the first place!<br /><br />There's been a lot of chatter amongst comic and movie fans about which Marvel film kicked more tail, The Incredible Hulk or Iron Man, and for most the answer to that is clear...Iron Man. However the battle between Iron Man and Stane's Iron Monger just cannot compare to the unbridled entertainment value of The Incredible Hulk's romp `em, stomp `em toe-to-toe showdown with the Abomination! Iron Man edges ahead of The Incredible Hulk in the "Better Film" category but only by a little and only due to Downey Jr.'s performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The summer of 2008 proved to be an extremely lucrative one for Marvel with the one-two punch of "Iron Man" followed by "The Incredible Hulk". Granted in terms of monetary value and profit margin, Marvel gained more from "Iron Man" than their second attempt at adapting the not-so jolly green giant for the big screen. Even so, under their new Marvel Studios filmmaking branch it seems that the self-proclaimed "House of Ideas" is off to a terrific start, and has chosen to make very solid, entertaining film adaptations that hold true to their source material. As some of you may remember, and no doubt many of you did (due to the lower box office totals, I would say it's safe to say most of you did), Marvel's previous attempt to adapt their angry jade "hero" didn't exactly go over very well with comic book fans and general moviegoers, essentially making "Hulk" into Marvel's first flop of the new comic book movie age.<br /><br />Which brings us to Marvel's second, yet first self-produced, remake "The Incredible Hulk" (their first re-do was 2004's "The Punisher"). To me the film would be more accurately viewed as Marvel's way of saying, "We are incredibly sorry for stealing away two hours of your life with the psycho-babble in Ang Lee's whine-fest of an excuse for a movie." But that tagline for the film would probably be too long and distracting. Thus, we now find ourselves with yet another Hulk movie on our hands, but is this film all that different from what came before? In a word...yes. The difference between the two adaptations is basically as follows:  unlike 2003's "Hulk" (Ang Lee's version, for those not keeping up) this new film knows what it takes to make the character work for audiences. Although it's really a shame that this Hulk wasn't able to smash so much more at the box office (we can all thank Ang Lee for ruining that possibility), after all the character's potential was fully and spectacularly realized in this adaptation.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" tells the story of brilliant scientist Bruce Banner, who has been living in secrecy from the prying eyes of the United States government for several years as he attempts to rid himself of a very strong curse...the Hulk that resides within. After some unfortunate events lead to the military discovering his whereabouts, Banner soon discovers that he has no choice but to stand and fight against those who would use the monster within him as a weapon of destruction.<br /><br />After I watched this film there was only one string of thoughts I had running through my mind, "Now, that is what an Incredible Hulk movie is all about! Intense action, plenty of drama, bits of romance and comedy sprinkled throughout, not to mention a talented cast of actors and actresses, and visual effects that will blow you away. If you haven't been able to forget about Ang Lee's travesty, then you haven't seen this film yet." Well, maybe my thoughts weren't exactly like that, but they were similar in nature, I know that for a fact.<br /><br />Anyways, let's begin by discussing the actors chosen to bring their respective comic book counterparts to life on the big screen. Each cast member was perfectly chosen, even if the choice didn't seem that obvious from the get-go. For instance, actor Edward Norton ("American History X") was not my first choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk, and even after the initial trailers were released I still wasn't sure if he could do some of the non-Hulk action that the film was clearly calling for. I do not doubt that Edward could handle the dramatic side of the character, but all the running, jumping, and even some fighting were not things this actor is normally known for in his work. However, I am more than willing to admit that I was mistaken in my uncertainty regarding his abilities, and Norton truly owned the role of Banner. He imbues this tortured soul with such an anxious intensity and passion for finding a cure that the audience fully understands and relates to everything he is going through. Beneath all the angst over his curse, Norton also reveals a man broken down by his lot in life and the sacrifices he's been forced to make to protect those he loves from himself. Every aspect of Edward's portrayal was perfectly in keeping with the character's emotions, motivations, and thought processes in the comic books.<br /><br />Joining Edward Norton is the talented veteran actor William Hurt ("A History of Violence") portraying the man hunting Bruce Banner, General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross. This casting choice made perfect sense to me, as William always seems to immerse himself into any character thrown his way, and it's that very dedication to his craft that made him the prime candidate for this modern day Captain Ahab. William delivers a performance that is rife with an intense hatred that drives him forward on his borderline nihilistic mission to capture Banner and unleash the beast. Assisting Ross in this dangerous endeavor is Tim Roth (TV's "Lie to Me") as Emil Blonsky, a military man past his prime, yet still thriving on the thrill of battle. Roth creates in Blonsky a warrior without any sense of remorse, in essence a sociopath whose mindset makes him both the ideal soldier for Ross' mission and the perfect weapon for the general to throw into the Hulk's path.<br /><br />Lastly, actress Liv Tyler ("Armageddon") as Betty Ross was even more of a maligned pick in my book than Edward Norton. I've never been all that taken by Liv in any of her roles, and even after her performance here (which is very good by the way) I still would have preferred Jennifer Connelly (who portrayed Betty in Ang Lee's "Hulk"), but that is driven more by her appearance than anything else. That being said, Liv does a very good job with Betty, giving her plenty of dimension and depth of character, making her much more than just the damsel in distress. She's very much an independent woman, and her portrayal is one that is probably more believable, in terms of appearance, than that of Jennifer Connelly, who let's face it didn't really look like she would actually be a scientist.<br /><br />The story for "The Incredible Hulk" was written by Zak Penn ("X-Men: The Last Stand") and co-written (although not credited) by Edward Norton. This adaptation of the Hulk was much more faithful to the comics that inspired it, no doubt influenced by the fact that Marvel itself was financing the picture. Unlike its predecessor, "The Incredible Hulk" opted for a much more streamlined approach to the origin story, something that other comic book adaptations could take to heart. What took Ang Lee two hours or more to create, this script accomplished in a much more concise, and altogether clearer manner. Gone is all the psycho-babble, daddy issues of "Hulk", and in their place we have a crystal clear storyline, full of character-driven drama that is both gripping and intriguing, loaded with action and spectacle, plus a flawed hero that is much more believable and charismatic than anything the former could muster. On every single level "The Incredible Hulk" delivers a top-notch story that comic book fans have always hoped for, and all their loyalty and patience has been brilliantly rewarded.<br /><br />Directing this latest adaptation we have action director Louis Letterier ("Unleashed"). For Ang Lee's vision of the Hulk's story, we were treated to some very stylistic, yet questionable choices about the editing and look of the overall film. Louis Letterier wisely chose to avoid over-stylizing the movie, opting for more of a down-and-dirty action film that felt much grittier and even realistic (which is an odd thing to say when discussing a movie that's subject is a giant green monster). Truly the only stylized element Letterier brought to the film, in my opinion, were his trademark fast-paced, quick cut action scenes that are designed to heighten the intensity of the moment even more than what the story was doing on its own. It's a gimmick used by many filmmakers today to assist in creating even more powerful action-heavy sequences, and it is probably one that is used far too often as a crutch more than anything else. However, Letterier has mastered the art of the quick cut, and deftly uses it to his advantage in every film he directs, and "The Incredible Hulk" is no exception.<br /><br />Finally, the visual effects for this incarnation of Hulk is leaps and bounds above anything featured in Ang Lee's version (this should be the last comparison to that film). The talented people at Rhythm and Hues were responsible for creating the surprisingly lifelike CGI creations of Hulk and Abomination. Truthfully, making an audience believe that a giant green monster is actually present amongst humans cannot be an easy endeavor; however, the stunning visual effects work done in this film (similar to what was done for "King Kong") is as close to creating a realistic human-esque monster as we can probably get (at least for a little while). Out of all the CGI-intensive films released in 2008, "The Incredible Hulk" boasted the very best the industry had to offer, and it was a shame that the film and its creative geniuses weren't recognized for it this last award season.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" is a fast-moving, intense action film that boasts some of the most impressive visuals you will see in a film for quite some time. This movie effectively recreates the film version of the character to be more inline with his comic book counterpart, becoming the definitive Hulk for audiences to enjoy watching for years to come.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>As the opening credits roll, we're treated to a montage of shots of an experiment gone wrong. Some how, the process turns Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into a giant green monster, the Hulk.<br /><br />But that was several years ago. (How many, we are never sure.) These days, Bruce is hiding out in Brazil working at a soda bottle company and learning to control his anger.<br /><br />But he can't stay hidden forever, and soon General Ross (William Hurt) gets a bead on his location. He sets up a team to go in and retrieve him, even bring in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help.<br /><br />When things don't go as planned, Bruce decides it is time to head home and get help. But that means reconnecting with General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Is there a cure for Bruce's condition? Can the two get it?<br /><br />This movie started our fairly slowly, making me glad that so much hit the cutting room floor.  But once Liv Tyler's Betty is introduced, things really pick up.  Not necessarily the action, but the drama.  Betty and Bruce's complicated relationship captured me and pulled me into the story.  Those two have some wonderful scenes together.  And the two actors capture the tenderness and chemistry perfectly, which doesn't surprise me at all.  Every time I have seen them, I have been blown away by their performances.  Not that I'm detracting from the rest of the cast, who are fine.  And watch for fun cameos by Stan Lee and TV Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, not to mention in the very last scene.<br /><br />The Hulk was created with a combination of motion capture and computer animation.  Sometimes, that foundation was obvious.  But most of the time you could believe what you were seeing on the screen was real.  And they never took me out of the film, which is important because the climatic battle was very emotional, not just some big fight scene.<br /><br />The original Hulk was just okay, but this one really made me care about the characters.  Despite a slow start, I really enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The '08 re-visioning of `The Incredible Hulk' has finally delivered what his fan base most desired, a Hulk that is both a terrifying and sympathetic figure at the same time. Ed Norton is up to the task of portraying the dedicated scientist turned green giant though his acting skills are primarily delegated to running away from the pursuing military forces, staring at blood samples through a microscope or gazing longingly at love interest Liv Tyler. That's not a knock on his abilities, it's simply the limitations within the Bruce Banner role as scripted. What made the storyline a major success for me was the inclusion of Tim Roth. When you sit down and compose a list of the truly great "bad guys" in contemporary cinema he would definitely be near the top of my list.<br /><br />Aside from all that, the Hulk is a comic book superhero, so first and foremost this film by definition must focus on special effects and action sequences. In those two aspects you will not be disappointed. If you like your heroes huge, angry and green this is the film for you!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>After the incredible letdown of The Hulk, this movie had so much going against it that I don't see how it ever got off the ground. Still, I'm glad some executive somewhere saw the potential in this character and decided to give it another shot. This one had a lot more action than the first, and the Hulk actually talked! Very nice!<br /><br />What was weird was how this movie paid homage to the first film in a lot of ways, yet still managed to stay as its own. I can't say I was stoked to hear that Edward Norton would be taking over as Bruce Banner, but he managed to turn in a great performance. That final scene in the cabin was absolutely incredible in setting the stage for future movies.<br /><br />While this one made the least amount of money of the "Big Three" (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and The Dark Knight), I still think it was a nice addition to the Summer.<br /><br />What Worked:<br /><br />* We saw the hero in the first 15 minutes of the film! For some reason, Ang Lee thought we were paying good money to see a movie call "The Hulk" but we didn't really want to see the big green guy, so he held out for the first hour before bringing him in. Bad move.<br /><br />* Action! Yes, we saw the inner struggle of Bruce Banner, but there was smashing in this one! The Hulk/Abomination fight was just like you'd imagine a real comic book smackdown to be like. He fought the army and the bad guy, and looked cool. I think Lou Ferrigno was a great guy, but his Hulk never jumped through the city at high speeds, or clapped out a fire. And yes, I know the Hulk looked like a video game character, but it's still better than getting some professional wrestler to wear green body paint for an hour!<br /><br />* Iron Man! To have a cameo like that from a movie that came out a month earlier was a home run! It helped build on the stinger from Iron Man, but they gave it to us before the credits this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Films of comic book superheroes seem to be a necessity of cinema at the moment especially when competing for the coveted title of summer blockbuster. I haven't seen many of them I have to say but do intend to in the near future. Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk is one of the more recent adaptations of a Marvel Comics hero and was intended to make up for Ang Lee's version from 2003 which didn't go down well with the critics. Trying to keep my anger in check I sat myself down to take on the Hulk.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is the subject of an experiment at the outset using gamma rays to increase the healing time in soldiers. The project is overseen by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt) and his daughter and Banner's girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). After the process begins Banner turns into a giant green monster, destroying the lab and leaving both General Ross and his daughter injured during his violent outburst. The film picks up years later where Bruce Banner is leading a surreptitious existence in Brazil working in a soft drinks factory and thanks to martial arts training has learned to control his anger and prevent a transformation into the Hulk for many months. General Ross is still desperately seeking Banner and turns to ageing soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) for help.<br /><br />After a destructive opening with Banner's transformation into the Hulk the film quickly moves onto his time in Brazil where he has not turned into the Hulk for months and is in contact via the Internet with Mr Blue about a cure for his condition. Banner's location is revealed when he cuts himself at work and a drop of blood, heavy set with gamma rays, ends up in the bottle of one of the soft drinks shipped to the United States. When the unfortunate victim drinks from the contaminated bottle he is rushed to hospital and General Ross is alerted to Banner's whereabouts. British soldier Blonsky leads the raid of the soft drinks factory and witnessed the Hulk taking out his men though he doesn't realise this is Banner transformed after being overwhelmed by rage and anger. General Ross tells Blonsky the truth that Banner was deceived with the experiment on him, the real purpose being to develop super soldiers. With Blonsky now 39 and no longer the soldier he once was he volunteers to be the next guinea pig in the same experiment, the hope being he is fit, agile and strong enough to face the Hulk.<br /><br />Though Banner escapes back to the United States he has to cross paths with Betty again and the inevitable romance plays out. With the army hot on his trail Banner faces more regular transformations into the Hulk. After hooking up with Betty it is time for Banner to locate Mr Blue and to take steps to curing himself of his purgatorial life. The army has other plans, however, and in Blonsky they have a secret weapon that is initially defeated easily by the Hulk leaving the soldier with nearly every bone in his body shattered. Blonsky, however, is no longer the same as a human and his body quickly repairs itself to fight another day. As with many guinea pigs of scientific experiments, Blonksy comes to face an ordeal even greater than that of the Hulk but this is one of his own choosing as he desires greater strength and power to face his formidable enemy.<br /><br />With such acting talent as Norton and Roth I was optimistic that The Incredible Hulk would be a great film but I was left disappointed by the end. There's nothing wrong with the performances of Norton and Roth, I just felt this film wasn't a worthy vehicle for them to show off their respective talents. Norton, in particular, is one of Hollywood's finest given such a role as Fight Club or American History X but I didn't feel that same memorable performance coming through here. Hurt and Tyler provide okay support while Tim Blake Nelson makes a noteworthy appearance as the mysterious Mr Blue. The film's effects are good but the ending was somewhat unsatisfying with a final showdown between Banner and Blonsky being a little flat. The opening half of the film is better than the second half and although this isn't a bad film it's certainly not the great one I had hoped for.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is a pretty average action superhero film, getting decent performances out of Norton and Roth, despite the material they have to work with not being spectacular. Though the effects are good they're not stunning and the film feels like everyone is treading too carefully trying to avoid the same mistakes the 2003 Hulk film made. In the end it's an okay effort but not a memorable one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Incredible Hulk 2008 is an improvement of the silly cgi Hulk Of 2003, Which I also liked somewhat.

They give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The rest of the cast carry out their performances well though nothing extraordinary.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!) and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, The Incredible Hulk is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br />Strongly recommended along with the 70's Incredible Hulk TV series. 4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Bruce Banner (lurking in South America and looking to purchase a pair of pants from a street vendor): "Tienes mas stretchy?"<br /><br />2008's THE INCREDIBLE HULK eases up on the psychological angst which so bogged down Ang Lee's 2003 version (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKC3">Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)</a>). But let's not twist it, Bruce Banner suddenly isn't some happy-go-lucky bloke. He's still pretty damn tormented, he and his alter ego still the modern incarnations of Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Nomad scientist Bruce Banner will always be teeteering on the edge of losing control. Else, what's the point of his character? Just like he'll always be on a quest for a cure. And just like he'll always fail to find one.<br /><br />As a nod to Ang Lee's HULK and its conclusion, this one opens up with Bruce Banner still in Brazil, but now toiling as a day laborer in a soda-bottling plant. In his ongoing efforts to dampen his emotions, he's even resorted to taking martial arts lessons (not that Bruce becomes a wushu master or anything). He's got a watch which monitors his heart rate (any number nearing 200 beats is a worrisome thing).<br /><br />For a bit now, Bruce has been corresponding via e-mail with a Mr. Blue (can you guess what Bruce's code color is?). Mr. Blue has been assisting him with his latest attempt at a cure. But it's not too long of a wait before Bruce learns that the cure, isn't. In the short term, though, that's the least of his worries. General Ross has finally tracked him down and he mobilizes a strike force to fetch Banner.<br /><br />The film makes a point of keeping a running tally of Days Without Incident onscreen, the latest reading being 158 days. Ooops. Reset the count.<br /><br />I do think that Norton improves on Eric Bana, but I prefer Sam Elliott to William Hurt as the cold-hearted General Ross. And I think it's a wash between Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler is hotness on legs, and, as Betty Ross, she does well with the emotional, pining scenes. But I don't quite believe her as a biologist (she's a friggin' elf, isn't she?). But she and Norton produce some good chemistry, and you even buy into the tender Beauty & the Beast moments with her and the Hulk. Banner's core persona is marked by repression, by a tamping down of emotions. What's left is this husk desperate to stay even-keeled and unengaged and still. In a sexy and funny bedroom scene between Bruce and Betty, we learn that it's not only fear and rage which may trigger the change. Bruce, no matter what, just cannot afford to get too excited (Betty protests: "Not even a little excited?"). Thankfully, Norton is able to bring out nuances and some liveliness to Banner, even if much of the acting has to be done internally. But there's only so much you can do with that. Bill Bixby, bless his soul, got the most out of all the actors to have ever played this role. Still, the Hulk usually has to pick up the slack, and he doesn't do this thru snappy dialogue and fancy emoting.<br /><br />The movie is still character driven, but much more accessible than the Ang Lee adaptation. THE INCREDIBLE HULK benefits most from driving up the pace. This film is more action oriented and showcases more of what makes the Hulk so much fun. Know your audience, says the box office guru. And the Hulk's audience clamors for the mean, green monster to break stuff and demolish a bad guy or two. Maybe occasionally yell out: "Hulk is strongest one there is!" or "Hulk smash!"  No one takes to a rampage quite like the Hulk, and that's the candy we crave.<br /><br />General Ross is the recurring villain, but the main adversary for the Hulk here is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a veteran paramilitary operative who envies the power unleashed by the Hulk. Of course, the old science-gone-mad schtick enters the picture, framed in General Ross's scheme to dust off the ancient super soldier project. Risky experimentations enable cellular changes within Emil Blonsky, who soon mutates to freakish, super strong stature. I don't think the film officially labels him this, but Emil Blonsky becomes the Abomination, one of the Hulk's perennial adversaries in the comics. His clash with the Hulk is of epic proportions, brutal and earth-shaking, and taking place in the crowded New York streets. There is much fan joy here.<br /><br />No disrespect to Bruce Banner, Betty and General Ross, but the film perks up most, obviously, whenever the Hulk manifests. While I did like how Ang Lee's Hulk was CG'd, this new version looks better, more ferocious and somehow more grounded to reality, more fixed into his surroundings. He's featured in three pulse-pounding action set pieces, the best of which is the aforementioned Hulk Vs. Abomination shatterfest (although the other two segments ain't nothing to sneeze at, either).<br /><br />Keep an eye out for the film's fond winks to Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and the late Bill Bixby, as well as a tongue-in-cheek take on Banner's famous line. Also, I'm digging the coda scene, as a character from another Marvel Comics title pops in for a cameo and with a very significant offer to General Ross. More fan joy, indeed.<br /><br />The other day, in one of those throwaway stream-of-consciousness conversations one sometimes gets into, someone was asking me whether Bruce Banner prefers briefs or boxers. I broke it down for her.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Marvel Studios followed their exceptional "Iron Man" with "The Incredible Hulk," another terrific comic book adaptation. Dispensing with the overall seriousness of the previous film, the Ang Lee-directed "The Hulk," this film returns to the storyline as seen in the 1978 television show. In fact, one of the film's pluses is that it brings elements from the show into the film, such as Lou Ferrigno, who lends his voice to the Hulk, as well as a cameo appearance as a security guard; and the TV theme makes a welcomed return.<br />While not as good as "Iron Man," this is a terrific film that features some awesome action sequences, terrific visual effects and fine storytelling. The performances are good as well. Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, bringing the character elements that Bill Bixby made famous, while also adding some great little character nuances, while not making the character too dark or depressing, such as Tobey McGuire did in the overrated "Spider-man" films. The beautiful and talented Liv Tyler provides some smarts and sexyness as Banner's love interest, while William Hurt and Tim Roth give menacing performances as Banner's villainous rivals. And a welcomed cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark is not only memorable, but also continues the march toward "The Avengers" in 2011.<br />With "The Incredible Hulk," Marvel Studios has made two well-done superhero films. If you enjoyed the original TV series or the comic books, then you'll surely enjoy "The Incredible Hulk!"<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>The Movie<br /><br />Presented in what I understand is the first ever not-blue-BD case and with a limited edition 3D cover, the incredible film from Louis Leterrier arrives to BluRay. I do not intend to get into many details of the film as other reviewers have already done so, the franchise reboot was indeed of great help, the cast and their performances are simply incredible and very serious for a film of this kind. What made this Hulk movie better than the previous one is the fact that the people behind it are trying to set the Marvel universe in a real-world scenario, with great results. Add the factor of Marvel being involved, the special cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), several references to the "super-soldier" and the imminent coming of an "Avengers" film and even non-fans will want more!<br /><br />The picture and audio quality in the BD are superb, while the movie does not have too many sequences that could take advantage of the format (such as "Speed Racer" by the Wachowski brothers) the fight sequences look and sound clean and sharp. The level of detail high definition brings is very notorious in this BD as the deleted scenes included are presented in standard definition, so after watching a HD film presentation and going to the extras to watch the material not included the difference in quality is huge (Not sure really why the deleted scenes were not presented in HD though)<br /><br />The Extras<br /><br />All extras except the deleted scenes are presented in full HD.<br /><br />The famous alternate opening sequence is included, Leterrier was known of being very fond of this sequence that was removed in the end. The digital effects in this sequence however, were not finished for this release, so the little bit we see of the Hulk is a rough CG shot.<br /><br />An animated comic in which they based one of the sequences of the film is also included, for me, watching a comic book drawn by Tim Sale animated in HD was a very interesting experience being a fan of him. As a reference and if you are not familiar with his work, he also draws all the paintings used in the TV show "Heroes".<br /><br />Documentaries included are "Making of the Incredible", "Becoming the Hulk", "Becoming the Abomination" and "Anatomy of a Hulk out". Each of them has interviews with the people involved in each process, from the motion capture artists to the actors bringing those characters to life in the film.<br /><br />The picture in picture feature provides a lot of details and interesting facts but it requires of course of watching the movie at least a couple times more. The UControl feature also includes data from the comic books that inspired shots in the film as well as character files.<br /><br />The feature I was more excited about is the only one presented in standard definition. There are several deleted scenes included; watching them you can see that one of the sequences that suffered more is the one with Betty and Banner at her house. Also there were more references to the "super soldier" that were removed. Unfortunately the fact that these are not HD makes them look bad and out of place in a HD presentation.<br /><br />Audio for the main feature is presented in DTS-HD 5.1, Dolby digital 2.0, Spanish and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, Spanish and French.<br /><br />A digital copy of the movie is also included.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>If you enjoy a wonderful sequel to a classic movie and TV show, you will enjoy this the latest installment of the Incredible Hulk. There are a few changes in this latest movie...Liv Tyler now plays the love interest; William Hurt plays the General; and Edward Norton now plays the tortured Dr. Bruce Banner. There is the same old theme of a tormented Dr. Banner trying to cure himself (i.e., by using calming techniques taught to him and by sending data to a professor at the University) while trying to elude his nemesis General Ross (who is still trying to capture and control the Hulk), and rekindling a romance with Betty (Ross' daughter). The new additions to the story is the angry, power hungry soldier, Emil Blonsky who Ross' is willing to experiment on to insure that he has someone who can rival the Hulk. Blonsky doesn't mind being experimented on if it means that he will have super strength. He feels the power already.<br /><br />While there are some cheesy moments (cameos of both a deceased Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, not to mention the creator of Marvel Comics), over all I think this movie was extremely enjoyable, and I think Norton ended up being a decent Hulk. He definitely looks and acts tortured. And the lesson is clear, you can continue to fight the rage inside you or you can learn to control and use it. But more importantly, the movie sets the tone for future Hulk movies and future storylines...the Doctor helping Banner I think could be the Doctor with the large cranium from the comic books/cartoons, not to mention Banner's continued search for a cure. Or maybe at least we will discover if Banner ever learns to control his beast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Incredible Hulk" is not a sequel to Ang Lee's lackluster 2003 film "Hulk" but a reboot of the Hulk franchise that introduces a slightly different backstory. Dr. Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) exposed himself to gamma radiation while working on a medical research project for General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who, unbeknownst to Banner, intended the research to create an enhanced soldier. When the experiment turns Banner into an enraged green Hulk, he is forced to flee Gen. Ross, who wants to dissect the beast and propagate its enhanced physique. Having eluded capture for five years, Banner is compelled to return to the U.S. to retrieve data from his old love and research partner Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). He has been communicating with a scientist calling himself Dr. Blue who may be able to use the data to cure Banner's condition.<br /><br />Be sure to watch this backstory play out over the opening credits. This is an economical way for director Louis Leterrier to set the movie up, but audiences could miss it. This film is a well-conceived and relevant adaptation of the Hulk comic from screenwriter Zak Penn. Like "The Incredible Hulk" television series of 1978-82, it emphasizes Bruce Banner's fugitive status and his constant battle to control his emotions. Edward Norton makes a good nerdy scientist who is, nonetheless, determined and resourceful. The audience really feels for his predicament, which is the film's great achievement. And, for most of its duration, Banner acts like a person would really act in his situation, lending credibility to a story that obviously stretches it. Liv Tyler is a little to breathy to be a cell biologist, but she plays well with Norton and Hurt.<br /><br />I found this Hulk, who is voiced by none other than Lou Ferrigno, more affecting that the cartoonish version in the 2003 film, but still not entirely lifelike. Ferrigno and Hulk co-creator Stan Lee also make brief appearances in the film. The final confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination runs too long, but "The Incredible Hulk"  shows promise as a new franchise. I look forward to the next episode. It's a good cast, and the themes of a man struggling to control himself and another striving to bend nature to his will are compelling, thought the latter might have been more explicit.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition contains 5 deleted scenes, 1 extended scene, and a feature commentary with director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth, who plays Emil Bronsky, a soldier employed by General Ross to capture Bruce Banner. It is a conversational but constant scene-by-scene commentary, sometimes with Roth acting as an interviewer. They share their recollections of filming, and Leterrier comments on locations, supporting cast, his intentions with each scene, and what he added that was unscripted. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>Action packed and kinetic. This one maintains a better pace than the first one. The first attempt tried to be very cerebral and focus on the inner workings of the characters, forgetting to put in some real action. Here, that has been rectified.<br /><br />The action is very well done and the effects of the Hulk character are about as realistic as you could expect a giant green man to appear.<br /><br />However, a couple of the fight scenes -- particularly the last one between the Hulk and the Abomination -- are filmed a little too close to really be able to easily follow the action.<br /><br />Other than that, this one is great. Here's hoping Marvel moves forward with the same love of their characters as they produce their own movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie re-tells the tale of "Hulk" with new cast of characters.  Ed Norton plays Bruce, Liv Tyler plays Betty, and William Hurt as "The General".  They pick up in Brazil where Banner was at the end of the last "Hulk" movie, and negate the whole storyline of David banner passing on the "Hulk" gene to Bruce, who unlocks it in a lab accident. Then the rest of the movie develops around how the general is going to capture the Hulk back for the military use.<br />Why three stars from me on this movie, and four for "Hulk"?<br />Here, they montage the creation of the hulk together in the opening credits by showing banner self experimenting and getting gamma poisoning and having a bad reaction with the test chemicals, unleashing the hulk.  This is what happened on the TV show and in the comics, but I thought it was too discounted and poor form to do underneath the opening credits.  That brought my rating down a bit.  Also, this animated version of the hulk i didn't care for as much as the "HULK" movie.  The details were just to overdrawn, to many ripples and textures. Finally, having Ed Norton play hulk and Liv Tyler play betty was like having Ben Affleck play DareDevil, bad casting.  I kept quoting Fight Club and Armaggeddon throughout the movie.  Too much actor baggage to bring along to characters who need to develop on their own.  They needed to keep Eric Bana, who brings fresher acting skills, like Tobey Mcguire did to Spiderman.  Overall, if marvel would have just had this movie made first, or made a sequel to Hulk to tie in the Avengers, it would have been better.<br /><br />I still recommend this movie, just not stongly. The Blu Ray format is excellent here with all the action and details, and worth picking up.<br /><br />FYI: The Alternate Opening is nothing to look forward to, a good choice to go with the montage, even though I didn't care for it, the lesser of two evils.</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>Well, it certainly took me a while to get to this one and I think part of my reluctance stemmed from the 2003 film Hulk, which left me with mixed emotions.  The story was entirely too dry and drawn out for my tastes and what little screen time the title character received had more in common with video game graphics of the era then big-budget Hollywood feature films.  However, I did say mixed emotions on account of the fact that Eric Bana's interpretation of the Bruce Banner character was pretty solid and as poorly animated as they were, a few of Hulk's frenzies were the stuff of comic fan-boy dreams (traveling from town to town like a bouncing ball and tossing tanks as if they were a shot-put to mention a few).<br /><br />Enter The Incredible Hulk where five years of hiatus brought with them a new director, new script, and even a new leading male to pick up the torch as everyone's favorite "green machine".  It should be noted that to a majority of industry insiders, this film is not considered a direct sequel to the 2003 Hulk, but calling it an entirely independent tale isn't accurate either.  As such this work is what's commonly classified as a "loose sequel" and for the most part, succeeds in nearly every area where the original came up short.<br /><br />The film opens right where the former title left off with an apprehensive Banner trying to establish a new life for himself in South America after his last violent encounter with the military.  Working at a soda-bottling factory in Rocinha while searching for a cure for his condition, Banner is constantly at odds with his own biology as he practices calming techniques to control his heart rate with trained masters.<br /><br />Perhaps the coolest developed link-up in recent action-film history occurs when a drop of Banner's infected blood finds its way onto the glass of one of the soda bottles on the assembly line, ends up getting shipped to the States, finds its way into a Wisconsin resident's fridge, poisons the poor thirsty fool (played by none other than Stan Lee himself), and results in the government getting the trace on the scientist/ monster at-large.<br /><br />Without breaking down the plot too thoroughly (after all, why bother watching it if so), let's just say that the military wants what fuels Banner, Banner just wants to rid himself of the condition, Elizabeth "Betty" Ross wants closure on her ex-boyfriend's condition, and rogue soldier Emil Blonsky feels like if given the chance, he could better-control the powers bestowed upon Banner.<br /><br />Where the 2003 film was a slightly misguided stab at drama, the 2008 picture is all action; bordering on the definition of a "popcorn flick".  As such the pacing is much more swift and efficient throughout with perhaps the longest non-action segment occurs right in the opening where Banner's attempt at a normal life in Brazil is established.  By the time Uncle Sam sends his goons down to retrieve the fugitive Banner, the viewer has passed the point of no return: hold on and enjoy the ride!<br /><br />Directed by Frenchman Louis Leterrier and written by Zack Penn opposed to Ang Lee and James Schamus respectively, the production team is only a part of the switch-ups Marvel Studious/ Universal Pictures implemented between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk.  Edward Norton replaces Eric Bana as Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross instead of Jennifer Connelly; and William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliott as General Thaddeus Ross.  And what would a Hulk film be without paying homage to the living legend Lou Ferrigno?  Lou delivers with both a cameo appearance as well as having provided the few spoken lines the Hulk delivers.<br /><br />Particularly noteworthy is the addition of a new villain intended to pose a more realistic threat to the Hulk than the military could possibly offer in the form of "The Abomination".  The presentation of this enemy is a bit reminiscent of the Gray Hulk Marvel comic story thread (only on the opposite side of the coin) and upon completing some research, it turns out that screenwriter James Schamus was indeed planning a sequel around the time the 2003 film was released that would indeed feature the Gray Hulk story arc.  However as time went on (and a new crew was assembled to do the film), Silver Age villain Abomination was recruited to provide the antihero moments with an updated look that subconsciously pays homage to the "Baby" alien design of Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />Perhaps my own crowning moment takes place at the conclusion of the film when Robert Downy Jr. appears as Tony Stark to assure a drunken General Ross that a new team of heroes was on the cusp of formation, of course hinting toward Marvel's next major motion picture: The Avengers set to release in 2012.  Additionally, and also appreciated by fans who have followed the comic's continuity, Samuel Sterns (played by Tim Blake Nelson) makes an appearance which sets up his eventual transformation from slightly mad scientist to green-skinned, large brained, massive skulled, super-intelligent villain, The Leader.<br /><br />In all it's easy to become thrilled with this project simply for the potential for future franchise efforts hinted toward throughout if not for the much-publicized improvements made over the 2003 picture.  And this coming from a reviewer who thought the 2003 film wasn't all that bad to start with.  While the computer generated imaging has drawn criticism by some fans once again, the truth of the matter is that this incarnation of the Hulk is truly "larger than life" as the character need be portrayed.  For the most part, it works, especially in the battle between Hulk and Abomination throughout the cityscape that comes off as a clash of titanic proportion more at home in the mythology of the ancient Greeks than on the pages of a comic book.  And in the end that's what makes for a solid comic to cinema translation as far as I'm concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I was never into comic books or super heroes or any of that stuff.  I just never found it interesting as a kid so I wasn't going into this movie with high hopes or expecting a classic.  If anything, I expected another movie similar to King Kong, and well, that's sort of what the Incredible Hulk is.<br /><br />A big jolly green monster jumping around through the streets with a nasty attitude that suddenly develops whenever he turns big and green and scary.  It's like you can't be big and strong with a positive and welcoming attitude.<br /><br />He is more than capable of picking up vehicles and throwing them through the air, and that's also his main thing- picking up cars and slamming them down.  He does this quite a bit throughout the movie, and while I was already aware of his car-slamming techniques before watching the movie despite not knowing much about the Incredible Hulk character, it's good to know those little details were included in the movie.<br /><br />Also, there was plenty of action that kept me interested, such as TWO mega hulks grabbing a helicopter with a hot woman inside and trying to bring it down.  They eventually did.<br /><br />I knew there would be plenty of special effects and the film certainly delivers in that area.  Though one thing that kind of bugs me is how the regular guy keeps turning into the Hulk character while inside a dark area, so you don't actually see the transformation very often.  You almost do in one scene, and I appreciated that, but other than that one part I can't remember getting the opportunity to see him turn into the green monster.<br /><br />So what do we have as a final thought?  Well, like I said, I don't know much about all these fictional character heroes, but this movie did keep me watching it until the end, something most movies fail to do these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's version was unwatchable so I was cautiously optimistic regarding this version. I've always liked Ed Norton and while the casting may be strange, I figured he would try something different and interesting with the role.<br /><br />I had a hard time trying to rate this film. I think without a doubt the first half of the film is the strongest, while the latter half was sort of ridiculous and over the top in a bad way. The plot is somewhat mangled, the characters range from uninteresting to downright annoying and the 'bad guy' Hulk was pretty stupid.<br /><br />Ed Norton brought some personality to the title role but even he couldn't save this film. He has a specific look that works so well in most of the films he does, but here, well, it was sometimes odd to see him in character. Liv Tyler did the best she could with her boring role. Her and Norton's character couldn't be more different and trying to picture them together in anyway just didn't work.<br /><br />The climax of the film, as I mentioned earlier is shockingly ridiculous. It is unintentionally funny and just loud and annoying. My 3 star rating is generous-it would be more like 2.5, but like I said, the first half of the film is respectable and had great potential. It's just too bad about the rest of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Starring Ed Norton, who I almost always like to watch.

The Hulk<br />was one of my favorite characters when I was a kid. I am now 56. The<br />lead character is played by Edward Norton in the role of Bruce Banner.<br />He is exposed to gamma radiation which in turn creates the Hulk when he is angered. He is pursued by General Ross who wants to create a super soldier in the mold of the Hulk. His daughter is the love of Banner's life. Banner escapes from South America and returns to America to see Betty Ross. He is again pursued by General Ross. There is nonstop action<br />of the Hulk doing battle with the Army soldiers. General Ross has a major<br />played by Emil Blonsky. The major wants to be a monster like the Hulk. He<br />is finally able to do this. He is horrible and mean. He and the Hulk have<br />a battle to the death. It is quite a contest. The special effects in this movie are unbelievable. Be sure to see this movie. You will not be dissapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Incredible Hulk is a better version than Ang Lee's Hulk which was released a few years ago. This particular movie is more lively and exciting but it is not a perfect action flick. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler make a lovely couple as Bruce and Betty and William Hurt is pretty flawless in terms of acting. Stan Lee makes a cameo apperance while Tom Roth once again steals every scene, he is truly creepy in this. Good solid movie with excellent special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Before watching this movie, I had a great number of expectations.  Disappointed that actor Eric Bana wasn't returning; I thought Edward Norton was going to phone in his performance.  This one gets off the ground running.  We get to see our favorite jade jawed hero in action from the first frame.  Oscar winner, William Hurt, was the perfect General Ross.  Obsessed and out of control, he manages to create a bitter rival in Blonski or the Abomination.  Tim Roth's intensity made the movie work outside the realm of comics.  Although he was much unlike his four color counterpart; it worked!<br /><br />Liv Tyler was the perfect actress for Betty Ross.  It appeared the relationship between Banner and Ross had progressed over time.  What I did admire was the tribute to the TV show, with the opening sequence.  It didn't take a set of Cliff Notes to know how Banner transformed into the creature.  The audience was not left wanting.  I would like to know how the writer and director are going to top this one in Hulk 3?  Will they feature the Leader or the Rhino for the nemesis?</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I appear to be one of about six people who actually liked Ang Lee's movie Hulk. This puts in me in good company with Roger Ebert, but that's about it. And that's too bad, cause it was a good movie, it just wasn't what people wanted in a film about the Hulk. Having watched The Incredible Hulk, I know now what people wanted. What they wanted, simply, was "HULK SMASH!" Boy, do you ever get that in this movie, which reboots the Hulk franchise.<br /><br />Edward Norton turns in a memorable performance as Bruce Banner, tortured scientist who must remain calm as possible under any circumstances (he can't even have sex anymore cause it excites his body too much). He's being hunted down by General Ross, and has a love affair with Ross' daughter, Betty. He's trying to find a cure, living a solitary life, dodging the authorities, etc, etc. Really, it doesn't matter. The plot is entirely tacked-on and doesn't do much but serve as links between scenes where the Hulk gets to pop up.<br /><br />That the movie succeeds despite this is saying something. As I said, it isn't much more than scenes of pointless plot followed by lotsa action, but that action is damn impressive! It's amazing how much the effects have improved just since the first Hulk movie came out. Some people compared the original Hulk's look to Shrek, or animated lime Jell-o. He, and the Abomination, both look very impressive and reasonably convincing.<br /><br />But I have to say, much as I liked this movie, it wasn't nearly as deep or, frankly, good, as Iron Man. That point really gets driven home as you're constantly reminded of that better movie, as the military types use weapons from Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself puts in an appearance at the end of the movie. SHIELD gets their name dropped a lot, too. That does at least lend a sense of continuity with the previous film, as do references to the super soldier serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America.<br /><br />You also get a bit of a feeling of deja vu if, like me, you watched the old Hulk TV series back in the day. Not only doe Lou Ferigno do a cameo appearance in person, but he also voices the Hulk. Bill Bixby even turns up in a brief little cameo. Best of all, they use what Family Guy described as "The sad walking-away music" on the soundtrak. Very cool.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie? Yes, but I strongly recommend seeing it on the big screen, since I think on TV it won't look nearly as impressive. Plus since there's apparently plans for movies with Thor, Captain America and Nick Fury, culminating in a film about the Avengers, it's worth seeing this movie so you'll have a better idea how it will link together with those.<br /><br />Even just as a stand-alone film, it is pretty damn entertaining and lots of fun. Great mindless escapism. The movie succeeds at what it sets out to do, and in this case, that's good enough for me!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Special effects was the only plus side to this film. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner (aka The Incredible Hulk)? No. Liv Tyler (aka breathe heavy in all lines girl) as Betty Ross? No. William Hurt has big mustache military man? No. This film was horribly miscast. I lost count how many times I thought Norton was pathetic (I am, of course, biased. I don't care for his acting) and how annoyed I got at Tyler's heavy breathing moans.<br /><br />The best part of this film, outside of the special effects, was the very end when Tony Stark made an entrance and spoke about "forming a team". BRING ME IRON MAN!<br /><br />The Hulk did look better in this film than the previous film. But the story for both films was awful.<br /><br />In this version, Bruce Banner is hiding from General Ross and the US Army in a far away country. He is taking steps to prevent himself from getting "worked up" and turning into The Hulk.<br /><br />Because some of Banner's blood drops into a bottle of silly juice and comic creator Stan Lee drinks it and dies, the army Special Forces is on the hunt.<br /><br />The Special Forces team is led by a man who wants to get stronger and faster to take on the green creature. Thanks to General Ross, he becomes another Hulk-type and they call him Abomination. The final fight between the two behemoths was touted as this fantastic eye candy...it left me wanting to watch something else.<br /><br />This is why I waited for a friend to loan this movie to me. There is no way I would ever pay for something like this.<br /><br />Let's hope the upcoming Captain America and Thor are more along the lines of Iron Man and let this film go away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Hulkamania is back on the screen! He's green! He's mean! He's ...uh ...green and mean.<br /><br />With less than five years separating Ang Lee's 2003 version entitled simply <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DRF84W">Hulk</a>, French director Louis Leterrier (who's done a few questionable films in the recent past, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSI7BW">Transporter 2</a> and DANNY THE DOG aka <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2IPQY">Unleashed</a>), takes up the Marvel comic book reigns and takes a shot at the pi$$ed off Bruce Banner.<br /><br />Replacing Erica Bana (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1IQN2">Munich</a>) as the Hulk/Bruce Banner is film star Edward Norton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>). Norton's film repertoire up to now has been fairly superlative: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305313687">American History X</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000B1OFL">The Italian Job</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GDH9NM">Down in the Valley</a>, The Illusionist, and several other high caliber films decorate his resume, so I was expecting another engaging film from him. Although I found his performance to be good, the story suffered from a lack of direction; it's goal seeming to be only to tell you that another film is coming with the Hulk's involvement. In other words, no plot.<br /><br />Marvel has had a couple of successes lately, though, and one can't necessarily knock them for doing what they're doing, which is setting comic book fans up for "something big". Their highest claim to fame is undoubtedly Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. I loved Iron Man. Downey Jr. encapsulated the character and was both funny and cocky. A great match. But here, with THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we get a mish-mash of quality.<br /><br />Part of the problem is undeniably due to the fact that this film comes off the heals of Ang Lee's version. Lee's Hulk was anything but perfect, let's make that perfectly clear. But it did reinvent Hulk and gave us a unique look at the dynamics behind the character. Here in The Incredible Hulk, we get a forced love story (with no background, really), an intro to the Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns. The Abomination's inclusion will obviously play a vital part in upcoming films, and I appreciate that, but let's tell a good story along with it. Lee's Hulk, at the very least, did that.<br /><br />There are a few positive qualities here, though. The cast is fairly strong except for another wooden performance by William Hurt (Into the Wild). He seemed to be just going through the motions. There's also the fact that the film feels more like the television series, jumping us right into Bannon's life and his isolation due to his medical condition. We also get a glimpse of the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno (if you pay attention).<br /><br />But these positives do not outweigh the negatives. Lacking any real direction, The Incredible Hulk is interesting eye-candy with plenty of action but little substance ...which made me turn a bit green.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>The first Hulk movie was better than this Hulk movie. Ed Norton just keeps getting skinnier and his acting abilities seem to need a boost of gamma radiation. I wanted to like this movie because I am a big Marvel Comics fan but this movie just wasn't that good. The casting was pretty poor. William Hurt did a good job as Thunderbolt Ross but Liv Tyler is just an awful actress and delivers every line like she is a 2 year old trapped in a womans body (with big pillowy lips). Tim Roth is a good actor but... why Tim Roth? He is suppose to be a great commando and then he takes his shirt off and he looks like a 3 pack a day horribly unfit homeless person who hasn't had a wash or a good meal in about 5 years. Then when he gets some of the super soldier formula they hilariously try to paint muscles on his horrible body. Also standing by William Hurt he looks to be about 4 feet tall which is ok considering that Ed Norton appears to be about 120 pounds of rippling skin and bones which is about 50 pounds less than his love interest Betty Ross.<br /><br />This movie just wasn't that good. I heard that Norton was not pleased and if you watch the deleted scenes you can see that a lot of the humanity of The Hulk (Banner) ended up on the cutting room floor. I have to disagree. There was nothing in the deleted scenes that shouldn't have been deleted except maybe the extended scene between Hurt and Roth.<br /><br />Watch the first one. It was better and it wasn't that good. But I liked the look of The Hulk in the first one better and I thought the fight scenes and special effects were better. Josh Lucas, Jennifer Conolley, Sam Elliot and Eric Bana were a much better cast too.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>If you are interested in a Hulk with high calibre acting and character investment but that's short on The Hulk and action sequences then go watch Ang Lee's The Hulk instead. If you felt that Ang Lee's The Hulk was like something out of a Danielle Steel novel and just want to see the comic book realized onto the big screen with lots of action upon action and are prepared to sacrifice character content for monsters throwing each other through buildings then The Incredible Hulk is exactly what you want.<br /><br />The Premise is quite simple and works as a sequel to Ang Lee's The Hulk even if it does change the story somewhat. Bruce Banner (Norton) finds himself in South America learning martial arts techniques to control rage while the military try to get him to convert his unique biology into a weapon and dose up a super solider to track him down only to find that the super solider has lost control and so they need The Hulk to save the day. That's it in a nutshell.<br /><br />Overall this flick is pure cannon fodder. You can sit through it and come out satisfied that you have finally seen Marvel's The Hulk on the big screen. At the same time it is no Batman or Spider-man but that is probably the character's limitations even if Norton does but in a good effort. If you want to see things getting trashed left, right and centre with some very good special effects then The Incredible Hulk is where it is at.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>After the major success of 'Iron Man' and of course the special surprise that was revield to us at the end of the film, we were all eager for the next big Marvel hero movie. So In between the summer kickoff with 'Iron Man' and the heavily anticipated blockbuster 'The Dark Knight', Marvel decided to revive a hero who was brought to shame a few years earlier.<br /><br />'The Incredible Hulk' was a complete make-over from Ang Lee's monstorsity with a talaented cast (Well....not much to say about Liv Tyler) much better special effects and a deeper more emotional story. The film also paid tribute to the fan favorite television show as well as the comic book geeks who pretty much went to see the movie against their will. This movie left me satisfied again it was not the greatest movie I had ever seen but like 'Iron Man' the movie was fun and enjoyable. Of course with Marvel's big project that will be heading to theaters in the next few years the end of this film will also leave you with a smile on your face.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>"The Incredible Hulk" is a romp in a Marvel Comics translation into film, but lacks the depth of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QDS">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>. What could have been absolutely astonishing becomes only credible viewing enjoyment, a great popcorn movie, as other reviewers have described it.<br /><br />Edward Norton is fine as the scientist Bruce Banner, but not outstanding. He does a credible job with the script as presented, but motive is lacking, a foundation for the story. The film--its writers, director--assumes viewer knowledge of the Marvel story, but a great film would fold the viewer into the story by providing missing background. We know what the Colonel wants but not why Banner was participating.<br /><br />So the film ends up being superficial--all show and no depth. I want to know more about Tim Roth's character, what motivates him. The film certainly gives nod to the stereotype of the military seeking troop enhancement at all costs. Are they all like that? As for William Hurt as the Colonel, he went beyond his usual acting portrayals to give us at least a thoughtful "villain" rather than his usual bullish portraits. I thought this character was the highlight of the film.<br /><br />And moon-struck Betty? How did these two get together? I have to assume that Betty and Banner worked together, but how? Showing her wearing a lab coat cannot take the place of some kind of explanation. What is their connection? I know that a film cannot be all-inclusive but some are. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a> did just that! Now there's a five-star film!<br /><br />"Incredible Hulk" is certainly a well-made film--the cinematography is awesome!--but it takes more than film editing and CGI to make an incredible movie. Although I enjoyed the movie, I finished wanting just a little more. However, the final scene is something to cheer about! May it happen!</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Let me say straight away, this film is much better than the Ang Lee/Eric Bana mess, but really that's not saying much.  Look, Im no fan of Edward Norton, he's surly, unattractive, and never has any chemistry with his female leads, I suppose maybe they find him as hideous as I do, but I digress.  Honestly, he's not bad in this, Banner is sort of a loner and skin flint, so it works in this role, though again no sparks between he and Tyler.  The Abomination is a great choice as a villian, he's as stong as the Hulk and much more destructive, the Hulk was never as blessed as Spider Man when it came to villian in the Marvel Universe, the Abomination is about as good as he ever got.  I wish he had appeared earlier in the film, we only really get to see him in full form at the end when he tangles with the Hulk.  The million dollar question is..did the CGI Hulk work this time, and in my opinion he did, he looked much more real, though still obviously CGI, but his face was more expressive.  The pace of the film is a bit slow, but not nearly the glacial pace of the Ang Lee film and as it neared the end it really picked up, though ironically I feel the best part of the film was the begining when Banner is chased all over the slums of Rio, yes, it was very "Jason Bourne", but all action films crib from Bourne these days.  Overall, hardly Ironman, but a pretty good action film, and as a huge Hulk comic fan when I was a kid, Im very grateful about that fact.  Oh and the camios by Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby and the iconic Stan Lee are all nice touches.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is quite a fun film but slow paced.

I'll admit, I never read his comic series despite being obsessed with Marvel as a whole, and so I didn't know much about him other than the random times he popped up in Spider-Man or whatever.  I saw bits and pieces of Ang Lee's 2003 disaster of sorts while on vacation a few years back and fell asleep.  Visually, it seemed tight but organically it lacked depth.<br /><br />This 2008 abomination is just lacking everywhere.<br /><br />The visuals are cheesy and so cartoon like that it made me literally depressed.  I mean, we can't expect all of our superhero films to have the depth of character that Nolan or even Rami brought to their respective franchises, but we should expect that they are visually impressive.  `The Incredible Hulk' is just blandly created and looks so garish.  The Hulk himself looks awful, but the real sinker visually was that thing that comes of Tim Roth.  Seriously, that was a mess.  Other than the ridiculous use of CGI, the storyline is messy and the acting is terrible.  Edward Norton, who is usually VERY good, is wooden and merely a prop that leads to bigger and dumber things.  Liv Tyler first of all looks awful and her hushed voice is used desperately here.  She sounds like an idiot, and her performance lacks all conviction.  The makeup job on Hurt was great (almost unrecognizable) but the makeup on Roth was terrible, and his performance was atrocious.<br /><br />All around, this is a comic failure (pun intended).</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>I don't get it. I thought that this version of the Hulk was supposed to be all that. Everybody griped about how bad Ang Lee's Hulk was and how this version was so much better. After all, with this Hulk you had one of the Hulk's old nemesis in the Abomination, which promised way more action. Also, with this hulk, you had not one but two credible actors in Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Edward Norton (Fight Club) albeit with an unknown director in Louis Letterier. All the critics raved that this Hulk had not only vindicated Ang Lee's so-called debacle, but that this Hulk almost rivaled the much vaunted Iron Man. So, I guess, I had to check the Hulk out for myself and see if all the salivation and sloppy oral service was worth it.<br /><br />It wasn't. First, the story was a cliche bastard, meaning that Marvel goofed. Anyone who's read the comic knows the true origin of how Dr. Robert Bruce Banner (not David damnit)became the Hulk. I won't go into a long explanation of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk, but it sure wasn't the way the writers of this movie portrayed Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk. I won't ejaculate on how counterfeit this movie was; instead, I'll stick to the merits of this movie--there were hardly any. I thought this Hulk would have more action. More action?!There were only two or three Hulk sequences in the entire film, and those sequences were abbreviated and inebriated. The special effects of this Hulk were less sophisticated than the special effects in the first (Ang Lee's) Hulk. Hulk looked like a big, green, veiny wad of rubber. Actually, he looked like an alien erection. If you've yet to see this Hulk, imagine this: choke down four sloppy double-cheese white castles, a jar of jalepenos, a bean burrito with guacamole sauce, an oxtail, a bowl of hot chili, and a couple of warm beers. A few hours later, take a crap, then turn around and look at what you did--that's the Hulk. Tim Roth and Ed Norton are great actors, but this movie proves that--no matter who's the star and no matter how awesome the intentions-- you need good writing. Take a look at the Batman franchise prior to Christopher Nolan. Batman was the Ocean's Eleven of superhero movies--a vehicle for big stars to get a lot of underserved publicity and to get an easy paycheck. Batman had gotten so putrid that George Clooney GEORGE CLOONEY played Batman. People have midget memories. Think back! Batman was camp fodder before Nolan took over and made it respectable again, or probably for the first time ever. Ang Lee tried to make the Hulk respectable and, to this reviewer, he did make this movie respectable, much more so than this dumb version of the Hulk which couldn't seem to make up its mind on what movie it wanted to sample. First, it wanted to be King Kong by taking the woman up to a cave overlooking the city, then he breaks out hollering and screaming like a damn idiot. Then, at the end of the movie, the Hulk goes away bouncing off of buildings a la Spiderman. This franchise needs an injection of heart and commitment, not more Gumby-like special effects. I'm tired of superhero movies.<br /><br />author of Gotta Be Down!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>There should be a law that if you intend to relaunch a franchise less than five years after the last attempt, every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a complete story. Knocking out the whole origin chapter during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce never came off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk. He actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brain, which kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that's supposed to fuel the story. They're both mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors. This blew up in Marvel's face.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>There are very good special effects and plenty of action. However, there is a disconnect with Hulk, the first movie. There are new actors, and a changed recap of part 1. This movie's story does not develop along, but it meanders, taking a toll on the overall movie experience. Last, the ending is less than satisfactory.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>well, the first THE HULK from some years before is real bad....the story is uninspired, and the film is confuse and silly....well, it's hard to make a movie with a green giant monster that destroy everything and can't speak rational words....this one, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a little better than THE HULK, but still is not so good...These HULK movies got amazing visual effects, but got uninspired dialogues, characters and  story....</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I have to say neither the movie or the actors were bad if at all the actors portraying the characters did incredibly well but this movie just for some reason did not keep my attention unlike the X-men movies.  If you've read the comics for the early years of the Hulk Bruce Banner was hunted like this by the government to use him and how Bruce tries to contain or control his Hulk Persona and I like that the movie shows the same thing.  I can't say if it's either because I've read the comics or just wanted to see the big fight between Hulk and Abomination but I found myself wanting to skip through the scenes in between the Hulk scenes and the final fight.  But if you haven't read the comics or seen the first Hulk Movie I do advise not skipping the scenes otherwise you will become confused on what is happening.  The video and audio for the blu-ray version are incredible nicely detailed and sharp and hearing the effects are astounding.  So I say while the movie doesn't reach the level of the X-men movies I put it in the same rank as Iron Man or the Fantastic Four movies.  So if you like the comic book movies this one is a good choice for you....</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What makes The Incredible Hulk a great movie is that it does such a great job with the CGI. I recently saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E75QGG">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>, and the green screen special effects were so obvious that it was distracting to the action. That kind of blatant "fakeness" would not be good in a movie like The Hulk whose 'big' star is CGI technology. No. The Hulk delivers a realistic looking CGI protagonist (and a cool looking antagonist).<br /><br />The story flow is a little slow at times, and I'm not sure that Ed Norton was a slam-dunk Bruce Banner. The movie was good while Ed and his supporting cast were on-screen, but the movie was great when his CGI counterpart smashed onto the screen.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk takes you from a brief introduction of how Bruce Banner became The Hulk, who uncontrollably destroyed everything in his path, to perhaps the first real confrontation that earned The Hulk superhero status. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. I was thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />The story is well-written for the screen by X-men screenwriter Zak Penn. The really good news is that Penn has announced that he is working on the screenplay that will bring The Hulk, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAPC1K">Iron Man</a> and the rest of The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">Avengers</a> together on the big screen perhaps as early as 2010 (wishful thinking).<br /><br />The Hulk needs some friends to help move his movies along when he's not in the green. The Avengers movie would be just the antidote that he's looking for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>this movie is good and exciting. Also It's better than the first one. This movie computer special effect was fantastic. Some scenes are great.<br />I enjoyed this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>I'm one of those people who didn't find fault in Ang Lee's "Hulk" sometime back. I actually thought it was a pretty good movie and stayed true to the comic book mythos. Given, Ang took a few liberties here and there with things but, for the most part, it was worth going to see- to me. Other people, however, didn't think the first one was any good because of the fact that it wasn't like the TV show. Too, maybe it was the fact that there wasn't any real butt-whooping in the movie like Hulk is so big on doing in the comics. That's where the second movie comes in.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk starts off with Banner in Brazil working at a soda company and living in the slums with his dog. He tries to live a quiet life while trying to work on a cure with an online friend of his called Mr. Blue. When General Ross finds out where Banner is hiding, he takes his group of military people and goes after him. Unfortunately, things don't turn out too well. A member of that squad named Blonsky is out for blood because his squadmates didn't make it so he talks Ross into letting him stay in the loop in tracking him down. That, my friends, is when things get interesting. Without giving anything away, let's just say that Hulk gets a little more than he bargains for.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk-which was directed by Louis Leterrier(best known for Transporter 1&2)- is a more action-packed movie than its' predecessor. It moves at a brisker pace than the original and is, overall, a better movie for it. However, in my opinion, it is far from being as spectacular as the Spider-Man movies or the X-Men movies or even the recent Iron Man. It certainly has potential, though. Potential that I see Louis Leterrier expanding on if kept as the film series director. I did find several things kind of annoying concerning The Hulk in this movie. All were, basically, visual. First off, His color looked a little too dark to me. I'll admit, Ang Lee's version wasn't right either but it was more in the right direction. Second, there's not much resemblance between Banner and The Hulk when there should be. Banner's hair is brown whereas Hulk's is black.  Third, and lastly, his size isn't consistent throughout. Course, it is known that the angrier that Hulk gets, the bigger he becomes. While these are minor things, as a whole, it's those little things that make it a little less interesting to me.<br /><br />At any rate, overall, The Incredible Hulk is a great movie. Much better than the first and more rewarding on account of it. I highly recommend it.

This is what a movie about a giant green rage-monster should be -- a lean, muscular action movie with a thread of bittersweet romance, and solid performances by William Hurt, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.<br /><br />A few years ago, Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation in a failed military experiment, which turned him into a giant green berserker. Ever since then, the cruel General Ross (Hurt) has been mercilessly pursuing him, so they can create giant green soldiers.<br /><br />And after a few years hiding in Brazil, Banner is finally found by the military... only to end up on the run after he Hulks his way out of the confrontation. He may be able to get a cure, but only if he gets the original data from the experiment, which means sneaking back into the US to see his ex-girlfriend Betty (Tyler). Betty is also Ross's daughter. Awkward.<br /><br />And after the military attacks him again, Banner ends up hulking out, then goes on the run with Betty to find a cure. But he doesn't know that Ross has taken special measures to capture him, by dosing elite soldier Neil Blonsky (Tim Roth) with a supersoldier serum -- which unleashes a monster far worse than the Hulk.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" gave audiences everything that Ang Lee's movie was missing. It has pretty much everything you can ask from a movie about a giant green id-monster -- lots of explosions, gunfire, chases, and a core story about a man whose life is destroyed by the ambitious people who want to use the Hulk's power.<br /><br />And the movie lopes along at a fast pace, slowing down for the occasional romantic scene when Betty and Bruce are alone. There are some funny moments ("Don't make me... hungry!"), but the overall mood is a somber one -- you're always aware of danger, and how much Bruce has lost through no fault of his own.<br /><br />The one problem I have with this movie? Edward Norton. Don't get me wrong, his performance is absolutely stellar, and his rewrites of the script made the movie even better. But he doesn't quite work as the quiet, shy nerd -- he can't turn off the wiry intensity that he always exudes.<br /><br />But the other actors are spot on -- Hurt as a cold, sociopathic soldier who doesn't care who dies as long as he gets the Hulk, Tyler as the loving supportive Betty who can soothe the savage beast, and Roth as a battle-happy soldier whose obsession with fighting turns him into a monster.<br /><br />"The Incredible Hulk" is exactly what you'd want from a Hulk movie -- romance, tragedy, and Hulk smashing. A fun popcorn movie with some darker edges.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Just watched The Incredible Hulk again, for the umpteenth time, and I have to say. It seems to get better every time I watch it. I am a huge fan of the character, but Ang Lee's Hulk did not do him the justice he deserved, in my opinion. Besides the fact that it was kind of long and boring, I just felt like there wasn't anything of value in that movie to retain my interest. For this one, it really made me happy to see such a devoted team work to bring fans the movie they deserved. It also made me happy to see that it was more of a continuation of where Hulk (2003) left off in the South American jungle, rather than a standard reboot. Ed Norton is to this film, what Ryan Reynolds will be to the Deadpool spin-off. He actually cared about the character, and had previous knowledge of who Bruce Banner and the Hulk were. That is always better than an actor who has to play catch up before shooting begins. I love Ed Norton, so I hope he returns for a second, and makes an appearance in The Avengers. I know the studio had his script rewritten and pissed him off, but hopefully they will work all of that out. Another huge plus this movie had going for it was Tim Roth as the villain. He was fantastic in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And say what you want about Planet of the Apes, but he was very convincing as Thade. Another thing I really like about The Incredible Hulk is how tightly edited it is. The cinematography is beatiful, and the editors did a great job at cutting the scenes together. I wish there was a little more film for them to edit though. Nevertheless, it had a consistent flow in the pacing.<br /><br />There was a fair amount of breathtaking action. My favorite action set piece is on the college campus, but the final fight was sick as well. The narrative is definitely the star of this one. It brings joy to my heart that writers are taking comic book movies more serious. I never felt like the story was getting off track, or boring. There's alot of things that I love about this movie, but there are definitely a few flaws. The biggest flaw would have to be Liv Tyler's phoned in performance. Is it just me, or is she overrated? Her performance in The Lord of the Rings was pretty good, but how hard was that role? Another problem I had was that there was not enough character development for the Hulk, himself. Sure Bruce Banner was well developed, but what about the Hulk? In the comics and cartoons he held full conversations, but in the live action movies he can only utter two or three words. It gives viewers the false impression that he is all smash and scream, with no real thought process, except to protect Betty. I also felt that there wasn't enough variety. To me the movie went by too quickly. Is that a bad thing? I don't know, but I like this movie alot. Especially because the character is special to me. Of course this movie is no Iron Man or Spider-man, but it was a nice addition to my library of comic book films. In the mean time, I will keep impatiently waiting for the next installment. Even if the studio pissed Ed Norton off, I still hope he can get over that before a sequel for this movie becomes obsolete. Actually a sequel will never become obsolete because I love the Hulk.<br /><br />Now for the BD's transfer. The Incredible Hulk has a just about pristine transfer. The picture was fantastic, albeit minorly flawed. There were not enough issues with the PQ for me to dock the transfer any points. The audio is perfection. Loud, bombastic, and it just abuses the Home Theatre. You want to wake your neighbors? Put on the scene where we see Bruce change into the not-so-jolly green giant for the first time. When he lets out the bellowing roar, my windows rattled. There's nothing else I can say about it. It's pure demo material. The Incredible Hulk stands alone as the only Blu-ray available in both a green Elite case and lenticular slipcover. The packaging is all a geek can dream of. I love it. The extras are very well done. I enjoyed the featurettes, but I really wish the "making of" was longer. Hey, a half hour is better than some half-assed little interview right? Also, I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't take the time to input his opinions in the otherwise engaging and entertaining audio commentary.<br /><br />7.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>THE INCREDIBLE HULK<br /><br />I remember not so long ago when a film by Ang Lee hit the theaters that was called simply "Hulk", and I liked unlike a lot of others apparently. I still to this day can not see why people did not like that film because I thought it was really good. The character driven emotional study of this man/creature was perfect. Lee did a great job with the film in my opinion and while it was not a classic was still very good. But the overwhelming out cry for another so called "better' Hulk film was so much that they made this one. New cast, new crew, and even new Hulk were added to this one to please those who did not care for the first one. What they got was a film that was equally entertaining in my opinion I thought this was just as good as the last one and neither surpassed the other. They are two very different films and takes on the character and for that I view them separately and do not compare the two.<br /><br />This film is all about Banner [Edward Norton] trying to get in touch with some one who may be able to help get rid of his big green curse. It is in his search that the military can close in on him during their search. It is here that General Ross [William Hurt] and his number one soldier Emil Blonsky [Tim Roth] take their first failed shots at the Hulk. It is also here that Emil begins his obsession with battling him again. The story is basically your seek and destroy story from this point on with Ross's daughter trying her hardest to help Bruce as much as possible. So let the battles begin as they say with so many sides going against each other, and poor Hulk is caught in the middle, all Hulk want do is smash.<br /><br />Director Louis Leterrier really brought a whole other style to this film and quickens the pace up a bit as action is found throughout the film. To me both of the films are on the same level as I enjoyed both about the same, so I can't say that Louis did the better job. But if you want more action this one is for you as Zak Penn's script called for more action. Still the story is very fun and all the performances are great as well, Roth in particular. Tim Roth struck me as the perfect villain for this film and I really wish he would get more roles in theatrical films. Edward Norton was great as well as the new Bruce Banner and played the role perfectly. I still feel that the script could have beefed up Banner's character a little more so Norton could properly portray him, I felt the character [not performance] was a little underdeveloped. Still I really feel that Roth was the sow stealer here, he did a great job.<br /><br />Liv Tyler and William Hurt are great as the daughter and father Ross in this film, I remember never being a huge fan of Tyler back in the day but I have come to like her a now. I think it is because she looks just like some one I know [who I dislike], oh well. Also while every one in this film is great I must say seeing Lou Ferrigno in this was classic, as was Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr reprising his Tony Stark character [Avengers here we come, also in an opening scene Cap's shield is visible], and the LEGENDARY Rickson Gracie appearing as Banner's Aikido Instructor. I was super excited to see that as was my brother, loved it.<br /><br />Of course the special effects for the film are top notch as the two monsters that go at it on here look amazing, also the Hulk doesn't look cartoonish and Abomination looks great. As do all of the fights, explosions and such that come with this type of film. But I think the biggest story that came out of this was the comparisons between the two Hulk films. Like I said earlier I like both of them about the same, they are two very different films with very different styles. This three disc addition is packed full of all kinds of special features and is well worth the price of purchase, or at least I think so. I have to say I really enjoyed the commentary by the director and Tim Roth. I recommend watching both Hulk films as I enjoyed both myself. Also there are all kinds of features on this set so enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>In addition...HULK SMASH STUPID ANG LEE VERSION!!! I actually liked many aspects of Ang Lee's HULK! It was different and had a great cast. All Ang had to do was end it after the army battle, but NOOOOOOO! Ang had to go all Brokeback Hulk with 20 extra minutes of daddy issues and a WTF was that ending? The Incredible Hulk is simply put: AWESOME! It is a reboot that kicks Ang Lee and his daddy issues movie's ass. It pays homage to the HULK t.v. show most of us all loved (see opening sequence and listen for some familiar music). The cast is even better than last time. Eric Bana was good, but Bruce Banner was made for Ed Norton! And for the record, Tim Roth is one of hollywood's best actors and plays a fantastic antagonist, again (i.e. Rob Roy and Planet of the Apes). The movie follows Banner on the run still searching for a cure. General Ross is desperately seeking to capture the Hulk and turn him into the weapon he intended. Once he tracks him down the mayhem ensues and Ross' top soldier Blomsky wants the power of the Hulk for himself! It all leads to a knock your socks off battle that is one of Marvel's best!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The Incredible Hulk rages on this transfer. Universal does it again with amazing picture and sound. I thought that the CGI Hulk would look less real on Blu because the clarity would only highlight flaws...I WAS WRONG! The blacks are great and actually the finer detail is picked up and makes the Hulk more lifelike! All the special features are carried over (watch the Alt Opening and see if you can find Captain America)! FINAL VERDICT: Seriously, I will HULK OUT if you don't upgrade. HULK IS STRONGEST ON BLU RAY! UPGRADE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>This was a three to four star film as far as all members of my recent movie party (on my 52" HDTV) were concerned.

In fact, she felt sorry for Ed Norton's character (which means the film worked for her).

For the first time we get a clear perspective of Hulk. Unlike the previous movie this adaptation proves that Hulk can be shown in the big screen as both a threat and a hero.<br /><br />The movie begins with Banner undergoing an experiment that obviously goes wrong; and unlike the previous movie, this one ignores everything that occurred before. This adaptation is much more loyal to the comics and The TV show. The setting is more realistic and we don't have the annoying comic book transitions that were applied to the first Hulk movie.<br /><br />so is this movie worth it? Hell yeah! The effects are better; the design of Hulk is better and meaner. Not to mention the last fight with Abomination, it will leave you breathless. Forget about the other Hulk movie, this is a re-boot like Batman Begins. For all comic book fans and Hulk fans this is the Hulk you were waiting for, don't hesitate.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RAITING: 4 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this reboot of the Hulk franchise better than the last version a few years ago.  Though it is a do over, it is also really a continuation of the story.  Bruce is on the run from a very determined General Ross who wants the Hulk for military purposes.  Leading the charge is a very mean Tim Roth who is destined to become the abomination.  The action scenes are great and between the two super powers, there is lots of destruction.  I liked Norton a lot in his role.  I really would have loved to have seen more of him.  It is my hope that they will one day put out a Norton edited version of the movie(which would be much longer).  Maybe if they make nice with him, he would be willing to come back for another round.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Here is my rhyming homage' to the newest "Incredible Hulk", to the tune of Blondie's "Call Me"<br /><br />Bruce Banner is the subject of a movie once again<br />But this time it is different (watching will not cause you pain)<br />Marvel gets it right this time<br />The Hulkster says his "HULK SMASH!"  line!<br />This Hulk! -Movie's fine,<br />It's great if you're the comics kind.<br />This Hulk!- Movie's fine<br />It's much better than my silly rhyme,<br />This Hulk!<br /><br />So...<br />Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy this movie much, but I did!

I watched the Video On Demand rental over Thanksgiving and watched "Iron Man" right afterwards and was happy to see that I should do exactly that, as they are tied together. There is a kind touch for the old TV show fans by showing Bill Bixby on TV (The courtship of Eddy's Father) and Lou Ferigno plays a guard at the University.

Ferrigno finally got to talk for the Hulk in a movie (not including the cartoon series). I loved it and thought it is very well done and I hope they make a sequel. Sadly, the last time I heard, they weren't going to :(</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I was not as down on the 2003 Ang Lee version of the story of the big green guy (note:  as first drawn by Jack Kirby, he was gray, though he very quickly underwent a color change) as many, but it clearly wasn't as good as it ought to have been.  The biggest fault was the CGI.  Although according to the official Marvel specs the Hulk can leap several miles in a single bound, it was rather silly watching him do so.  For one thing, he would bounce several hundred yards in a single, impossibly quick leap.  As a result the Hulk appears to have no mass or even any reality.  You simply couldn't buy into the fantasy.  The Hulk in this film, on the contrary, possessed only a fraction of the leaping ability of the Ang Lee Hulk -- possessing vastly less mobility than the comic book version as well -- but the gains were enormous, with the new Hulk having mass, solidity, and some reality.  Some of this could be laid on the development of new CGI software since 2003, but more than that was simply the decision to make him denser and slower.  When the 2003 Hulk moved I cringed; when the new one moved I had a great time.<br /><br />By all accounts Edward Norton was deeply involved in the making of the movie, and not merely as the star.  Though he did not receive official writing credit, enough people working on the project have acknowledged that he wrote a complete draft that featured many elements that were incorporated in the final film and that he was rewriting scenes immediately before shooting.  This is not new for Norton.  He has been involved in the writing of the scripts for many of his films, usually with no credit.  It is expected that he will write the draft for any Hulk sequel.<br /><br />Sequels.  Although THE INCREDIBLE HULK did not do as well at the box office this summer as they had hoped, the film did make money.  Part of the disappointment might have resulted from the far superior box office performance of IRON MAN.  One of the executive producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK has insisted that she plans on making a sequel with Norton at the center of things.  And with Marvel Studios clearly moving towards an Avengers movie, the Hulk would clearly play a role.  The Hulk, however, is one Avenger who can either be friend or foe, either a member of the team or the Big Bad of the movie.  There have been no official announcements as of yet, but the final scene in the film, showing Tony Stark approaching a very drunk General Ross in a bar and telling him, "We are putting together a team," shows that the team is being put together.  General Ross had a portrait of Steve Rodgers (i.e., Captain America) on his office wall and a cut scene from THE INCREDIBLE HULK showed a glimpse of Captain America in frozen ice.  Upcoming films focusing on Thor and (believe it or not) Ant-Man show that Marvel does indeed intend to put the whole team together as soon as feasible.  I think it is going to take a bit longer than they had hoped.  Films that were earlier announced for 2010 and 2011 are still in pre-production.  I think 2012 and 2013 is more likely.  They have also been set back by casting problems.  Daniel Craig turned down an offer to star as Thor.  At least the news shows their intent to continue to cast major actors in the key roles.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLE HULK begins in medias res, giving a bit of a recap of a prequel that never quite existed (the events recounted are not quite the same as the Ang Lee film) in the opening credits to jump to Bruce Banner in Rio de Janeiro, where he is living while working on a cure to his condition.  I think this was a brilliant decision.  As a result they could just go ahead and skip the "making of the Hulk" story that is a crucial part of almost all superhero movies.  One of my beefs with most of movies of the genre is that we don't really get anything new for fans of the comics.  IRON MAN was redeemed by a fantastic lead performance by Robert Downey Jr.  I'm not saying that Edward Norton wasn't good in this film, but a lot of the joy of the film is that we got to move the whole story forward.  I liked the decision to focus on the Abomination, though they altered him a bit from his classic presentation, making him larger than the Hulk, whereas in the official Marvel spec sheet he is slightly smaller.  Tim Roth is great in the film as Klonsky/The Abomination.  And just as in the comics the Hulk does not kill him, but is locked away by the military, so in this film he resists, at Betty's pleading, the temptation to kill him.<br /><br />This later detail actually points to how much the film goes out of the way to acknowledge both the larger world of Marvel Comics and its prior versions of the Hulk.  In the earlier category are things like references to Nick Fury in the opening credits and the portrait of Steve Rodgers, but also the slightly bulging head of Dr. Sterns near the end of the film (foreshadowing his possible appearance in a sequel as The Leader).  In the latter we get things like Bruce Banner watching THE COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER in Portugese in Brazil, which starred, of course, Bill Bixby, who played David Banner in the TV version of The Hulk.  Lou Ferrigno, who played Banner when he turned green, played a security guard (and I have to say, was looking pretty good) and voiced the Hulk.  And Toronto actor Paul Soles, who plays the pizza joint owner Sandy, voiced Bruce Banner in the sixties cartoon version of the comic (he also did Peter Parker in the cartoon version of Spider-Man).<br /><br />I think the superiority of this new film could mainly be seen in the great fight scene from the end of the picture in which the Hulk and the Abomination face off.  Most such fight scenes in movies are either disappointing or anti-climatic, sometimes merely a necessary add on.  But this one was exciting, involving, and helped move along the story of Bruce Banner's transformation as something more than just an enraged monster.<br /><br />This is not as good as IRON MAN, but it was the second of two very good films that represent the initial products of Marvel's new film production company.  If forthcoming productions are as good as these two, then we have a lot of great popular entertainment to look forward to.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's 2003 take on the Hulk was an ambitious, but ultimately flawed, adaptation of the classic Marvel character that managed to somewhat capture the tragedy of the character, but proved supremely underwhelming in delivering the action goods.  With this reboot directed by Louis Letterrier (Transporter 2, Unleashed), the Hulk gets a fresh start, and it's all the better for it.  The Incredible Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, who has managed to evade capture by living in Brazil for the past few years, and keeping his monstrous alter-ego at bay as well.  A search for a possible cure brings Bruce out of hiding, as his nemesis General Ross (William Hurt) employs spook agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to bring Banner in, by any means necessary, even if it means turning Blonsky into some sort of Abomination (I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself).  With loads of odes to the comic and even more to the classic 70's series, The Incredible Hulk delivers in terms of action and excitement, and even manages to pull out some surprises as well.  The only real flaws of The Incredible Hulk are some plot-holes in the story and the mis-casting of a stale Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, but that aside, this film still makes up for the Ang Lee mis-fire.  Also starring Tim Blake Nelson and Ty Burrell as some important supporting players in Hulk lore, and featuring an ending that will send fanboys in an uproar, The Incredible Hulk truly is a smashing and entertaining good time.  All in all, it's nice to finally have the Hulk movie that we wanted and deserved, and longtime fans of comic should definitely enjoy it.</p></br></body></html>
